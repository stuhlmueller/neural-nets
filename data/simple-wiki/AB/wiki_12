She later appeared in the 2016 video game, \"Overwatch\". These games are made by Blizzard Entertainment, a company that makes and publishes video games.\n\nIn \"Overwatch\", the character is known as Tracer, but her real name is Lena Oxton. Her personality is noticeably happy and energetic. She is known as one of the faster characters in the game, but also one with low health. In the game, she is able to teleport and time travel. \n\nIn the real world, she is one of the more well known characters from \"Overwatch\". This is because she is seen on the cover of the video game and Blizzard has made animated videos featuring her.\n\nTracer was first seen in 2014 at Blizzard Entertainment's \"BlizzCon 2014\" event. The main designer on \"Overwatch\", Scott Mercer, said that Blizzard's canceled project, \"Titan\", had a character with Tracer's abilities. Jeff Kaplan was the main hero designer for \"Overwatch\"; he had a big part in Tracer's design. While the game was still being designed and tested, or its \"beta\" period, Tracer's health was lowered. \n\nHer personality was designed as heroic and happy. \"Overwatch\" game designer Michael Chu said, \"the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] [to] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism.\" She is British and the British actress Cara Theobold voices her in the game.\n\nWhile the game was still being designed, victory poses were added to the characters. Tracer's \"Over the Shoulder\" victory pose caused a controversy, because some players thought that the pose's focus on her physical features did not line up with her personality traits. Some players disagreed with this, finding nothing wrong with the pose, but Jeff Kaplan, the director of \"Overwatch\" apologized for the pose. Blizzard then changed the pose, and while some players were happy with the change, as well as with Blizzard listening to the game's community, other players thought that the game's makers were giving up their creative control to offended players.\n", "id": "567468", "title": "Tracer"}

Slánský was one of the main organizers of the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état. During World War II he was a member of Czechoslovak exile resistance in the foreign centre in Moscow. Slánský was executed on December 3, 1952 at Prague’s Pankrac Prison.\n\nSlánský was born on July 31, 1901 in Nezvěstice near Pilsen, Bohemia. His father was a Jewish merchant. He studied at a public academy in Plzeň. Slánský joined the Czechoslovakian Communist Party in 1921, three years after it was formed. In 1924 he was the editor of the Communist Party newspaper, \"Rude Pravo\". He rose in the ranks of the Party becoming a member of the Central Committee. He was in hiding from 1929 to 1935 because the Party was illegal in Czechoslovakia at the time. He became a member of the National Assembly and a close associate of Klement Gottwald.\n\nWhen the Munich Agreement was signed in 1938, Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland was taken over by Nazi Germany. When the German army marched into the Sudetenland on October 1, 1938, Slánský fled. He went to the Soviet Union and stayed there during most of World War II. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1944 and took part in the Slovak National Uprising.\n\nAfter the war, he was involved in politics. The Communist Party in Czechoslovakia agreed to accept many of Joseph Stalin's trained Czechs. Slánský was made the Secretary-General of the Party in Czechoslovakia. By 1948, it was clear that Gottwald was following the Stalinist style of politics. \n\nSlánský himself had been in charge of purges of several of his associates. When Gottwald thought he might be next, he had Slánský and 13 others arrested. The charges against Slánský included treason, spying and sabotage. Slánský finally confessed after being tortured. Then he had to memorize a speech for the show trial. All of the 14 had confessed. Slánský was one of the 11 who was given a death sentence.

Peroutka was also wrote about politics in \"Lidové noviny,\" where he wrote against Nazis and communists, whose idelogies he saw as dangerous. For this he was frequently attacked by members of those parties. He also openly criticiced Adolf Hitler, for his lies and false promises. \n\nAfter German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Peroutka was forced to write propaganda for the Nazis. He didn't listen and in April 1939 issue of \"Přítomnost\" he wrote an article \"Dynamický život\" (Dynamic life) about the 50th birthday of Adolf Hitler. In this article he acknowledged Hitler's power, but refused that Czechs should listen to him. For this he was sent to concentration camp, but was released after few days.

Their proof were articles \"Dynamický život\" and \"Hitler po lidské strance\" (Hitler with a human face), that he didn't actually write. Peroutka refused those claims. Many years later in 2015, Czech president Miloš Zeman claimed that Peroutka was fascinated by Nazism and wrote an article called \"Hitler je gentleman\" (Hitler is gentleman).

There are 2 SAR's in China, Hong Kong and Macau. Unlike other regions in mainland China, SAR's have a constitution that is different from that of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Basic Law. Basic Law allows Hong Kong and Macau to have freedoms that are not in the rest of China, like freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, and freedom to petition. Basic Law also allows the SAR's to decide the economic rules of their region, which is why the economies are a lot less controlled in Hong Kong and Macau than in mainland China, as well as giving them the freedom to choose who to let into their own regions without needing a visa. As a result, Hong Kong and Macau have their own currencies, passports, official languages, etc. This is commonly known as the \"one country, two systems\" policy.\n\nChinese is an official language in both SAR's, but unlike mainland China where Mandarin is the main spoken language and simplified Chinese is the main written language, Cantonese is the most spoken language and traditional Chinese is the main written language in these areas. Interestingly enough, the vagueness of simply stating Chinese as the official language allows this to happen. Also, English and Portuguese, the main languages of the nations that controlled Hong Kong and Macau in the past in respective order, are also official languages in the respective SAR's.\n\nAfter the British Empire defeated China in the Opium Wars, China was forced to give up Hong Kong to the British after signing unequal treaties that favored British interests. They had to give up control of Hong Kong Island in 1842, Kowloon Peninsula in 1860, and were made to lease New Territories for a period of 99 years in 1898. In the 1980s, when its lease of New Territories was nearly over, the United Kingdom sought to renew its lease of New Territories. However, China refused to renew the lease. Since New Territories had half of Hong Kong's people and most of its water supply, having Kowloon and Hong Kong Island without New Territories would have ruined Hong Kong's economy. Reluctantly, Britain decided in 1984 to begin talks on giving Hong Kong back in 1984. In 1988, China agreed to uphold Basic Law, which would make Hong Kong into an SAR when it gets returned to China, and in 1997, Hong Kong was returned to the PRC.\n\nIN 1557, the Portuguese Empire made a permanent settlement on Macau, after being given permission from China to dock and trade there. However, it took over Taipa in 1951 and Coloane in 1864, and in 1887, China was forced to sign a treaty to make Macau a permanent colony of Portugal. However, after a military coup overthrew the Portuguese government in 1974, the new government made a promise to give back all the lands it took overseas. In 1986, Portugal and China began talks on how to bring control of Macau back to China peacefully, and in 1999, Macau became an SAR in the PRC.\n\nAs SAR's, China agrees that \"commercial, social and legal life of Hong Kong/Macau will remain as it is\" until after their first 50 years of being part of the PRC. For Hong Kong, its uninterrupted status will last until 2047, and for Macau, it will last until 2049.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569178", "text": "Avrum Burstein\n\nAvraham Leib \"Avrum\" Burstein, Hebrew: אברהם לייב בורשטיין , (born November 1971) is an Israeli musician, actor and imparter of the legacy of authentic Klezmer, and a founder of Jerusalem Klezmer association. \n\nBurstein was born in Katamon, a neighborhood of Jerusalem.\n\nHe is married, a father of three boys and two girls, and a grandfather to a granddaughter.\n\nHis father, Chaim son of Rabbi Moshe Burstein the late, born in Pultusk, Poland, who immigrated to Israel in 1934, raised a family, which numbered during his lifetime nearly a thousand descendants in Israel and abroad, and was a co-founder of the Bratslav Hasidim synagogues in Jerusalem.\n\nis mother, Bracha from the house of Mandel, was born in the village Patterson, NY- a neighborhood of Jewish immigrants who arrived from Germany on the eye of World War 2.\n\nThe families of Burstein and Mandel include creators and artists, among them the actors Pesach (Paul) Burstein and his son , and film director Barry Mendel.\n\nAt the age of 19, he married Miriam Rubinstein, the granddaughter of one of the influential Bratslav Hasidim, Rabbi Elazar Mordechai Rubinstein the late. Before the death of Rabbi Rubinstein, his Rabbi, Rabbi Eliezer Berland, ordered to document and record the grandfather who composed dozens of traditional tunes with emotion and revival in the Yiddish language, as well as melodies and prayer formulas he received from the Bratslav elders, and preserved them over the years. Burstein, on the advice of his Rabbi, fearing though the melodies become extinct, duplicated the recordings and distributed them to all of the Hasidim, melodies who became over the years the pantheon of the Bratslav Hasidim.\n\nIn 1990, young Burstein began to train youth who showed a musical talent of expressing Klezmer melodies, in order to continue the tradition of the original Klezmer music, as he received in a frontal way of means, from famous clarinet artists Dov Taras, and Gershon Kletzkin. The clarinet musicians and Nathan Coral, aged 16, who became hit musicians in the orthodox and national-religious sector during the 90's, started their training under Burstein's directing and with him, and together they producer albums with Klezmer and soul music, in order to preserve the melodies, their character and their heritage.\n\nIn 1992, he founded the youth groups \"Karroubi HaNahal\" in Jerusalem, for children and teenagers of the Bratslav Hasidim who came from other sectors, some of them boys to penitents' parents. In this framework, Burstein also made a point to bequeath to future generations the Jewish melody, by means of singing and music, among other activities on duty, some of them during outings with the youth to the countryside.\n\nIn 1993, for the first time in the history of the Bratslav Hasidim, Burstein records the songs and melodies of the Days of Awe of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, who passed through a tradition from the students of Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov, and been kept by the Bratslav Hasidim for about 200 years. For the recordings, Burstein provided Rabbi Shraga Levy, who serves since 1992 as a prayer leader (cantor) in the prayers of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of the Bartslav Hasidim, in the kibbutz in Jerusalem and in Uman.\n\nThese recordings have become bestsellers and with a broad impact on the Bratslav Hasidim communities in Israel and abroad. They provide a way in which Hasidic people and the newly approaching to the religion could become familiar with the wording of the founder of the Bratslav Hasidim, Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov and , and their students in Poland and Ukraine in the 18 century.\n\nIn 1995, Burstein recorded and produced the first albums recorded on tape reels. The first album was called \"Labadik\" (cheerfulness, in Yiddish). The first tape passes a fresh and pulsating breeze of the traditional Klezmer, which did not receive representation in the Academy by means of musical notes or formal courses, but learned and purchased within a tradition passed down from father to son, and from Klezmer musicians to their students for centuries.\n\nIn 1997, he recorded the first album of the clarinetist Yechiel (Hilik) Frank, \"Inside the Walls\". That year, Frank married Burstein's sister, Sarah.\n\nOver those years, Burstein brought together talented youth, and among their musical activities, they used to have a weekly, Saturday night \"Melaveh Malkah\" diner, with traditional songs and dances. This custom existed for 15 years in a row, since 1990 to 2006. From these frameworks emerged the future Klezmer artists, like the virtuoso player Nachman Zucker, the clarinet players David Golan and Abraham Balti, the violinist Shim'on (Shimi) Vaitzhlndr, the guitarist Nachman Driiar- also a second-generation of the Bratslav Hasidim.\n\nThe group that rallied around Burstein spent many hours training and publishing albums in the spirit of Klezmer and the Jewish melody, among them: \"Midnight Amendment\", \"Dance\", \"the Jewish Melody\", \"Soul Melodies\", \"Braslav Hanukkah and Purim Songs\", \"Joyful Song of Rosh Hashanah\", \"Grace of the Lord\" and more.\n\nIn 1993, Klezmer artists led by Burstein went to the Klezmer Festival in Zefat, among them clarinetist Gershon Kletzkin and Rabbi Shmuel Stern, who later wrote books about the relationship between the Jewish tune and the worship of God according to the Hasidic thought and the Kabbalah. At that time, the Jerusalem Klezmer musicians began to expand their performances and leave to appear on stages abroad. Those performances stood out in their unique style, in which young Hasidic men played and danced decorated in wigs, caps and tassels, to Jewish and non-Jewish locals alike. Among the outstanding performances in those years, were performances in Krakow, Poland and in Barcelona, Spain, where the local audiences was first introduced to the authentic tune of the Members of the Old settlement in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2001, Burstein won the musical competition held in the television program \"Made in Israel\" on the state broadcaster, where they climbed to the top and received a first place award.\n\nThe \"main Joy\" of the tens of thousands in the town of Uman, near the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, is a tradition that was organized half a century ago, since the fall of the Soviet Union. Burstein founded this tradition, with an emphasis on klezmer and traditionally Hasidic melody, while making sure that no modern melody will ever be played atop that stage.\n\nAt Lag B'Omer, the Jewish largest day of celebration of the author of the book \"Zohar\", Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, at mount \"Meron\", which thousands of people celebrate each year, the main stage is led throughout the day by Burstein's students and the graduates' of \"the Klezmer Association\".\n\nIn 1999, Burstein founded the center for Jewish music \"Judaism and singing\", in the bohemian street \"Sheinkin\" in Tel Aviv. Spontaneous concerts of Jewish music took place there, and every Thursday, a \"Kabbalat Shabbat\" took place, led by the singer and songwriter Yitzhak Fox.\n\nIn 2005, Burstein founded the \"Jerusalem Klezmer Association\".\n\nIn 2007, Burstein founded the \"Klezmer on Foot\" parade, a parade of Klezmer musicians and dancers, which takes place during Passover and sukkot, starting at Yemin Moshe neighborhood, via Hutsot HaYotser and around the walls of Old Jerusalem to the tomb of King David on Mount Zion- a symbolic finish to the one considered the generator of Jewish poetry. The parade includes the maestro Giora Feidman, Hilik Frank and the rest of the graduates and students of Burstein, joined by musicians and dancers from other frameworks. Townspeople, tourists and lovers of Klezmer from all circles and communities join this parade.\n\nIn 2008, Burstein expends the annual performances and establishes the first Klezmer Festival in Jerusalem, attended be esteemed musicians in the genre, such as Moshe (Musa) Berlin, Hilik Frank, Urit Orbach from the band \"Women of Eve\", Mirel Reznik. The festival puts emphasis on the fact that the rest of the festivals called \"Klezmer\" abandoned the authentic Klezmer in favor of art from other styles. Burstein also makes sure to bring to the light the fact that Jerusalem is the capital of klezmer, in the historical aspect and through the fact that more than 50 klezmer artists live and are active in the city and its suburbs.\n\nThe same year he publishes the booklet \"Klezmer Soul\" that contains the musical notes and explanations of dozens of Klezmer melodies and stories of the Jewish town, accompanied by photos of the klezmer past and present. The booklet is distributed in six languages: Hebrew, Yiddish, English, German, French and Russian.\n\nSince 2010, Burstein puts on a weekly occurrence, the \"Klezmer Tish\": a \"Melaveh Malkah\" show, that takes place in Jerusalem's \"Hkrtz'ma of Burstein\" (the basement of the former library, \"Yung Yiddish\"), founded by Mendy Cahan, who occasionally comes to perform there.\n\nSince 2009, each year during the Days of Awe between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Burstein and his graduates, the klezmer musicians, travel to cities in Europe, and in this framework they play music, present and bring to the stage the culture of the Jewish shtetl (Jewish town), the Jewish prayers and Klezmer. Performances in the overseas communities receive a broad documentation in the local media and is very popular, even among local nations.\n\nBurstein, also known at his performing and acting skills, among them plays in practice to the stories of \"Shalom Aleichem\", was chosen by the producers of the educational series \"KiKa\" In Germany to a leading role, along with some of his students. The series, \"Search of God\", part of which was filmed in Jerusalem, documents searching for God in three the world's major religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism).\n\nIn 2011, Burstein and some of his graduates were chosen to play in key roles in the first place winning series \"Shtisl\" from \"Hot\". In other episodes, they are used as escorting musicians.\n\nIn the same year, \"the Klezmer Association\" won the second place prize in the nationwide Klezmer contest in Israel on behalf of the Tel Aviv municipality.\n\nIn 2013, Burstein and his students are chosen as \"the commendable of the cultural basket\", following the show \"The Story of Klezmer\" that was written by Ofer Schneider, who is a music teacher from the Ministry of Education and advocates for the enrichment of musical knowledge of the artists association.\n\nIn 2014, Burstein founded the \"Klezmer Annual Conference\", in the collage \"Emuna\" in Jerusalem, attended by clarinet musicians Giora Feidman, Musa Berlin, Hilik Frank, Hanan Bar Sela, Urit Orbach and more. In 2015, the second conference took place in a larger format in the Hall of Solomon in Jerusalem.\n\nAt Hanukkah 2014, Burstein gets the responsibility for the musical and visual accompaniment at the International Bible Contest for Adults on behalf of the Ministry of Education, with the participation of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Deputy Minister of Education Avi Wortzman. After the Chanukah candle lighting, Burstein preformed the song \"If I Were a Rich Man\" from the play \"Tevye\" written by the Jewish writer Shalom Aleichem - a play that relates the biblical Jewish heritage and Jewish life in exile.\n\nOn this occasion, Burstein and his students gave the decoration of \"the Darling of the Jerusalem Klezmer\" to the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara. The Prime Minister promised to promote the status of Jerusalem as the capital of the klezmer world.\n\n", "id": "569178", "title": "Avrum Burstein"}

Their headquarters are in Springfield, Massachusetts. The company was founded in 1852. Smith & Wesson's pistols and revolvers have become standard issue to police and military forces. Smith & Wesson firearms are very popular among sport shooters.\n\nSmith & Wesson is also known for the many types of ammunition it has introduced over the years. Many cartridge calibers bear the S&W name. For example, the .500 S&W Magnum.\n\nHorace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith & Wesson Company in 1852. The purpose was to develop a lever action pistol. But by 1854 the company was failing. They sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith & Wesson. Their timing was right. Not long after they built their new factory in Springfield, the American Civil War started. \n\nOne of the most popular pistols during the war was the Smith & Wesson Model 2. Many Civil War soldiers purchased the No 2 revolver privately. Between 1861 and 1874, over 77,000 were produced. Smith & Wesson became so profitable that the two partners were the wealthiest men in Springfield by 1865.\n\nOne of the most popular calibers during the Civil War was the .44 caliber. The partners realized they needed to produce a pistol in this caliber. By 1870 S&W introduced the .44 metallic cartridge which was a major improvement over the .44 percussion cap models used in the war. To use this new cartridge, the company introduced a larger pistol known as the Smith & Wesson Model 3. It featured rapid loading and reloading. The gun was a personal favorite of Wyatt Earp. In 1875, at age 65, Smith sold his share of the company to Wesson. He still advised his former partner in business matters.\n\nIn 1880 S&W introduced the first double-action revolver. It was designed to use the .32 S&W caliber cartridge. By this time Wesson's three sons, Walter H., Frank L., and Joseph H., were active in the company. In 1887, Frank L. Wesson died but his brothers continued as partners in the company. \n\nIn 1887 a new concealed hammer design for police was made. Variations of this design are still being made. In 1899, S&W brought out its most famous design, the Military & Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&W Special. It is still one of the most popular revolver cartridges ever produced. Large numbers of S&W .38 special handguns were sold to police and military worldwide. They were used in both World War I and World War II. They remained popular until they were finally replaced by many police and military organizations by Semi-automatic pistols.\n\nIn 1904, Daniel B. Wesson died. But without his guidance the two sons could not agree on the future direction of the company. This period of weak leadership continued for some time. In 1908 the company introduced a new line of .44 caliber pistols called the .44 New Century, but was soon renamed the Smith & Wesson Triple Lock. It used a new cartridge developed by S&W, the .44 Special.\n\nSmith & Wesson received large government contracts for military revolvers from the American government. The company expanded to produce the firearms. But management problems, labor disputes and a new workforce all caused problems for production. As a result, the US government stepped in to manage S&W until the end of the war.\n\nAfter the war a surplus of military arms and imports of low cost guns caused sales to drop. Under Harold Wesson, the company manufactured other items to try to keep up profits. They made sewing machines, handcuffs, washing machines and toilet parts. But none of these items made the company profitable.\n\nAbout this time, bullet-proof vests came into use. Gangsters quickly adopted them so that bullets traveling at under 1,000 fps would not penetrate them. S&W immediately began experimenting with improved bullets. They also used the famous firearms expert Bill Jordan as a consultant to help develop a new much more powerful handgun. What resulted was the first magnum cartridge, the S&W .357 Magnum. In 1935 they released the Smith & Wesson Model 19. Using a 125 grain bullet traveling at 1600 fps, it could easily defeat the body armor of the time.\n\nBy the start of the war S&W was nearly bankrupt. The company was now run by Carl R. Hellstrom. Under his management the company concentrated its efforts on handguns and the company began to expand. In 1965 the Wesson family sold the company to the Bangor Punta corporation. The company began producing firearms accessories as well as firearms. In 1884, S&W was sold to Lear Siegler who, in 1986, was acquired by Forstmann Little & Company. Forstmann & Little was mainly interested in Siegler's aerospace and automotive lines. So they sold Smith & Wesson to Tomkins plc, a British holding company. Under Tomkins, S&W developed a number of semiautomatic pistols. This included several using the new .40 S&W cartridge. During this time handgun sales declined. Because of anti-gun lawsuits, operating costs began to rise.\n\nOn March 17, 2000, Smith & Wesson made an agreement with US President Bill Clinton. It agreed to make changes in the design and distribution of its firearms. This was in return for \"preferred buying program\" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott. All authorized S&W dealers and distributors had to follow a “code of conduct” to eliminate the sale of firearms to prohibited persons. Dealers had to agree to not allow children under 18 access to gun shops or sections of stores that contained firearms.\n\nAfter an organized campaign by the NRA and NSSF, thousands of retailers and tens of thousands of firearms consumers boycotted Smith & Wesson.\n\nOn 11 May 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson from Tomkins plc for $15 million USD. This was a fraction of the $112 million originally paid by Tomkins. The Smith & Wesson purchase was chiefly brokered by Saf-T-Hammer President Bob Scott. He had left Smith & Wesson in 1999 because of a disagreement with Tomkins’ policies. After the purchase, Scott became the president of Smith & Wesson. He guided the 157-year-old company back to its former standing in the market.\n\nOn 15 February 2002, the name was changed to Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation.\n\nIn December 2014, Smith & Wesson Holding announced it was paying $130.5 million for Battenfeld Technologies. This is a Columbia, Missouri-based designer and distributor of hunting and shooting accessories. This was part of a plan to merge all its existing Smith & Wesson, M&P and Thompson Center Arms accessories into a single division.\n\nIn August 2016 the company bought Crimson Trace, a laser-sight manufacturer, for $95 million. They bought Taylor Brands, a tool and knife maker, for $85 million. In November 2016 the company bought UST Brands, a survival equipment maker, for $32.3 million. On November 7, 2016, Smith & Wesson announced that it would be changing the name of its holding company to American Outdoor Brands Corporation.\n", "id": "569572", "title": "Smith &amp; Wesson"}

He received his public education at The Latymer School graduating in 1946 and later enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts where he excelled in studying both acting and music. He graduated in 1950. His first professional beginnings in the entertainment industry began singing in the background chorus of the famed Palace Theatre in London. One fateful night in 1952, he happened to be discovered by famed motion picture director David Lean and his then wife, actress Ann Todd, who were so impressed by young Aidan's vocal abilities and charming looks, that they plucked him from obscurity and arranged for him a motion picture contract through London Film Productions where he would make his debut, under Lean's direction and with Todd as his first leading lady, in 'The Sound Barrier' (1952). Young Aidan's first screen appearance was so successful that within the very first year of his contract he appeared in 10 more films, one of which included the lavish costume epic 'Ivanhoe' whose cast included such acclaimed talents as \"Robert Taylor\", \"Elizabeth Taylor\", and \"Joan Fontaine\".\n\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Aidan was ranked as being one of the United Kingdom's 'Stars of Tomorrow' and continued to make a name for himself in films appearing in such features as 'Doctor In The House' (1954), 'Dark Avenger' (1955), 'Village of the Damned' (1960), 'Day The Earth Caught Fire' (1961), 'Countess from Hong Kong' (1967), 'Best House in London' (1969), 'Eagle Has Landed' (1977), 'Top Secret' (1984), 'Batman' (1989), and, in his final on screen appearance,  'The Blackheath Poisonings' (1992). He also became a household name on the small screen appearing in such syndicated British sitcoms as The Invisible Man', 'The Edgar Wallace Mysteries', 'Scotland Yard', 'Ghost Squad', 'The Prisoner', 'The Sweeney, and QB VII.\n\nHe was also highly regarded for his stance as a method actor on not only the British but American stage scene appearing in everything from light-hearted comedies to extreme dramatic roles. Some of which included: \"Romeo and Juliet, Dinner at Eight, The Importance of Being Earnest, The Mousetrap, And Then There Were None, Les Miserables, Julius Ceasar, The Crucible, All My Sons, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Little Foxes, Waiting for Godot, A Christmas Carol, Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Browning Version, Brewster's Millions, Angel Street, and Love Letters.\" In his later years, he even provided private acting lessons to aspiring performers.\n\nHe retired in 2012, and spent his last years spending time with his family, took up painting in oils, and divided time between his three homes which consisted of an estate in Surrey, England, a custom built Tudor house in County Dublin, Ireland (which he spent most of his time for over 40 years), and a summer house in Pebble Beach, California. He was married for 56 years to his wife, Rosemary, who predeceased him in 2010. Together they produced 3 children. He died surrounded by his family in the comfort of his Ireland home from natural causes on February 4, 2017, and was interred at Deansgrange Cemetery, Blackrock, County Dublin, Ireland, following a private family-only funeral service.\n\nBreaking the Sound Barrier\n1952\n\nCrimson Pirate\n1952\n\nHour of 13\n1952\n\nIvanhoe\n1952\n\nI Believe in You\n1952\n\nStory of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men\n1952\n\nTop Secret\n1952\n\nWhere's Charley?\n1952\n\nCard\n1952\n\nHindle Wakes\n1952\n\nPotter of the Yard\n1952\n\nIt Started in Paradise\n1953\n\nFolly to Be Wise\n1953\n\nDoctor in the House\n1954\n\nBelles of St. Trinians\n1954\n\nPickwick Papers\n1954\n\nColditz Story\n1955\n\nI Am a Camera\n1955\n\nLyons in Paris\n1955\n\nDark Avenger\n1955\n\nExtra Day\n1956\n\nPort Afrique\n1956\n\nMorning Call\n1957\n\nTwo-Headed Spy\n1958\n\nBreakout\n1959\n\nBehemoth the Sea Monster\n1959\n\nTrials of Oscar Wilde\n1960\n\nVillage of the Damned\n1960\n\nWings of Death\n1961\n\nHellfire Club\n1961\n\nDay the Earth Caught Fire\n1961\n\nGuns of Darkness\nGuard \n1962\n\nJolly Bad Fellow\n1963\n\n633 Squadron\n1964\n\nLiquidator\n1965\n\nOperation Crossbow\n1965\n\nThunderball\n1965\n\nBerserk\nExtra (uncredited)\n1967\n\nDirty Dozen\n1967\n\nCountess From Hong Kong\nExtra\n1967\n\nAssassination Bureau Limited\n1968\n\nBest House in London\nWaiting Room Man\n1969\n\nSome Girls Do\n1969\n\nMosquito Squadron\n1969\n\nOne More Time\n1970\n\nEagle Has Landed\n1977\n\nTop Secret!\n1984\n\nMorons From Outer Space\n1985\n\nBatman\n1989\n\nBlackheath Poisonings\n1992\n\nTV Apperances\n\nThe Invisible Man (1959)\n\nDanger Man (1961)\n\nThe Edgar Wallace Mysteries (1961)\n\nScotland Yard (1961)\n\nGhost Squad (1963)\n\nThe Prisoner (1967)\n\nThe Sweeney (1964, 1965)\n\nQB VII (1974)\n", "id": "571906", "title": "Aidan Harrington"}

Because of the Guiana Shield is just north of the equator, its climate varies primarily according to elevation and the effects of the trade winds. The trade winds blow from the east and northeast, off of the Atlantic Ocean onto northeastern South America.\n\nThe heaviest rains usually occur between May and August, whereas the rainy season from December to January is shorter and less intense, with rains mostly along the coast. In areas where there is only one rainy season, the driest part of the year is January to March; in areas where there are two rainy seasons the driest months are March and October.

Because of this many plants are carnivorous and feed on insects and small animals.\n\nSo far over 2,000 species of plants been found, and more than 50% are endemic to this region, meaning they are found only here, and many are only found on one peak.\n\nSome minerals are found in large amounts in the Guiana Shield; diamonds, gold and bauxite are some of them.

The festival's main attraction is a large parade in Kyoto, in which over 500 people dressed in the aristocratic style of the Heian Period (794-1185) walk from the Imperial Palace to the Kamo Shrines. Aoi is Japanese for Hollyhock, and the festival is named after the Hollyhock leaves that are worn by the members of the procession.\n\nPredating Kyoto's establishment as the national capital in 794, the Aoi Matsuri began in the 7th century, although its precise origins are uncertain. There were most likely natural disasters occurring that were believed to be caused by the deities of the Kamo Shrines. After the Emperor made offerings to the gods, the disasters subsided and a tradition was begun. The festival's official name remains Kamo Matsuri, because of its association with the shrines.\n\nThe festival grew in prominence so that during the Heian Period the word festival became synonymous with the Aoi Matsuri. Nowadays, the massive procession illustrates the high regard in which the festival would have been held. There are men on horseback, giant bouquets of flowers, ornately decorated ox drawn carts, and a large retinue of women in kimono accompanying the year's Saio.\n\nTraditionally, the Saio was a young female member of the imperial family who served as the high priestess of the Kamo Shrines. During festivals, the Saio performed rituals at the shrines. In the modern era, a different unmarried woman from Kyoto is selected each year to serve as Saio. She must go through purification ceremonies before the festival, and is taken through the procession on a palanquin.\n", "id": "572318", "title": "Aoi festival"}

They are also called 'supernumerary' or 'accessory chromosomes'.\n\nIn addition to normal chromosomes (the karyotype), many species have B chromosomes. Wild populations of many animal, plant, and fungi species have B chromosomes. These chromosomes are not essential for their life, and are lacking in many individuals. So a population might have individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc) supernumeraries.\n\nMost B chromosomes are mainly or entirely heterochromatic, and so do not code for anything. Some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable euchromatic segments, and therefore do code for some products. \n\nIt seems unlikely that supernumeraries would survive in a species unless there was some positive advantage. In a few cases this has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper \"Myrmeleotettix maculatus\" has B chromosomes with a satellite DNA. They occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler places.\n\nIt is thought that B chromosomes are parasitic elements like selfish DNA. Various scenarios have been suggested as to how they arose.\n", "id": "573045", "title": "B chromosome"}

The movie was adapted from Walter Lord's book of the same name.\n\nThe RMS \"Titanic\" is christened for its maiden voyage. Passengers and crew get on board the ship. The ship departs from port on April 10, 1912 and heads out into sea.\n\nThe ship receives a number of ice warnings from other ships. However, only a few of the messages are sent to Captain Edward J. Smith. The captain does not slow down the ship, or consider an alternate route.\n\nLate on Sunday, April 14, one of the lookouts sees an iceberg in front of the ship. \"Titanic\" turns hard to port and tries to avoid the iceberg. But the ship eventually hits the iceberg on its starboard side. The first five compartments, below the waterline, are ripped open. Thomas Andrews, the ship's maker, inspects the damage. He then learns the ship will sink within two hours. Making matters worse, the ship does not have enough lifeboats for all the people aboard.\n\nA distress signal is sent out. The radio operator on the RMS \"Carpathia\" hears the distress call, understands the emergency and alerts Captain Arthur Rostron. Rostron, right away, orders the \"Carpathia\" to head to the \"Titanic\" at full speed. But unfortunately, it will take four hours to reach the \"Titanic\".\n\nCaptain Smith orders Officers William Murdoch and Charles Lightoller to begin lowering the lifeboats. Women and children are let on the boats first. However, the women and children are not that happy about getting into the lifeboats. They are then forced into the boats by officers.\n\nThe \"Carpathia\" is racing to the \"Titanic\" site. Before \"Carpathia\" can get there, though, \"Titanic\" sinks.\n\nOn the \"Carpathia\", Lightoller is told by Rostron that only 705 people have survived. They have only passed one body. \n\n\nAs with many \"Titanic\" movies made prior to 1985, this movie shows \"Titanic\" sinking in one piece. In reality, the ship broke in two before sinking.\n\nThe movie won several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film.\n", "id": "573384", "title": "A Night to Remember (movie)"}

Creos also owns units of property in the following companies: Luxmetering from 2012, Learning Factory from 2014, Balansys and Ampacimon from 2015 .\n\nIn order to make a difference between the parent company and its subsidiaries – energy provider Enovos and grid operator Creos –, Enovos International is now called Encevo.\n\nCreos Luxembourg S.A. plans, constructs and maintains the electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution networks in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its subsidiary Creos Deutschland Holding GmbH, which is the owner of the companies Creos Deutschland GmbH and Creos Deutschland Services GmbH, organises the transmission of high-pressure natural gas in Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate.\n\nIn Luxembourg, following the liberalisation of the energy markets, an independent organisation – the Luxembourg Institute of Regulation (ILR) – organises and supervises access to the networks. The tariffs are subject to its approval. The energy suppliers are thus guaranteed transparent access to Creos's networks.\n\nThe majority of the electric current in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg comes from Germany via two double high-voltage 220,000 volt (220 kV) lines that are connected to the German network. Interconnection with Belgium will be soon created, and around 15% of the energy is produced locally (biogas, cogeneration, wind turbines, hydroelectricity and photovoltaics). The electricity is transmitted to the six transformer stations (Flebour, Roost, Itzig/Blooren, Heisdorf, Bertange and Schifflange) where the voltage is reduced from 220 to 65 kV and is distributed to industries and large municipal distribution networks. The voltage is then reduced from 65 kV to 20 kV in more than 60 transformer stations in the whole country. The electric energy obtained is distributed to SMEs, towns and villages where the transformers reduce the current voltage to 0.4 kV before distributing it to the final consumer. A control centre, known as Electricity Dispatching, controls and manages these high and medium-voltage networks.\n\nThe total length of the Luxembourg electricity network managed by Creos is longer than 9,500 kilometres, including 580 kilometres of high-voltage lines, 3,400 kilometres of medium-tension lines and 5,500 kilometres of low tension lines.\nThanks to its connections with Germany, Belgium and France, Luxembourg is linked to the interconnected gas networks throughout Europe. Monitored by Dispatching Gas, the high and medium-pressure pipelines distribute the gas to 60 communes that are connected to the national gas network. Pressure-reducing stations that supply the local networks then reduce the gas pressure. Creos distributes natural gas in 45 communes.\n\nSince 1 October 2015, Creos and Fluxys Belgium, in collaboration with their respective regulators ILR and CREG, have united the national markets of Luxembourg and Belgium into one Belux market. This integration, the first between two European Union member states, reflects the will of the European Union to create an European gas market without borders.\n\nCreos has four regional centres. They build, operate, maintain and repair the electricity and natural gas networks.\n\nThe centre in Roost covers the central and northern regions. It covers the high, medium and low-voltage electricity services and the medium and low-pressure natural gas services, the central store and the mechanical and electrical workshops.\n\nThe centre in Schifflange covers the southern part of the country.\n\nThe centre in Luxembourg City covers the capital and the communes of Strassen and Hesperange.\n\nThe centre in Contern manages and adjusts the meters, in particular smart meters.\n\nCreos is involved in two national projects; smart grids and electromobility.\n\nIn accordance with the law of 7 August 2012 that transposes the European Energy Efficiency Directive into Luxembourg legislation, all the gas and electricity meters must be changed in the country, independently of the network operator. By the year 2020, Creos will thus install 300,000 smart meters that record detailed information on the consumption and production of energy in the entire territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, including 250,000 electricity meters and 50,000 gas meters. The installation of these new electricity and gas meters – called Smarty – in Luxembourg homes will allow the creation of networks with real intelligence: smart grids. These smart grids are capable of monitoring decentralised electricity production (like wind turbines and photovoltaic panels), regulating the variations of the feeds into the distribution networks with greater precision and managing the demand peaks linked with the charging of electric vehicles more effectively. The law from 7 August 2012 also demands that the metering system must be able to receive water and heating.\n\nCreos will install 800 public charging stations for electric cars and hybrid plug-in cars across the country by 2020. Each charging station will incorporate two charging points, and the network – called Chargy – will include 1,600 parking spaces for electric vehicles. Creos will be responsible for the deployment, operation and maintenance of the public charging infrastructure on its distribution network, representing a total of 749 stations out of the 800 that are to be installed by 2020.\n", "id": "573737", "title": "Creos Luxembourg S.A."}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573766", "text": "Cherry picking\n\nCherry picking is when someone chooses some data or information from a larger amount to give evidence for their own argument, when all the information taken together would not have done so, or would not have done so so strongly. \nFor example, if twenty scientific studies have been done on a new medicine and 19 say it works, but one says it does not work, a person could \"cherry pick\" by only using the one study in which the drug did not work and use that to \"prove\" the point that the medicine is useless, even though most of the evidence suggests otherwise. It is a type of confirmation bias, where a person sees evidence for what they want or expect to see, and ignores evidence which goes against their belief.\n\nThe term cherry picking comes from when people harvest cherries from a tree - the cherry picker only takes the reddest, ripest fruits. If someone looked at all the fruit the person had picked, they might think that all the cherries were red, until they went to the tree and saw lots of pale, unripe cherries still on it.\n\nCherry picking as a term is quite negative, as it implies that the person doing the cherry picking is trying to deceive the audience, or simply does not care about the facts.\n\nWhen applied to subjects like medicine and science, cherry picking is considered \"bad science\" or a sign of pseudoscience.\n\nCherry picking can take several forms. The most obvious case of cherry picking is where only evidence that supports a given argument is used, and other evidence which does not support it or goes against it is ignored or covered up. Other examples can include giving a lot of emphasis to evidence which supports the idea but barely any to other evidence, and taking a quote out of context so that it seems to have a different meaning than it originally did.\n\nPseudoscience is when untrue claims are made to appear as though they have a scientific basis, even though they do not. Many pseudoscientists cherry pick real scientific evidence to support their claims. It is quite common in science for some studies to contradict others, for example in cases where different methods are used to measure an outcome, or where human error or fluke may lead to unusual results. This means that there is often a study someone can use to support their claim, and they can cherry pick that one study even if many more contradict it.\n", "id": "573766", "title": "Cherry picking"}

She went to prison after she wrote a story about stoning. Iraee was released from prison on January 3, 2017 after a 71-day hunger strike by her husband and a protest on Twitter that got international attention, but she was returned to prison January 22, after her husband stopped his hunger strike. \nStoning to death is controversial in Iran, and often used against women. In 2010 there was strong international criticism of Iran because of the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. Ashtiani was freed in March 2014, after nine years on death row. Another Iranian woman, Fariba Khalegi, is believed to be in prison and in danger of stoning. \n\nIn September 2014, the Iranian government searched the home of Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee and her husband Arash Sadeghi (Farsi: آرش صادقی) in Tehran. The guards took laptops, notebooks and CDs. They found an unpublished story Iraee wrote about stoning a woman. In the story, a young woman watches the movie, “The Stoning of Soraya M”, becomes angry, and burns a copy of the Koran.\n\nAfter the story was found, Iraee and her husband Sadegh were arrested by four men believed to be from the Revolutionary Guards. They took Sadegh to Evin Prison, but they took Iraee to a secret place for three days. They did not allow her to see a lawyer or to talk to her family. Then they took her to Evin Prison. For 17 days, they questioned her for hours, blindfolded her, and threatened to kill her. While they interrogated Iraee, she had to listen to the guards kick and choke her husband in the next cell.\n\nIraee had two short hearings. Her first hearing was about her husband's political activity. She was not permitted to speak. During the second hearing she was in the hospital after surgery, but the court would not look at her medical records. Her first lawyer was pressured to drop her case, and her second lawyer was prohibited from representing her. \n\nIn October 2016, Iranian officials called Ebrahimi Iraee on a friend's telephone and told her to go to Evin Prison to start serving a six-year prison sentence. They did not have an arrest warrant, as the law requires. Iraee was convicted of “insulting Islamic sanctities” and “spreading propaganda against the system.”\n\nAmnesty International called on the Iranian governement to set Iraee free. According to Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, \"She is facing years behind bars simply for writing a story, and one which was not even published – she is effectively being punished for using her imagination. Instead of imprisoning a young woman for peacefully exercising her human rights by expressing her opposition to stoning, the Iranian authorities should focus on abolishing this punishment, which amounts to torture.\"\n\nOn October 24, Iraee's husband Sadeghi went on a hunger strike in prison to protest Iraee's imprisonment. There were demonstrations outside Evin Prison, which is very unusual. Even though Twitter is prohibited in Iran, a Twitter campaign used the hashtag #SaveArash On January 3, 2017 Iraee was set free, and Sadeghi stopped his hunger strike. Sadghi's family said he was having many medical problems, including vomiting blood, and respiratory, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal problems. They took Sadeghi to the hospital, but after only a few days, on January 7 they returned him to prison, even though the doctors said he needed to be in the hospital.\n\nIranian authorities said Iraee and Sadegh could be temporarily out of prison on bail if they got property bonds worth 7 and 10 billion rials (US$300,000) for Arash Sadeghi and 5 billion rials (US$150,000) for Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee.\n\nIraee brought a property deed for the bail, but the government said they had a new order, and that Iraee must return to prison. Iraee refused to return to prison, but when she tried to visit her husband in the hospital, on January 22 the Revolutionary Guards at Sarallah Headquarters forced her to return to Evin Prison.\n", "id": "574050", "title": "Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee"}

Koken was prominent in the old-time music revival during the 1960s, and continues to be a leader and mentor in the old-time music community today.\n\nKoken defines old-time music as, “fiddle-centric and related music (ballads, etc.) from the Piedmont, Appalachia, the Gulf coast, central Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, northern Virginia, western Pennsylvania, and westward with the pioneers all the way to the coast.” \"Old-time music is for dancing and its songs are for lifting us above our burdens. Our music gives relief from the everyday burdens of modern life, and an insight into a simpler time, with a glimmer of hope for us all.” \n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nFamily\n\nKoken's mother, Helen Hawkins Koken Pickel, was a classical pianist and a beloved kindergarten teacher. Her family was from England before immigrating to America. His father, John C. Koken, was a math professor whose family emigrated from Germany. The Koken family arrived in New Orleans in 1850, then traveled up the Mississippi River to St. Louis. By 1892, the Koken Barber’s Supply Company of St. Louis held two barber chair [[ patents; one for the first reclining Koken chair and one for the first hydraulic lift chair . In 1915 Walter F. Koken received a patent for the first electric Barber’s Chair. \n\nMusic\n\nKoken started playing banjo at the age of thirteen. “In 1959, my brother had broken his arm, and heard that playing guitar might be a good way to get its strength back. He got his old guitar with a warped neck and high strings, and started strummin’ it. I really thought that was neat, and one day he came to me and said, “Why don’t you get a banjo, and we’ll make some money?”\n\nSince 1965, Koken has played in multiple bands: the Busted Toe Mudthumpers, the Muskrat Ramblers, the Fat City String Band, the legendary Highwoods Stringband, and The Cacklin’ Hens and Roosters Too!. \n\nCurrently, he plays fiddle-banjo duets with his partner and soul-mate Clare Milliner, as well as with Milliner, Kellie Allen, and Pete Peterson as the old-time string band, Orpheus Supertones.

Bloomeries were the first smelters able to smelt iron. The result of using a bloomery is a mass of iron and slag called a bloom. This is called sponge iron, because it is porous like a sponge. Sponge iron is usually refined into wrought iron. Bloomeries are no longer used in smelting, because blast furnaces are better.\n\nA bloomery consists of a chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. Near the bottom, pipes (made of clay or metal) enter through the side walls. The pipes allow air to enter.\n\nTo use a bloomery, charcoal is inserted into the chimney, then heated. Then roughly the same volume of iron is inserted. A common product of this process is fayalite, which occurs when iron mixes with slag.\n\nIron began to be used around 1200 BC.\n\nChina appeared to not use bloomeries, seemingly skipping to blast furnaces. However, bloomeries have been found in China, though these were likely only brought from other locations, and not built in China.\n\nBloomeries had been used in Sub-Saharan Africa before 500 BC.\n\nEuropean Bloomeries started very small, smelting about 1kg of iron with each use, but got larger over time, smelting about 14kg on average in the fourteenth century.\n", "id": "574318", "title": "Bloomery"}

The series is also aired in primetime as a syndicated series. Based on Archie Comics' \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\", it was a spinoff of \"The Archie Comedy Hour\". The series featured new episodes of Sabrina along with the \"Groovie Goolies\". The series follows a teenaged witch who likes to hang out and fight enemies using her magical powers, without letting her friends at Riverdale High find out. This series was aimed primarily towards young girls ages 6 to 14, and contained an adult laugh track. Following its first season, the series was reduced to a half-hour when the Goolies were spun off into their own show.\n\nThe show's opening strapline is:\n\"Once upon a time, there were three witches, who lived in the little town of Riverdale. Two aunts, Hilda and Zelda, are choosing the ingredients to create an evil wicked witch. But suddenly, Zelda bumped right into Hilda and accidentally added beautiful girls' stuff as an extra ingredient. Thus, the grooviest teenage witch was born. She has white hair with a pink headband, and blue eyes. She wears a blue dress with a black belt and black shoes. She loves to goof off and battle evil forces using her ultra magical powers. It so happens that she is the first bewitching American superhero — Sabrina, the teenage witch!\"\n\nFilmation animated Sabrina once more in 1977 with \"The New Archie and Sabrina Hour\".\n\n\n\n\nWhile \"The Sabrina the Teenage Witch Show\" aired on CBS as a Saturday morning cartoon, this series was broadcast on several local television stations as a primetime series, which was aired at night.\n\nGenius Products released the entire series on DVD on April 29, 2008.\n", "id": "574415", "title": "The Sabrina the Teenage Witch Show"}

In the most important match, Brock Lesnar beat Randy Orton by technical knockout while in another important match, Finn Balor beat Seth Rollins to become the first WWE Universal Champion. \nThis match was for the WWE World Championship. \"SmackDown\" wrestler Dean Ambrose won a match for the title at \"Battleground\" on July 25 against \"Raw\" wrestlers Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins. So \"SmackDown\" needed to find a challenger for Dean for \"SummerSlam\" and they had a six-pack challenge to find the challenger. The first five spots were given to John Cena, Bray Wyatt, AJ Styles, Baron Corbin and Dolph Ziggler. Apollo Crews took the sixth spot when he won a battle royal, but Dolph won the six-pack.\nBecause the WWE World Championship was on \"SmackDown\", \"Raw\" had to create their own world championship. They called it the WWE Universal Championship. \"Raw\" commissioner Stephanie McMahon felt that Seth had a chance to pin Dean Ambrose at \"Battleground\" and that would have brought the World Championship to \"Raw\" but Roman Reigns was selfish and broke up the pin. Because of that, Stephanie gave Seth the first spot in the first Universal Championship match. Then, Finn beat Cesaro, Kevin Owens and Rusev in a fatal 4-way match and Roman beat Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn and Sheamus in another fatal 4-way. Finally, Finn and Roman fought in a normal match where the winner would face Seth at SummerSlam and Finn won this match.", "id": "574573", "title": "SummerSlam (2016)"}

He was sentenced to death after he wrote an article about discrimination and the caste system in Mauritania.\n\nMohamed is an engineer from the northern industrial city of Nouadhibou. He belongs to the Moulamines, or blacksmith group, the lowest social group in Mauritania. He worked for SAMMA, a company partly owned by the Canadian mining corporation Kinross.\n\nMohemed wrote an article called \"Religion, religiosity and craftsmen,\" that criticized Mauritania's caste system. The article was published on the news website Aqlame on December 31, 2013. Mauritania abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still very common and that many Mauritanians are born into slavery. Mauritania passed a new anti-slavery law in 2015 that makes slavery a \"crime against humanity\". \n\nThe editor of Aqlame took down the article, and said it was published by accident.\n\nOn January 2, 2014, Mohamed was arrested in his home in the city of Nouadhibou. He was charged with apostasy under Article 306 of the Mauritanian criminal code, and sentenced to death. There were national demonstrations against Mohamed, and there was a fatwa to kill him. His family denounced him. His lawyers dropped him and he could not get another lawyer, only the lawyers assigned by the court. The trial started a day late because of a fight in the courtroom. The prosecuting lawyer said he was a member of the caste that the blogger criticized in his article. Mohamed belongs to a lower social class.\n\nAccording to Abdel Nasser Beibe, a Mauritanian activist and representative of the Arab Thinking Foundation, there are many people who wrote about the same things as Mohamed, but they belong to the white community, who are the majority of the people, and no one asks for their death. Their tribes and their families defend them against any attack. But Mohamed comes from the \"blacksmith\" minority, and are very marginalized. After the article, his family and caste had to deny him, and his parents had to go into exile in France. \n\nMekfoula Brahim, activist and president of For a Green and Democratic Mauritania says that Mohamed was a victim of a very hard prison sentence because he belongs to a powerless and hated group. Mekfoula says Muhamed's future is being controlled by street fanatics, who receive orders from extremist clerics influenced by radicals who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq, who press them to execute the boy.\n\nThe president of Mauritania, Abdel Aziz spoke to the country in January 2014, saying Mauritanian is an Islamic state and the death penalty could be used against Mohamed.

The court upheld the verdict, but sent the case back to Mauritania's supreme court. On Jan. 31, 2017, Mauritania’s supreme court heard the case, and returned it to the appeal court.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575284", "text": "Goicoechea (canton)\n\nGoicoechea is the 8th canton in the Province of San Jose, Costa Rica, with a population of 115,084 as of 2011. The city of Guadalupe is its main district. It forms part of the broader San José metropolitan area, itself the capital of the Republic.\n\nGoicoechea is located northeast of the capital city of San José. Goicoechea's geographic center is 09°57'31\" latitude north and 83º 59'26\" longitude west.\n\nThe canton is narrowly shaped in width and elongated in length. It is a maximum of 20 kilometers wide in a southeast by northeast direction from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge crossing the Tórres River, along Nacional No. 5 road, that leads from San José to San Juan de Tibás.\n\nIt borders:\n\nThe canton is named after an illustrious national forefather, Franciscan friar José Antonio de Liendo y Goicoechea who was born in the city of Cartago in the Province of Cartago, Costa Rica, on the 3rd of May, 1735, and died July 2, 1814, in Guatemala.\n\nThe area corresponding to the Goicoechea canton during the pre-Columbian period was populated by an indigenous people called the Western Huetar Kingdom, under the rule of king Garabito at the start of the Spanish Conquest.\n\nThe first canton dwellers established themselves in what today is called Calle Blancos (White Street), the first street neighborhood in the area. This name was assigned to the area as a result of the many people by the name of Blanco (White) who had taken residence there. The population began to spread eastbound, stretching paths toward what later became known as the canton's center.\n\nIn 1828, the main district (known as the Municipality) of San José divided the Murciélago neighborhood into several groups of houses. This gave cause for registering, under the name of San José del Murciélago, what today is known as the , which became a village and eventually on August 6, 1891, according to Law No. 56 during José Joaquín Rodríguez Zeledón's administration, this village was granted township status to head the canton as its main district. Entry for San José del Murciélago was recorded in the Neighborhoods and Quarters Boundary Register at the Department of San José a full 63 years before Guadalupe reached municipality status for the Canton of Goicoechea.\n\nAs of November 30, 1841, the Neighborhood and Dwellings Boundary Register's entries for the Los Santos neighborhood, along with the San Francisco, San Ramón, San José, San Rafael and San Joaquín quarters matched what presently corresponds to a large portion of the Goicoechea canton. And in 1844 residents of the San José quarter negotiated a permit to build a hermitage dedicated to their patron St. Joseph. Six years later, the first parson of the area, presbyter Raimundo Mora, changed the patron saint as well as the name of the quarter from San José to Guadalupe, in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, being that he was her devotee. He also broke ground for the cemetery, which is one of the oldest works in the city of Guadalupe. In 1855 a began to be built where it is still presently located. The following year a parish was built, during the episcopacy of monsignor Joaquín Anselmo Llorente y Lafuente, Costa Rica's first bishop, and it is currently suffragan of the archdiocese of San José, belonging to the ecclesiastic province of Costa Rica.\n\nThe regional demographic and economic development that occurred in Goicoechea resulted from the planting of coffee. It became the dominant product as of 1850, replacing the large tabacco plantations that had constituted the main source of income for the earliest population. The \"golden bean\" was introduced to Guadalupe in 1840 by José Manuel Núñez, who planted it and established the first processing site at his former wheat mill. Another important factor in regional development was the Camino de Carrillo (Road to Carrillo), located near the confluence of the Sucio and Honduras rivers. The need for this road was due to local coffee farmers' demands to deliver their beans to the Limón harbor on the Atlantic for exportation, thereby shortening the cargo journey to their main European markets. At first the thought was to build a train track from San José, the country's capital, to Limón, moving through Paso de La Palma. Later in 1881, when the road section had reached Carrillo, the national government proposed to discontinue construction to open a road instead from San José to Carrillo. The following year that new road was inaugurated, but was in use for very little time, given its high cost of maintenance and traffic on it becoming sparse, once a train track construction from San José to the Caribbean coast was completed in 1890.\n\nGoicoechea's first elementary school was built in 1883. It is located north of the Goicoechea Park. Afterward Escuela Carlos Gagini was built, and then in 1939 a new grammar school was inaugurated called Escuela Pilar Jiménez Solís, during president León Cortés Castro's administration. The secondary school Liceo Napoleón Quesada began operations in 1955, during president José Figueres Ferrer's first administration.\n\nGuadalupe has been Goicoechea's municipality since 1891. But given its population growth, as of on August 10, 1920, during president Julio Acosta García's administration, Law No. 69 conferred to it the title of city.\n\nGoicoechea was officially drawn away from the canton of San José and established by decree via Law No. 36 on December 7, l848. Law No. 56 decreed on August 6, 1891 that Goicoechea be itself established as a canton in the province of San José with Guadalupe as its municipality. Yet this law did not define any other districts for the canton, though it did recognize 6 townships toward that end.\n\nThe first Canton Board Hearing of Goicoechea occurred on September 13, 1891 with representatives Francisco Jiménez Núñez serving as president, Tomás Gutiérrez and Ezequiel Vargas serving as vice presidents. Jesús Zeledón served as secretary and Basileo Araya as political chief.\n\nThe first aqueduct and sewage lines were inaugurated in 1910 under president Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno's administration.\n\nGoicoechea consists of 7 districts:\n\nGeologically, Goicoechea canton is grounded on volcanic matter dating to the Quartenary Period. Rocks from the Pleistocene epoch predominate in the region. Dating to this period, there are rolling structures located between Villa Rancho Redondo and the Purral district. Volcanic structures, recently and presently established, formed during the Holocene epoch. They are associated to pyroclastics and other volcanic matter such as lava, lahars and pyroclasts. The earliest ones are located west of the canton, originating from Villa Rancho Redondo. The later ones originate from Purral and move east.\n\nThe Goicoechea canton is part of a geomorphic unit of volcanic origin, which is divided into two sub-units called the Irazú Volcano and the Volcanic Filling of the Central Valley.\n\nThe Irazú Volcano sub-unit is located to the east of the canton from Villa Mata de Plátano. It consists of slopes of all kinds. The contours of the hills are rounded due to the thickness of recent ash deposits that cover almost the whole surface mass. The sub-unit is composed of volcanic rocks displaying gaps, lavas, tuffs, agglomerates, ignimbrites, ash and also many streams of mud and lahars. The rocks' degree of weathering is highly variable, with its origin being due to the accumulation of different type of volcanic rocks.\n\nThe volcanic filling of the Central Valley, located in the western sector of the canton, corresponds to a flat undulating surface. It is possible that changes on the surface within the area are due to the presence of lava only a few meters below the surface. This constitutes a front. The sub-unit takes surface form from volcanic rocks, mainly lavas, tuffs and ignimbrites covered by ash in varying thickness. The sequence flow of lavas rests on sedimentary rock. The lavas are of the andesitic type. Geomorphologically, this unit is not a valley. Nevertheless, for political, socio-economic reasons and various other kinds of references, it is preferable to continue calling this region the Central Valley. The correct technical name is Tectonic Pit, due to the presence of a fault along the foot of the Central Volcanic Sierra, which is evidenced by the existence of thermo-mineral sources. Also there is an abrupt interruption in the foothills that align with the fault as they descend from the Central Volcanic Sierra mountain range towards the valley. Additionally, there is the presence of an unexplained \"volcanism\" (Pacacua Formation) that corresponds with or nears the position of the fault.\n\nElevations above sea level for the urban centers in the districts of Goicoechea canton follow:\n\n\nThe fluvial system of the canton of Goicoechea follows Pacific slope, which belongs to the basin of the Grande de Tárcoles River.\n\nThe rivers that drain the region begin with the Purral River, with the Navarro River as its tributary as well as the Mozotal brook. The Purral river is a tributary of the Torres River along with the Cangrejos, Patalillo and Patal brooks, together with the Tiribí, Ipís, Durazno and Barreal streams. These watercourses, except for the Torres River, have their source in the canton, on the western slope of the Cabeza de Vaca Hill, and course east-to-west. The Torres, Tiribí, Durazno, Ipís flows, and the ravines Barreal and Patal serve as cantonal borders. The first borders with San José and Montes de Oca. The second borders with the Cartago province. The rivers Durazno and Ipís along with Vázquez de Coronado and the ravines, respectively border with the cantons of Moravia and Montes de Oca.\n\nThe canton's maximum width is 12.43 miles (20 km), spreading northeast to southwest from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge over the Torres River, along National Highway No.5, which runs from San José to San Juan de Tibás.\n\n\nGoicoechea is home to important institutions of various kinds, both governmental and private, as well as a series of industries of great recognition, established mainly in the ​​Calle Blancos industrial zone. Worthy to be noted are:\n\n\nThe canton of Goicoechea has been characterized for being an area of ​​important industrial and commercial development in the province of San José, Costa Rica's capital. An example of its importance may best be seen in that companies such as Motorola and Durman Esquivel remained located in the district of Calle Blancos along with Coca Cola-FEMSA bottling corporation for decades. The construction of the industrial complex Parque Empresarial del Este in the same district has added multinational accounts, namely Amazon, Bank of America, Teletech, among others to this list of growing companies that have increased the rate of employment in the area, while the infrastructure, especially roads, has remained unchanged, leading to excessive congestion.", "id": "575284", "title": "Goicoechea (canton)"}

At that time, more people were becoming interested in the new science of modern linguistics and they were especially interested in practical results. One important area of applied linguistics is language teaching and learning. Also at this time, the European Union was becoming more important, so people in Europe needed better language teaching. \n\nPeter Strevens, the Chair in Applied Linguistics at the University of Essex first had the idea to start BAAL. At a meeting at Birkbeck College in July 1965, the original idea for BAAL was to study mainly language teaching and machine translation. However, at the first full meeting in 1967 in Reading, Berkshire the group decided to study many different topics. BAAL became the UK member of AILA, and Pit Corder was its first Chair. At first, membership was only for academics because BAAL wanted people to think it was a group of experts, not a teachers' meeting. However, by the early 1970s it became easier to join BAAL. Since 1985, anyone can join. There are no requirements to become a member.

The operating system can then emulate the DOS software.\n\nVDMs like Windows 3.x 386 Enhanced Mode can add support for using 16-/32-bit protected mode software if they use the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI).\n\nIf a DOS program in a VDM needs to use a peripheral, Windows will give the DOS program a virtual device driver (VDD) which emulates the hardware using commands that the operating system it is running on can understand.\n\nDOS VDMs appeared on Windows/386 2.01 in 1987 and were also in Windows 3.x, if you were using 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in 95, 98, 98 SE and ME.\nSimilar to Windows 3.x, VDMs can let you run many DOS applications at one time if you use the EMM386 /MULTI option. Digital Research / Novell was working on a similar system since 1991 under the codename \"Vladivar\" (originally a device driver KRNL386.SYS and not part of EMM386). It was made for the next version of DR DOS, released as Novell DOS 7 in 1994, but it was also used in their \"Star Trek\" project, which they stopped working on before finishing.\n\nVDMs called MVDM (Multiple Virtual DOS Machine) are used in OS/2 2.0 and later. OS/2 MVDMs are better than NTVDM in many ways, for example with block devices. While the OS/2 1.x emulated DOS 3.0, 2.x emulated DOS 5.0.\n\nRunning Windows 3.1 applications in OS/2 looks similar to XP Mode in Windows 7, but the technologies used are very different. A \"guest\" VDM permits programs to use the disks of the OS/2 or NT operating system that is running the VDM. Applications in a VDM can use named pipes to talk to their \"host\".\n\nNTVDM is included in all x86 versions of Windows made on NT, and let 16-bit Windows and 16-/32-bit DOS applications run. It is not included with 64-bit versions (see Limitations). ntvdm.exe helps emulate the APIs needed to run 16-bit DOS and Windows applications.\n\nNTVDM uses NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS, which runs a changed version of COMMAND.COM. The 16-bit system files are smaller versions of their MS-DOS 5.0 counterparts, including IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM, which remove biases with the FAT file system and can also call the 32-bit NTVDM if needed. NTDOS originally gave a DOS version of 30.00 to programs, but this soon was changed to 5.00 to let more programs to run without being changed However, there are many newer MS-DOS functions and commands added to MS-DOS versions 6.x and in Windows 9x which are not there.\n\n16-bit programs run separately within one 32-bit NTVDM process. Checking \"Run in separate memory space\" in the \"Run\" dialog box or shortcut of the program creates a new process instead. NTVDM emulates BIOS functions, the Windows 3.1 kernel, and its 16-bit API. \n\n32-bit DOS emulation is used for DPMI and using 32-bit memory. wowexec.exe is the emulator process for 16-bit Windows. Windows 2000 added Sound Blaster 2.0 emulation to 32-bit NTVDM. 16-bit and DOS virtual device drivers can't be run. Win16 programs can communicate with other parts of Windows using OLE, DDE and named pipes.\n\nAs virtual 8086 mode isn't available on non-x86 processors, NTVDM was a full emulator for NT on these architectures. NT 3.51 could only 80286, but since NT 4.0, 486 emulation was added.\n\nIn January 2010, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a large security problem in NTVDM system letting non-Administrators to increase their permissions to the SYSTEM level. Ormandy claimed it was a problem for all x86 versions of Windows NT after 1993. 32-bit versions of NT 3.X/4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, and 7 were affected. Ormandy published how the problem works. Before Microsoft could fix it, you could turn off 16-bit application support to solve the problem, but it made so you couldn't run 16-bit programs. x64 Windows never had this problem because it doesn't use NTVDM. After applying the security fixes Microsoft made available, NTVDM could be turned on safely.\n\nNTVDM and wowexec had limitations on Windows XP and later because of a GDI object limit per session, which might cause GDI handles to be moved two bits to the right when changing 32 to 16 bits. Handles thus couldn't be larger than 14 bits, so 16-bit programs with a GDI handle larger than 16384 would crash.\n\nOn x86-64 CPUs, virtual 8086 mode is only available as a legacy sub-mode (if running a 32-bit operating system), but not in 64-bit long mode, which is why NTVDM is not included with 64-bit versions of Windows, so 16-bit applications cannot be run on 64-bit Windows. You'll need Windows XP Mode or similar virtualization software to run 16-bit programs within a 64-bit operating system.\n\nNTVDM cannot run DOS games on computers of today. Emulation is only provided for simple peripherals. For example, sound in NTVDM can be limited. Windows NT only updates the screen a few times per second when DOS programs write on it, and they can't emulate high-resolution graphics options. As software runs at the speed of the CPU, all \"timing loops\" stop too early. This either makes games run too fast, or causes the software to not see some emulated hardware peripherals, because it can not wait that long for an answer.\n\n\n", "id": "575796", "title": "Virtual DOS machine"}

This Imambara has a horrifying history as it was burnt down and destroyed number of times.\n\nOne of the most ancient monuments of India, Imambara Zadibal sits proudly on the land of Jammu and Kashmir. It lies in Zadibal locality of Srinagar to the west side of the fort. Made in 1518, this shrine was erected by Kaji Chak, who was a minister with Sultan Mohammed Shah.\nThis two-storey building is one of the oldest historic places in Kashmir valley. Sitting on the lines of Persian architecture, this shrine looks antique and a hot tourist spot. From 1548 AD to 1872 AD, the building went ablaze eleven times and it was rebuilt each time. Of recently, the ancient Imambara was taken down in 2004 to restructure and rebuild the new structure of the shrine that stands today.\nThe shrine has the unbelievable capacity to accommodate more than 32,000 visitors at a time.\n\nInspired by Persian style architecture, Imambara Zadibal is a two-storey building. It is constructed of oriental bricks and this structure holds Maharaji bricks that cover an area of over 75 square meters. Antique and striking, this shrine has various sideways floor raisings known as Gulam Gardish. There’s a central ground level floor that’s called Pokhr. It also houses a large gallery of four gates.\n\nCurrently, the structure is under the supervision of All Jammu and Kashmir Shia Association, who take care of its maintenance. However, the structure that we see today is still undergoing construction work at a slow pace.\n\nShia Muslims are a minority in Kashmir. During the first 10 days of Muharram, Imambada Zadibal becomes a centre of mourning and religious gathering in Zadibal. Shia followers join the mourning, usually ending in the festival of Ashura when a large procession parades through the streets of Zadibal ending at Imambada Zadibal, though mourning continues from 1st day of muharram to 10th of the Islamic month Safar.\n\nAt the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed, it was a majestic building. Soon, it turned into a pride of Kashmir Valley. However, this shrine is witness to a horrific past. The structure was set ablaze the first time in 1548 AD. This was done by Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat due to communal violence. Later on in 1551, Daulat Chak took over the work to reconstruct this Imambara.\nOnce again in 1553, this structure was set ablaze by Zafar Kupawari for the second time. That was not all, the destruction soon followed in 1653, when the building was burnt down by adversaries of Ahlul Bayt during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.\nLater on, in 1682 AD, Imambara Zadibal went on fire again. This occurred at a time when Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgir was the ruler of the region. Then in the 1719 AD, the structure got burnt down a fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. For the sixth time, Imambara Zadibal caught fire in 1748 AD. This was done by mysterious enemies of Ahlul Bayt who set the building on fire once again in 1763.\nDuring Afghan rule in Kashmir, on eve of Ashura event, Imambara Zadibal went into flames in June 1801. It was in July 1830 that this place saw a horrific massacre as Imambara Zadibal faced fire when Jammu and Kashmir was under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal.\nImambara Zadibal got reconstructed with the help of financial aid sent by a minister of Awadh’s Sultan Nasr-ud-din. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty to rebuild this structure to Hatim Mir.\nHowever, in September 1872 the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&K. This time the king gave away a financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara to the current prosperous condition. Every time the shrine went through fire, followers of Prophet Mohammad and Ahlul Bayt were only more convinced to make it again.\n\nImmabara Zadibal carries a strong tale of destruction but each time the shrine was rebuilt again. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shine was burnt down around eleven times.\n\nReaching this shrine is easy because it is close to Srinagar, Badgam, Daachigam and Pulwama. All of these are popular tourist places. The nearest railway station for Zadibal is Jammu, which is at a distance of 282.6 km. Jammu Railway Station is well connected with all major Indian cities. Taxi services are also available from Jammu to Srinagar.\n\n", "id": "575809", "title": "Imambara Zadibal"}

This was made to give software developers time to make their software 32-bit while people moved from Windows 3.1x to Windows 95, so the OS can be upgraded to a newer version while running most, or all of, a customer's 16-bit programs.\n\nWindows 9x operating systems, which were made on top of DOS, had both 16 and 32-bit systems, so if it kept those 16-bit parts, the OS could run 16-bit software without emulation. NT-based versions are very different in how they run, so they need a more sophisticated solution. There are two main techniques to let 16-bit programs run on 32-bit versions of Windows (with some limitations) called thunking and shimming. \n\nWOW \"thunks\" 16-bit instructions into 32-bit equivalents to permit 16-bit pointers, memory spaces, and address spaces.\n\n16-bit programs usually run in a single virtual DOS machine, sharing memory between them. However, they can be changed to run in a private, separate memory space, where every 16-bit process has a separate process. This can reduce system crashes by not letting programs interfere with others, but it can cause reduced 16-bit inter-process communication and can use more of your computer's memory.\n\nWOW is a part of 32-bit editions of Windows NT. 64-bit versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2008 R2 and later where they only have 64-bit versions) can not run 16-bit software without using different emulation software (for example, DOSBox).\n\nWOWEXEC.EXE on Windows NT allows WoW to work. Windows-on-Windows can, using the WIN.COM file, emulate the Windows 3.x (for NTVDM), Windows 95 and Windows 98 kernels, which can run 16-bit DOS-powered Windows applications on Windows NT.\n\nProblems with applications running on newer operating systems, especially with long filenames, multiple user accounts, and least privilege, may prohibit some applications from working correctly. For example, they might incorrectly think that they can write files to any part of the file system, but NTFS file permissions exist and does not allow this in many system folders. When Microsoft was building Windows 95, they had to ensure old programs still worked with 8.3 filenames to allow old applications to keep working properly. Since Windows 95, there was a feature where both a long and short file name are kept, so older applications could still use the 8.3 filenames.\n\nPrograms that try to access hardware directly can't do so. Old programs may also not work if they expect certain system configuration files from DOS and Windows 9x that are not used in Windows NT operating systems, so empty versions of files like AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS exist even though Windows NT does not use them.\n\nMany shims exist in the application compatibility layer of later versions of Windows to capture and change API calls from old applications made with different assumptions about the operating system in mind.\n\n\n", "id": "575822", "title": "Windows on Windows"}

It emits more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy, it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy. This contradicted the principles of conservation of energy and showed a new model was needed for the behaviour of blackbodies. This happened around the end of the nineteenth century. It was one of the things that led to the invention of quantum mechanics.\n\nIt led theorists like Max Planck to come up with quantum theory in which energy leaves the body in distinct packet called quanta rather than in continuous waves.

It is in the central part of the state along the Kentucky River. It is the site of Fort Boonesborough State Park, which includes the Kentucky River Museum. The park site has been rebuilt to look like a working fort of the days when Daniel Boone lived there.\n\nBoonesborough was founded by Boone as Boone's Station while he was working for Richard Henderson and Nathanial Hart of the Transylvania Company. Boone led a group of settlers through the mountains from Fort Watauga (present-day Elizabethton in Tennessee). He carved the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap. He established Fort Boonesborough. Boone lived there from 1775 to 1779. Boonesborough was the town in the area of present-day Kentucky formally chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia which then claimed it. It was also one of the first English-speaking communities west of the Appalachian Mountains. Boone successfully led his fellow settlers during the Siege of Boonesborough in 1778. He then moved to his son Israel's settlement at Boone's New Station near what is now Athens, Kentucky.\n", "id": "576981", "title": "Boonesborough, Kentucky"}

He has been missing since 2013, when he was kidnapped with archbishop Yohanna Ibrahim of the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\nYazigi was born in 1959 in Lattakya, Syria. He studied for a civil engineering degree at the University of Tishreen in Latakia, Syria. He studied theology at the University of Thessaloniki in Greece and received a masters degree in 1989 and a PhD in 1992. The title of his thesis was \"Eschatology & Ethics: The Eschatological Foundations of the Life in Christ According to St. John Chrysostom.\" He also studied Byzantine music and iconography in Greece and Mount Athos.\n\nYazigi's brother is Greek Orthodox Patriarch John X Yazigi.\n\nIn 1992, Yazigi became a religion instructor at Saint John of Damascus Institute of Theology at the University of Balamand in Lebanon. He was dean of the institute from 1994 to 2001. At the same time, he was appointed abbot of Balamand Monastery in the Koura District in northern Lebanon.\n\nYazigi was ordained a priest in 1992 and became bishop of Aleppo in 2000. He wrote 11 books and 7 articles on religious subjects, including translations of English and Greek works into Arabic.\n\nYazigi disappeared on April 22, 2013 in Syria after he was kidnapped along with archbishop Yohanna Ibrahim of the Syriac Orthodox Church. The two men worked in Aleppo. Their driver was shot and killed in the attack. The two men were kidnapped in the village of Kfar Dael by \"a terrorist group\" on the road to Aleppo from the rebel-held border with Turkey at Bab al Hawa. Ibrahim went to get Yazigi because he was familiar with the border crossing and the route. The name of the driver killed was Fathallah Kabud. Bishop Ibrahim went to the border to receive two priests who had been kidnapped: Armenian Catholic Michel Kayal and Greek Orthodox Isaac Moawad. Money was paid for the priests on April 19, but Ibrihim did not receive the priests that day, and they asked him to return. Ibrahim was experienced with negotiating kidnapping releases. In the year before his kidnapping, he participated in 20 successful hostage exchanges.<ref></refIt is now known that Boulos Yazigi was murdered in a horrific decapitation by a jihadist from a Caucasian Republic. The video has surfaced and been viewed in a Turkish court during proceedings against the perpetrator for other matters. In fact, it appears that Turkish Secret Services and the Justice Minister of Erdogan's government aided and abetted the downplaying of his crimes ,if not materially supported him via controlled others for plausible deniability.Russia's new rapproachment with Turkey makes it highly unlikely he will have to answer for his crimes. The jihadist was /is a member of Islamic fundamentalists that are still called \"moderates\" by the USA and its allies ,even though the group is well known for most of its activity being the declaration of war on /and perpetrating violent murders on Christians in Syria ...a religion in common with most of NATO and its allies. He has been in prison for at least two years in Turkey for the above -mentioned other matter. He kept the knife used in the decapitation as a souvenir and in fact the blood on the knife was used as additional proof that the victim was Boulos Yazigi.\n", "id": "577018", "title": "Boulos Yazigi"}
