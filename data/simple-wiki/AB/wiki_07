It was popular among soldiers, police, and civilians alike. It was invented by John T. Thompson at the end of World War I as a \"trench-boom\" weapon, or a weapon that could clear out trenches very quickly. The war ended before the submachine gun could be used in battle. In 1919 general Thompson had the company he founded, Auto-Ordnance Company, modify the gun for civilian use. The gun was classified as a submachine gun, meaning a small, fully automatic, hand-held gun that fires pistol ammunition. It remains an iconic firearm that is very popular with collectors. It fires .45 ACP caliber bullets, an effective and accurate combat bullet against human targets.\n\n\nIn 1882, John T. Thompson entered the United States Army. During the Spanish–American War he made a reputation for himself making sure ammunition got to the front lines. This was at a time of almost complete chaos in the army supply system. He later played a part in developing two important American military weapons. These were the M1903 Springfield rifle and the M1911 pistol. In 1916 Auto-Ordnance was started with Thompson holding the majority of shares. Designed for use in World War I, the gun was first called \"The Annihilator I\" (Thompson nicknamed it a trench broom) could fire 20 rounds per second. The first cases of the new submachine gun arrived on the docks for shipment on November 11, 1918; the same day the war ended. Thompson and Auto-Ordnance began developing the gun for civilian markets. In 1921 the first model, called the M1921, was produced.\n\nIn 1921, the Colt Patent Firearms Company made 15,000 Thompson submachine guns for Auto-Ordinance at a cost of $38.25 each. These were called the “Model 1921A”. This model weighed and had an effective range (distance it was accurate) of . General Thompson tried to sell his gun to European countries with little success. He tried selling it in the US but sales were slow. In 1926 he got orders from the United States Postal Service and the United States Marine Corps. The Marines used the guns during the Banana Wars. It worked well to counter ambushes by Nicaraguan guerrillas. The Irish Republican Army used them in 1921 during the last part of the Irish War of Independence. They were not impressed by the fact they could only kill about 32 percent of those they fired at. Others who bought his submachine gun included Law enforcement agencies and ranchers. Organized crime quickly found uses for the gun. Later, the United States Navy ordered 1,500.\n\nThe US military began using the weapon in 1938 and used it throughout World War II. There were two variants used. The model M1928A1 could use either stick or drum magazines, it had a muzzle brake (to counter the gun's tendency to rise when fired) and had Cooling fins (to counter the barrel of the gun getting too hot). The M1A1 model had no cooling fins, could only use the stick magazines and had a simplified sight. It was used by all the allies during the war. The main problem of the Thompson submachine gun was it was complex and expensive to manufacture. It was also heavy at about loaded. It had to be kept very clean or it would misfire. But soldiers liked the weapon. It was a favorite of British and Australian soldiers. In the US military it was carried by squad leaders and officers. In the heavy jungles in the Pacific War, it sounded dangerously like the Japanese light machine guns causing some confusion on both sides. When the US developed the M3 submachine gun, also called the \"grease gun\", it was much lighter, cheaper to make and had a slower rate of fire. Most soldiers who had Thompsons were very slow to give them up in favor of the less well-liked grease gun. \n\nIt was used during the Korean War and later during the Vietnam War. The Thompson submachine gun was retired in 1971 after 33 years of service. \n\nThe Thompson was used in the Arab–Israeli conflict, the Cuban Revolution and in the Northern Ireland conflict (1969–1998. The Thompson submachine gun continue to be produced today. It's production numbers are over 1,700,000. They are still in use in many countries around the world.\n\n", "id": "531059", "title": "Thompson submachine gun"}

The .45 ACP has good stopping power because of the large size of the bullet, a .45 ACP bullet is almost half an inch. When shot at human targets, the .45 ACP bullet makes a big hole that causes blood loss and leads to faster death. \n\nIt was used for guns like the M1911, the Thompson submachine gun, the M3 Grease Gun, the USP45, the UMP45, the TDI Kriss Super V, the MAC-10, and many other guns.\n", "id": "531061", "title": ".45 ACP"}

He was brought to New York City as a child in 1897, by the explorer Robert Peary. His father and four others were also brought. The six of them were studied by staff at the American Museum of Natural History, which was given custody of them. Most of them died soon after arriving. \n\nMinik was a member of the Inughuit, the northernmost group of Inuit in Greenland. His father was named Qisuk. They met Peary when the explorer employed men from the Inughuit during several expeditions into the Arctic. Peary asked some of them to come with him to New York. Six of them agreed, including Qisuk and Minik. Peary did not tell them about the real purpose of the trip. Some agreed to travel to see new places; others did not want to be separated from relatives. Peary promised them that they would be able to return to Greenland. Soon after their arrival, the group became the objects of study. The museum staff had not made plans for their care, nor for their return.\n\nSoon after arriving in New York, most of the Inuit contracted the disease tuberculosis. Three adults and one child died, including Minik's father. A fourth adult survived and was returned to Greenland. Minik was the only one left. William Wallace, the curator of the museum, adopted Minik. Minik pleaded for a proper Inuit burial for his father. The museum staff wanted to preserve Qisuk's body for study. They made a fake body and put it in a coffin. They staged a fake burial so that Minik would think he was burying his father.\n\nThe museum put the skeleton on display. In about 1906, a story was published in local newspapers that stated Qisuk's skeleton was displayed in the museum. Minik was told about it by his classmates at school. He then asked that his father's bones be given to him for traditional burial. Wallace supported Minik in this, but the museum denied that they had the body. Minik was never able to reclaim his father's bones.\n\nMinik returned to Greenland in 1910, with the help of Peary. He came back to the United States in 1916. He lived and worked there until dying of influenza in the pandemic of 1918.\n\nKenn Harper wrote a book about Minik in 1986. The book was called \"Give Me My Father's Body\". Harper spent several years trying to persuade the Museum of Natural History to return the remains of the four Inuit to Greenland. He succeeded in 1993. The bodies were buried in a funeral in Qaanaaq. Minik is buried in a cemetery in Pittsburg, New Hampshire.\n\n", "id": "531072", "title": "Minik Wallace"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531116", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bathes and protects the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord). \"Cerebro\" means \"brain\"; \"spinal\" is a short version of \"spinal cord\"; and fluid is a liquid.\n\nCSF is made by networks of blood vessels called choriod plexuses in each of the brain's four ventricles.\n\nCSF flows through the subarachnoid space - the space between the two layers of meninges that are closest to the skull (the arachnoid layer and the dura mater). CSF also fills the brain's ventricles, and flows down the middle of the spinal cord (the \"central canal\").\n\nCSF is created from blood plasma (the liquid part of blood), so CSF's contents are very similar to plasma's. CSF is 99% water. It carries:\n\nThere should be very few white blood cells in the CSF, or none at all. There should be no red blood cells in the CSF.\n\nBeing surrounded by CSF helps the brain float inside the skull, like a buoy in water. Because the brain is surrounded by fluid, it floats like it weighs only 2% of what it really does. If the brain did not have CSF to float in, it would sit on the bottom of the skull. The brain's weight would push the bottom of the brain against the skull. Blood would not be able to get to the bottom of the brain because it the blood vessels would be getting crushed by the weight of the brain on top of them. Without getting blood (and the oxygen it carries), the neurons in the bottom of the brain would die.\n\nCSF protects the brain by acting like a cushion. Without CSF, every time a person moved their head, their brain would hit the inside of their skull. This could injure the brain. \n\nWhen a person hits their head, CSF acts like the airbag in a car and can sometimes keep the brain from slamming into the inside of the skull. However, when a person hits their head very hard - for example, in a car accident - the CSF cannot protect the brain from hitting the skull. This can cause concussions, bleeding in the brain, brain damage, or even death.\n\nThe brain's cells do chemical reactions to change one chemical to another chemical that the brain needs. Sometimes, after a chemical reaction, chemicals that the brain does not need are left over. These chemicals are called \"waste products.\" For example, when the brain's cells use oxygen and glucose (sugar) to create energy, carbon dioxide (CO) is left over. Too much carbon dioxide can poison the brain.\n\nTo keep waste products from building up in the CSF, the chorioid plexuses make new CSF about four times a day. The old CSF drains out into the bloodstream, bringing waste products and toxins with it. In this way, the CSF rinses things that could hurt the brain out into the bloodstream. The bloodstream can then carry these chemicals to organs that can get rid of them, like the kidneys and the lungs. For example, the bloodstream carries carbon dioxide to the lungs, where it can be breathed out.\n\nDoctors can use samples of CSF to find out if a person has a brain infection, like meningitis, encephalitis, or syphilis. CSF samples can also show bleeding from certain parts of the brain. Swelling in the brain, caused by some inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, can show in a CSF sample as well.\n\nUsually, doctors take samples of CSF by doing a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\n\nNormal CSF should be clear and colorless, with no red blood cells, and very few white blood cells.\n\nSigns of a brain infection include:\n\nProtein levels that are higher than normal can be a sign of inflammation in the brain. However, they can also be a sign of other problems, like a bleed in the brain; a brain tumor; epilepsy; and \"acute alcoholism.\"\n\nCancer cells in the CSF are a sign that a person has brain cancer, or has cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the brain.\n\nHead injuries and some diseases can make too much CSF build up in the brain. This is called hydrocephalus. The extra fluid puts pressure on (squeezes) the brain. This is called increased intracranial pressure. If the pressure gets high enough, the brain's blood vessels get crushed, and blood cannot get to the brain. If a person's brain does not get enough blood and oxygen, they will become unconscious and their brain cells will die. Eventually, the person will die.\n\nWithout treatment, 6 out of every 10 people with hydrocephalus will die. The rest will have physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and/or other brain problems.\n\nSome problems can cause CSF to leak out through a hole or tear in the dura mater (the layer of the meninges that is next to the skull and the bones of the spinal cord). CSF leaks are usually a complication of a lumbar puncture or certain kinds of surgery on the head, neck, or brain. However, an injury to the head or spine can also cause a CSF leak. Sometimes, doctors cannot find a cause for a CSF leak.\n\nMost people with CSF leaks get better on their own, after the hole in the dura mater heals. However, some CSF leaks can cause serious complications:\n\n", "id": "531116", "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531211", "text": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nCreated on December 15, 1791, the Sixth Amendment (Amendment VI) to the United States Constitution is a part of the United States Bill of Rights. It provides many protections and rights to those accused of a crime. Among the provisions are the right to a lawyer, the right to a speedy public trial and the right to an impartial jury. It gives defendants the right to know who his (or her) accusers are. It also give the defendant the right to know the charges and evidence against him. \n\nOne of the most important rights given is that to legal counsel. It is so important that another right is associated with it. All those who cannot afford to pay for legal assistance will have a lawyer appointed for them at government expense. The federal, state and local justice systems all have provisions to appoint legal counsel for indigent defendants. The appointed counsel assists the defendant in any interrogations by law enforcement. They assist the defendant through the trial phase, sentencing and the initial appeal if there is a conviction. Legal systems, including the U.S. legal system, are complex and not easily understood by the average person. Having an attorney is critical to guiding the defendant through the legal processes. An attorney advises his client, the defendant, as to his or her rights and explains all processes of the criminal proceedings. The attorney protects the defendant's Constitutional rights. An attorney also can negotiate with the prosecution and the court in cases of plea bargains. \n\nThe right to a speedy trail originated with the Assize of Clarendon in 1166. It says that justice must be provided to robbers, murders, and thieves \"speedily enough.\" Those who wrote the Bill of Rights did not want defendants to be prisoners for a long time without the benefit of a trial. They did not want the accused to have their life disrupted, especially when the Fifth and Sixth Amendments both hold a presumption of innocence. Also, the longer a trial is delayed, the more likely that evidence may be lost and that witnesses may forget or cannot be found. \nA right to a speedy trial does not begin until a person has been arrested or formally charged. The government may investigate a crime (within any applicable statute of limitations) for as long as they find it is necessary. They are under no obligation to bring an indictment within a certain period of time. The prosecution may drop any pending criminal charges and open the investigation again at a later time without penalty of the Sixth Amendment. \nIf a defendant brings a claim that their speedy trial rights have been violated the court may look at the reasons for the delay, any prejudice or injury to the defendant and how far the prosecution has gone into the criminal proceedings. If a defendant does not assert the right to a speedy trial early enough, they may lose their claim. Defendants who cause unnecessary delays also lose their rights to a speedy trial claim. \nIf the delay in bringing a defendant to trial exceeds one year following the arrest, this will trigger a presumption that the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial may have been violated. The government may counter if they have good or plausible reasons for the delay. Requests by the prosecution for additional time may be granted if plausible. But if none are offered or the court finds the reasons not plausible, they may dismiss the indictment, overturn a conviction or hear other remedies the defense might seek. \n\nThis right, to a public trial, has its roots in English common law. It reflects the hostility and suspicion felt at the time towards secret proceedings such as the Spanish Inquisition, the French \"Lettre de cachet\" or England's Star Chamber. The framers of the Bill of Rights believed that public trials would help prevent corruption in judges and prosecutors. It was also thought it might reduce witnesses committing perjury. The United States Supreme Court has held that the right to a public trial applies to federal, state, and local governments. The right is not absolute however. While the public and the press have a First Amendment interest in open proceedings, under some circumstances a defendant waive his rights to a public trial. In cases where undue publicity might hurt the defendant's case, public access to the trial can be restricted.\n\nThe right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses—those punishable by imprisonment for no more than six months—are not covered by the jury requirement. Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to a jury trial does not exist. Also, in the United States, except for serious offenses (such as murder), minors are usually tried in a juvenile court, which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the right to a jury.\n\nOriginally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to “a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law. This includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted. Therefore, it was held that juries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary in England. \n\nWhen, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the number of jurors by \"historical accident,\" and that a jury of six would be sufficient, but anything less would deprive the defendant of a right to trial by jury. The Sixth Amendment requires unanimity in a federal jury trial. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while requiring states to provide jury trials for serious crimes, does not incorporate all the elements of a jury trial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Thus, states are not mandated to require jury unanimity.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment's confrontational clause grants the defendant the right to face their accusers. It allows the defense to dispute the testimony given by prosecution witnesses. It also allows the jury the opportunity to decide if a witness is being dishonest in any way. This applies to statements made in court and out of court statements. A court may prevent repeated questioning of witnesses on the same question or harassing a witness. But if a judge restricts the cross-examination of a witness too severely, it may cause a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. \n\nAdmitting out of court statements, often called hearsay evidence, may also prevent a defendant from confronting his accusers. There are some exceptions. For example, if a witness is unavailable and testified against the defendant in previous judicial proceedings, and the defendant was able to cross-examine the witness, a transcript of the testimony may be used as evidence. \n\nThe compulsory clause also allows the accused to present witness testimony favorable to the defense.\n", "id": "531211", "title": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531231", "text": "Exposure (toxicology)\n\nToxic exposure means that a toxin (poison) touched or got into a person's body. That person has been exposed to the toxin. \n\nAfter a person is exposed to a toxin, many different things about that person, the toxin, and the exposure affect \"toxicity\". Toxicity is how the person reacts to the toxin, including what symptoms they may have.\n\nA person can get exposed to a toxin accidentally or on purpose. People can also use toxins as weapons to try to kill other people (for example, during chemical or biological warfare).\n\nAnything can be a toxin if enough of it gets into a person's body. For example, even water can be toxic. If a person drinks enough water (usually more than 6 gallons in one day), they can get water toxicity (also called \"water poisoning\" or \"water intoxication\"). This causes the body's cells to swell up with extra water. Swelling in the brain's cells can cause brain damage or death. Water, in normal amounts, helps keep us alive; but if a person is exposed to enough of it, it becomes a toxin, and it can kill the person.\n\nThere are two major types of exposure: acute and chronic.\n\nAn acute exposure happens only one time. Chronic exposure happens many times, over a long period of time.\n\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines these types of exposure this way:\n\nToxins can get into the body in four different ways. These are called \"routes of exposure.\" The route of exposure is one of the many things that affects toxicity.\n\nToxins can get into the body through inhalation (the person breathes in the toxin). If a toxin is a gas, inhalation is usually the way it gets into the body.\n\nWhen a toxin is inhaled, it may injure the airways and the lungs. Also, some toxins can go from the lungs into the bloodstream. The bloodstream then delivers blood - with the toxin in it - to all of the organs in the body. The toxin can then damage those organs.\n\nInhalation is one of the easiest and fastest ways for toxins to get into the body. The lining of the respiratory tract absorbs toxins into the bloodstream very quickly.\n\nAn example of a commonly inhaled toxin is cigarette smoke. There are over 100 toxins in cigarette smoke, including formaldehyde, arsenic, and hydrogen cyanide. Smoking is also an example of \"chronic\" toxic exposure. The exposure is chronic because the smoker is breathing in toxins many times, over a long period of time.\n\nAnother inhaled toxin that causes \"acute\" exposure is smoke from house fires. There are many toxins in this kind of smoke, including carbon monoxide and cyanide. Firefighters or people who were trapped in fires can get cyanide poisoning or carbon monoxide poisoning from breathing in these toxins. This is an example of an acute exposure, because the smoke was not breathed in for more than 24 hours.\n\nIf a toxin gets in a person's eyes or on their skin, it can get taken up into the bloodstream. This is called absorption. Absorption through the skin is the most common route of toxic exposure.\n\nThe skin is able to keep some toxins from getting into the body. However, if a person has a cut or wound on their skin, any toxin will be able to get into the body through that wound. Also, the toxin will be taken up into the bloodstream more quickly, because it does not have to get absorbed through the skin.\n\nExposure by absorption often happens in workplaces where people work with toxins. For example, if a person who works at a gas station spills gasoline on himself, the body will quickly absorb the gasoline into the bloodstream. Some chemical weapons like sarin, a nerve gas, can also be absorbed through the skin and the eyes, along with being inhaled.\n\nIngestion means that a person swallowed the toxin. Some chemicals cannot get into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. However, others are absorbed through the lining of the intestinal tract into the bloodstream.\n\nIngestion of toxins is very common in developing countries, where many people do not have safe drinking water. There are many different toxins that can be carried in water. They can be chemicals, like lead. They can also be biological toxins, like the bacteria that causes cholera, and the viruses that cause Hepatitis A and polio. People ingest these toxins by drinking the contaminated water, or eating food made with the water. The World Health Organization says that about 502,000 people die every year because of toxins in water and the diseases they cause.\n\nFood poisoning is also caused by ingestion of toxins, like \"E. coli\" bacteria, which can live in foods like meat and poultry.\n\nAn injected toxin gets into the body when something carrying the toxin breaks the skin. Injections can go into a vein, a muscle, or just under the skin. Toxins that are injected into a vein have the fastest effects, because the toxin is being put right into the bloodstream.\n\nSome snakes, scorpions, and spiders carry venom. If they bite or sting a person, they are injecting that toxin into the person's body.\n\nAn example of a toxin which is often injected on purpose is Botulinum. This is a very deadly toxin that causes botulism, but it is also sold under the name \"Botox.\" Many people choose to get Botulinum toxin injected into their faces to get rid of wrinkles. The toxin paralyzes some of the muscles in the face, usually for three to 12 months, and makes the face look smoother.\n\nSome toxins can get into the body through more than one route of exposure. For example, if water is polluted, a person can get exposed to the toxins in the water by drinking it (ingestion) and by showering or swimming in it (absorption).\n\nOnce a person has been exposed to a toxin, there are many things that affect toxicity. This article talks about only a few.\n\nMany things about a person's exposure affect toxicity. Three of the most important things are:\n\nThe route of exposure also affects toxicity. For example, if it is injected, snake venom can be life-threatening. However, if it is ingested, snake venom is usually not harmful. The effects of this toxin are very different depending on the route of exposure.\n\nToxins sometimes affect different people in different ways. This is partly caused by differences in people's bodies. A person's age, gender, genes, hormones, nutrition, and the strength of their immune system all affect toxicity. For example, infants, young children, and the elderly are more likely to get sick from lower concentrations of toxins, which might not make a healthy adult sick.\n\nSome health problems can affect toxicity. For example, inhaling toxins is especially dangerous for people who already have lung diseases, like emphysema. If the lungs are already damaged, breathing in toxins is likely to cause even more damage, and puts the person at risk for respiratory failure.\n\nAlso, once a toxin gets into the bloodstream, the body immediately starts trying to get rid of it through excretion. The main organs involved with excretion are the kidneys, liver, and lungs. If a person has damage to any of these organs (like kidney failure or cirrhosis of the liver), they will be unable to get rid of the toxin as fast as a healthy person will. The chemical will stay in their body longer, and have more toxic effects.\n\nMany things about the type of toxin a person was exposed to affect toxicity. Two examples are solubility and pH.\n\nA toxin's solubility is its ability to mix into a liquid. If a toxin is not water-soluble (it cannot dissolve in water), it cannot absorb into the bloodstream. (Plasma, the liquid part of blood, is made mostly of water.) If a person ingests a toxin that cannot dissolve into the watery plasma, the toxin will not absorb into the bloodstream through the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. It will pass out of the body through the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nHowever, many toxins are water-soluble and will get absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, the \"Vibrio cholerae\" bacteria is water-soluble. If a person ingests water or food that has this toxin in it, they can get cholera.\nOther toxins are \"lipid-soluble\" (they dissolve in fats). Instead of getting absorbed into the bloodstream, these toxins get stored in the body's fat. When the person's body burns fat to make energy, these toxins are let out and can poison the person. Examples of fat-soluble toxins include lead, DDT, and mercury.\n\nThe toxin's pH is also important. For example, if a toxin is a strong acid or a strong base, it can cause severe chemical burns to the eyes and skin. Toxins that have a more neutral pH can still hurt the body by being absorbed into the bloodstream, but they will not burn the eyes and skin. For example, if a person swims or bathes in water contaminated with cholera toxin, the toxin can still get absorbed through his eyes or skin. However, the water will not burn the eyes or skin.\n\n", "id": "531231", "title": "Exposure (toxicology)"}

It consists of finding solutions to problems. A problem is a situation that needs to be changed. It suggests that the solution is not totally obvious, for then it would not be a problem. A great deal of human life is spent solving problems. Social life is based on the notion that together we might solve problems which we could not as individuals. \n\nThe word \"problem\" comes from a Greek word meaning an \"obstacle\" (something that is in your way). If someone has a problem, they have to find a way of solving the problem. The way to solve it is called a solution. Some problem-solving techniques have been developed and used in artificial intelligence, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Some are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in gestalt psychology, cognitive psychology. and chess.\n\nProblems can be classified as ill-defined or well-defined. Ill-defined problems are those that do not have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solution. An example is how to face threats which might perhaps be made in the future. Well-defined problems have specific goals, clearly defined solution paths, and clear expected solutions. These problems also allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems. \n\nBeing able to solve problems involves the ability to understand what the goal of the problem is and what rules could be applied to solving the problem.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531493", "text": "Vertical transmission\n\nVertical transmission (also called mother-to-child transmission, or MTCT) means that an infection is spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy or childbirth. Vertically transmitted infections are usually caused by bacteria or viruses.\n\nIf the baby still has the infection after he or she is born, the infection may be called a congenital infection.\n\nHere are some examples of infections that can be \"vertically transmitted.\"\n\nMany (but not all) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be vertically transmitted. STIs that can be spread from mother to fetus include:\n\nAlmost every type of hepatitis can be vertically transmitted. Hepatitis C, D, and E can be spread during pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nHepatitis B cannot be spread during pregnancy. However, it can be spread during childbirth if the infant touches its mother's blood or other body fluids.\n\nIn developed countries, Group B streptococcal infection is the most common cause of bacterial infections in newborns. It can cause infections that are very dangerous to newborns, like meningitis, septicaemia, and pneumonia. These infections can kill a newborn or cause serious long-term health problems.\n\n\nThere are two main ways that infections can be spread during pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nThe placenta surrounds and protects the fetus during pregnancy. It keeps the mother's blood from mixing with the fetus's. However, some infections can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. This is called \"perinatal infection.\"\n\nThese infections are especially dangerous because they affect the fetus while it is still developing. This is why many vertically transmitted infections are most dangerous to the fetus early on in a pregnancy. All of the fetus's important organs start to grow by the time the fetus is nine weeks old, and they grow the most early on in the pregnancy. If the fetus gets an infection while important parts of its body are developing, the infection can cause problems in the way those parts of the body grow.\n\nThese infections are also dangerous because a fetus does not have an immune system of its own. It depends on its mother's immune system. If the mother has an infection that has not been treated, and her immune system cannot fight off the infection, the fetus will not be able to fight off the infection either.\n\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta protects the fetus from its mother's blood. However, during childbirth, the placenta stays in the womb while the baby travels through the birth canal. While it is being born, the mother's blood and other body fluids get on the baby, and the baby also touches its mother's genitals. Because of this, infections that are carried in the blood, in body fluids, or in sores on the mother's genitals can infect the baby.\n\nInfections are usually more dangerous for newborns and infants than for adults. This is because it takes about six months for an infant's immune system to develop completely. Until the infant's immune system is fully grown, it will not be able to fight off infections as well as an adult could.\n\nSometimes, medical treatment, like antibiotics, can prevent a baby from getting infections that spread during childbirth.\n\nSome vertically transmitted infections can be prevented if the mother gets vaccines before getting pregnant. These infections include HPV, chickenpox, measles, and rubella. However, while these vaccines are common in developed countries, many people in developing countries do not have good medical care and cannot get vaccines.\n\nOther vertically transmitted infections, like syphilis, can be cured with antibiotics before the mother gets pregnant.\n\nSexually transmitted infections can often be prevented by having safer sex.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests these ways of preventing vertically transmitted infections:\n\nThe World Health Organization says that mothers with HIV can lower their baby's risk of getting vertically transmitted HIV to 2% if:\n\n", "id": "531493", "title": "Vertical transmission"}

Because it is so toxic, it cannot be used as anything other than a chemical weapon. The United Nations classifies VX as a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nVX is the most toxic nerve agent ever created. The Council on Foreign Relations says: \"A fraction of a drop of VX, absorbed through the skin, can fatally disrupt the nervous system.\"\n\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, an international law, made it illegal for countries to use chemical weapons like VX. It also made it illegal to make or keep more than 100 grams of VX. It allows some scientists to make and use amounts under 100 grams only if they are trying to create an antidote, or doing medical research.\n\nVX is one of the \"V-series nerve agents,\" which were made in the 1950s by the United Kingdom's military researchers. Nobody agrees on why these nerve agents are called \"V-series.\" Different people say the V stands for \"Victory,\" \"Venomous\" (poisonous), or \"Viscous\" (thick liquid).\n\nVX is a liquid that cannot be smelled or tasted. It is a thick liquid with the texture of motor oil. As a weapon, it can be used as a liquid or an aerosol. It could be spread by air, through water, or through food.\n\nMaking VX is difficult and very dangerous. Many toxic and dangerous chemicals are used in the process.\n\nVX works the same way other nerve agents do. It blocks nerve signals from getting from the brain to the body. Normally, a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) called acetylcholine tells the body's muscles to tighten up when they need to. When it is time for the muscles to relax, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase destroys acetylcholine, so the muscles stop getting the signal to relax.\n\nVX blocks acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine builds up, because it is not getting destroyed by acetylcholinesterase. The muscles get tighter and tighter, because the extra acetylcholine keeps telling them to. The extra acetylcholine also signals the parasympathetic nervous system to work extra hard. These changes in the body cause the signs and symptoms of VX poisoning.\n\nThe earliest symptoms of VX poisoning depend on how a person was exposed to VX. If VX got on a person's skin, their first symptoms might be sweating or twitching muscles near where the VX was. If the person breathed in VX, their first symptoms might be a runny nose and trouble breathing, caused by the bronchi (the tubes that bring air to the lungs) getting narrower.\nAll nerve agents have the same symptoms, because they work the same way. They make the parasympathetic nervous system work too hard. They also keep signals from the brain from getting through to the body, so the brain cannot tell the muscles to relax. This causes a group of unique symptoms:\n\nPeople with VX poisoning can have seizures and go into status epilepticus. They can die because their breathing muscles get so tight that they do not work.\n\nIf a person got VX on their skin, the first step is to wash away the VX with bleach and water. This is called \"decontamination.\" Removing clothing that the VX touched is also part of decontamination.\n\nThere are antidotes for nerve agent poisoning. They have to be given together.\n\nHowever, nerve agents like VX work very quickly. Antidotes usually have to be given within a few minutes after a person was exposed to VX. If pralidoxime is not given soon enough, it cannot reverse VX's effects.\n\nUsually, a sedative like diazepam (Valium) is also given. This will help the body's muscles relax, and can prevent seizures.\n\n", "id": "531510", "title": "VX"}

Choking agents make fluid build up in the lungs, and can cause suffocation.\n\nThe most common examples of choking agents are chlorine and phosgene. There are others, but they are not often used.\n\nPhosgene is the most dangerous choking agent that is commonly used..\n\nPhosgene can be a liquid or a gas. As a gas, it is heavier than air, so it can stay near the ground (where people can breathe it in for long periods of time. It smells like freshly cut grass or moldy hay.\n\nAlong with being a choking agent, phosgene is also a blood agent. This means it keeps oxygen from getting into the body's cells. Without oxygen, a person's cells will die, and the person will suffocate.\n\nPhosgene usually does not cause its worst effects right away. The worst symptoms do not happen until 12 hours after a person breathed in phosgene. The person usually dies within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nChlorine is naturally a gas, but it can be made into a liquid or a solid. Chlorine is used to make many different things, like plastics, and is used to clean swimming pools.\n\nChlorine gas is very dangerous if it is inhaled. Chlorine can react with water in the lungs to make hydrochloric acid. This is a very strong acid which can burn the lungs so badly that a person dies.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of exposure to a choking agent depend on how the chemical got into a person's body. \n\nIf a choking agent gets into a person's eyes or on their skin, it usually causes very bad burns.\n\nIf a choking agent is inhaled, it usually causes:\n\nIf a person got a high enough dose of a choking agent, they will eventually suffocate.\n\nPhosgene and chlorine gas were both used as weapons during World War I. Chlorine was used first. It was the first chemical weapon that was used during the war to try to kill enemy soldiers. (Before this, countries like France and Germany had used tear gas, which is not meant to kill people.) \n\nChlorine was used as a weapon for the first time by the German Army around January 1915, against the British Army. At the time, German Major Karl von Zingler wrote: \"[I]t has been said that our Chlorine is very effective. 140 English officers have been killed. This is a horrible weapon ...\".\n\nAbout four months later, the German Army used chlorine gas for the first time against French and Algerian soldiers. These soldiers did not know about this new weapon, and they panicked and tried to run away. However, running makes chlorine's effects worse. In a few minutes, the gas killed more than 1,000 French and Algerian soldiers, and injured more than 4,000 others. One soldier who survived said:\n\n\"[I watched] figures running wildly in confusion over the fields. Greenish-gray clouds swept down upon them, turning yellow as they traveled over the country blasting everything they touched and shriveling up the [plants]. . . . Then there staggered into our midst French soldiers, blinded, coughing, chests heaving, faces an ugly purple color, lips speechless with agony, and behind them in the gas soaked trenches, we learned that they had left hundreds of dead and dying comrades.\"\n\nIn September 1915, the British Army used chlorine gas as a weapon for the first time.\n\nThe German Army used chlorine gas as a weapon many more times, against French, Canadian, and Russian soldiers. In one attack on Russian soldiers in Poland, 9,000 Russian soldiers were injured by the gas, and more than 1,000 were killed.\n\nHowever, soon soldiers learned that the effects of chlorine were not as bad if they stayed still, got as high off the ground as possible, and used a damp cloth to cover their mouths and faces. Because chlorine gas is green, soldiers could see the chlorine coming and would have time to protect themselves. This made chlorine gas less deadly, and both sides soon switched to using phosgene.\n\nPhosgene was first used by the German Army to attack the British Army in 1915. After that, phosgene was used often during World War I. Countries on both sides of the war - including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States - used phosgene to attack enemy soldiers. Often they mixed it with chlorine, with the goal of killing more people. \n\nIn World War I, phosgene caused about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by poison gas during the war (a total of about 85,000 deaths).\n\nAfter people saw the effects of poison gases during World War I, these gases were not used often after that war.\n\nHowever, the Imperial Japanese Army used phosgene against China many times during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).\n\nIn 2007, Iraqi insurgents used chlorine bombs to attack soldiers and civilians. Over 350 people got sick from the first attack. In two other attacks, more than 30 people died in each attack.\n\n", "id": "531560", "title": "Choking agent"}

In an idealized gas the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, most of the time. Sometimes they collide and exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment. Particle in this context refers to gaseous particles (atoms or molecules), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium.\nWhile the distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds, Boltzmann later carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution.\n\nA particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The distribution depends on the temperature of the system and the mass of the particle.\nThe Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies to the classical ideal gas, which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., van der Waals interactions, vortical flow, relativistic speed limits, and quantum exchange interactions) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell–Boltzmann form. However, rarefied gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. For this reason, it forms the basis of the Kinetic theory of gases, which provides a simplified explanation of many fundamental gaseous properties, including pressure and diffusion.\n", "id": "531567", "title": "Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution"}

No treatment can help. When a person is brain dead, there is no activity in any part of their brain. Every part of the brain is dead; no oxygen flows to the brain, and there is no electrical activity in any part of the brain.\n\nThe brain controls everything we need to do to stay alive. For example, it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, and many other important things. When a person is brain dead, their brain cannot control any of these things. A brain-dead person cannot breathe on their own. They will never be able to wake up or be aware of what is going on around them.\n\nSometimes, brain-dead people are kept alive with special machines and medications. For example, doctors can put a tube down a person's throat and use a machine called a ventilator to pump oxygen into their lungs. While these machines can keep the person's other organs alive for a while, they cannot help the brain get better. Eventually, the person's other organs will stop working too.\n\nDoctors can diagnose brain death by examining the patient. They will check for reflexes which are controlled by the brainstem, and see if the person can breathe on their own. If the person is brain-dead, the doctor will find:\n\nBefore diagnosing brain death, doctors will check for any other problem that could look like brain death (for example, a very low body temperature, or an overdose of sedatives). They will usually wait six to 24 hours before checking again to make sure the person still has no signs of activity in the brain. Then a second doctor is called in to do the same tests. If both doctors agree, the patient can officially be diagnosed \"brain dead.\"\n\nSometimes, doctors use other tests which can diagnose brain death right away. These tests include:\n\nBrain death happens because of an injury to the entire brain.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531644", "text": "Interrogation\n\nInterrogation (also called questioning) generally means formally or informally interviewing a person who is suspected of committing a crime. Interrogations are used by military organizations, intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies worldwide. The goal of an interrogation is to gain needed information of some kind. The questioner in criminal and military interrogations is often an officer trained in different interrogation techniques. Depending on how they view the person being questioned or the purpose of the interrogation, the methods used may vary widely. For example:\n\nAn interrogation may often begin with several closed-ended questions. Examples would be \"are you comfortable\" or \"would you like a cigarette\"? The intent is for the interviewer to control the conversation and put the person being interrogated at ease. Let them think they are not in any trouble.\n\nNext may follow asking narrative questions to find out what the person knows about a subject. Next, the interrogator may ask direct questions. Throughout the interview interrogators may ask \"cross-questions\". These are the same question asked in different ways and at different times during the interview to see if the person being questioned answers them the same every time.\n\nA method taught to police interrogators since the 1970s is called the Reid technique. It was named for a Chicago police officer who developed it in the 1940s. It is widely used in North America because it gets confessions; sometimes false confessions. It is based on outdated psychology that maintains if a person shows stress they are lying. Unfortunately most people show stress when in stressful conditions. Suspects are questioned, often by teams of police officers. The Good cop/bad cop routine seen on police procedural shows is an example of the Reid technique. The police use this method to convince a suspect that confessing to the crime (whether they are guilty or not) is the best way out for the suspect. Many false confessions have been obtained this way resulting in false inprisonments.\n\nA police officer may stop and question a person at any time. They do not need to give a Miranda warning before informal questioning or before making an arrest. But any information gained this way is not admissible at a trial against the person. Miranda required advising a person of their rights before being question in police custody. If the person asks the officer if they are free to leave, they are not in custody. That is one of the few things a police officer may not lie about. During questioning police may use trickery, lying or other forms of deception in order to get a confession from a suspect. \n\nA fairly new technique is being used in the UK, Denmark, New Zealand and other places. The word PEACE is an acronym for Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure and Evaluate. It is considered a more ethical model of police questioning. It is intended to prevent wrongful convictions by eliminating any coercion or deceptive methods. When tested in England and Wales, it resulted in the same percentage of convictions as the older methods produced. Peace is more of a journalistic approach. It assumes a liar will find it increasingly difficult to keep all the lies consistent and will eventually break down and confess. \n\nA historic method of obtaining confessions is the applying of the so-called third degree. It consists of treating a suspect brutally, keeping them awake for long periods of time with no food or water. Beatings were given along with threats. Often a suspect confessed to stop the abuse. The suspect was then forced to sign a paper saying he was not intimidated or coerced into giving his statement. In 1937, the court threw out a confession upon learning it was not given voluntarily but the defendant had been hung from a tree and whipped until he confessed.\n\nEven though it is a serious breach of most international agreements, torture is still used by some police, military and intelligence services. Torture is prohibited under international law, but it is still used. In 2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee found that the Central Intelligence Agency tortured terror suspects. \n", "id": "531644", "title": "Interrogation"}

The village of Nixa incorporated on June 10, 1902.\n\nNixa is located at (37.045253, -93.298755). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The modern day city rests on and around seven hills.\n\nAll the schools in Nixa are public. Currently, the Nixa R-2 School District operates four elementary schools for students in kindergarten through fourth grade. These are Matthews, Espy, Century, and the newest, High Pointe Elementary (named so because it sits on the highest elevation in Christian County), opened in August 2007. There are also two intermediate schools for students in the fifth and sixth grades—Inman and Summit. There is one junior high school and one high school. There is also a magnet school for Kindergarten through 6th grade- John Thomas School of Discovery (JTSD). The old Main Street Elementary School building has become an administration building, named Faught Administration Center. The district is widely considered one of the best school districts in Missouri. The district has received the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's Distinction in Performance Award for each of the last five years. Its Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) scores surpassed state averages in all 10 assessments. Nixa High School is ranked one of the best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nIn the Robert Ludlum novels and movies (fiction), Nixa, Missouri is the birthplace of the character Jason Bourne. It was revealed in \"The Bourne Supremacy\" that Bourne's real name was David Webb and that he was born in Nixa, Missouri.\n\nSeveral streets in a neighborhood northeast of downtown are named for performers on ABC-TV's \"Ozark Jubilee\", including Nixa native Slim Wilson. They include Slim Wilson Boulevard, Red Foley Court, Zed Tennis Street, Bill Ring Court, (Speedy) Haworth Court and Ozark Jubilee Drive.\n\nA 2013 episode of the Investigation Discovery television series \"Beauty Queen Murder\" featured a murder in Nixa—the 1985 death of Jackie Johns. The murder was not solved until 2007, when DNA evidence proved that fellow Nixa resident Gerald Carnahan had raped and murdered the young lady.\n\n", "id": "531735", "title": "Nixa, Missouri"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531760", "text": "Undertale\n\nUndertale (also written as UNDERTALE) is a role-playing video game made by Toby Fox, an independent artist.\n\nIn the game, players control a human child who has fallen into the Underground, a large and out-of-the-way place under the top of the Earth, separated from the rest of the world by a magic wall. The player meets many kinds of monsters as they try to return to the surface, mainly through the fighting system; the player takes turns selecting actions and avoiding attacks made of many bullets, and can choose to make peace with monsters instead of attacking and killing them. The player's choices change many things in the game, including how characters act, and what kind of story it is.\n\nFox developed almost the whole game by himself; he wrote the words and made the music by himself, and only used a few pieces of extra art given to him by other artists. The game was inspired by the \"Mother\" and \"Mario & Luigi\" role-playing series, the \"bullet hell\" shooter series \"Touhou Project\", and the British comedy show \"Mr. Bean\". \"Undertale\" was originally meant to be two hours long and released in mid-2014, but creating the game took over three years, making the campaign longer and not making the game available until much later.\n\nThe game was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X on September 15, 2015. When it was released, the game was praised for its writing, themes, easy-to-learn fighting system, music, and original ideas; with praise directed towards its story, dialogue, and characters. The game sold over a million copies, and was nominated for many honors and awards, including Game of the Year from many gaming news sources, winning others from conventions including South by Southwest.\n\n\"Undertale\" is a role-playing game that shows everything from above. In the game, players control a child and finish tasks in order to go forward in the story. Players explore an underground world of towns and caves, and must solve many puzzles on the way. The underground world is the home of monsters, many of whom fight the player; players decide to kill, run away, or make friends with them.\n\nWhen players meet enemies in either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a small red heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks shot by the monster(s) in a way much like a bullet hell shooter. Deeper into the game, new types of gameplay are shown; these include colored bullets which harm players only while they are moving, or only while they are staying still, and boss battles which change the way players control the heart. Players may choose to attack the enemy, which involves timed button presses, earning EXP and gold for defeating them. Or instead, they can use the ACT option to do non-violent actions, which are different from enemy to enemy. If players uses the right actions to respond to the enemy, they can choose to spare them and end the fight without killing them. In order for some boss battles to be completed peacefully, the player must survive until the character they are facing has finished their dialogue. The game has many story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to kill or spare their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear the game without killing a single enemy.\n\nMonsters will talk with players during the battles, and the game will tell the players what the monster's feelings and actions are. Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: if the player chooses non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, but they become harder if players choose violent options. The game uses many metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players play in a boss battle more than once, the dialogue will change depending on actions from the times they played the battle before.\n\nSans- A short skeleton who enjoys telling a skele-TON of puns.

A \"ranking\" is the assignment of \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc. to different observations of a variable. A rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings.\n\nOne might test for \"do colleges with a higher-ranked basketball program tend to have a higher-ranked football program?\" A quite important question is \"do people with higher-ranked education tend to get higher levels of income?\"\n\nSome of the most used rank correlation statistics are\n\nAn increasing rank correlation coefficient implies increasing agreement between rankings. The coefficient is inside the interval [−1, 1] and assumes the value:\n\n\nDave Kerby recommended the rank-biserial as the measure to introduce students to rank correlation, because the general logic can be explained at an introductory level. \n\nKerby showed that this rank correlation can be expressed in terms of two figures: the percent of data that support a stated hypothesis, and the percent of data that do not support it. The Kerby simple difference formula states that the rank correlation can be expressed as the difference between the proportion of favorable evidence (\"f\") minus the proportion of unfavorable evidence (\"u\"). \n\nSuppose a coach trains long-distance runners for one month using two methods. Group A has 5 runners, and Group B has 4 runners. The hypothesis is that method A produces faster runners. The race to assess the results finds that the runners from Group A do indeed run faster, with the following ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The slower runners from Group B thus have ranks of 5, 7, 8, and 9. \n\nThe analysis is done on pairs, a member of one group compared to a member of the other group. For example, the fastest runner in the study is a member of four pairs: (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). All four of these pairs support the hypothesis, because in each pair the runner from Group A is faster than the runner from Group B. There are a total of 20 pairs, and 19 pairs support the hypothesis. The only pair which does not support the hypothesis are the two runners with ranks 5 and 6, because in this pair, the runner from Group B had the faster time. By the Kerby simple difference formula, 95% of the data support the hypothesis (19 of 20 pairs), and 5% do not support (1 of 20 pairs), so the rank correlation is r = .95 - .05 = .90.\n\nThe maximum value for the correlation is r = 1, which means that 100% of the pairs favor the hypothesis. A correlation of r = 0 indicates that half the pairs favor the hypothesis and half do not. An effect size of r = 0 describes \"no relationship\" between group membership and the members' ranks.\n", "id": "531764", "title": "Rank correlation"}

While investigating a shooting, the officer moved—without probable cause—stereo equipment to record the serial numbers. They also seized three weapons and a stocking-cap mask.

It is used by law enforcement to take actions such as searching for evidence, making an arrest or seizing property.\n\nIn the United States, in order for police and other law enforcement personnel to search for evidence, they need a warrant. They must also have probable cause (a good reason to believe they will find evidence of a crime). A search warrant must be signed by a judge or magistrate. The officer must provide a sworn statement of fact called an affidavit. If the judge or magistrate believes the affidavit establishes probable cause, he or she approves the warrant. A warrant is usually for a specific period of time and spells out exactly what the officers may search for and seize.\n\nIn many cases an arrest warrant is not needed. If a police officer personally sees someone committing a crime, the officer may arrest that individual without a warrant. An officer may also arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe the person had committed or were about to commit a crime. For example, a police officer is notified a bank has just been robbed and is given a description of the suspect. The single robber left in a dark blue Ford Mustang. The officer stops a dark blue Ford Mustang with bags of money on the back seat (in plain sight) and the driver matches the description. The officer believes he has probable cause and arrests the driver. \n\nIf the person is in his (or her) own home and the crime is not a serious one, an officer needs an arrest warrant.\n\nIn the European Union a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is most often used between member countries in place of a lengthy extradition process.

They can detain the person for up to 48 hours. The police are required to inform the person why they were arrested. During the 48 hour period, the person may be brought before a prosecutor if the police have enough evidence. If the prosecutor believes the evidence is enough, they request a warrant of detention before a judge within 24 hours. The defendant appears before the judge when the warrant is requested.

For example, brain injuries can happen before a baby is even born. These are called congenital brain injuries.\n\nA physical injury (trauma) can also hurt the brain (for example, if a person hits their head in a car accident). These types of brain injuries are called traumatic brain injuries. \n\nMany medical problems can also injure the brain. For example, the brain can get injured if it does not get enough oxygen (for example, during a stroke).\n\nAll brain injuries are different. Some are mild (not very bad); some are severe (very bad). Some are temporary (they get better); some get better slowly over time; and some never get better. Also, since the brain controls every part of the body, the symptoms of brain injury can be very different for different people. This depends partly on what part of the brain was injured, and how badly.\n\nCongenital brain injuries are caused by something that damages a fetus's brain during a woman's pregnancy.\n\nFor example, a fetus can get a congenital brain injury if:\n\nTraumatic brain injuries (TBI) are caused by a physical injury to the brain. They can happen when the head suddenly hits an object very hard, like in a car accident. They can also happen when something - like a bullet or knife - goes through the head and into the brain.\n\nTraumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of disability everywhere in the world. It is more common in developing countries. All over the world, about 10 million people are affected by TBI every year.\n\nExperts estimate that the most common causes of TBI in the world are:\n\nWar and violence are often much more common causes of TBI in certain parts of the world.

The United States Department of Defense says that 22% of all injuries from these wars are traumatic brain injuries.\n\nSome traumatic brain injuries are mild and can get better with time, like a concussion. Others are more serious, especially if they cause bleeding or swelling in the brain.\n\nAnother major type of brain injury is a hypoxic brain injury. This happens when the brain does not get enough oxygen. This can happen for many reasons, like:\n\nThe brain can also be injured by many other things. Some examples are:\n\nThe signs and symptoms of a brain injury depend on many things.\n\nA \"diffuse\" injury hurts the entire brain. For example, if a person is drowning, and cannot breathe, no part of their brain will get oxygen. If this lasts long enough, the entire brain will be injured by not having enough oxygen.\n\nA \"focal\" injury hurts just part of the brain. For example, in some strokes, a person has a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to just part of their brain. If the person gets good medical treatment, just that part of their brain may be injured.\n\nThis is important because different parts of the brain control different things. When a person has a focal brain injury, their symptoms will depend on what part of the brain was injured. For example, if a part of the brain that controls speech was injured, the person may have trouble speaking.\n\nA brain injury's symptoms may also depend on how bad the injury was. \n\nFor example, brain injuries can cause changes or problems in a person's thinking, senses, feelings, or ability to move. However, some people might have mild problems in these areas, while other people might have more serious problems:\n\n\nThere are many different treatments that may help people with brain injuries.

The amniotic sac is filled with amniotic fluid, which protects the fetus. \n\nThe amniotic sac starts to form and fill with amniotic fluid just days after a woman gets pregnant. At first, the amniotic fluid is made from the mother's plasma (the liquid part of her blood).\n\nAt first, the amniotic fluid is made mostly of water with electrolytes (salts). However, by the 12th to the 14th week of pregnancy, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, phospholipids, and urea are all in the amniotic fluid. These things help the fetus grow.\n\nAs the fetus gets bigger, more amniotic fluid gets created. By the time the baby is born, there is about one liter of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac.\n\nThe amniotic fluid is very important in protecting the fetus and helping the fetus grow:\n\nAfter the fetus is about four months old, when the kidneys start to work, the amniotic fluid serves another important purpose. The fetus swallows amniotic fluid. This fluid passes through the fetus's digestive system and urinary system and gets urinated out into the amniotic fluid. This helps the fetus \"practice\" swallowing, digesting, and urinating before being born.\n\nThe amniotic sac has two layers, which have two different jobs. The inside layer holds in the fetus and the amniotic fluid. The outside layer attaches to the umbilical cord, so that blood and oxygen from the mother can get through the amniotic sac and to the fetus.\n\nA sample of amniotic fluid can show whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or infections. A test called an amniocentesis can take a sample of amniotic fluid with a needle and study it for problems.\n\nWhen a woman starts to give birth, the amniotic sac should break and the amniotic fluid will leak out the woman's vagina. This is often called the time when a woman's \"water breaks.\" Doctors call it \"rupture of membranes.\"\n\nOnce the baby is born, the amniotic sac is pushed out of the woman's vagina in the afterbirth, along with the placenta.\n", "id": "531858", "title": "Amniotic sac"}

The United States Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment may not be used at trial in a state court.\n\nOn May 23, 1957, in Cleveland, Ohio, three police officers arrived at the home of a Miss Mapp, the appellant. The officers said they had information a bombing suspect was in the house and demanded entry. After telephoning her attorney, she refused to admit them without a search warrant. The officers watched the house until more officers arrived. Three hours later and with four more police officers, they again demanded entrance to the home. When Mapp did not come to the door immediately, a door was forced open and the police entered. At about the same time, Mapp's attorney arrived, but was refused permission to see his client or to enter the home. When Mapp was halfway down the stairs she demanded to see the search warrant. A piece of paper was flashed at her which she grabbed and hid on her person. The officers grabbed her to physically recover the paper. The paper was not a warrant. The police did not find the bombing suspect. However, they did find books and photographs they said were sexually explicit. At trial, the prosecution did not produce a search warrant or prove one was ever issued. Mapp was convicted of violating Ohio state law prohibiting “lewd, lascivious, or obscene material.” She was sentenced to one to seven years in prison. Mapp appealed the conviction based on her First Amendment rights.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio heard the case. The court believed an argument could be made for reversing the case because of the way the evidence was obtained. But they did not determine the evidence was taken from Mapp's person by the use of brutalforce against the defendant. They added that even if the search was made without authority, it could be used at the state trial. They ruled the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence gained by unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore, her appeal was denied. \n\nIn their decision, the court ruled in favor of Mapp and overturned her conviction. In the 6-3 decision, the court found the states were also required to exclude evidence seized in violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights. They stated that any evidence obtained in searches and seizures that violated the Constitution were not admissible in state courts. Otherwise, there would be no right against unreasonable search and seizure. Associate justice Tom C. Clark delivered the majority opinion.\n\n", "id": "531878", "title": "Mapp v. Ohio"}

Unlike a regular bank, they do not typically lend their own money or use their own money to purchase part or all of a business, but instead they help to match the business financing need to those other business and personal investors who are seeking to earn money by either lending to the business or owning part of the business.\n\nIn the mid twentieth century, certain investment banks started to also try and help their business clients to sell their business entirely to other businesses instead of to investors, as well as to help businesses decide what other business they should buy, in exchange for a fee based on the sale price of the business. This activity became known as Mergers and Acquisitions and today falls into the category of investment banking. In fact, there are many small investment banks that only offer this activity, and do not help businesses to borrow money or sell ownership in the business. \n\nAn investment bank most often helps businesses to borrow money using a form of a contract known as a bond, and to sell ownership in the company using a contract known as stock. Most countries have developed government rules that in exchange for requirements that the business operate in a certain manner and disclose their financial results in a certain manner, they are then allowed to borrow money using bonds and sell ownership using stock to the general public, and the general public is allowed to sell bonds and stock to other members of the public without being responsible for the operations and financial disclosures of the business. When a business operates under these rules it is known as a Publicly Traded Company. Those business owners who agree to follow the rules and regulations required to make their business a publicly traded company do so because they believe they can either borrow money more favorably or receive a higher price from the sale of part or all of their business because of the larger amount of individuals and/or businesses who can lend or purchase the business ownership when the business is publicly traded. This public trading system was originally started in the 1600's when a business was formed in Holland with the goal of building a fleet of ships to buy and sell spice from other countries for a profit. Since the cost to start this business was much more than any one individual was willing to risk, many individuals invested in the business using stock. Today however, except in the case of businesses that attempt to discover new medicines, most businesses that choose to sell stock are not brand new businesses but those that have been in business for a while, and where the owners either desire to sell ownership to receive money to be used in the business to further expand the business, or to receive money themselves as a profit to their original investment. \n\nSome reasons that a business might choose to borrow money from investors instead of a bank may include the following:\n\n\nSome reasons that a business owner would agree to use an investment bank to sell part or all of their business to other investors include the following:\n\nInvestment Banks therefore work with two kinds of customers, one being the businesses/governments which desire to borrow funds or sell ownership, and the individuals and other businesses who want to earn a profit on their money by lending to or owning other businesses. As mentioned above, in a publicly traded company, people who have lent money in the form of bonds or purchased ownership in the form of stock can sell those stocks and bonds to other people. However, since at any given time only a relatively small amount of people/businesses might be looking to purchase stocks or bonds on any given day, in certain cases an Investment Bank might choose to purchase the stock or bonds from one individual with the intention of selling the stock and bond to another individual at a later date. The primary reason investment banks do this is to encourage people/businesses to continue to invest in stocks and bonds in the future by allowing them to realize one of the main benefits of doing so, namely that they can sell their stocks and bonds to others relatively quickly in order to receive some or all of their investment back. Without investment banks willing to buy stocks but especially bonds in this way, it might take a lot longer for someone to sell their stocks/bonds when they wish to (a difference between minutes and days or weeks for example). This activity of investment banks is called making a market. When an investment bank purchases a stock or bond from a customer, there is a risk that the stock/bond can lose value before they can sell it to another customer, and therefore banks use various strategies to try and protect themselves against this risk. Over time, banks began expanding how they invested their funds into stocks and bonds from just making a market, to trying new strategies unrelated to making a market in order to make a profit. This activity is known as proprietary trading. New rules passed since the 2008 subprime financial crisis however have limited proprietary trading an investment bank can do.\n", "id": "532017", "title": "Investment bank"}

It passes by 16 places that are important to American history. The Trail is 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long. It starts at the Boston Common and ends at the USS \"Constitution\" in the Charlestown Navy Yard.\n\nThe Black Heritage Trail crosses the Freedom Trail between the Massachusetts State House and Park Street Church.\n\nWilliam Schofield, a journalist in Boston, first thought of creating the Freedom Trail. In 1951, he suggested building a walking trail to connect many of the important historic places in Boston. Boston's mayor, John Hynes, agreed. The Trail was marked with red bricks and red paint, and signs were added along the way to explain the importance of the Trail's 16 stops. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the Freedom Trail every year.\n\nThe City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission is in charge of the Trail. The costs of keeping up the Trail are supported by grants from non-profit organizations and foundations; philanthropy; donations; and Boston National Historical Park.\n\nThe Boston Common is America's oldest public park. When the Puritans came to Boston, they bought the land from William Blackstone, who was the first European person to settle in Boston. The Puritans turned the land into a \"Common Area\" where people could bring their cows to eat grass. \n\nThe Common was also used to punish and hang people.\n\nIn 1775, when the British Army occupied Boston just before the American Revolution started, over 1,000 British soldiers camped and trained on the Common.\n\nThe Common has also been used for many other things, including:\n\nThe State House is where the Massachusetts state government does business. It was built in 1798 on land that used to be John Hancock's cow pasture. It is topped by a big dome which Paul Revere coated with golden copper.\n\nOn the way from the Common to the State House, the Trail passes a monument to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. This was the first all-black volunteer regiment in the American Civil War.\n\nBuilt in 1809, Park Street Church was once the tallest building in Boston. The Church became an important supporter of the abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement. On Independence Day in 1829, William Lloyd Garrison made his first major speech against slavery at the Church.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, the Church's members stored brimstone (which is used to make gunpowder) in the Church's basement.\n\nGranary Burying Ground is a very old cemetery, created in 1660. Many important people are buried here, including:\n\nMany other Bostonians are also buried here.\n\nKing's Chapel was the first Anglican church in Boston. It was built in 1688, on land that was part of a burying ground (cemetery). At that time, most people in Boston were Puritans. King James II, who wanted the colonists to follow the Church of England, ordered that an Anglican parish should be built in Boston. However, nobody in Boston would sell good land to build a non-Puritan church. Because of this, the King ruled that a piece of burying ground would be taken and used for the church.\n\nKing's Chapel Burying Ground was Boston's first cemetery. (It was created before King's Chapel.) Many important Bostonians were buried here, including:\n\nBoston Latin School was the first public school in America. It opened on April 23, 1635. Boys could go to school there for free, whether they were rich or poor. (Girls were taught at home.) Five signers of the Declaration of Independence went to school at Boston Latin:\n\nThe original Boston Latin School was torn down in 1745, but a statue of Benjamin Franklin marks the spot where the original school was. Boston Latin School still exists today in a different place (and now teaches both boys and girls).\n\nThe Old Corner Bookstore is the oldest business building in Boston. It was built in 1718 as an apothecary shop. \n\nBefore it became a business, Anne Hutchinson lived in this building. She used to hold religious meetings in her home, where she would read scripture. Sometimes as many as 80 people would come to the meetings. This was more than 10% of Boston's population at the time. Eventually Hutchinson was accused of heresy for preaching without being a preacher. (At that time, no women were allowed to be preachers, and Hutchinson's ideas also disagreed with the Puritans'.) Hutchinson was excommunicated and exiled to Rhode Island in 1638.\n\nIn the 1800s, the Old Corner Bookstore was one of the United States' most important book publishing companies. It published books written by many famous authors, who would also meet at the Bookstore. These authors included:\n\nThe Old South Meeting House was built in 1729 so that Puritans could meet there to pray. Benjamin Franklin was baptized here. The church's famous members included:\nSome of the events that led up to the American Revolutionary War happened at Old South Church. For example, five thousand people met at Old South Meeting House just before the Boston Tea Party in 1773. They were trying to decide what to do with the tea that was waiting on ships in Boston Harbor. After the British passed the Tea Act, Bostonians would have to pay taxes on the tea even though they had no say in whether the taxes were fair or not. They tried to have the tea sent back to England, but they were unable to. After this, Samuel Adams got up and said, \"This meeting can do nothing more to save the country.\" This was a secret signal to tell the Sons of Liberty to go destroy the tea. This is how the Boston Tea Party started.\n\nSeveral years later, when British soldiers were occupying Boston, they got revenge on Old South Church for its role in the Boston Tea Party. They ripped out the church's pews (benches) and turned the church into a horse stable. They used Old South Church to teach British cavalry soldiers how to ride horses. After the Revolutionary War was over, in 1783, the church's members fixed the building up into a church again.\n\nThe Irish Potato Famine memorial statue is on the way to the Old South Meeting House. During the Irish Potato Famine, over one million Irish people died. Another million Irish people immigrated to the United States, mostly to Boston. The statue shows a family that was dying of starvation, who became strong and healthy again after moving to Boston.\n\nThe Old State House was built in 1713. The Massachusetts Bay Colony's colonial government worked there. The Old State House was very important in starting the American Revolution. In 1768, the colony's House of Representatives decided that people in Massachusetts should refuse to pay taxes to the British. The British decided to get rid of the colony's legislature, and also sent soldiers to occupy Boston.\n\nIn 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read to the people of Boston for the first time from the balcony of the Old State House.\n\nThe Boston Massacre happened just in front of the Old State House, in 1770. After British soldiers occupied Boston, many people in Boston got angrier and angrier. On March 5, 1770, an angry mob of Bostonians surrounded British soldiers. Somebody yelled \"fire,\" and the British soldiers started shooting their guns. Five Bostonians were killed.\n\nAfter news about the Boston Massacre spread throughout the Thirteen Colonies, people became angrier at the British. The Boston Massacre made more people want to fight the British for independence.\n\nA rich merchant named Peter Faneuil built Faneuil Hall in 1741. He meant Faneuil Hall to be a place for trade and business. However, it became an important meeting place for people who wanted to fight against British rule. The Sons of Liberty met there and announced that they would fight back against the British. Leaders like Samuel Adams gave speeches there encouraging independence.\n\nAmerica's first town meeting was held at Faneuil Hall. Americans first met there in 1764 to protest the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act. Later, they would meet there to protest the Tea Act, the Townshend Duties, and the British occupation of Boston.\n\nOn top of Faneuil Hall, there is a famous weathervane (which tells which way the wind is blowing). It is shaped like a golden grasshopper. Legend says that Bostonians used this weathervane during the War of 1812 to find spies. If a person did not know the answer to the question \"What is on top of Faneuil Hall?\", they were suspected of being a spy.\n\nIn the 19th century, abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Lucy Stone spoke against slavery at Faneuil Hall.\n\nThe Paul Revere house is the oldest building in downtown Boston that is still standing. It was built around 1680. Revere bought it in 1770. He lived here when he made his famous \"Midnight Ride\".\n\nThe Old North Church is the oldest church in Boston that is still standing. This Episcopal church opened in 1723. The first bells ever brought to America were put in its steeple.\n\nBecause the steeple was the tallest in Boston at the time, it played an important role just before the American Revolution started. Just before the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the Revolution, the British had two choices for how they could get to Lexington and Concord. They could walk, or they could row across the Charles River. The Sons of Liberty hung two lanterns in the church's steeple to signal that British soldiers were crossing the Charles River. This helped the Americans figure out the best way to defend against the British.\n\nCopp's Hill Burying Ground was the largest cemetery in colonial Boston. It was created in 1659. Famous people who are buried here include:\n\nBritish soldiers put their cannons at Copp's Hill Burying Ground during the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\nThe Bunker Hill Monument honors the Battle of Bunker Hill. This was the first major battle of the American Revolution. Though the British won this battle, it was so difficult for them to win that the battle proved the Americans would not be easy to beat.\n\nUntil May 2015, the USS \"Constitution\" was the oldest warship in the world that still floated. It was first put into the water in 1797. The \"Constitution\" became famous during the War of 1812. The ship got the nickname \"Old Ironsides\" because cannonballs would bounce off the wooden sides of the ship like they were made of iron.\n\nThe \"Constitution\" is still a United States Navy warship.\n\n\n", "id": "532089", "title": "Freedom Trail"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532197", "text": "Exsanguination\n\nExsanguination is losing enough blood to cause death. A person does not have to lose all of their blood to exsanguinate. People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood. \n\nThe average adult has about 5 to 6 liters of blood in their body (women, and people who weigh more, have more blood). This means a person can die from losing 2 / to 4 liters of blood. To compare, this is five to eight times as much blood as people usually give in a blood donation.\n\nChildren and babies have much less blood than adults, and can exsanguinate by losing much less blood than adults.\n\nExsanguination is often called bleeding to death or bleeding out. It is a medical emergency.\nDoctors define exsanguination this way:\n\nBleeding can be \"external\" or \"internal\".\n\n\"External\" means \"outside the body.\" External bleeding is visible - it can be seen outside the body. For example, a person who cuts their hand and has blood on their hand is having external bleeding.\n\n\"Internal\" means \"inside the body.\" Internal bleeding cannot be seen, because it is inside the body. For example, a person who is bleeding into their brain because of a stroke is having internal bleeding.\n\nSometimes, bleeding can be both internal and external. A person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding, external bleeding, or both.\n\nExsanguination is usually caused by major blood vessels getting injured or breaking open. Smaller blood vessels bleed less, and bleed slower, so it is harder to exsanguinate if they are injured.\n\nExsanguination can be caused by trauma (injuries). Out of everyone who dies from injuries, 30-40% die from exsanguination. Up to half of these people (33-56%) die before they even get to the hospital.\n\nPenetrating trauma (an injury where something breaks the skin) is one of the most common causes of exsanguination. This is especially true for gunshot wounds to places like the heart, chest, or head, which all have major blood vessels in them.\n\nOther injuries that can cause exsanguination include:\n\nA person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding if:\n\nExsanguination is one of the most common causes of death in soldiers at war. It is usually caused by gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents, or explosions.\n\nSome medical problems can make a person exsanguinate by bleeding internally. These problems include:\n\nIf a person is losing blood very quickly (for example, from a broken aortic aneurysm), they will only be conscious for 20 seconds to a few minutes. If blood loss is slower, and the person does not get medical treatment, they may be conscious for a few hours. However, they will get more and more confused and tired as they lose more blood. Eventually the person will go into a coma because there is not enough blood left in their body to bring oxygen to their brain. Finally their heart will stop and they will die.\n\nDoctors call exsanguination a syndrome (a group of symptoms), because it causes so many problems in the body.\n\nBlood helps keep us warm. Because of this, losing a lot of blood causes hypothermia.\n\nCoagulopathy means that the blood no longer clots normally. When a person loses blood, they also lose the platelets and blood-clotting proteins the blood carried. These platelets and proteins make the blood clot. If a person loses too much blood, they will not have enough platelets or proteins left to make the blood clot.\n\nAcidosis means that the body makes too much acid. Usually, the body makes energy out of oxygen (carried in blood) and glucose (sugar). (This is called aerobic respiration.) If a person loses a lot of blood, there will not be enough oxygen in the blood that is left to make energy this way. The body switches to anaerobic respiration, and makes energy out of glucose without needing oxygen. However, this creates many acidic waste products (chemicals that the body does not need, which are left over after the body does chemical reactions). Eventually these waste products can build up so much that they poison the body. This is called acidosis.\n\nWhen the heart does not get enough blood, it can start beating in ways that are not normal. When this happens because of exsanguination, it usually means that the patient is close to dying.\n\nIf a person loses enough blood, they will go into shock. This means the body's most important organs are not getting the blood, oxygen, and nutrients they need to survive. It also means that the body is not able to get rid of waste products, like acids. If shock gets bad enough, it will kill the person.\n\nFirst aid is an important first step in treating exsanguination. Things that regular people can do to help include:\n\nIf possible, a person giving first aid should wear gloves any time they touch another person's blood. The sick or injured person may have an infection that can be spread through blood, like HIV or hepatitis. Wearing gloves will protect the person giving first aid from getting these infections.\n\nFirst aid saved many lives during the Boston Marathon bombings, when ordinary people used belts for tourniquets or used their own hands to press against bleeding wounds. The three people who died in the bombings died right away. There were many other people who were hurt badly enough that they could have exsanguinated. For example, some people's legs were blown off by the bombs. However, because of the help of ordinary people giving first aid (and because of emergency medical services), everyone who did not die right away survived.\nEmergency medical treatments for exsanguination include:\n\nThere are some risk factors which make a person more likely to exsanguinate. A few examples are:\n\nWhen a person is exsanguinating, they are more likely to die if:\n", "id": "532197", "title": "Exsanguination"}

This amendment codifies the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases. It also stops courts from overturning a jury's verdict. The Seventh Amendment's provision for jury trials in civil cases has never been incorporated (applied to the states). However, the rights to civil jury trials are found in nearly every state constitution.\n\nThe prohibition of overturning a jury's verdict applies to federal cases, state cases involving federal law, and to review of state cases by federal courts. \"United States v. Wonson\" (1812) established the \"historical test\", which interpreted the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil lawsuit. The amendment thus does not guarantee trial by jury in cases under maritime law, in lawsuits against the government itself, and for many parts of patent claims. In all other cases, the jury can be waived by consent of the parties. The amendment also guarantees a minimum of six members for a jury in a civil trial. \n\nThe 7th Amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791 as one of ten amendments in the Bill of Rights. But the background for its passing began in England during the 12th century. At the time juries were made up of 12 men who gave their opinions in a trial. The 12-man jury originally included the accusers against the defendant, a supposed enemy of the king. Eventually this led to a system where the jury made a verdict based on evidence. The practice followed English colonists to the American colonies. But juries became a tool used to express American discontent with British rule. A series of Navigation Acts prohibited the American colonies from trading directly with the Netherlands, Spain, France, and their colonies. As more and more trade restriction were imposed, the American colonists turned to smuggling. When smugglers were caught, they were brought before juries made up of other colonists. These sympathetic juries often acquitted their fellow colonists. The king, angered at these lawbreakers going free, created new courts that did not allow juries. This was a breach of common law practice and infringed on their rights as British citizens. After the American Revolutionary War, the Seventh Amendment was written to expressly limit the powers of the executive and the Judicial branches of the new federal government.\n", "id": "532230", "title": "Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

Many illegal drugs and medications can be given intravenously.\nDrugs and medications work very fast when given intravenously, because they go right into the bloodstream. They reach the brain and start working in a minute or less. Also, when a drug is given intravenously, 100% of the drug gets into the bloodstream.\n\nWhen medications are given in other ways, they do not work as fast. Also, not all of the drug reaches the bloodstream.\n\nHowever, medications given by IV do not last as long as medicines given by mouth As soon as the drug reaches the bloodstream, the body begins to break it down so the body can get rid of it.\n\nThere are two types of intravenous injections.\n\nSometimes, people inject just one drug into a vein with a needle. Then they take the needle out. \n\nWhen people use illegal drugs like heroin intravenously, they use a single injection. They shoot the drug into their veins, and then take the needle out.\n\nThe second type of IV injection is called an \"intravenous (IV) line.\" This is usually what medical professionals mean when they say a patient is getting an IV. \n\nTo do an IV line, a medical professional will:\n\nAn IV line allows medical professionals to give different liquids at different times, without having to put a needle into a vein every time. They can also give many medications at the same time.\n\nIntravenous lines are often used in emergency medicine. Many things can be given through an IV line.\n\nVolume expanders are special fluids that are used when a person has lost some of the fluids in their body. For example, a person might lose fluids because of dehydration or bleeding. Volume expanders are used to replace these lost fluids. They are called \"volume expanders\" because they expand (increase) the volume of liquid in the bloodstream.\n\nLosing too much fluid is dangerous. People need liquid in their bloodstream to carry blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things. Usually, the blood plasma (the liquid part of blood) does this job. However, people can lose plasma for several reasons. For example:\n\nVolume expanders add to the amount of liquid in the bloodstream. They help plasma do its job.\n\nThere are a few common volume expanders. They are mixtures of liquids and other things the body loses when a person loses fluid:\n\nMany medications can be given by IV. They can be given by themselves, or mixed into volume expanders.\n\nExamples of medications that can be given by IV include:\n\nBlood transfusions are usually given through an IV line. A blood transfusion can give a person regular blood, or only parts of the blood, like:\n\nIf a person cannot eat for a short time, nutrition can be given through an IV line. IV nutrition mixtures include water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, lipids (fats), and vitamins.\n\nIntravenous drug use means injecting illegal drugs into a vein. Illegal drugs that can be injected intravenously include:\nSometimes, people also dissolve prescription medications in water and inject them intravenously. For example, some people dissolve oxycodone or benzodiazepines and inject them.\n\nPeople use drugs intravenously because it is one of the fastest ways to get the effects of the drug. When a person uses drugs intravenously, the drugs start working within 15 to 30 seconds.\n\nUsing drugs intravenously can cause many problems.\n\nIf a person uses a needle that is not clean to inject drugs, they can get an infection. Common infections caused by IV drug use include:\n\nAn IV drug user can also get some infectious diseases by using the same needles as people who have those diseases. HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and many other infections can be spread by sharing needles.\n\nIn the world, 40-60% of IV drug users have hepatitis B, and 60-70% have hepatitis C.\n\nPeople are more likely to overdose when they use drugs intravenously. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nWhen an IV drug user injects drugs into their veins over and over again, they can damage their veins. The veins can get scarred and eventually collapse.

The word \"flautist\" is used, but much less often.\n\nThere are many stories about how different Native American peoples invented the Native American flute.\nIn one story, a woodpecker pecked holes in the branch of a tree while searching for termites.\nWhen the wind blew along the holes, people heard music.\n\nIt is not well known how the design of the Native American flute developed before 1823.\nSome of the influences may have been:\nIt is also possible that instruments were carried from other cultures during migrations.\n\nThe oldest Native American flute made of wood is from 1823. It is now in a museum in Bergamo, Italy.\n\nThe Native American flute has two parts:\nthe \"slow air chamber\" and the \"sound chamber\".\nA \"plug\" inside the instrument separates the slow air chamber from the sound chamber.\n\nThe parts of the Native American flute can have many alternate names.\nThe plug is sometimes called the \"internal wall\".\nThe slow air chamber is also called the \"SAC\", the \"compression chamber\", or the \"mouth chamber\".\nThe sound chamber is also called the \"pipe body\",\nthe \"playing chamber\", the \"resonating chamber\", the \"tone chamber\", or the \"variable tube\".\n\nThe \"block\" on the outside of the instrument is a separate part that can be removed.\nThe block is also called the \"bird\", the \"fetish\", the \"saddle\", or the \"totem\".\nThe block is tied by a \"strap\" onto the \"nest\" of the flute.\nThe block moves air through a \"flue\" from the slow air chamber to the sound chamber.\nThe block is often in the shape of a bird.\n\nThe slow air chamber has a \"mouthpiece\" and \"breath hole\" for the player's breath.\nAir flows through the slow air chamber and up the \"exit hole\" into the flue.\nThe sound chamber contains the \"sound hole\", which creates the vibration of air that causes sound when the airflow\nreaches the \"splitting edge\".\nThe sound hole can also be called the \"whistle hole\", the \"window\", or the \"true sound hole\" (\"TSH\").\nThe splitting edge can also be called the \"cutting edge\", the \"fipple edge\", the \"labium\", or the \"sound edge\".\n\nThe sound chamber also has \"finger holes\" that allows the player to change the\nfrequency of the vibrating air.\nChanging the frequency of the vibration changes the pitch of the sound produced.\n\nThe finger holes on a Native American flute are \"open\", meaning that fingers of the player cover the finger hole\n(rather than metal levers or pads such as those on a clarinet).\nThis means that the player must be able to reach all the finger holes on the instrument with their fingers.\nThe finger holes can also be called the \"note holes\", the \"playing holes\", the \"tone holes\", or the \"stops\".\n\nThe \"foot end\" of the flute — the end far away from the player's mouth — can have \"direction holes\".\nThese holes affect the pitch of the flute when all the finger holes are covered.\nThey also relate to the \"Four Directions\" of\nEast, South, West, and North found in many Native American stories.\nThe direction holes can also be called the \"tuning holes\" or \"wind holes\".\n\nThe picture shown above\n– \"Parts of the Native American flute\" with\ncan also be seen with labels in\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\n\nAnother way to build Native American flutes uses a \"spacer plate\" to create the flue.\nThe spacer plate sits between the nest area on the body of the flute and the block.\nThe spacer player is usually held in place by the same strap that holds the block onto the instrument.\nThe splitting edge can also be part of the spacer plate.\n\nThe spacer plate is often made of metal, but spacer plates can be made of wood, bark, and ceramic.\n\nMany old Native American flutes were made using measurements of the body.\nThe length of the flute was the distance from inside of the elbow to tip of the index finger.\nThe length of the slow air chamber was the width of the fist.\nThe distance between the sound hole and first finger hole was the width of the fist.\nThe distance between finger holes would be the width of a thumb.\nThe distance from the last finger hole to the end of the flute was the width of the fist.\n\nCurrently, makers of Native American flutes use many methods to design the dimensions of their flutes.\nThis is very important for the location of the finger holes, since they control the pitch of the different notes of the instrument.\nFlute makers may use calculators to design their instruments,\nor use dimensions provided by other flute makers.\n\nMany Native American flutes are made from river cane, bamboo, wood,\nor even plastic. Some makers of Native American flutes use ceramic or glass.\n\nMany Native American flutes have a musical scale called the pentatonic scale\nin a minor key.\nThis musical scale is used in most Native American flute music.\nHowever, some makers of Native American flute now use different musical scales.\nAlso, many makers of Native American flutes tune flutes carefully so that they\nsound good when played with other instruments such as guitars and pianos.\n\nNative American flutes may be large or small and have a wide range from very low notes to very high notes.\nFrom the largest flutes (lowest pitch) to the smallest flutes (highest pitch),\nthey span a range of about three and a half octaves,\nfrom C to A.\n\nEarly recordings of Native American flutes are available from several sources.\nMost Native American flutes have either five finger holes or six finger holes.\nHowever, a flute may have no finger holes or as many as seven finger holes, including a hole for the thumb.\nDifferent makers employ different musical scales and fingerings for their flutes.\n\nWritten music for the Native American flutes is often in the key of F-sharp minor, although some music is scored in other keys.\nHowever, music written for the Native American flute uses a key signature of four sharps.\nThis is known as \"Nakai tablature\".\nMany pieces of written music adds finger diagrams below the notes to show which finger holes to cover for that note.\n\nThe use of a standard key signature for written music that can be used across Native American flutes in a variety of keys classifies the instrument as a transposing instrument.\n\nThere were few Native American flute players before 1960.\nHowever, use of the Native American flute increased in the late 1960s.\nMany people began playing Native American flutes, such as Doc Tate Nevaquaya,\nJohn Rainer, Jr.,\nSky Walkinstik Man Alone, and\nCarl Running Deer.\n\nThe music of R. Carlos Nakai became popular in the 1980s.\nThe album \"Canyon Trilogy\" was issued in 1989.\nIn 1998 it was the first Native American music album certified as a Gold Record\nby the Recording Industry Association of America.\nCanyon Trilogy was certified as a Platinum Record\non July 8, 2014.\n\nMary Youngblood won two Grammy Awards in the \"Native American Music\" category for her Native American flute music\nin 2002 and 2006.\nToday, Native American flutes are being played and recognized by many different peoples and cultures around the world.\n\nGroups of players of the Native American flute meet every month or two.\nThese groups are known as \"flute circles\".\n\nThese organizations help flute circles within their country:\n\n\n\n", "id": "532293", "title": "Native American flute"}

The test, first developed in the late 19th century, is widely used in American constitutional law. In short, the Undue Burden standard says the legislature cannot make a particular law that is too burdensome or restrictive of one's fundamental rights.\n\nOne use of the standard was in \"Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia,\" 328 U.S. 373 (1946). In a 7-to-1 ruling, Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed fashioned an \"undue burden\" test to decide the constitutionality of a Virginia law requiring separate but equal racial segregation in public transportation. \"There is a recognized abstract principle, however, that may be taken as a postulate for testing whether particular state legislation in the absence of action by Congress is beyond state power. This is that the state legislation is invalid if it unduly burdens that commerce in matters where uniformity is necessary—necessary in the constitutional sense of useful in accomplishing a permitted purpose.\"\n\nMore recently, the standard has been used in cases involving state restrictions on a woman's access to abortion. The standard was applied by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in her dissent in \"City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,\" 462 US 416 (1983).

He has been using a traditional farming technique called Zaï to help soil damaged by drought. He is notable for spreading an improved soil and water conservation practice in Burkina Faso.\n\nHe went to a religious school where the students often didn't have enough to eat. Since he was the smallest and youngest, he was the one who had to go without.\n\nThe northern parts of Burkina Faso are very dry and often have droughts. The most recent big drought in happened in the 1970s, resulting in a famine (lack of food) which killed a lot of people.\n\nThe drought caused a lot of desertification. There were also other problems like overgrazing, bad land management, and overpopulation. These problems meant that a lot of land couldn't be used to grow food. \n\nTogether with Mathieu Ouédraogo, another local farmer, Yacouba Sawadogo tried different ways of fixing bad soil in about 1980. He uses simple traditional things: cordons pierreux (lines of stones) and zaï holes. Both Sawadogo and Ouédraogo have tried to get other people to do the same things.\n\nCordons pierreux are thin lines of fist-sized stones laid across fields. They catch water. When rain falls, it pushes silt (special dirt) across top of the field. The rocks slow down the water so it soaks into the ground more. The silt also makes a good place for seeds of local plants to grow. The plants slow the water even more, and their roots break up the soil, so it's easier for more water to soak in.\n\nZaï holes are holes dug in the soil. They also catch water, but in a different way. They used to only be used a little bit to make land better for growing plants. Yacouba Sawadogo had the idea to fill the holes with manure and other things to make food for the plants. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help break up the soil even more. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Zaï holes have been used to help cultivate trees, and crops like sorghum and millet.\n\nYacouba Sawadogo holds \"Market Days\" to get other people to do these things, especially zaï holes.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532475", "text": "Jury trial\n\nA jury trial or trial by jury is a legal proceeding in which a jury either makes a decision or makes findings of fact. This is called a verdict. The judge usually follows the jury's verdict in his ruling. It is distinguished from a bench trial, in which a judge or panel of judges make all decisions.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror brought to England a system of having witnesses who had any knowledge of a crime, tell the court what they knew. They did this after first swearing an oath. The word juror in English comes from the French \"jurer\" (to swear). In the 12th century juries were used by the king to discover and present facts. Usually this was in answer to questions posed by the king or his ministers who made the final decision in the case. Eventually this led to a system where the jury made a verdict based on evidence. In the late colonial period, juries became a tool used to express American discontent with British rule. A series of Navigation Acts prohibited the American colonies from trading directly with the Netherlands, Spain, France, and their colonies. As more and more trade restriction were imposed, the American colonists turned to smuggling. When smugglers were caught, they were brought before juries made up of other colonists. These sympathetic juries often acquitted their fellow colonists. The king, angered at these lawbreakers going free, created new courts that did not allow juries. This was a breach of common law practice and infringed on their rights as British citizens. After the Revolutionary war, the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial was written to limit the powers of the executive and the Judicial branches of the new federal government.\n\nJury trials are changing worldwide. In 2008 Russia abolished jury trials in cases of treason and terrorism. Britain, where juries got their start, is using them less in cases of serious fraud and may ban them from some inquests. In many asian countries, their legal systems are moving towards using the jury trial more. In the United States jury trials are on the decline. In federal courts \n\nThe right to a jury trial in civil cases is found in the United States but in very few other places. England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all but done away with civil jury trials in favor of bench trials. Fewer than 1 percent of civil trials in the US are jury trials. The Seventh Amendment prevents judges from overturning a jury verdict in federal cases where the finding of fact is reasonably supported by the evidence. In addition, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury in criminal trials.\n\n", "id": "532475", "title": "Jury trial"}

The cat works at 10 Downing Street. Only three cats, Humphrey, Sybil and Larry, have been given the title officially. Other cats have been given this title as a nickname, usually by the British press. There has been a Downing Street cat mouser and pet since the reign of Henry VIII.\n\nOfficial records about these working cats only date back to 3 June 1929. These come from the Treasury and state the cost for taking care of the cat. Now, the mouser costs 100 GBP (about $140) a year for keep.\n\nThe cats do not always belong to the Prime Minister in residence. Only rarely do they serve for exactly the same time as a Prime Minister.The cat with the longest known time at Downing Street is Wilberforce. He served for eighteen years under Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, and Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe incumbent is Larry, since 15 February 2011. The last cat Sybil, was the first mouser after a ten-year gap. She began in September 2007 and left in January 2009. Sybil was owned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, who lived in 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, lived in the larger 11 Downing Street. It was reported that Sybil did not like living in London. She went back to Scotland to live with a friend of the Darlings until she died.\n\nIn January 2011, rats were seen in Downing Street, \"scurrying across the steps of Number 10 Downing Street for the second time during a TV news report,\", as reported by Independent Television News . The Prime Minister's office first said there were \"no plans\" for a cat to be brought in. On 14 February 2011, it was reported that a cat named \"Larry\" had been brought in to get rid of the rodents. The \"London Evening Standard\" reported that the brown and white tabby cat had been chosen by David Cameron and his family, from those at Battersea Dogs & Cats Home.\n\nIn September 2012, it was reported that Prime Minister David Cameron had dismissed Larry from the post of Chief Mouser. He put in place Chancellor George Osborne's tabby cat, Freya, as the new Chief Mouser to patrol Numbers 10, 11, and 12. Some sources said the two cats would be \"job sharing\" to avoid any hurt feelings. In November 2014 Freya was exiled from Downing Street, again leaving Larry as the Chief Mouser.\n\nWhen Theresa May became new Prime Minister in July 2016, Cabinet Office staff said that Larry would still live at Downing Street and would be Chief Mouser under the new Prime Minister. However, \"The Daily Telegraph\" says maybe Cameron does not really like Larry. During David Cameron's final Prime Minister's Questions on 13 July 2016, the Prime Minister said to the House that Larry's role as Chief Mouser was secure even after the change of premier. Cameron also showed photos that prove he loves Larry. He spoke of his \"sadness\" that he cannot take Larry with him.\n\nThe British government voluntarily employees and feeds 100,000 cats to keep down mice on government property. By being chosen Chief Mouser, of course, Larry (and Freya) became quite pampered cats, living in royal luxury.\n\nLarry's birthday was celebrated on 15 February 2016. A month later Larry's importance to the UK was compared favourably to a team of dolphins being trained by the Russian Navy. In April Larry's ability to be a good mouser was again questioned. So a new neighbour, Palmerston the cat, moved into the Foreign Office. Just a week later Palmerston made his first kill, a mouse.\n\nDuring President Obama's April visit to the UK, Larry got much coverage in American social media and news reports.\n\nIn June 2016 it was reported that Larry is undecided about the Brexit decision. Whether he gets to keep living at 10 Downing Street, he will still get his daily dinner.\n\n\n", "id": "532479", "title": "Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office"}

Civil law is concerned with the duties individuals owe to other people or to their government. This excludes the duty not to commit crimes. The American form of civil justice is considerably different from European systems. Two features stand out, class actions and the awarding of punitive damages in tort cases. Many people in other countries are amazed at the number of civil cases in the United States. Americans sue in a wide variety of cases for compensation and medical expenses that are covered in other countries by national health insurance and government compensation programs.\n\nCivil law is concerned with cases such as divorce, child custody and support and related lawsuits. Contract cases, tort cases (when someone is hurt and seeks compensation) and crimes which are tried in a criminal court and then tried in a civil case. Examples would be cases resulting from drunk driving or hit and run.\n\nCivil cases use a lower preponderance of the evidence standard of proof whereas criminal cases use the higher standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. An example of the differences and that the same crime can result in both criminal and civil trials is the O. J. Simpson trials. In his criminal trial a jury decided the evidence did not meet the higher standard so he was acquitted of murder charges. But in the civil wrongful death trial he was found guilty.\n\nThe right to a jury trial in civil cases is found in the United States but in very few other places. England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all but done away with civil jury trials in favor of bench trials. Fewer than 1 percent of civil trials in the US are jury trials. Where juries are used, the presence of a jury has changed the form of civil proceedings. A jury has to be impaneled, they must hear witnesses and go over evidence before reaching a verdict. The verdict, in turn, must follow the instructions given by a judge.\n\nBench trials in civil cases are usually conducted differently than jury trials. Judges usually prefer settlements to trials and prefer bench trials because they save time. A judge can streamline a case by asking for what he wants to see and hear, not what is presented for the benefit of a jury.\n\nBench trials have several advantages. They are usually much less formal than a jury trial. Attorneys for both sides can usually agree on the facts of a case before the trial starts. This can save a great deal of time otherwise spent on hearing witnesses and reviewing evidence. This can save on the costs of a trial. In a jury trial, the judge is required to give instructions to the jury before they deliberate. If a judge makes an error in his instructions, this is called a reversible error and can be used as a basis for an appeal. In a bench trial, the judge gives no instructions since there is no jury. This means the judge cannot be reversed due to an error in the instructions.\n\n", "id": "532488", "title": "Civil law (common law)"}

They are: the long head, medial (inside) head, and the lateral (outside) head.The long head comes from the shoulderblade. It goes down the arm between teres minor muscle and teres major muscle.\n\nThe medial head and lateral heads comes from the humerus (upper arm bone).\n\nThe medial head is mostly made of small, slow muscle fibers and motor units. The lateral head is mostly made of large, fast fibers and motor units. The long head is made of a mixture of fiber types and motor units. Some scientists think that each of the three parts can be thought of as separate muscles.\n\nThe fibers join to a single tendon to attach to the ulna bone. Some research found that there might be more than one tendon. \n\nScientists used to think that all three heads of the triceps brachii got nerve signals from the radial nerve. However, a study found that, in 20 cadaveric (dead) bodies and 15 live people, the long head actually got nerve signals from part of the axillary nerve in every case.\n\nThe triceps straightens the elbow pulls against the biceps and brachialis muscles. It can also hold the elbow in place when the forearm and hand are used for small movements, like writing.The long head might be used when the same force is needed for a long time, or to help control shoulder and elbow movement.

This plan for farming may grow more rice in the same field. It uses less water, takes more work, and uses younger seedlings spaced apart. SRI calls for hand weeding with special tools. It was started in 1983 by the French Jesuit Father Henri de Laulanié in Madagascar. Full testing and spread of the system throughout the rice growing parts of the world did not happen until some years later with the help of schools like Cornell University.\n\nWriting the plan now called SRI started in the 1960s when Fr. de Laulanie kept notes on growing rice. The SRI plan includes using less water and hand planting very young seedlings in a square. The SRI plan continues to change. Sometimes people try to use only rain for water, and sometimes people try to plant seeds instead of young plants. The main parts of SRI plan written by Cornell University, New York are:\n\n\nThanks to Norman Uphoff, the SRI plan has spread from Madagascar to many places around the world.

In 1993, Uphoff met officers from Association Tefy Saina, the non-governmental organisation set up in Madagascar in 1990 by de Laulanie to try SRI. After trying the SRI plan for three years, Malagasy farms that made about 2 tons/hectare improved to about 8 tons/hectare. Uphoff believed the SRI plan works, and in 1997 started to tell groups in Asia about SRI. Uphoff estimates that by 2013 the number of small farms using SRI had grown to between 4 and 5 million.\n\nBelievers and unbelievers of SRI talk about the SRI claims, and many questions about it remain unresolved. Wageningen University has also published an article discussing the problems of measuring SRI. This paper ended by saying: \"Although the technical aspects of SRI have been contested, it clearly exists as a real social phenomenon\".\n\nThe question now seems to be: is SRI better at making more rice and other benefits to rice farmers, such as healthier soils, when compared with older, trusted ways for growing rice?[source?]\n\nProponents and critics of SRI debate the claimed benefits and many questions about it remain unresolved. Wageningen University has also published an article discussing the challenges of evaluating SRI in which one concluding sentence read: \"Although the technical aspects of SRI have been contested, it clearly exists as a real social phenomenon\".\n\nThe question at hand seems to be: is SRI better at delivering increased yield and other benefits to rice farmers, such as healthier soils, when compared with established recommended best management practices for rice production?\n\nBelievers of SRI claim it grows more rice, saves water, reduces costs, and raises income and that benefits have been achieved in 40 countries. Uphoff published an article in the International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability that states that SRI \"can raise irrigated rice yields to about double the present world average without relying on external inputs, also offering environmental and equity benefits\".\n\nA special issue on SRI in the trade journal Paddy and Water Environment (not related to schools) collected recent findings in support of SRI.\n\nIn 2011 Five farmers beat the old yield record, the best was a young farmer named Sumant Kumar setting a new world record in rice yield of 22.4 tons per hectare using SRI, beating the existing world record held by the Chinese scientist Yuan Longping by 3 tons. In 2014 S Sethumadhavan from Alanganallur, India grew a record yield of nearly 24 tons of paddy rice per hectare using SRI.\n\nHow well SRI works is still debated between believers and unbelievers of the plan. Critics of SRI say that claims of high yield in SRI are due to unscientific reporting. They object that there is a lack of details on the methodology used in trials and a lack of printed reports in the peer-reviewed literature (related to schools and universities). Some unbelievers have suggested that SRI success is unique to soil conditions in Madagascar. While unbelievers still claim this, there are over 700 articles and printed reports about SRI that are published in international scientific journals as of January 2016.\n\nBelow is a picture gallery of SRI farming in Chhattisgarh, India:\n\n\n", "id": "532649", "title": "System of Rice Intensification"}

It was in northern Germany, near the town of Ravensbrück.\n\nThe \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), led by Heinrich Himmler, ran Ravensbrück concentration camp.\n\nIn November 1938, Himmler gave the order to start building the camp at Ravensbrück. By 1939, Ravensbrück was the biggest women's concentration camp in Nazi Germany.\n\nOver time, the Nazis made Ravensbrück much bigger. By 1944, Ravensbrück had become a complex (a group of many concentration camps).\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945, about 153,000 people were prisoners at Ravensbrück.\n\nAfter Heinrich Himmler decided that Ravensbrück should be built, the SS brought about 500 male prisoners from Sachsenhausen concentration camp to the area. The SS forced these prisoners to build Ravensbrück. SS records say that Ravensbruck was designed to hold 3,000 prisoners.\n\nRavensbrück opened in May 1939. The camp's first prisoners were a group of about 900 women sent from Lichtenburg concentration camp. Ravensbrück very quickly became full. From 1939 to 1945, the Nazis were constantly making the camp bigger to hold more and more prisoners.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the Nazis made Ravensbrück much larger. They expected to send many Polish people to concentration camps, and they wanted Ravensbrück to be able to fit more prisoners. However, by May 1940 (just eight months after World War II started), Ravensbrück was full of prisoners. \n\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in summer 1941, there were about 5,000 prisoners at Ravensbrück. By the end of 1942, the camp held 10,000 prisoners (including many Soviet prisoners of war).\n\nAt its most crowded, the women's camp held 50,000 prisoners.\n\nTo make room for more and more prisoners, the Nazis added new camps to the original women's camp.\n\nIn April 1941, the Nazis added a concentration camp for men next to the women's camp. The SS forced the male prisoners to build the new camps in the Ravensbrück complex, and to work on making the women's camp bigger.\n\nIn June 1942, a \"juvenile protective custody camp\" called \"Uckermark\" was built next to the men's camp. This was a camp just for teenage girls and young women.\n\nBy 1944, the SS had forced prisoners to build over 40 smaller camps (called sub-camps). These sub-camps held over 70,000 prisoners, mostly women. The original Ravensbrück camp became the office for these sub-camps. However, women prisoners were still kept there, and male prisoners had to keep making the camp bigger to fit more prisoners.\n\nOf the 153,000 people who were prisoners at Ravensbrück between 1939 and 1945:\n\nPeople were sent to Ravensbrück for many different reasons. Prisoners at Ravensbrück included:\n\nThe Nazis sent people from over 30 countries to Ravensbrück. For example, historians estimate that:\nMale SS members were in charge of Ravensbrück. However, the camp had over 150 female SS members who guarded the prisoners.\n\nRavensbrück was also a training camp for SS women. They learned how to be concentration camp guards at Ravensbrück. Then they would stay and work there, or go work at another camp. Over 4,000 SS women trained at Ravensbrück.\n\nMany of the female SS guards at Ravensbrück, like Irma Grese, treated the prisoners very badly.\n\nWhen prisoners first got to Ravensbrück, their hair was usually shaved off. The SS took away their personal things, including their clothes. Prisoners had to wear striped uniforms, which included a dress and a head scarf. Later on in the war, when there were not enough uniforms, women were sometimes allowed to wear their own clothes. However, they had to mark a big white \"X\" on the back of their clothes to show that they were prisoners.\n\nEvery prisoner was given a serial number. The SS never called them by their names - only by their numbers.\n\nPrisoners had to sew their serial numbers onto their clothes. They also had to wear colored triangles which showed why they were sent to Ravensbrück. In the middle of the triangle, they had to sew a letter saying what country they were from. For example, Polish prisoners had to sew a red triangle with the letter \"P\" (for Poland) onto their clothes. (A red triangle showed that a person was a political enemy of Nazi Germany.)\n\nWhen Ravensbrück first opened, and the camp was not too crowded, living conditions were not too bad. However, during the winter of 1939 to 1940, the camp got more crowded, and the SS reacted by giving the prisoners less food. After 1941, the food got much worse, and prisoners got much less of it.\n\nThe women's camp at Ravensbrück had twelve barracks where the prisoners lived. They slept on wooden bunks which had three rows, one on top of the other. Each barrack had a washroom and three toilets with no doors. There was very little sanitation. After 1943, sanitation in the barracks got much worse. This made it easier for diseases to spread. \n\nTowards the end of World War II, the camp was so crowded that 1,500 to 2,000 women were packed into barracks meant to hold only 250 people. Many women had to sleep on the floor, without even a blanket. In 1945, the barracks were so crowded and sanitation was so bad that an epidemic of typhus spread through the camp. The disease killed many prisoners.\n\nEvery morning, the prisoners had to get up at 4:00 in the morning for roll call. This meant they had to stand in line while the SS counted them.\n\nAfter roll call, prisoners went to work. Every prisoner at Ravensbrück was forced to work. If a person could not work, they would be killed.\n\nMany prisoners worked at a Siemens Electric Company factory next to the women's camp. The prisoners worked as slaves, making parts for Nazi V-1 and V-2 rockets (flying bombs). Other prisoners worked at important German companies like Daimler-Benz (now Mercedes-Benz) and AEG (a German electrical company).\n\nSome prisoners in the women's camp did other jobs, like:\n\nSome women had to work outside. They built roads and buildings. Sometimes these women were used like animals. For example, sometimes twelve to fourteen women would have to pull a huge roller to pave the streets.\n\nWomen who were too sick or injured to do other jobs - usually because of medical experiments - knitted things like socks for the German Army, or cleaned the barracks and latrines.\n\nPrisoners usually worked for twelve hours a day. Some worked from 7:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night. Others worked from 7:00 at night to 7:00 in the morning.\n\nPrisoners did not have to work on Sundays.\n\nStarting in 1942, Nazi doctors did medical experiments on 86 women prisoners. The doctors did two types of experiments.\n\nIn the first type, the doctors cut the women's legs, muscles, and nerves, or broke their leg bones. Then they infected these wounds with bacteria. Sometimes they rubbed wood or glass into the wounds. Then they gave the women sulfanilamide antibiotics to see if they would work.\n\nIn the second type of experiment, the doctors studied whether bones could be taken from one person and put into another person. They amputated some women's arms or legs to do these experiments.\n\nIn January 1945, Nazi doctors sterilized about 120 to 140 Roma women and children. The doctors were trying to find a quick, easy way to sterilize people.\n\nSome women died from these experiments. The SS killed some other women who had wounds that did not heal.\n\nSome of the women and young children at Ravensbrück were raped or sexually abused.\n\nStarting in 1942, the SS created brothels in eight other concentration camps, like Buchenwald and Dachau. Women from Ravensbrück were forced to work as prostitutes in these brothels.\n\nNobody agrees on how many people died or were murdered at Ravensbrück. Estimates range from 52,200, to 90,000, to 117,000.\n\nPrisoners at Ravensbrück died for many reasons. These included:\n\nMany prisoners were also murdered by the SS.\n\nUnlike many other concentration camps, Ravensbrück did not have its own gas chamber until early 1945. The SS used other ways of killing prisoners.\n\nRegularly, the SS would perform \"selections.\" They would pick out prisoners who looked too sick or weak to work. Then they would kill these prisoners.\n\nAt first, the SS killed prisoners by shooting them or giving them lethal injections in the camp's \"hospital.\" Then, starting in 1942, they began sending prisoners to other places that did have gas chambers, like Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, so they could be killed there. Between 1942 and 1944, the SS sent about 60 groups of prisoners to Hartheim to be gassed to death. Each group had 60 to 1,000 prisoners in it.\n\nThe SS also sent prisoners to Auschwitz concentration camp to be killed in its gas chambers.\n\nIn early 1945, the SS made prisoners build a gas chamber at Ravensbrück. By this time, the Nazis knew that the Soviet Red Army was getting close. They wanted to kill as many prisoners as possible before the Red Army arrived. In its last few months, Ravensbrück became an extermination camp (a death camp). The SS started sending children and prisoners from Ravensbrück's sub-camps to the main camp, so they could be gassed to death. In just a few months, the SS killed 5,000 to 6,000 prisoners in the gas chamber.\n\nIn March 1945, the Red Army was very close to Ravensbrück. The SS did not want to leave any witnesses to tell the Soviets what had happened at Ravensbrück. In March, they sent about 8,000 prisoners to other concentration camps.\n\nOn April 27, the SS forced about 20,000 female prisoners and about 3,000 male prisoners to march towards the middle of Germany. This was a death march. The SS guards had been ordered to kill anyone who could not keep up. However, Soviet soldiers found the route of the march and freed the prisoners who had survived the death march.\n\nOn April 29, the SS guards that were still at Ravensbrück ran away from the camp. The next day, the Red Army arrived at Ravensbrück and freed the camp. They found only about 3,000 very sick prisoners. These were the prisoners that the SS had left behind because they were too sick to march.\n\n", "id": "532742", "title": "Ravensbrück concentration camp"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532788", "text": "Gamemaster\n\nA gamemaster is a person who plans, referees, solves arguments in and otherwise runs a role-playing game with more than one player. They are almost always seen in games where all the players are on the same side, and less often seen in games where the players are against each other. Acting as a gamemaster is sometimes called \"Gamemastering\" or \"GMing\" for short.\n\nA gamemaster's job in a traditional role-playing game (where all the players are together in person) is to bring the other players' characters' stories together, control the other characters and monsters, put together places and scenes for the player characters to act in, and solve arguments between players. This basic rule is the same in almost all role-playing games, but some rule sets may need the gamemaster to do other jobs unique to that system.\n\nThe role of a gamemaster in an online game is to make sure everyone follows the game's rules and give general customer service. Gamemasters for online games may be players who choose the role like in traditional role-playing games, or they might be workers paid by the company that makes the game.\n\nThe term \"gamemaster\" and the job itself it could be found in the postal gaming hobby.\nIn the sense of a role-playing game, it was first used by \"Chivalry & Sorcery\", and in wargaming it has been used in Guidon Games' 1973 ruleset, \"Ironclad\". In most play-by-mail games, players control armies or countries and mail the actions they want to do to the GM. The GM then regularly mails the newest game state to all players.\n\nEach gaming system has its own name for the gamemaster, such as \"judge\", \"narrator\", \"referee\", \"director\", or \"storyteller\", and these names not only describe the role of the gamemaster in general but also help explain how the game is meant to be run. For example, the Storyteller System used in White Wolf Game Studio's storytelling games calls its gamemaster the \"storyteller\", while the rules- and setting-focused \"Marvel Super Heroes\" role-playing game calls its gamemaster the \"judge\". The cartoon-based role-playing game \"Toon\" calls its gamemaster the \"animator\". A few games use system- or setting-specific flavourful (closely related to the game's setting or \"flavour\") names for the gamemaster, such as the Hollyhock God in \"Nobilis\", where the hollyhock means vanity, or the most well known of such names, \"Dungeon Master\" (or \"DM\") in \"Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\nThe gamemaster prepares the game session for the players and the characters they play (known as player characters or PCs), describes the events taking place and decides on the results of players' actions. The gamemaster also keeps track of non-player characters (NPCs) and random encounters, as well as of the general state of the game world. The game session (or \"adventure\") could be described as a play, in which the players are the lead actors, and the GM brings the stage, the scenery, the basic plot on which the improvisational (unplanned) script is built, as well as all the bit parts and supporting characters. Gamemasters can also be in charge of RPG board games, making the events and setting up challenges.\n\nA gamemaster can be said to wear four \"hats\" in their role, meaning the four main jobs they do as part of the overall job of GMing.\n\nIn early virtual worlds gamemasters worked as a moderator or administrator; in MUD gamemasters were called \"wizards\". Gamemastering in the form found in traditional role-playing games has also been used in virtual worlds that mostly run by themselves. However, human moderation was sometimes thought of as unfair or wrong in a world that is otherwise run by computer programs.\nAs online games got bigger and more popular, gamemasters' jobs grew to include giving customer service for an online community. A gamemaster in such a game is either a volunteer player that has been there a long time, or someone who works for the game's publisher. They make everyone follow the game's rules by getting rid of spammers, player killers, cheaters, and hackers and by solving players' problems by giving general customer service. For their jobs they use special tools and characters that allow them to do things like teleport to players, make items, and look at logs that record players' actions. Often, players who aren't happy with the game will blame the GMs for any problems. However, this blame is not fair as most GMs are not developers and cannot fix those types of problems.\n\nAmerica Online Online Gaming Forum (which is no longer in use) used to use volunteers chosen from applications from its users. These people were called OGFs by other members, and their screennames showed their role (i.e., OGF Moose, etc.). While users only needed to be members of AOL to use the Online Gaming Forum, OGFs were given powers like AOL \"Guides\" and could use them at will when they thought it was right.\n\n\"World of Warcraft\" has employees of Blizzard Entertainment that serve as gamemasters to help users with many problems in gameplay, chat, and other things like account and payment issues. A gamemaster in this game can talk to players through chat with blue text, and they will also have a special \"GM\" tag and Blizzard logo in front of their name.\n\n\"RuneScape\" has more than 500 moderators working for Jagex Games Studio to help players and do administrative work in-game and on the site forums. These \"Jagex Moderators\", as they are called, usually have the word \"Mod\" and a gold crown preceding their account names which normal players are not allowed to use. The game also has \"Player Moderators\" and \"Forum Moderators\" who are player volunteers helping with moderation, having the power to mute (block from chatting) other players who break rules.\n\nNote that a few games, such as \"Neverwinter Nights\" and \"\", are video game adaptations of tabletop role-playing games that are played online with one player acting as a gamemaster in the same way as they would in real life.\n\nGamemastering, sometimes called Orchestration is used in pervasive games to guide players along a path that the game's writer wants.\n\nGood gamemastering in this type of game sometimes needs special user interfaces that are unique to a certain game.\n\nSometimes, tabletop GMs can not find players that want to play in either the same setting, product line, or play style in their local area. The networked personal computer gave an answer with online chat programs. Gamemasters with the right equipment can find players online and a group can meet using chat rooms, forums, or other electronic means.\n\nCompared to standard tabletop games (and to games \"meant\" to be played online), this online chat format changes the balance of duties for a gamemaster quite a lot. Descriptions require more preparation, even when using cut-and-paste; acting and voice skills can not be used to get the personality of NPCs and monsters across, making background music as a playing aid more useful. The GM is likely to need copies of player-character records, not being able to look at the originals as in a normal face-to-face game. The format also forces the issue (particularly when players do not all know each other) of whether to leave all rolling of dice to the GM, or to trust all players to honestly give the results of their rolls (the honor system may be strained when rolling well is a very good thing).\n\nHowever, over time there have been answers to these problems. The use of Wiki software helps GMs and players keep track of game data, sometimes turning into a home-made gaming aid. Scripting software allows difficult parts of gameplay (e.g. a complicated formula or lots of die-rolling) to be done at the push of a button. Teleconferencing lets groups use voice, video, and a shared whiteboard to interact. The use of technology to allow online play is growing, as seen in products like the D&D Insider.\n\n", "id": "532788", "title": "Gamemaster"}

This time in his life is talked about in his semi-autobiographical (written about a fictional character but partly about himself) story \"The Story of a Bad Boy\" (1870), in which \"Tom Bailey\" is the young hero.\n\nAldrich gave up on going to college after his father's death in 1849. At age 16, he joined his uncle's business office in New York in 1852 and started working on the newspapers and magazines. Aldrich made friends with other young poets, artists and wits of New York's \"bohemia\" of the early 1860s, including Edmund Clarence Stedman, Richard Henry Stoddard, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Bayard Taylor and Walt Whitman. From 1856 to 1859, Aldrich worked for the \"Home Journal\", which was edited by Nathaniel Parker Willis at that time. During the Civil War, he was the editor of the \"New York Illustrated News\".\n\nIn 1865 Aldrich went back to New England, where he was editor in Boston for ten years for Ticknor and Fields — at the time they were very well thought of — of the eclectic weekly \"Every Saturday\". It stopped being made in 1875. From 1881 to 1890, Aldrich was editor of the important \"Atlantic Monthly\". As editor, he made tension with his publisher Henry Houghton by not agreeing to publish commissioned articles (ones that had been paid for) by his friends, including Woodrow Wilson and Marion Crawford. When Houghton argued with Aldrich for refusing articles from his friend Daniel Coit Gilman, Aldrich threatened to quit his job and finally did so in June 1890.\n\nMeanwhile Aldrich carried on with his private writing, both in prose (the sort of writing found in most books) and verse (poetry, songs, etc). He had many skills. He was well known for his form in poetry. His many books of verse, mainly \"The Ballad of Babie Bell\" (1856), \"Pampinea, and Other Poems\" (1861), \"Cloth of Gold\" (1874), \"Flower and Thorn\" (1876), \"Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book\" (1881), \"Mercedes and Later Lyrics\" (1883), \"Wyndham Towers\" (1889), and the collected editions of 1865, 1882, 1897 and 1900, showed him to be a poet of lyrical skill and light touch. Critics said that his work was like Robert Herrick's.\n\nAldrich's longer narrative or dramatic poems did not do as well. Important work includes \"Hesperides,\" \"When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan,\" \"Before the Rain,\" \"Nameless Pain,\" \"The Tragedy,\" \"Seadrift,\" \"Tiger Lilies,\" \"The One White Rose,\" \"Palabras Cariñosas,\" \"Destiny,\" or the eight-line poem \"Identity.\"\nBeginning with the collection of stories called \"Marjorie Daw and Other People\" (1873), Aldrich wrote works of realism and quiet humour. His books \"Prudence Palfrey\" (1874), \"The Queen of Sheba\" (1877), and \"The Stillwater Tragedy\" (1880) had more dramatic action. The first showed Portsmouth with the loving touch shown in the shorter funny tale, \"A Rivermouth Romance\" (1877). In \"An Old Town by the Sea\" (1893), Aldrich wrote about his place of birth again. Travel and description are the theme of \"From Ponkapog to Pesth\" (1883).\n\nAldrich married and had two sons. Mark Twain is said to hated Aldrich's wife Lilian. He wrote in 1893: \"Lord, I loathe that woman so! She is an idiot—an absolute idiot—and does not know it ... and her husband, the sincerest man that walks ... tied for life to this vacant hellion, this clothes-rack, this twaddling, blethering, driveling blatherskite!\"\n\nThe Aldrich family were close friends of Henry L. Pierce, former mayor of Boston and chocolate magnate (he made a lot of money from the chocolate business). When Pierce died death in 1896, he willed the Aldriches his home in Canton, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1901, Aldrich's son Charles, who had gotten married the year before, was found to have a disease called tuberculosis. Aldrich built two houses, one for his son and one for him and his family, in Saranac Lake, New York, which was the leading treatment centre for the disease at the time. On March 6, 1904, Charles Aldrich died of tuberculosis, at the age of thirty-four. The family left Saranac Lake and never went back.\n\nAldrich died in Boston on March 19, 1907. His last words were, \"In spite of it all, I am going to sleep; put out the lights.\" His \"Life\" was written by Ferris Greenslet (1908).\n\n", "id": "532793", "title": "Thomas Bailey Aldrich"}

This test has two parts. \"CRAFFT\" is an acronym for the six questions in the second part of the test.\n\nA doctor or counselor can give the CRAFFT Screening Test to see if a teenager might have an alcohol or drug problem. Teenagers can also take the test themselves.\n\nDoctors at Boston Children's Hospital's Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research developed the CRAFFT Screening Test in 1999. At the time, there were no tests for alcohol and drug abuse designed specifically for teenagers. The Children's Hospital team's goal was to develop a test for teenagers that was quick, easy to give, easy to score.\n\nAt the time, one of the most common tools used to test for alcohol problems was the CAGE questionnaire. However, the CAGE does not work well for teenagers. Also, the CAGE only tests for alcohol problems. \n\nThe CRAFFT tests for both alcohol and drug problems. Because drug- and alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among teenagers, the CRAFFT includes a question about this. \nOriginally, the CRAFFT was designed for primary care doctors to use, to test teenagers they thought were likely to have substance abuse problems. Then, around 1999, researchers found that teenage alcohol and drug use was much more common than they thought. They found that:\n\nThis made it clear that the CRAFFT was not just needed to test teenagers who were more likely to have substance abuse problems. Now, experts suggest that primary care doctors use the CRAFFT to test all of their teenage patients. This can help identify alcohol and drug problems early, before they start to get too much worse.\n\nThe CRAFFT Screening Test has two parts. They are called \"Part A\" and \"Part B.\"\n\nPart A of the CRAFFT asks:\n\nDuring the past 12 months, did you:\n\nIf a person answers \"no\" to ALL of these questions, they only have to answer the first question in Part B. \n\nIf a person answers \"yes\" to ANY of these questions, they have to answer all of the questions in Part B.\n\nIn simple English, here are the questions in Part B of the CRAFFT:\n\nEach time a person answers \"yes\" to one of the CRAFFT questions, they score one point for that question. If a person scores two or more - meaning they answered \"yes\" to at least two of the six \"CRAFFT\" questions - they are likely to have alcoholism or a drug addiction. \n\nNot everyone who scores two or more on the CRAFFT will have an addiction. However, they do need to be tested more to see if they have an addiction. \n\nResearch has shown that the CRAFFT is a good test for alcohol and drug problems in teenagers.\n\nThe CRAFFT has been translated into many languages, including Mandarin Chinese, French, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Japanese, Khmer, Laotian, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, Turkish, and Vietnamese. Research shows that the CRAFFT is just as good a test when given in different languages, and to teenagers from different cultures.\n\nThe CRAFFT is a very quick test.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533028", "text": "Intracranial hemorrhage\n\nAn intracranial hemorrhage is bleeding in the brain. (\"Intracranial\" means \"inside the skull\"; \"hemorrhage\" means \"dangerous bleeding\"). The most dangerous type of stroke, a hemorrhagic stroke, is a type of intracranial hemorrhage. It is a bleed in the brain that happens when the brain has not been injured.\n\nWhen blood vessels in the brain break or are injured, they bleed. Bleeding in the brain is very dangerous, because if enough blood builds up, the blood can squeeze or crush the brain. It can also make it impossible for oxygen to get past the blood to parts of the brain. Without oxygen, these parts of the brain will die.\n\nBleeding in the brain can happen for two reasons. It can happen because of a head injury. A bad head injury can break some of the blood vessels in the brain.\n\nBleeding in the brain can also happen when blood vessels in the brain break without being injured. For example, this may happen when a cerebral aneurysm bursts.\n\nThe three most common types of bleeding problems in the brain are epidural hematomas, subdural hematomas, and subarachnoid hemorrhages. These happen in different parts of the meninges (the layers that cover the brain).\n\nAn epidural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura mater and the skull. (\"Epidural\" means \"on top of the dura;\" a \"hematoma\" is a collection of blood.) Usually, injuries to the head cause epidural hematomas by tearing arteries in the dura. Because the arteries in the dura are large, they carry a lot of blood. If one of these arteries is injured, it can bleed very quickly, and an epidural hematoma can build up almost right away. \n\nAbout 15% to 20% of people with epidural hematomas die from them.\n\nThe picture at the top of this page shows an epidural hematoma. The bleeding (shown in light gray) is between the skull (the thick white outside layer) and the rest of the brain (shown in dark gray).\n\nA subdural hematoma is a collection of blood under the dura mater, between the dura and the arachnoid layer. (\"Subdural\" means \"under the dura.\") Usually, subdural hematomas are caused by injuries to the head that tear veins. Because these veins are smaller, and because veins do not bleed as fast as arteries, subdural hematomas may not bleed as quickly as epidural hematomas.\n\nSubdural hematomas can happen right away after a bad injury to the head. These are called acute subdural hematomas. These are the most dangerous of all head injuries. They kill about 60% to 80% of people who have them.\nSubdural hematomas can also be chronic. This means they take days or weeks to happen. They are usually caused by injuries to the head that are not very bad. Sometimes, if a person has a vein in their dura that slowly leaks blood every now and then, chronic subdural hematomas can take years to build up.\n\nA subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid and the pia mater). (\"Subarachnoid\" means \"under the arachnoid.\") Because the subarachnoid space holds cerebrospinal fluid, bleeding here makes blood mix into the cerebrospinal fluid. The blood irritates the brain and spinal cord, and causes symptoms like a very bad headache and a stiff neck.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages can be caused by head injuries. They can also happen when an aneurysm in one of the arachnoid layer's blood vessels bursts and starts bleeding.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhages are very dangerous. About half of all people with subarachnoid hemorrhages die from them. About 10% to 15% die before they even get to the hospital. Many of the people who survive have brain damage.\n\n", "id": "533028", "title": "Intracranial hemorrhage"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533095", "text": "Holocaust victims\n\nDuring The Holocaust, millions of people died or were killed in Nazi Germany. These Holocaust victims included about six million Jewish people. They also included five million of people who were not Jewish. \n\nHolocaust victims died in many ways. Millions were murdered by the Nazis, especially in concentration camps and extermination camps (death camps). Many others died in camps and ghettoes from diseases, starvation, and freezing to death, caused by the terrible living conditions. Others in areas that Nazi Germany took over died from famine and other causes. \n\nWhen all these people are added up, historians estimate that between 19 million and 22 million people died during The Holocaust. Holocaust victims came from many different countries, religions, ethnic groups, and cultures. The Nazis wanted to kill them for many different reasons.\n\nThe Nazis believed that some races and ethnic groups were not as good as others. They thought the \"Aryan race\" was the best of all. They wanted Nazi Germany to be filled only with \"Aryan\" people.\n\nThe Nazis thought that there were some ethnic groups that were not even human. Two of these groups were the Jews and the Roma people. The Nazis decided to kill all of the Jews and Roma people in Nazi Germany. The Nazis also thought that Slavic peoples were less than human, and they killed millions of Slavs because of their ethnicity.\n\nThe Nazis thought of the Jewish people as an ethnic group. This meant that even if a person did not practice the Jewish religion, the Nazis still thought of them as Jewish.\n\nEarly on in World War II, the Nazis made Jewish people leave their homes and forced them to live in ghettoes. However, by 1941, Adolf Hitler had decided to kill all of the Jews in Europe. This plan was called the Final Solution.\nStarting in 1942, the Nazis deported the Jews from the ghettoes to death camps like Auschwitz. At these camps, people were killed in gas chambers as soon as they arrived.\n\nBy the end of The Holocaust, one out of every three Jewish people in the world had died or been killed by the Nazis. Only one out of every three Jews in Europe survived The Holocaust. Many countries lost most of their Jewish populations. For example, during The Holocaust:\n\nOver one million Jewish children died or were killed during The Holocaust.\n\nUnder the Nazis' Nuremberg Laws, the Roma people were called \"enemies of the race-based [Germany],\" just like Jews. Like with the Jews, the Nazis wanted to kill all of the Roma people in Europe.\n\nIn 1936, the Nazis began deporting Roma people, first to areas on the outside edges of cities, and later to the same ghettoes that Jews were sent to. In 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered that the Roma people (including children) should be sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. The Nazis also sent many Roma adults and children to other death camps, like Bełżec, and to other concentration camps, like Ravensbrück.\n\nHistorians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Roma were killed by the Nazis. This was about one in every four Roma people who lived in Europe at the time. However, one researcher says that as many as 1.5 million Roma may have died during The Holocaust. \n\nAfter World War II, it took a long time for countries to admit that Nazi Germany had committed a genocide against the Roma people. In 1982, West Germany admitted that a genocide of the Roma had happened. In 2011, the Polish Government ruled that Poland would honor the Roma genocide on the 2nd of August, every year.\n\nThe Nazis killed millions of Slavic people during The Holocaust. These people included Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Bosniaks, and Sorbs. The Nazis thought Slavs were an inferior race. However, they also wanted to clear out the people in the Slavic countries, so there would be plenty of \"Lebensraum\" (\"living space\") for \"Aryan\" people.\n\nOriginally, the Nazis planned to kill 65% of the 23.2 million people in the Ukraine (about 15 million Ukrainians). They planned to make the survivors work as slaves.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1945, the Nazis killed about three million Ukrainians. They also deported over two million Ukrainians to Germany to be used as slave workers.\n\nMore Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Soviet Red Army than American, British and French soldiers all put together.\n\nPoles were one of the first groups that Hitler decided to get rid of. He first shared this idea in 1939. On August 22, 1939, Hitler said:\n\"[T]he [goal] of the war is ... to destroy the enemy. That is why I have prepared ... my 'Death's Head' [groups of soldiers] with orders to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we [get] the living space we need.\"\n\nBefore World War II, Poland had the largest population of Jews in Europe. By the end of The Holocaust, three million Polish Jews had died or been killed. So had between 1.8 million and three million Poles who were not Jewish. These victims included:\n\nAlmost 17% of Poland's population died or was killed in The Holocaust.\n\nMany Soviet prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians died during Operation Barbarossa (the Axis countries' invasion of the Soviet Union). The Nazis killed many Soviet children as well as adult civilians in the lands they took over.\n\nThe Nazis killed millions of Red Army prisoners of war in many ways:\n\nIn eight months between 1941-1942, the Nazis killed about 2.8 million Soviet POWs by execution, starvation, and freezing to death.\n\nAfter the Nazis occupied parts of the Soviet Union, they treated Soviet civilians terribly. During the siege of Leningrad, more than 1.2 million civilians died. Nazi soldiers destroyed thousands of peasant villages across Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine. In 1995, the Russian Academy of Sciences reported that the Nazis caused 13.7 million civilian deaths in the occupied Soviet Union, including Jews. This was 20% of the area's population. These deaths included:\n\nAbout three million people also died of starvation in areas that the Nazis had not taken over.\n\nThe Nazis believed that people with disabilities were \"life unworthy of life,\" and that they did not deserve to live. People with disabilities also did not fit into the Nazis' ideas about having a race of perfect \"Aryans.\" \n\nThe Nazis forced about 375,000 people to be sterilized so they could not have children with disabilities. These people included people with physical disabilities, mental illnesses, intellectual disabilities, and the Deaf.\n\nPeople with disabilities were the first people the Nazis killed in gas chambers. In 1939, the Nazis set up a program called the T-4 Euthanasia Program. As part of this program, the Nazis sent children and adults with disabilities to hospitals like Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, where they were killed with poison gas. They also killed some children with disabilities right after they were born. By the end of World War II, the Nazis had killed about 275,000 people with disabilities. About 5,000 to 7,000 of these victims were children.\n\nLesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people were also victims of The Holocaust. The Nazis were especially cruel to gay men. They thought that homosexual people hurt Nazi Germany in a few ways:\n\nBy 1936, Heinrich Himmler was trying to use Germany's laws, and make new laws, to persecute gay men. At least 100,000 gay German men were arrested, and 50,000 were convicted and put in prison. Some were forced into state-run psychiatric hospitals. Courts ordered hundreds of European gay men living in Nazi-controlled areas to be castrated with chemicals. \n\nBetween 5,000 and 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps. They were often treated even worse than other prisoners. They had to wear a pink triangle on their shirts, just like men convicted of sexually abusing children and having sex with animals. \n\nLesbians were not usually treated as badly as gay men. They were usually not put in prison just because they were lesbians. In the concentration camps, they usually wore a black triangle. \n\nAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \"Nazi Germany did not seek to kill all homosexuals. Nevertheless, the Nazi state, through active persecution, attempted to terrorise German homosexuals into sexual and social conformity, leaving thousands dead and shattering the lives of many more.\"\n\nAfter World War II, many homosexuals who were liberated from the concentration camps were still persecuted in Germany. They could be charged under Paragraph 175, a law which made \"lewdness between men\" illegal. If they were convicted, they would be sent to prison. (The time they spent in the concentration camps would be subtracted from their sentences.) This was very different from how other Holocaust victims were treated. Other victims were compensated (given money) for the loss of family members and educational opportunities. Gay victims were treated like criminals.\n\nThe Nazis also killed many people who did not agree with the Nazis' political beliefs. They thought of these people as political enemies of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe Nazis were especially cruel to people who spoke out or fought against the Nazi government. When they arrested these people, the Nazis often killed them right after questioning them. Sometimes, the Nazis killed their families too. People who were not killed right away were sent to the political People's Court. This court was famous for the number of death sentences it gave.\n\nThe Nazis thought of leftists as political enemies. Leftists included communists, socialists, and social democrats/democratic socialists. German communists and Social Democrats were some of the first people to be sent to Dachau concentration camp. The Nazi Party hated communism, and was worried that German communists would be loyal to the Soviet Union, a communist country. The Nazis spread rumors about communist violence to get the Enabling Act of 1933 passed. This law gave Adolf Hitler his first powers as a dictator.\n\nHitler and the Nazis also hated German leftists because they did not agree with the Nazis' racism. When the Nazis took over a place, communists, socialists and social democrats/democratic socialists were usually some of the first people they abused. Sometimes they would murder leftists right away.\n\nAs part of their religious beliefs, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to serve in the German Army, salute the Nazi flag, or say \"Heil Hitler\" (\"Hail Hitler\"). They refused to go along with Nazi beliefs and laws that went against their religious beliefs.\n\nBecause of this, many Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps. Between 2,500 and 5,000 Witnesses died in the concentration camps.\n\nThe Nazis also attacked the Catholic Church during The Holocaust.. Hitler wanted to destroy Catholicism and Christianity in Nazi Germany, and make Nazi Germany pagan instead. Thousands of German clergy, nuns, and Catholic leaders were arrested after the Nazis took over.\n\nIn 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, beginning World War II. Poland was mostly Catholic. The Nazis wanted to destroy Poland. They started by destroying the Catholic Church in Poland. They arrested the Church's leaders and closed churches and monasteries. In 1940, the Nazis created a special barracks just for priests at Dachau concentration camp. Of 2,720 clergy imprisoned at Dachau, almost all (94.88 percent) were Catholic. About 1,700 were Polish priests; half of them died or were killed at Dachau. The Nazis even made it illegal for priests anywhere to give Catholic sacraments to Polish people. At least one German priest was sent to Dachau for taking a confession from a Polish Catholic.\n\nIn 1933, Germany had made an agreement with the Holy See to protect Catholicism in Nazi Germany. However, the Nazis often broke this agreement. They shut down the Catholic press, schools, political parties and youth groups in Germany amid murder and mass arrests.\n\nThe Church was treated especially badly in lands that Germany took over. In Austria, Catholic property was taken, Catholic organizations were closed, and many priests were sent to Dachau. In Czechoslovakia, the Nazis refused to let people follow religious orders; closed schools; made religious teachings illegal; and sent priests to concentration camps. Catholic people, bishops, clergy, and nuns protested and attacked Nazi policies. \n\nIn 1942, Dutch bishops protested the mistreatment of the Jews. When the Dutch Archbishop refused to obey the Nazis, the Gestapo rounded up Catholic \"Jews\" and sent 92 to Auschwitz A Dutch Catholic nun named Edith Stein was murdered at Auschwitz. So was Maximilian Kolbe, a Polish priest. Both were eventually made into Catholic saints by Pope John Paul II in the 1980s. Other Catholic victims of the Holocaust have also been beatified, including some of the Polish priests who died at Dachau.\n\nSome Protestant Churches agreed with Nazi ideas. Others did not. To try to take over Protestantism in Germany, the Nazis formed the National Reich Church: an official state church that taught a state religion based on Nazism. The Reich Church:\n\nThey fired all clergy members who were not \"Aryan.\" Church members called themselves \"German Christians\" and said they had \"the swastika on their chest and the cross in their heart.\" \n\nProtestant groups that disagreed with Nazi ideas formed the Confessing Church, a group of German churches. The Nazis persecuted the Confessing Church. In May 1936, the Confessing Church sent a letter to Hitler criticizing his actions. The Nazis reacted by:\n\nMost pastors and churches were not members of either the Reich Church or the Confessing Church. Pastors who spoke out against what the Nazis were doing were threatened, arrested, and sometimes sent to concentration camps.\n\nIn 1937, the Nazis made it illegal to practice the Bahá'í Faith. The Nazis closed all Bahá'í organizations in Germany. The Nazis did not like the Bahá'í Faith because it taught pacifism. \n\nThroughout the Holocaust, Bahá'ís were arrested and given very expensive fines. The Nazis also continued to close their organizations.\n\nThe Nazis blamed Freemasonry for Germany losing World War I. They said the Freemasons' leaders were part of a conspiracy with Jewish people to take over Germany. In 1941, Adolf Hitler decided that Masons were political enemies. The Nazis sent tens of thousands of Masons to concentration camps. Between 80,000 to 200,000 Freemasons were killed.\n\nThis table estimates the total number of deaths caused by The Holocaust.\n", "id": "533095", "title": "Holocaust victims"}

This amendment has three parts that each grant specific rights. The excessive bail clause limits excessive bail for any person arrested for a crime but has not yet been placed on trial. The excessive fines clause is intended to limit fines imposed by state and federal governments on persons who have been convicted of a crime. The most controversial and most important part is the cruel and unusual punishment clause. The Eighth Amendment applies to criminal punishment and not to most civil procedures.\n\nThe wording of the Eighth Amendment is almost the same as three of the provisions in the English Bill of Rights of 1689. These provisions were based on the case of Titus Oates, whose lies under oath caused the execution of many innocent people. Because the English authorities did not want to make honest people fear to give evidence in court, he was not put to death. While his punishment included those considered ordinary at the time, the combination of these punishments were applied in an excessive and brutal way. Oates was convicted of sedition, thrown into prison to remain there. However, after James II of England became king in 1685, he was tried again, this time for perjury. In addition to being imprisoned for life, he was to be \"whipped through the streets of London five days a year for the remainder of his life.\" The first use of the provision of the English Bill of Rights was the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776.\n\nBail is the amount of money, property or bond that a defendant has to give to the court to guarantee his or her appearance at trial. The bail put up by the defendant may be recovered at the end of the trial. But if a defendant fails to appear at the time the trial is scheduled, the bail is forfeited and the defendant may face additional penalties. A judge, when setting the amount of bail, has to consider several factors. These include the nature of the offense, how much evidence there is against the accused and what ties the defendant has to the community. The judge must also take into account the defendant's ability to pay the amount of the bail and how likely it is the defendant will simply flee and not stand trial. All defendants are presumed innocent. Setting bail for an unreasonable amount would restrict the freedom and ability of the defendant to make a living as well as make it difficult to support his or her family.\n\nThis clause limits the government's power to set fines, which are payments for a punishment or offense. The amount of the fine must be proportional to the seriousness of the offense. A fine violates this clause if it is grossly disproportional to the nature of the defendant's offense.\n\nIn 1993, in \"Austin v. United States\", the United States Supreme Court ruled that this clause applied also to civil procedures. In doing this the Court reversed not only its own previous rulings but also those by several circuit courts of appeal.\n\nThe phrase \"cruel and unusual punishments\" was first used in 1789 in the English Bill of Rights. In 1776, George Mason added it to the Virginia Declaration of Rights. In 1791, this same prohibition became the central part of the Eighth Amendment. Patrick Henry was among those who argued that prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment should be part of the Bill of Rights. Otherwise the new federal government could use torture to get confessions. Torture was still being used at the time by Spain, France and Germany. The United States should not follow their example. Because of these arguments this was added to the Eighth Amendment. Very few would disagree that the use of rack, thumbscrews or the gibbet are cruel and unusual punishments and clearly violate the Eighth Amendment. But past that point it becomes controversial as to what is and what is not cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nCruel and unusual punishment was not clearly defined when the Eighth Amendment was passed. But it was discussed. Representative Livermore pointed out on the floor of the House of Representatives that the wording was vague. He asked: \"It is sometimes necessary to hang a man, villains often deserve a whipping, and perhaps having their ears cut off, but are we in the future to be prevented from inflicting those punishments because they are 'cruel'?\" But despite his objections the vague language was left in the amendment. \n\nIn 1910, in \"Weems v. United States\", the Supreme Court admitted that “what constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment has not been exactly decided.” The Supreme Court began using the \"evolving standards of decency\" test. In \"Trop v Dulles\" (1958) the Court agreed with the view that what are prohibited \"cruel and unusual punishments\" should change over time based on punishments that offend society's \"evolving sense of decency.\" Very recently the courts have been reluctant to keep the term \"unusual\" in their judicial interpretations.\n\nOriginalists find that evaluating whether a punishment is cruel and unusual still come under the evolving standards test and public opinion. In \"Coker v. Georgia\" (1977) the Supreme Court held that the death penalty is unconstitutional for those convicted of rape. This was based largely on the fact only one of the 50 states used this sentence. Even then, juries in that state did not use it very often.\n\nWaterboarding has been seen as torture since the Spanish Inquisition. US Soldiers who were caught waterboarding in the Philippines in 1901, or during the Vietnam War, in 1968, were put on trial. When done by other governments the US has not failed to call it torture. The Bush administration maintained it was not bound by the constitutional test outside of the United States. Justice Antonin Scalia had said in an interview with the BBC that he did not see anything in the constitution that prohibited torture of detainees. Not when it was for the purpose of gaining information. He said it would be unconstitutional if it were inflicted as a punishment, however. At his inauguration in 2009, US President Barack Obama pledged to end “enhanced interrogation techniques” by the CIA and to close Guantánamo through executive orders. \n", "id": "533180", "title": "Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

The actions of non-player characters are generally chosen by the game itself in video games, or based on rules followed by a gamemaster in tabletop role-playing games. The player character acts as a fictional, different body for the player using it.\n\nMost video games have one player character for each person playing the game. Some games offer a group of player characters for the player to choose from, letting player control one of them at a time. Where more there is more than one player character to choose, the characters may have different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses to make the gameplay different with each.\n\nA player character may sometimes be based on a real person, such as in sports games that use the names and looks of real sports people. Historical people and leaders may sometimes appear as characters too, such as in strategy or empire building games like Sid Meier's \"Civilization\" series.

It is sold under the brand names Antabuse and Antabus.\n\nDisulfiram works by making people feel very sick if they drink alcohol. It is not a cure for alcoholism. Usually, alcoholics who take disulfiram also need to get counseling and support.\n\nWhen a person gets treatment for alcoholism, disulfiram may be part of their treatment plan. However, the person has to go through alcohol withdrawal first. It is not safe to take disulfiram if a person has had any alcohol in the past 12 hours.\n\nWhen a person takes disulfiram, they get very sick if they drink any alcohol. They will start feeling sick 5 to 30 minutes after they drink. Usually, the more a person drank, the sicker they will feel. Their symptoms may include:\nThese symptoms can last anywhere from a half hour to a few hours.\n\nOne of the symptoms of alcoholism is wanting alcohol very, very badly. This is called craving. An alcoholic feels like they need alcohol to live.\n\nOne problem with disulfiram is that it does not stop alcohol cravings. If an alcoholic takes disulfiram, they will keep craving alcohol, but will get very sick if they do drink. Many alcoholics solve this problem by just not taking disulfiram. One year-long study done in 1986 found that disulfiram did not seem to work. However, the researchers found that only 20% of the alcoholics actually took their disulfiram. The other 80% stopped taking disulfiram so they could drink alcohol without getting sick. \nHowever, later studies found that when disulfiram is supervised - when someone watches an alcoholic take their disulfiram - the medication works. Alcoholics getting supervised disulfiram drink less, go longer periods of time without drinking, and participate more in other treatments than alcoholics getting un-supervised disulfiram. Family members, friends, clinics, or courts can make sure that alcoholics take their disulfiram.\n\nDisulfiram tablets can also be placed under the skin by a surgeon. These tablets release disulfiram continuously for up to 12 weeks. This makes it impossible for an alcoholic to decide not to take their disulfiram so they can drink.\n\nAlso, a doctor can prescribe a newer drug, like naltrexone, along with disulfiram. Naltrexone does block alcohol cravings. The two drugs can work together to make it easier for the alcoholic not to drink.\n\nThe United States National Institutes of Health says:\n\"Disulfiram is not a cure for alcoholism. When [disulfiram is] used alone, without proper motivation and supportive therapy, it is unlikely that it will have any [real] effect on the drinking pattern of the chronic alcoholic.\"\n\nJust taking disulfiram is usually not enough to keep an alcoholic from drinking. Disulfiram works best when an alcoholic also:\n\nDisulfiram may help other medical problems too.

They left school to march for civil rights. Police officers tried to stop them by using fire hoses and police dogs to attack the children. Then the police arrested as many as they could, released them only to have them marching again the next day. They marched to protest the city of Birmingham, Alabama's racial segregation laws. The Children's Crusade proved to be more effective than earlier civil rights protests. A few days later, on May 10, city officials agreed to desegregate the stores in downtown Birmingham.\n\nReverend James Bevel of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) suggested to Martin Luther King, Jr., who was directing the Birmingham desegregation efforts at the time, that they try a protest made up of children. In May of 1963, over 3,000 youths and teenagers gathered in Birmingham to march on city hall. While marching students faced off against police officers armed with dogs and fire hoses.

They are usually called SSRIs. They are used to treat depression, anxiety disorders, and some other problems.\n\nIn many countries, SSRIs are prescribed more often than any other type of antidepressant.\n\nExamples of common SSRIs are fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celena), and escitalopram (Lexapro).\n\nSSRIs are mainly used to treat:\n\nAntidepressants like SSRIs are a first-choice treatment for people with very bad depression. When a person's depression is not as bad, but counseling has not helped them, antidepressants can help.\n\nScientists do not agree on whether SSRIs work for mild depression that does not last very long.\n\nSSRIs work well for generalized anxiety disorder. They help decrease people' anxiety. This can help them participate in counseling to learn how to deal with their anxiety.\n\nSSRIs also work well for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). They are the first-choice treatment for people with very bad OCD. Like with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, SSRIs are not a cure; people need to participate in counseling and other treatments too. However, people with OCD who took an SSRI are about twice as likely to do well in treatment than people not taking an SSRI.\n\nFluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil) are the only medications the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Medications alone usually will not cure PTSD; they need to be combined with counseling. Except for Prozac and Paxil, most other SSRIs do not seem to help PTSD.\n\nWhen a person starts to get treatment for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder, SSRIs can be a helpful first step. Over short periods of time, they can decrease some of the symptoms of these eating disorders. For example, for a short while, people taking SSRIs do less binge eating. However, SSRIs only seem to help for a short period of time.\n\nSSRIs do not seem to help anorexia nervosa. However, if a person with anorexia also has depression, anxiety, or OCD, SSRIs could help treat those problems.\n\nResearch shows that two SSRIs can help treat chronic pain. These SSRIs are paroxetine (Paxil) and citalopram (Celexa). Other SSRIs, like fluoxetine (Prozac), do not help chronic pain.\n\nAnother group of antidepressants, called tricyclic antidepressants, treat chronic pain better than SSRIs do. However, tricyclic antidepressants have many more side effects than SSRIs do. Because of this, some doctors prescribe paroxetine or citalopram for chronic pain, because the side effects are not as bad.\n\nSerotonin is an important chemical in the human body. It exists in different parts of the body. In the brain, it helps control a person's mood, appetite, and sleep.\n\nMany researchers think low levels of serotonin in the brain can help cause depression. If a person's brain does not have enough serotonin, the serotonin cannot do its job of controlling their mood. This can make the person depressed. (It can also cause other symptoms of depression, like not having any appetite, not being able to sleep, or sleeping too much - because serotonin controls appetite and sleep too.)\n\nSSRIs increase the amount of serotonin that the brain can use. Researchers think that in depressed people, this brings the amounts of serotonin in their brains back to normal. \n\nHowever, depression is complicated. So are the other problems SSRIs treat, like anxiety disorders. There is no one cause for these disorders. They are usually caused by a mixture of things. This is why SSRIs are not a cure. Most people also need counseling to help treat the other causes of their depression, anxiety, or other problems.\n\nEach SSRI has its own possible adverse effects (side effects). It is important to remember that every medication has many possible side effects. This does not mean that everyone who takes the medication will have side effects. It only means that \"some\" people who take these medications have these symptoms.\n\nHere are some examples of adverse effects that SSRIs can cause.\n\nTaking SSRIs makes children and young adults more likely to think about suicide and try to kill themselves. This is true for young adults up to age 24. \n\nIn 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) looked at clinical trials on children with major depressive disorder. They found that children taking SSRIs had:\n\nIn both the United States and the United Kingdom, only three SSRIs are approved to treat children:\n\nScientists do not agree on whether SSRIs make adults more likely to think about suicide or try to kill themselves. The FDA says that people over age 24 are not more likely to think about suicide when they take SSRIs.\n\nSSRIs often cause sexual problems. These problems include erectile dysfunction, not being able to have an orgasm, not wanting to have sex, and not enjoying sex. \n\nSexual problems are one of the most common reasons why people stop taking SSRIs.\n\nWhen a person takes SSRIs along with anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medications, they are a little more likely to have bleeding problems. For example, the person is more likely to have bleeding in their gastrointestinal tract, or to bleed after they have surgery. Bleeding problems are most likely in people who:\n\nMost SSRIs can also make a person:\n\nIf a person stops taking SSRIs suddenly, they can get serotonin discontinuation syndrome. This can cause:\nA person and their doctor should come up with a plan for how to stop taking an SSRI. If possible, the person should slowly decrease the amount of medication they are taking, bit by bit, over a few weeks. \n\nIf a person overdoses on an SSRI, they can poison themselves or even die.\n\nSSRI overdoses can cause:\n\nIt is not safe to take some drugs with SSRIs. Taking these drugs with SSRIs can cause serotonin syndrome. Here are some examples of drugs that cannot be taken with SSRIs:\n\n", "id": "533539", "title": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor"}

The Court ruled a New York State law that set the maximum numbers of hours bakers could work per week was unconstitutional. The Court held that the right of a person to make a contract as a part of his or her business is a liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. With few exceptions this included the right to buy and sell labor. The decision was controversial and it made the Supreme Court an adversary to legislatures for over 30 years. Repeatedly, the Court struck down laws that regulated labor saying they violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This was called the \"Lochner Era\"; so-named for this decision. \n\nA statute was enacted by the State of New York which limited the number of hours bakers could work to 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week. The law was a part of the Bakershop Act passed in 1895. The Journeymen Bakers’ Union wanted to limit the number of hours a day union bakers could work. Bakers were then typically paid by the day. The work had a number of health and safety risks due to dust, fumes, the heat of the ovens, etc. The lobbying was successful and in May 1895 the Governor of New York signed the bill into law. \n\nJoseph Lochner, a baker in Utica, New York, found the law made it hard to operate his business. He and his bakers often had to work more than 60 hours a week. Lochner was charged with violating the state law. He filed the appeal because he felt the law was unconstitutional because it violated his Civil liberties of \"Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness\". The case went before the Supreme Court on February 23rd and was decided on April 17, 1905.

It is one of the major nutrient systems of the world, bringing nutrients up into the surface waters of the ocean. This supports an extraordinary abundance of marine life.

This is because the subtropical center of high pressure is displaced during the summer.\n\nAbout 18-20% of the world’s fish catch comes from the Humboldt Current. The species are mostly pelagic: sardines, anchovies and jack mackerel. This high productivity supports other important fishery resources as well as marine mammals (eared seals and cetaceans) and seabirds.

Groups who commit crimes against humanity do not hurt just one person, or just a few people. They want to hurt an entire group of people that they do not like. For example, in Nazi Germany during The Holocaust, the Nazis tried to kill all of the Jewish people in Europe. This is an example of a crime against humanity.\n\nUnlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can happen during peace or war.\n\nNot every crime committed against a big group is a crime against humanity. To be crimes against humanity, crimes must be:\n\nCrimes against humanity must also be committed against a civilian population (people who are not soldiers).\n\nToday, crimes against humanity can include:\nHowever, in the past, not all of these things were thought of as crimes against humanity. For example, crimes against humanity were first listed in 1945. However, it was not until 2002 that many forms of sexual abuse (like sexual slavery) were included as crimes against humanity.\n\nThe words \"crime against humanity\" were first used after the Armenian Genocide. In 1915, the government of the Ottoman Empire killed up to 1.5 million Armenian people. The government killed men or made them do forced labor. They also forced Armenian women and children to leave their homes. On the way, the Ottoman military raped, robbed, and killed civilians.\n\nOn May 24, 1915, Britain, France, and Russia accused the Ottoman Empire of committing \"a crime against humanity.\"\n\nAfter World War II ended, many people who participated in The Holocaust were captured and put on trial at the Nuremberg Trials. However, the people running the Trials had to figure out how to deal with the crimes these people had committed during the Holocaust. At that time, courts could try people for war crimes. But the courts had never seen a case where a government committed such awful crimes against its own citizens.\n\nTo allow the court to charge the Nazis for these crimes, the court passed a law. This law said that the court could put people on trial for crimes against humanity as well as war crimes. It defined \"crimes against humanity\" as:\nApartheid is a system of keeping one race separate from another. One race has all the power, and the other race has none. This continues through racist laws and attitudes. \n\nSouth Africa practiced apartheid for decades. The government passed laws saying that different races could not live in the same areas, have sex, get married, go to school together, go to the same beaches, or even go to the same hospitals. The schools, hospitals, and other places where non-white people were allowed to go were much worse than the places for white people.\n\nIn 1976, the United Nations General Assembly ruled that apartheid is a crime against humanity. Part of its ruling said:\n\"Considering ... that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all ... rights and freedoms ... [we] declare that apartheid is a crime against humanity.\" \n\nNo one has ever been tried for apartheid-related crimes against humanity.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) opened in 2002. Its job is to look into war crimes and crimes against humanity. If possible, it tries and punishes people for these crimes. When the ICC was formed, it created a new list of crimes against humanity. This was the first time that any type of sexual abuse, other than rape, was included as a crime against humanity. The ICC includes all of these as crimes against humanity:\n\nThe ICC also includes all of these crimes as war crimes, if they happen as part of a war.\n\nIn 2008, the United Nations Security Council ruled that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can [be] war crimes, crimes against humanity or a [part of] genocide.”\n\n", "id": "533816", "title": "Crimes against humanity"}

It deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\".\n\nThe idea of sovereign immunity originated in English common law. It was also proposed by political theorists like Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin. The founding fathers of the Constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits. Several Anti-Federalists were afraid that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits \"between a State and Citizens of another State\", would override that doctrine. \n\nThe Eleventh Amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the Supreme Court in \"Chisholm v. Georgia\" (1793). In \"Chisholm\" the Court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against US states. Also, that states were not immune to these cases. The Eleventh Amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country. It says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state.\n\nIn \"Ex parte Young\", the Supreme Court decision allowed suits in federal courts against officials acting on behalf of states of the union to proceed despite the State's sovereign immunity, when the State acted unconstitutionally.\n\nThe Eleventh Amendment is one of five amendments that overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions.\n\n", "id": "534066", "title": "Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

Because of this, the term \"wage\" sometimes refers to all forms of employee payment. However, a wage is different to a salary or commission. A salary is where the employer pays an arranged amount at regular intervals (such as a week or month) regardless of hours worked or amount of work done. Commission is usually an extra payment based on the performance of the worker or product. Waged employees may also receive \"tips\" paid directly by clients. They will usually not get the same benefits as those paid with a salary, such as annual leave and sick leave.\n\nWages are usually paid by the hour. This is called an hourly wage. Wages paid by the day are still common. Wage rates may be influenced by market forces (supply and demand), laws, and tradition. Market forces are perhaps more dominant in the United States, while tradition, social structure and seniority, perhaps play a greater role in Japan. In many countries, laws set a minimum wage that all employers must pay their workers. This means that employers cannot pay workers a lower rate than the minimum wage; however, they can pay them a higher rate.

It was ratified by the state legislatures on June 15, 1804. It provided new procedures for electing the President and Vice President. Before the amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast a single vote. The candidate who received the largest number of votes became the President. The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes became the Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment changed the process to the current system whereby one vote is cast for the President and one for the Vice President. \n\nThe Constitutional Convention of 1787 went over several different proposals for electing the President. Some wanted Congress to choose the President. Other suggestions included selection by the state legislatures, by the state governors or by a congressional committee. Near the end of the convention the question was turned over to a committee called the Committee of Eleven for leftover business. They devised a system called the Electoral College. The plan was accepted and was added to the Constitution.\n\nIn 1789, the Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first president. He was reelected in 1792. In both cases he was the only president to receive all of the electoral votes. In the 1796 election, Washington declined to run. His Vice President, John Adams, and his running mate Thomas Pinckney ran for President and Vice President respectively. Alexander Hamilton tried to use his influence to get Pinckney more votes, making Adams the Vice President again. But the scheme backfired when Thomas Jefferson got more votes than Pinckney, but Adams won more of the electoral votes. This made Adams the President and Jefferson the Vice President.\n\nThe 1800 Presidential election showed the deep problems in the electoral college system. Jefferson ran against Adams again. Both had running mates. Pinckney was again the running mate of Adams for the Federalist Party. Aaron Burr was Jefferson's running mate for the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes creating a tie between two candidates from the same political party. Under the Constitution, the matter was to be decided by the House of Representatives. In the House, the two tied again in 35 votes. Only on the 36th ballot was the deadlock broken and Jefferson was elected president. \n\nThe solution to the problem became the Twelfth Amendment. It was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803. Three days later it was submitted to the states for ratification. Fourteen of the seventeen states (at the time) ratified it and the amendment was added to the Constitution on September 25, 1804.\n\nThe Electoral College remained much the same under the Twelfth Amendment. But the process for choosing a president and vice president changed. Under the Twelfth Amendment an elector must cast separate votes for the President and Vice President. Also, electors are not allowed to vote for both candidates on the same ticket (both belonging to the same party). Also spelled out is who is not eligible to be President. If nobody gets the majority of the votes, the process remains the same as before; the House of Representatives decides.\n\n", "id": "534238", "title": "Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

It was one of the Reconstruction Amendments.\n\nNowhere in the original Constitution or the Bill of Rights were Americans given the right to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment gave African-American men the right to vote. But not until the 1960s did judicial interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment conclude the right to vote was a fundamental right of all citizens.\n\nThe reasons behind the omissions of voting rights in the Bill of Rights and Constitution is that including them would have been too controversial at the time. Each state had different rules for who could vote. Some allowed free blacks the right to vote. Others allowed women the right to vote. A few states required ownership of property in order to vote.\n\nIn the Election of 1868, Republican Party candidate, Ulysses S. Grant, won the presidency by only a narrow majority of the popular vote. He received support from free black voters in the South. Without that support, he probably would have lost the election. At the time blacks could not vote in the Northern states. The Republican party needed help to stay in power and thought that black votes would help. At the time Republicans controlled both the Senate and House. The proposed amendment was passed by Congress in 1869 and sent to the states for ratification. It was quickly ratified by three-quarters of the states in early 1870. Part of the reason why is that Republicans also controlled the state governments in the South. Southern Democrats were not able to block the measure.\n\nAfter passage, the Fifteenth Amendment did not have much of any impact on black voting in the South for nearly a century. Southerners used various methods including terrorism, poll taxes and grandfather clauses to prevent blacks from voting. Congress and the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down voting restrictions. For example, in a landmark decision in \"Smith v. Allwright\" (1944), The Court decision made it unconstitutional to keep African-Americans from voting in a Democratic Party primary in Texas. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which stated that all Americans had the right to vote, including African-Americans. But overcoming these problems on a case-by-case basis was proving to be unsuccessful. As soon as one form of discrimination was stopped, a new one appeared in its place. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, removed further barriers to minorities voting. It was amended five times by Congress to extend its protections as needed.\n\n", "id": "534328", "title": "Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

It is north of Yangon. Mandalay is on the east side of the Irrawaddy River. In 2014, there were 1,225,553 people living there.\n\nThe name \"Mandalay\" comes from the nearby hill called Mandalay Hill. \"Mandalay\" may come from the Pali language. Some people think that the name \"Mandalay\" comes from the Pali word \"mandala\". Other people think that the name comes from \"Mount Mindara\". Mindara is a mountain in Hindu mythology.\n\nThe original name of the city was Yadanabon (, ). This name came from the Pali word \"Ratanapūra\" (). \"Ratanapūra\" means \"City of Gems.\" The city also had another name: Lay Kyun Aung Myei (, ). This means \"Victorious Land over the Four Islands.\"\n\nMandalay was started by King Mindon. He started the city on 13 February 1857. He built Mandalay as the new capital city of the Kingdom of Burma.\n\nMindon's city was in size. There were rivers on each side. It had 144 square blocks in a grid. In the middle was a palace that was 16 square blocks in size.\n\nThe palace had four walls that were each long. Around the walls was a moat that was wide and deep. Each wall had turrets (towers) for watchmen. These turrets were placed every . Each turret had a spire made of gold. Each side had three gates and five bridges across the moat.\n\nThe king also built some other buildings in the city. These buildings were the Kuthodaw Pagoda, the \"Pahtan-haw Shwe Thein\" upasampada hall, the \"Thudamma\" \"Good Dharma\" zayats (), and a library for the Pāli Canon. A \"zayat\" is a building where Buddhism is taught.\n\nIn June 1857, the king moved the royal palace to Mandalay. The palace had been in Amarapura. The building was taken apart. Each piece was moved by elephants to Mandalay. The palace was put back together and finished on 23 May 1859. The palace is now at the bottom of Mandalay Hill.\n\nMandalay was the capital for 26 years. It was the last royal capital of the Konbaung Dynasty. (The Konbaung Dynasty were the last rulers of the Kingdom of Burma before it was taken over by the British Empire.) On 28 November 1885, the British conquered Burma. This ended the Third Anglo-Burmese War. King Thibaw Min and Queen Supayalat were sent into exile.\n\nMandalay was still an important city in British Burma. The city of Rangoon became the capital of Burma.\n\nThe British wanted to make Mandalay an important commercial city. They did not want it to be important for politics, education, or other reasons. Mandalay was connected to Yangon by railroad in 1889. The first college in Mandalay wasn't built until 1925.\n\nThe royal palace was looted by the British. All of the treasures were stolen. Some treasures can be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The British changed the name of the palace to Fort Dufferin. British soldiers used the palace as a barracks (a place to camp.)\n\nMandalay was the most important city for Burmese culture during the time the British were in charge. It was also the most important place for Buddhist learning. The Burmese people saw Mandalay as a symbol. Between World War I and World War II, there were many protests in Mandalay against the British.\n\nDuring the time the British were in charge, many people moved to Mandalay from India. (India was also a British colony.) From 1904 to 1905, a plague happened. About one third of the people of Mandalay left to get away from the disease.\n\nDuring World War II, Mandalay was bombed by the Japanese. The British moved all of their airplanes to India. Mandalay had no defenses against the Japanese air raids. On 3 April 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed the city. Three-fifths (3/5) of the houses were destroyed. More than 2,000 civilians (people who are not military) were killed.\n\nThe Japanese soon invaded Burma. The Imperial Japanese Army took over the city of Mandalay. They were in charge from May 1942 until March 1945. The palace citadel was made into a supply depot. (A supply depot is a building that stores supplies like food and machines.)\n\nThe Allied forces bombed the city after the Japanese took it over. Much of the palace was destroyed. Only the royal mint and watch tower were not destroyed. The palace was rebuild in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1948, the British left Burma. Mandalay was still the most important city for culture, education, and commerce in Upper Burma.\n\nUntil the 1990s, most students went to university in Mandalay. Until 1991, there were only three universities in Upper Burma: Mandalay University, The University of Medicine, Mandalay, and the Defense Services Academy. All of these universities are in Mandalay. Only some other cities had schools called \"Degree Colleges.\" These were small schools that were part of Mandalay University. These colleges had classes in a small number of subjects.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1988, Ne Win was in charge of the government. He was very isolationist. This means that he did not want Myanmar to be part of global trade or tourism. In the 1980s, Mandalay was the second biggest city in Myanmar. It looked like a town with low buildings, dusty streets, and more bicycles than cars.\n\nDuring the 1980s, there were two big fires. In May 1981, a fire destroyed more than 6,000 buildings. 36,000 people were left homeless. On 24 March 1984, there was another fire. This fire destroyed 2,700 buildings. 23,000 more people were made homeless.\n\nFires are still a big problem. In February 2008, there was another big fire in Mandalay. It destroyed the Yadanabon Market. This was the second-biggest market in the city. In February 2009, a fire destroyed 320 houses. More than 1,600 people were made homeless.\n\nThe fires during the 1980s destroyed a lot of buildings. This made a lot of land empty. Many Chinese people in Burma bought this land. A lot of these people had come from Yunnan in China. Many Chinese people came to Upper Burma and Mandalay from Yunnan and Sichuan in the 1990s. 250,000 to 350,000 people from Yunnan came to Mandalay in the 1990s. Today, about 30% to 40% of the people of Mandalay are Chinese. The native Burmese people complain that Mandalay is now like a part of China.\n\nThe Chinese have rebuilt the parts of the city that burned down. They built apartment buildings, hotels, and shopping centers. They helped make Mandalay again an important city for trade and commerce. It now connects trade for Upper Burma, Lower Burma, China, and India.\n\nMandalay has grown much bigger over time. It now includes what used to be Amarapura. (Amarapura was where King Mindon's capital city used to be before he moved it to Mandalay.) Mandalay celebrated its 150th birthday on 15 May 2009 at 4:31:36 am.\n\nThere are many important places and buildings in Mandalay.\n\nThe royal palace in Mandalay is a very important building. A lot of it was burned down during World War II. The royal mint and watch tower did not burn down. The rest of the buildings were rebuilt.\n\nThe Mandalay Palace's name in Burmese is \"Mya Nan San Kyaw\" ( ; \"The Famed Royal Emerald Palace\"). It is also called (), or the \"Great Golden Royal Palace\".\n\nToday the palace is an important symbol of Mandalay. Many tourists and visitors come to see it.\n\nThe Atumashi Monastery is a Buddhist monastery. A monastery is a building where monks (holy men) live, work, and pray. This place is a \"kyaung\", a special kind of monastery. The name means \"inimitable \"vihara\".\"\n\nThe monastery burned down in 1890. Only the plinth (bottom platform) did not burn. The government decided to rebuild the monastery. They started building on 2 May 1995. It was finished being built in June of 1996.\n\nMandalay Hill is a big hill in Mandalay. It is a holy hill. There is a legend about the hill. The Buddha visited the hill and made a prophecy. He said that some day a great city would be built at the bottom of the hill.\n\nThe hill is tall. There is a road to the top. There are many temples, monasteries, and pagodas built on the hill.\nThe Kuthodaw Pagoda is a very large pagoda. It was built by King Mindon in 1857. It was designed to look like the Shwezigon Pagoda in Nyaung U.\n\nThere are 729 rocks around the pagoda. Each rock is smooth and has writing on it. The writing are the words of the \"Tipiṭaka\". (The \"Tipiṭaka\" are the Buhhdist holy books.) These stone rocks are the \"world's largest book.\"\nThe Mahamuni Buddha Temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples. It has an important Buddha statue. The statue was made during the life of the Gautama Buddha. The Gauthama Buddha hugged the statue seven times. This caused the statue to come to life.\n\nBuddhists believe that the statue is alive because of this. They call it the Mahamuni Sacred Living Image. This makes the Mahamuni Temple the most holy pagoda in Mandalay.\n\nThe temple was built by King Bodawpaya in 1784. The Buddha is sitting. It is tall.\n\nNear the bottom of Mandalay Hill is the Kyauktawgyi Pagoda. It was built by King Mindon from 1853 to 1878. It was carved out of one big block of marble. Around it are 80 arahants.\n\nThe Yadanabon Zoological Garden is a small zoo in Mandalay. It is in between the palace and Mandalay Hill. It is the only zoo in the world that has Burmese roofed turtles.\n\nThe Shwenandaw Monastery (, ; lit. \"Golden Palace Monastery\") is an important Buddhist monastery. It was built by King Thibaw Min in 1880. It is made from teak, a kind of wood. Inside of it are many carvings on the walls and roofs. The carvings show Buddhist myths.\n\nIn 2007, the United Nations (UN) guessed that there were about 1 million people living in Mandalay. In 2014, the Myanmar government counted all of the people in the country for a census. They found that there were 1,225,133 people living in Mandalay then. The UN thinks that there will be 1.5 million people in Mandalay in 2025.\n\nMandalay has always been an important city for the Bamar people. Most of the people who have lived in Mandalay are Burman people. Lots of Chinese people have been moving to Mandalay. The Chinese have been coming for the past 20 years. Now there are more Chinese people than Burman people in Mandalay.\n\nToday, 40-50% of the people in Mandalay are Chinese. About 30% of Mandalay's people are Yunnanese. The rest of the people in Mandalay are probably Burman. There are also a lot of Burmese Indians in Mandalay. (These are Indian people who live in Myanmar.)\n\nPeople in Mandalay speak the Burmese language. A lot of people also speak the Standard Chinese language. The Chinese language is used a lot in markets like Zegyo Market. People who have a lot of money and education also speak the English language.\n\nMandalay is in the country of Myanmar. It is by the side of the Irrawaddy river. Its coordinates are 21.98° North, 96.08° East.\n\nThe city is above sea level. It is in the same time zone as the rest of Mandalay: Myanmar Standard Time (MST), .\n\nMandalay is on a tectonic fault. This means that there are two tectonic plates that come together underneath the city. (A \"tectonic plate\" is a big piece of earth.) The tectonic fault underneath Mandalay is called the Sagaing Fault. It is where the India Plate and the Sunda Plate meet.\n\nA lot of earthquakes happen on tectonic faults. The biggest earthquake in Mandalay happened in 1956. That one was a magnitude 7 earthquake. That earthquake did a lot more damage to the city of Sagaing, which is nearby. It is now called the \"Great Sagaing Quake.\"\n\nMandalay has a tropical savanna climate. This means that the city has a wet season and a dry season. There is a lot of rain during the wet season. There is very little rain during the dry season. The wet season is from May to October. The dry season is from November to April.\n\nThe coldest month is January. The average temperature is . The hottest month is April. Then, the average temperature is .\n\nIt is very hot in April and May. Most days it is hotter than . Some days it is hotter than .\n\nThe hottest temperature ever in Mandalay was . The coldest temperature ever was .\n\nThere are some important books and poems that talk about Mandalay. Some of these are famous.\n\nRudyard Kipling wrote a poem called \"Mandalay.\" He wrote it in 1890. This poem has a famous saying in it: \"on the road to Mandalay.\"\n\nIn 1907, Oley Speaks wrote a song using the words of the poem. He called the song \"On the Road to Mandalay.\" The song is very famous. Frank Sinatra sang the song and called it \"Come Fly with Me\".\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote a novel called \"Burmese Days\". He wrote it in 1934. Orwell was part of the Indian Imperial Police. He was stationed in Mandalay. The novel is about his experiences (what he did and saw.) He also wrote some non-fiction essays and short stories. Some of these are \"A Hanging\" (1931) and \"Shooting an Elephant\" (1936).\n\nMandalay has three twin towns:\n\n", "id": "534409", "title": "Mandalay"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534413", "text": "Act of Congress\n\nAn Act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress according to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. The term can be used in other countries with a legislature called a \"Congress,\" such as the Congress of the Philippines. But most often the term is associated with the United States Congress. In the US, there are several steps from a bill or resolution becoming a law. It must first be passed by a majority of both of the houses of Congress. Then the bill or resolution is sent to get signed by the President. It becomes an Act of Congress by either the president's signature or, if the President does not return the bill or resolution within ten days.\n\nSenators and Representatives create thousands of written proposals each year for new laws. Called bills, only a few few ever make it all the way through the process to become a law. The Constitution requires only three steps: passing the House, passing the Senate and approval by the President. The actual process has become much more complicated. \n\nA bill may be proposed by anyone but only a member of Congress, called the bill's sponsor, may introduce them on the floor of one of the houses of Congress. A bill may be introduced in both the Senate and House at the same time. In theory, this saves time over sending it though one house, then the other. In each house of Congress, a bill is sent to a committee. A committee studies the bill and recommends changes. If a committee does nothing, the bill is considered \"dead\". A committee may also add other unrelated provisions to a bill called amendments. Committees usually divide themselves into smaller groups called subcommittees. The bill's sponsors then try to convince the subcommittees to approve the bill. They do this through hearings. If the bill passes through a committee it is sent to the floor for debate and a vote. A bill may either be passed by be defeated. If passed, it is sent to the other house of Congress to follow the same procedures.\n\nIn addition to bills, Congress also passes Acts of Congress called resolutions. There are three kinds: simple resolutions, joint resolutions and concurrent resolutions.\n\nThese are resolutions concerning the operation of either house of Congress. They are not sent to the President for his approval. Resolutions by the House of Representatives which affect that house are designated \"H.Res.\" followed by a number. Simple resolutions in the Senate are designated \"S. Res.\" followed by a number.\n\nA joint resolution may start either in the House or Senate. They are essentially the same as a bill. The only difference is a joint resolution that proposes an amendment to the US Constitution. They require a two-thirds majority vote in each house. Like a simple resolution, they are not sent to the President for his signature. They become effective when they are ratified by three-quarters of the states. A joint resolution that began in the House of Representatives is designated \"H.J.Res.\" followed by the number. A joint resolution started in the Senate is designated \"S.J.Res.\", followed by the number. Joint resolutions become law the same as bills.\n\nConcurrent resolutions start with either \"S.Con.Res.\" (Senate) or \"H.Con.Res.\" (House). They are numbered consecutively as they are introduced. Concurrent resolutions are those that affect the operations of both the House and Senate. They can also be used to create a temporary joint committee. Concurrent resolutions are not sent to the president for his signature and do not have the force of law.\n\n", "id": "534413", "title": "Act of Congress"}

This allows the federal government to collect a tax on personal income, no matter where that income came from. The Sixteenth Amendment overturned the 1895 Supreme Court landmark decision in \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co\". In \"Pollock\", the Court ruled that a 2 percent tax on incomes over $4,000 was unconstitutional. This was because the law the ruling struck down did not allow for apportionment, the court ruled against it. The Sixteenth Amendment allowed Congress to levy a uniform direct income tax without being subject to apportionment.\n\nWhen the framers of the Constitution were determining how the new government would be funded, they were trying to avoid a tax based on a person's income. In the Constitution, Article one, Sections 2 and 9 created the \"rule of apportionment\". On a practical basis this required Congress to tax the states based on each state's population instead of a tax on each person's income or property. For example, if a state made up four percent of the total population, they would be required to pay four percent of the total federal tax. The framers of the Constitution expected direct taxes to be used and defined the term broadly. However, they did not see that apportionment would cripple any attempt to collect direct taxes.\n\nBefore 1913, the bulk of federal revenues came from indirect taxes on goods. These include tariffs on goods imported into the country. They also included excise taxes on items like whiskey. Income taxes were not new in 1913. Congress had passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War to help pay for the war. Ten years later it was allowed to lapse. The Confederate States of America also had an income tax. Starting in 1863, the tax exempted the first $1,000 and charged a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption. A 2% tax was levied on all income over that amount.\n\nIn 1894, Congress passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act which included a flat rate federal income tax of 2 percent. A year later, the Supreme Court handed down their decision in \"Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.\". They ruled the tax unconstitutional because it was a direct tax and not apportioned to the population of each state.\n\nOn June 16, 1909, President Taft sent a message to the Senate which read:\n\nThe largest and most direct effect of the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment was it shifted power from the states to the federal government. States had income taxes before the federal government did. This kept the federal government weaker due to having less revenue than the states. Without the Sixteenth Amendment, the federal government would find it far more difficult to extend its military power to other parts of the world.\n", "id": "534448", "title": "Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

Excise taxes are commonly part of the retail price of a product such as gasoline, alcohol or cigarettes. Excise taxes may be charged by both state and federal governments.\n\nExcise taxes are different from sales tax in two important ways. First, excise is charged only on specific goods. Sales tax can apply to most things a person might buy although certain jurisdictions may exempt food or clothing. Excise taxes are usually applied to luxury goods or products linked to health issues such as tanning salons or cigarettes. Secondly, sales tax is charged as a percentage of the purchase price. An excise tax is usually a fixed amount added to the price. It can be hard to tell how much excise tax a person pays because it is part of the purchase price. Sales tax is added to the price and is usually shown on the receipt.\n\nIn the United States, excise taxes make up about 4 percent of all federal revenues. This is lower than many other countries.

For the first 125 years of the Constitution required US Senators to be elected by the state legislatures. A number of problems in the United States Senate created the need to change how Senators were elected from indirect to direct elections by the people of the United States.\n\nWhen the Constitution was adopted in 1788, Senators were to be elected by the state legislatures. This remained in effect for 125 years. By the late 19th century it became clear there were many problems with this procedure. In addition to long vacancies that lasted for months and even years, political machines had gained control over state legislatures. This corrupted the process and the Senate was seen as a \"millionaire's club\" who served private interests instead of the people. Beginning in the 1890s, the House of Representatives passed several resolutions for a constitutional amendment which proposed Senators be elected by direct election. The Senate refused to even take a vote on these proposals.\n\nAt this point, many states changed their strategy. Article Five of the United States Constitution offers two methods for amending the Constitution. In addition to the common method of a two-thirds vote by both houses of Congress, was another method. It stated that if two-thirds of the state legislatures apply for one, Congress must call a constitutional convention. The method had not been used before. When it appeared two-thirds of the states wanted the change, Congress acted. \n\nJoint resolution 39 was passed by the House of Representatives in 1911 proposing a constitutional amendment to directly elect US Senators. The Senate accepted the resolution but since it included a change, it went back to the House. The amended Joint resolution was sent to the states for ratification a year later. The required three-quarters of the states ratified the amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment became official on April 8, 1913.\n\nThe people of the United States are to elect two Senators from each state, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote in the Senate. There are 100 Senators and 100 votes. \"The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures\" means that anyone who can vote in a state election in their state, may also vote for a Senator. In the archaic language of the Constitution this was written in such a way to allow for states having different qualifications for persons eligible to vote for their Senator.\n\nThe clause. Previously, when vacancies occurred, several state legislatures were not able to agree on who would fill the position. Before the Seventeenth Amendment, vacancies could last for months and even years in some cases. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held. \n\nThis is a simple addition to prevent the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment from interrupting the election or term of any Senator chosen before the amendment was passed. The United States Senate elections, 1914 were the first nationwide popular elections for Senators.\n\n", "id": "534503", "title": "Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

The average atmospheric pressure of the Martian surface (6.0 mbar) is much lower than that of the Earth (1,013 mbar). The pressure is well below the Armstrong limit, meaning that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body: 98.6 °F (37.0 °C).\n\nThe Martian atmosphere contains 96% carbon dioxide, 1.9% argon, 1.9% nitrogen, and traces of oxygen, carbon monoxide, water and methane, and so on. Ever since the discovery of methane in 2003, scientists say that this might indicate life. It has also been suggested that is may be caused by geochemical processes, volcanic or hydrothermal activity.\n\nThe atmosphere of Mars is quite dusty, giving the Martian sky a light brown or orange-red color when seen from the surface.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534614", "text": "Article One of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle One of the United States Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government, the United States Congress. The Congress is a bicameral legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.\n\nSection 1 gives federal legislative power exclusively to Congress. Similar clauses are found in Articles II and III. The former gives executive power to the President. The latter grants judicial power to the federal judiciary. These three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government. The separation of powers was intended to limit Congress to making law, the President to enforcing the law and the courts as interpreting the law in different cases.\n\nThere is no provision in the Constitution that gives Congress the power to investigate. However, before the adoption of the Constitution, assemblies| in the American colonies exercised that power. Before them, the British Parliament had investigative powers. Congress has always considered an implicit power in the Constitution. In \"McGrain v. Daugherty\" (1927), the Supreme Court held that Congress did have the power to investigate.\n\nSection Two provides for the election every two years of members of the House of Representatives by the people of the respective states. The \"electors\" (voters) in the state are those who the state decides are eligible to vote for \"the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature\" are eligible to vote for members of the House of Representatives from that state.\n\nThe Constitution provides three requirements for Representatives. A Representative must be at least 25 years old. He or she must live in the state in which he or she is elected. A Representative must also have been a citizen of the United States for the previous seven years.\n\nAfter much debate, the framers of the Constitution compromised and made population the basis of determining the number of seats (called apportionment) in the House of Representatives. It also used apportionment to determine the tax liability among the states. To accomplish this, the Constitution requires that a census be conducted every ten years. This is to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole. It also establishes a rule for who should and who should not be included in the count. Because the Constitution would go into effect before the completion of a national census, it provides for a temporary apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOriginally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was determined by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other persons (slaves), but excluding non-taxed Native Americans. This Constitutional rule was known as the three-fifths compromise. It was used to determine the number of Representatives in the House. Larger states contributed more money and would have more seats in the House of Representatives. \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment removed the three-fifths rule and ordered the census to count everyone regardless of skin color. It stipulated that males over the age of twenty-one could vote. The Sixteenth Amendment removed the connection between apportionment and direct taxes. The 19th Amendment removed the restriction by sex allowing women to vote. The 26th Amendment reduced the voting age requirement to those 18 years of age and older. But none of these amendments changed congressional apportionment.\n\nSince enactment of the Reapportionment Act of 1929, Congress set the number of House seats at 435, except in 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted as states. Then the number became 437 temporarily.\n\nSection two, Clause four, provides that when vacancies occur in the House of Representatives, it is not the job of the House of Representatives to arrange for a replacement. It is the job of the State whose vacant seat is up for refilling. In addition, the Constitution does not authorize a State Governor to appoint a temporary replacement. He is to arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy. The original qualifications and procedures for holding that election are still valid.\n\nSection Two also provides that the House of Representatives may choose its Speaker and its other officers. The Constitution does not require it but every Speaker has been a member of the House of Representatives. The Speaker rarely presides over routine House sessions. Instead he chooses to deputize a junior member to accomplish the task.\n\nFinally, Section Two grants to the House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Although the Supreme Court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision, the Court has suggested that the grant to the House of the \"\"sole\"\" power of impeachment makes the House the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an impeachable offense.\n\nThis power, which is analogous to the bringing of criminal charges by a grand jury, has been used only rarely. The House of Representatives has initiated impeachment proceedings 62 times since 1789, and nineteen federal officials have been formally impeached as a result, including: two Presidents (Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton), one Cabinet Secretary (William W. Belknap), one Senator (William Blount), one Supreme Court Associate Justice (Samuel Chase), and fourteen federal judges.\n\nThe Constitution does not specify how impeachment proceedings are to be initiated. Until the early 20th century, a House member could rise and propose an impeachment, which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation. Presently, it is the House Judiciary Committee that initiates the process. It does this only after investigating the allegations, prepares recommendations for the whole House's consideration. If the House votes to adopt an impeachment resolution, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee recommends a slate of \"managers,\" whom the House subsequently approves by resolution. These Representatives then become the prosecution team in the impeachment trial in the Senate (see Section 3, Clause 6 below).\n\nThe first Clause of Section Three provides that each state is entitled to have two Senators. It states they would be elected by its state legislature and serve six-year terms. Each Senator has one vote. By these provisions, the framers of the Constitution intended to protect the interests of the states as states. However, this clause has been superseded by the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913. Due to problems in the Senate, it was changed to Senators would now be elected by the people instead of the state legislatures.\n\nApproximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years. But the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year. The Seventeenth Amendment changed how vacancies would be filled. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, if a Senator dies or has to leave office, his state governor may appoint a temporary Senator until a special election can be held.\n\nA Senator must be at least 30 years of age, must have been a citizen of the United States for at least nine years before being elected, and must reside in the State he or she will represent at the time of the election. As with Representatives in the House, the Constitution sets the qualifications to be a Senator.\n\nSection Three provides that the Vice President is the President of the Senate. When serving in this capacity, the Vice President, who is not a member of the Senate, may cast a vote to break a tie. Early in the nation's history, Vice Presidents frequently presided over the Senate. In modern times, the Vice President usually does so only during ceremonial occasions or when a tie in the voting is anticipated. A tie-breaking vote has been cast 243 times by 35 different Vice Presidents.\n\nClause five provides for a President \"pro tempore of the Senate\" (meaning temporary), a Senator elected to the post by the Senate, to preside over the body when the Vice President is either absent or exercising the Office of the President.\n\nThe Senate's current practice is to elect a full-time President pro tempore at the beginning of each Congress, as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the Vice President's absence. Since World War II, the senior (longest serving) member of the majority party has filled this position. As is true of the Speaker of the House, the Constitution does not require that the President pro tempore be a senator, but by tradition, a senator is always chosen.\nThe House of Representatives votes to impeach a president, vice president or other civil officer, but the Senate serves as judge and jury. The defendant in the trial can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Only two times has the Senate brought impeachment charges against a president still in office. This was in 1868 against Andrew Johnson and in 1998 against Bill Clinton. In both cases the president was not convicted and allowed to serve out his term of office.\nIf any officer is convicted on impeachment, he or she is immediately removed from office. He or she may be barred from holding any public office in the future. No other punishments may be used. Any person removed from office may still be criminally prosecuted. They may also be subject to lawsuits. \n\nState legislatures have the task of deciding how congressional elections are held. They may decide the scheduling of an election, where voters may cast ballots and how voters are to register. Congress has the right to change these rules. \nClause 2 fixes an annual date upon which Congress must meet. By doing so, the Constitution gives Congress the power to meet, whether or not the President called it into session. \n\nSection Five states that a majority of each House constitutes a quorum to do business; a smaller number may adjourn the House or compel the attendance of absent members. In practice, the quorum requirement is all but ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call, requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.\n\nEach House can determine its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish any of its members. A two-thirds vote is necessary to expel a member. Section 5, Clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each House regarding when and how each House may change its rules, leaving details to the respective chambers.\n\nEach House must keep and publish a Journal, though it may choose to keep any part of the Journal secret. The decisions of the House—not the words spoken during debates—are recorded in the Journal; if one-fifth of those present (assuming a quorum is present) request it, the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered.\n\nNeither House may adjourn, without the consent of the other, for more than three days. Often, a House will hold \"pro forma\" sessions every three days. Such sessions are held just to fulfill the constitutional requirement. They are not for the purpose of conducting business. Neither House may meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses (the Capitol), without the consent of the other House.\n\nSenators and Representatives set their own compensation. Under the Twenty-seventh Amendment, any change in their compensation will not take effect until after the next congressional election.\n\nMembers of both Houses have certain privileges, based on those enjoyed by the members of the British Parliament. Members attending, going to or returning from either House are privileged from arrest, except for treason, felony or breach of the peace. One may not sue a Senator or Representative for slander that may happen during Congressional debate, nor may speech by a member of Congress during a Congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution. \n\nSenators and Representatives may not simultaneously serve in Congress and hold a position in the executive branch. This restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using patronage to buy votes in Congress. It is a major difference from the political system in the British Parliament, where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament.\n\nThis establishes the method for making Acts of Congress that involve taxation. Accordingly, any bill may originate in either House of Congress, except for a revenue bill, which may originate only in the House of Representatives. \n\nThis clause of the U.S. Constitution stemmed from an English parliamentary practice that all money bills must have their first reading in the House of Commons. This practice was intended to ensure that the power of the purse is possessed by the legislative body most responsive to the people, although the English practice was modified in America by allowing the Senate to amend these bills. \n\nThis clause is known as the Presentment Clause. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law. If he disapproves of the bill, he must return it to the House in which it originated together with his objections. This procedure has become known as the veto, although that particular word does not appear in the text of Article One. The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated. In the latter case, the President, by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session, exercises a \"pocket veto\", which Congress may not override. In the former case, where the President allows a bill to become law unsigned, there is no common name for the practice, but recent scholarship has termed it a \"default enactment.\"\n\nWhat exactly constitutes an adjournment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear. In the \"Pocket Veto Case\" (1929), the Supreme Court held that \"the determinative question in reference to an 'adjournment' is not whether it is a final adjournment of Congress or an interim adjournment, such as an adjournment of the first session, but whether it is one that 'prevents' the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated within the time allowed.\" Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In \"Wright v. United States\" (1938), however, the Court ruled that adjournments of one House only did not constitute an adjournment of Congress required for a pocket veto. In such cases, the Secretary or Clerk of the House in question was ruled competent to receive the bill.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Line Item Veto Act, which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case \"Clinton v. City of New York\", the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, \"if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it.\" Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.\n\nEvery bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in Article V.\n\nCongress's legislative powers are enumerated in Section Eight:\n\nMany powers of Congress have been interpreted broadly. Most notably, the Taxing and Spending, Interstate Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress.\n\nCongress may lay and collect taxes for the \"common defense\" or \"general welfare\" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined \"general welfare,\" leaving the political question to Congress. In \"United States v. Butler\" (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to \"matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare\". Congress continues to make expansive use of the Taxing and Spending Clause; for instance, the social security program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.\n\nCongress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding \"Knox v. Lee,\" the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only \"binding on the conscience of the sovereign\", as the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges its commitment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the \"commerce clause\" for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was \"Gibbons v. Ogden\", decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: Thomas Gibbons had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the Hudson River, while the other, Aaron Ogden, had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that \"commerce\" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice John Marshall rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that \"commerce\" included navigation of goods, and that it \"must have been contemplated\" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce \"is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution\".\n\nThe expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a \"laissez-faire\" attitude dominated the Court. In \"United States v. E. C. Knight Company\" (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted Sherman Antitrust Act, which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, \"commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled New Deal programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In \"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,\" (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had \"come to a permanent rest within the State.\" As Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes put it, \"so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased.\" Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1937, the Supreme Court began moving away from its laissez-faire attitude concerning Congressional legislation and the Commerce Clause, when it ruled in \"National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Company\", that the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (commonly known as the Wagner Act) was constitutional. The legislation under scrutiny, prevented employers from engaging in \"unfair labor practices\" such as firing workers for joining unions. In sustaining this act, the Court, signaled its return to the philosophy espoused by John Marshall, that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce.\n\nThis new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942. In \"Wickard v. Filburn\", the Court ruled that production quotas under the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 were constitutionally applied to agricultural production (in this instance, home-grown wheat for private consumption) that was consumed purely intrastate, because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of Congress to regulate under the Commerce Clause. This decision marked the beginning of the Court's total deference to Congress' claims of Commerce Clause powers, which lasted into the 1990s.\n\n\"United States v. Lopez\" (1995) was the first decision in six decades to invalidate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the Congress under the Commerce Clause. The Court held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \"commerce\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale. In a later case, \"United States v. Morrison\" (2000), the justices ruled that Congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect.\n\nIn contrast to these rulings, the Supreme Court also continues to follow the precedent set by \"Wickard v. Filburn\". In \"Gonzales v. Raich\" it ruled that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to criminalize the production and use of home-grown cannabis even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes. The court held that, as with the agricultural production in the earlier case, home-grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce.\n\nCongress may establish uniform laws relating to naturalization and bankruptcy. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish post offices and post roads (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting copyrights and patents of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the Copyright Clause, is the only instance of the word \"right\" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments). Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in \"Eldred v. Ashcroft\" (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.\n\nCongress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the War Powers Clause, only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the Feres Doctrine.\n\nCongress has the exclusive right to legislate \"in all cases whatsoever\" for the nation's capital, the District of Columbia. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected mayor and council of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.\n\nFinally, Congress has the power to do whatever is \"necessary and proper\" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a \"substantial effect\" on interstate commerce in \"Wickard v. Filburn\" ; however, Thomas Jefferson, in the Kentucky Resolutions, supported by James Madison, maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for treason, counterfeiting, piracy and felony on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations.\n\nThe necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819), which involved the establishment of a national bank. Alexander Hamilton, in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was \"a more or less direct\" relationship between the bank and \"the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies\". Thomas Jefferson countered that Congress's powers \"can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase\". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing \"all\" of Congress's powers \"would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind\". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the \"minor ingredients\" of the powers of Congress, Marshall \"deduced\" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the \"great outlines\" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as implied powers) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.\n\nThe ninth section of Article One places limits on Congress' powers:\n\nThe first clause in this section prevents Congress from passing any law that would restrict the importation of slaves into the United States prior to 1808. Congress could however, levy a \"Per capita\" duty of up to ten dollars for each slave imported into the country. This clause was further entrenched into the Constitution by Article V, where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808. On January 1, 1808, the first day it was permitted to do so, Congress approved legislation prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States.\n\nA writ of \"habeas corpus\" is a legal action against unlawful detainment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court inquire into the legality of the detention. The court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or unjustifiable. The Constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\" may not be suspended \"unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\". In \"Ex parte Milligan\" (1866), the Supreme Court ruled that the suspension of \"habeas corpus\" in a time of war was lawful, but military tribunals did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the Constitution and where civilian courts were still operating.\n\nA bill of attainder is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial. An \"ex post facto\" law is a law which applies retroactively, punishing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done. The \"ex post facto\" clause does not apply to civil matters.\n\nSection Nine reiterates the provision from Section Two that direct taxes must be apportioned by state populations. This clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by Article V. In 1913, the 16th Amendment exempted income taxes from this clause. Furthermore, no tax may be imposed on exports from any state. Congress may not, by revenue or commerce legislation, give preference to ports of one state over those of another; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another. All funds belonging to the Treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law. Modern practice is that Congress annually passes a number of appropriations bills authorizing the expenditure of public money. The Constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published.\n\nThe Title of Nobility Clause prohibits Congress from granting any title of nobility. In addition, it specifies that no civil officer may accept, without the consent of Congress, any gift, payment, office or title from a foreign ruler or state. However, a U.S. citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service.\n\nStates may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue bills of credit (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government) from \"making a tender\" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment) of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation, unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in \"Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Federal Reserve Bank\"). Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In Federalist no. 44, Madison explains that \"... it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded.\" Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, enact \"ex post facto\" laws, impair the obligation of contracts, or grant titles of nobility.\n\nThe Contract Clause was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when \"Fletcher v. Peck\" was decided. The case involved the Yazoo land scandal, in which the Georgia legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, \"What is a contract?\" His answer was: \"a compact between two or more parties.\" Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid \"contract\". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.\n\nThe definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of \"Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" involved Dartmouth College, which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King George III. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred \"vested rights\" on the trustees.\n\nThe Marshall Court determined another dispute in \"Sturges v. Crowninshield\". The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In \"Ogden v. Saunders\" (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws \"could\" apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive federal bankruptcy law in 1898.\n\nStill more powers are prohibited of the states. States may not, without the consent of Congress, tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws (which may be revised by Congress). The net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state, but to the federal Treasury.\n\nUnder the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace. They may not enter into alliances nor compacts with foreign states, nor engage in war unless invaded. States may, however, organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. (Article I, Section 8, enumerated powers of Congress.) The National Guard, whose members are also members of the militia of the United States as defined by , fulfill this function, as do persons serving in State Militias with federal oversight under .\n\nThe idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to the Crown for approval. After the American Revolutionary War, the Articles of Confederation allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or \"any cause whatever\". The Articles of Confederation also required Congressional approval for \"any treaty or alliance\" in which a state was one of the parties.\n\nThere have been a number of Supreme Court cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an interstate compact. In \"Virginia v. Tennessee\", , the Court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of Congress. (One example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself, it would not require Congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport.) According to the Court, the Compact Clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is \"directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the States, which may encroach upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the United States\". The congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutionality of the not yet effective National Popular Vote Interstate Compact entered into by several states plus the District of Columbia.\n", "id": "534614", "title": "Article One of the United States Constitution"}

He was in Memphis, Tennessee for the Memphis Sanitation Strike. The sanitation (garbage) workers in Memphis were on strike because they got paid very little, and their work was dangerous. King wanted to support them.\n\nThe speech talks mostly about the Strike. King talks about the best ways to get the workers what they needed. At the end of the speech, he talks about the possibility that he might be killed.\n\nThe next day, King was murdered.\n\nWhen talking about the Strike, King focuses on the importance of non-violence. At a protest on March 28, some protesters had become violent and started breaking windows. King says:\n\nKing thought that if protesters or the people on strike were violent, other people would only pay attention to the violence. They would not pay attention to how badly the sanitation workers were treated.\n\nKing suggested boycotting things sold by white businesses as a nonviolent way of protesting and getting people's attention. He explains that one black person might be poor, but all together, they spent a lot of money. This gave them power. If they stopped buying things from businesses owned by white people, then those businesses would lose a lot of money. Then they would have to pay attention, or else they could go out of business. Meanwhile, black people could use their money to buy things from businesses owned by other blacks. King says:\n\nKing then talks about the Civil Rights Movement. He says:\n\nKing promises that civil rights activists will not stop until they get their basic human rights.\n\nAt the end of the speech, King says that as soon as he got to Memphis, he began to get threats. However, he says he is not afraid of death. This is the most famous part of the speech, and also its ending:\n\nKing was a Baptist pastor. He often mentioned stories from the Bible in his speeches.\n\nIn the end of this speech, King is talking about a story from the Old Testament. Moses was the leader of the Israelites (the people of Israel). The Israelites followed Moses because they thought he would lead them to a Promised Land. In this Promised Land, they could live in peace. \n\nHowever, before the Israelites got to the Promised Land, God spoke to Moses. God said he would let Moses see the Promised Land with his eyes. However, God would not let Moses enter the Promised Land. The Bible says: \nSoon after this, Moses died. Joshua replaced him as leader, and led the people of Israel into the Promised Land.\n\nKing is saying that like Moses, he has \"been to the mountaintop\" and seen the Promised Land a society where black people have peace and equal rights. He knows that he may not get to this Promised Land with them, because he might die first. However, he tells his listeners that, like the people of Israel, African-Americans as a people will get to the Promised Land.\n\n", "id": "534705", "title": "I've Been to the Mountaintop"}

The SCLC was very important in the African-American Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King, Jr. was its first president.\n\nToday, the SCLC says it is \"a nonprofit, non-sectarian, inter-faith, advocacy organization that is committed to nonviolent action to achieve social, economic, and political justice.\" This means the group is open to people of all faiths and religions, not just Christians. \n\nThe SCLC was created in 1957, after the Civil Rights Movement's successful Montgomery Bus Boycott. On January 10, 1957, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. invited about 60 black pastors and leaders to Atlanta, Georgia. Their goal, at the time, was to end segregation on buses in the Southern United States. However, they agreed that they would only use non-violent ways of protesting and trying to make change. Their motto was: \"Not one hair on one head of one white person shall be harmed.\"\n\nAbout a month later, the group met again in New Orleans, Louisiana. They decided that their goal would be to end segregation everywhere not just on buses. They also chose Dr. King as their president, and chose the name \"Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\"\n\nThe SCLC also chose a group of leaders called the Board of Directors to be in charge of making final decisions and planning strategies. At first, some churches and civil rights organizations joined the SCLC. However, it was difficult to get churches to join. Groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council used violence and terrorism to attack civil rights activists. So did the police in many states. Some churches which joined the SCLC, or did civil rights work, were bombed or set on fire.\n\nIn 1954, civil rights activists started \"Citizenship Schools.\" These schools taught African-American adults to read so they could get driver's licenses; fill out forms; open bank accounts; and pass literacy tests that only black people had to pass to sign up to vote. The program spread across the South. They called themselves the \"Highlander Folk School.\"\n\nIn 1961, the state of Tennessee took the Highlander Folk School's land and property away. In that year, the SCLC rescued the Citizenship School program. The Schools' teachers pretended to be teaching adults to read. Secretly, they were teaching about democracy, civil rights, leadership, getting people together to protest, politics, and protest strategies. All of these things would be very important in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nEventually, close to 69,000 teachers taught Citizenship Schools throughout the South. Most of these teachers were volunteers who were not paid. Many of the African-American Civil Rights Movement's adult leaders went to or taught Citizenship Schools.\nThe SCLC's work in the African-American Civil Rights Movement included:\n\nRalph Abernathy became the President of the SCLC after Dr. King's murder.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534873", "text": "Geomagnetic reversal\n\nA geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged. \n\nThe Earth's field has alternated between periods of \"normal polarity\", when the direction of the field was the same as the present, and \"reverse polarity\", when the field was the opposite. These periods are called \"chrons\". \n\nThere is no pattern to these changes, which seem to take place at random. Chrons last from between 0.1 and 1million years (see diagram) with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to happen.\n\nThe latest one, the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago;\nand may have happened very quickly, within a human lifetime. A brief complete reversal, known as the Laschamp event, occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5% of its present strength. Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions.\n\nThe past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe reversals on the ocean floor. This soon led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. The relatively constant rate at which the sea floor spreads causes \"stripes\" in the basalt. From these past magnetic fields polarity can be inferred. Data is got by towing a magnetometer along the sea floor.\n\nNo existing unsubducted sea floor is more than about 180 million years old, so other methods are used for detecting older reversals. Most sedimentary rocks have tiny amounts of iron rich minerals. Their orientation reflects the magnetic field when they formed. The rocks keep that record unless they get changed by some later process.\n\nA \"superchron\" is a polarity interval lasting at least 10million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the Cretaceous Normal and the Kiaman. \n\nThe Cretaceous Normal (also called the Cretaceous Superchron or C34) lasted for almost 40million years. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly.\n\nThe Kiaman Reverse Superchron lasted from the late Carboniferous to the late Permian. That is more than 50million years, from 312 to 262 million years ago (mya). The magnetic field had reversed polarity. The name \"Kiaman\" derives from the Australian village of Kiama, where some of the first geological evidence of the superchron was found in 1925.\n\nThe magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is caused by dynamo action of molten iron in the planetary core. This convection (movement) generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields. In simulations of planetary dynamos, reversals occur from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of UCLA ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself. Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in a laboratory liquid metal experiment VKS2.\n\nAs far as we know, there is no effect on life. Studies have been done to see if reversals relate in any way to extinction events. Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions.\n", "id": "534873", "title": "Geomagnetic reversal"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535082", "text": "Mass grave\n\nA mass grave is a grave where many bodies are buried together, without coffins. Mass graves are usually created when a large number of people die or are killed. For example, in the past, they have been used when many people die at once from disease, a natural disaster, or genocide.\nDifferent people have come up with different meanings for the phrase \"mass grave.\" Mass graves have been defined as:\n\nSince 1993, the United Nations has defined a mass grave as a grave where three or more people are buried together.\n\nFor centuries, people around the world have used mass graves when many people died at once from epidemics of diseases. The goal of this type of mass grave is not to disrespect the bodies of the dead. The goal is to prevent disease from spreading from the dead to the living. Also, if too many people have died, it may be impossible to bury them all separately.\n\nFor example, during outbreaks of the bubonic plague (\"The Black Death\") in Europe, people were terrified of catching this disease from dead bodies. Often they buried plague victims in mass graves. Daniel Defoe, who lived during the Great Plague of London in 1655-1666, wrote about one mass grave:\nHowever, at some mass graves for plague victims, people still tried to honor the dead with Christian burial traditions.\n\nMore recently, victims of natural disasters have been buried in mass graves. Like with mass graves for disease victims, mass graves for disaster victims are not meant to disrespect the dead. In disasters where many people die, it may not be possible to bury each person one by one.\n\nFor example, after 2010 Haiti earthquake, there were tens of thousands of bodies in the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince. In the first nine days after the earthquake, about 90,000 people were buried in mass graves, using bulldozers. There were so many bodies that there was no room, and not enough workers, to bury them one by one. \n\nOne Haitian man, who helped bury 2,500 people in three mass graves, said: \"You have to understand that it's completely un-Haitian to dump bodies like this. We have extreme respect for the dead. And these people deserve a decent burial.\" Later, he and other volunteers put up crosses to mark the graves, put holy water on the graves, and had a priest say prayers for the dead. Like at the mass graves for the plague victims, they were still trying to honor the dead, even though they had to bury them in mass graves.\n\nSome areas in Japan also had to use mass graves after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In Japan, most people are cremated after they die. However, there were too many victims, and not enough kerosene to cremate them or dry ice to keep the bodies from decomposing. In one town, cremating all the town's victims would have taken 100 days. Because of this, some towns had to use mass graves to bury the dead.\n\nThroughout history, people and governments that have murdered many people have buried them in mass graves. Unlike mass graves for victims of disease or disasters, this type of mass grave is often meant to disrespect the bodies of the dead after they are murdered.\n\nMass graves have been found from many of the international wars and civil wars in modern history. Here are a few examples.\n\nDuring World War I, on July 19, 1916, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were killed in a battle with the German Army. In 2008, about 250 of their bodies were found in mass graves, where the Germans had buried them.\n\nDuring The Holocaust, Nazi Germany killed six million Jewish people and millions of other people. Nobody knows exactly how many of these people are buried in mass graves. However, here are some examples of mass graves from Nazi murders:\n\nDuring World War II, German soldiers who died when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union were buried in mass graves in Eastern Europe. In 2013, the German War Graves Commission moved 70,000 soldiers from mass graves to a cemetery in Russia. This was the 82nd cemetery the Commission had built to re-bury soldiers buried in mass graves. All together, the 82 cemeteries hold more than 800,000 German soldiers. The Commission says there are at least 250,000 more German soldiers buried in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Soviet Union also used mass graves during World War II. For example, in the Piskaryovskoye Memorial Cemetery, they buried almost 500,000 civilians and soldiers in 186 mass graves. These people had died or been killed during the Siege of Leningrad.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, as many as 20 million people may have died or been murdered while Joseph Stalin ruled the government. Most of them were Soviet civilians. Many were buried in mass graves. \n\nThe biggest include:\n\nEarly on in the Korean War, South Korea killed at least 100,000 people who had been put in prison for their political beliefs. They buried many of these people in mass graves. In 2007, the South Korean Truth and Reconciliation Committee found four mass graves, with more than 400 people in them. The Committee estimates that there are about 150 mass graves in South Korea.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, in the Huế Massacre, the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army murdered between 2,800 and 6,000 civilians and prisoners of war. They buried the bodies in dozens of mass graves.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, the Khmer Rouge, ruled by Pol Pot, controlled Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge committed a genocide against the Cambodian people. Historians and scientists say that there are at least 20,000 mass grave sites in the country, holding at least 1,386,734 victims of execution.\n\nDuring the Bosnian War (1992-1995), the Bosnian Serb Army killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims in the Srebrenica genocide. They buried them in mass graves. In 2003, mass grave specialists found a mass grave that was \"as big as a tennis court.\" It included victims of the Srebrenica genocide. By 2006, 42 mass graves had been found around Srebrenica, and specialists think there are at least 22 more. Another 2,070 victims have been found in the graves.\n\nDuring the Kosovo War (1998-1999), Serbian soldiers committed many war crimes against the Albanian people. As of 2010, six mass graves had been found in Serbia with Albanian victims inside. The largest had between 705 and 1,000 bodies in it.\n\nThe Colombian government says that in its civil war, which is still going on today, its enemies have buried at least 6,000 people in mass graves.\n\nCNN recently wrote that the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) killed more than 130 men, women, and children who refused to join ISIS. They buried their bodies in mass graves.\n\n", "id": "535082", "title": "Mass grave"}

This was a period of mass civil disobedience to the law. Those who could afford the higher prices of smuggled liquor went to illegal bars called speakeasies.

Congress passed the national Prohibition Enforcement Act, also known as the Volstead Act. The act defined any beverage containing more than one-half of one percent an intoxicating beverage. It gave the Internal Revenue Service the power to enforce the law.\n\nThe third clause gave seven years as the time period for the states to ratify the amendment. This is the first amendment to have a limit on the time in which it was to be ratified. If it was not ratified by the required number of states in that time period, the amendment would not go into effect. Article Five of the United States Constitution requires an amendment be passed by three-quarters of the states. (36 out of the 48 states at that time.)\n\nDuring the 1820s intense religious and social movements spread across the country calling alcohol and drunkenness a \"national curse.\" They were called temperance movements. The first state to have a temperance law was Massachusetts who in 1838 enacted a law prohibiting the sale of liquor in less than quantities. In 1846, Maine passed the first state prohibition law. It was repealed two years later, still, other states also passed similar laws.\n\nAfter the American Civil War, immigrants, mainly from Ireland, Germany, Italy and other parts of Europe, crowded major cities by the millions. Many of these men worked hard and drank just as hard. Beer became a favorite drink and many German-Americans who knew how to brew beer began producing it in large quantities. By the 1870s, many wives and mothers who were completely dependant on their men, began to protest having their lives ruined by alcohol. They were joined by a number of clergymen. They organized as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and became a powerful force for change. They were joined by women such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. prominent in the suffrage movement (women's right to vote). The temperance movement was able to put political pressure on politicians that many were afraid of. The WCTU began calling for a nation-wide ban on alcoholic drink. At first, most Senators were against the idea. But they also did not want to be seen as voting against it. For this reason they imposed a deadline for ratification of seven years. Many hoped it would not be ratified. But the plan did not work since it was ratified just over a year after its passage.\n\nGustav Boess, Mayor of Berlin visited New York City in late 1929. He asked the Mayor of New York City, Jimmy Walker, when prohibition was supposed to go into effect. At that time, prohibition had already been the law of the land for over nine years. That the German mayor even had to ask shows how well the Eighteenth Amendment had been working. In fact, it was not working very well at all.\n\nThose who supported prohibition expected the sales of household goods and clothing to go up dramatically. Many expected real estate and rents to rise as bars closed and neighborhoods were cleaned up. Many producers of soft drinks, juices and chewing gum expected sales to go up as Americans had to find new ways of entertaining themselves. None of this happened. Instead, the unintended consequences proved to be a decline in amusement and entertainment industries across the country. Restaurants failed, as they could no longer make a profit without legal liquor sales. Theater revenues declined rather than increase, and few of the other economic benefits that had been predicted came to pass. Prohibition proved to be largely negative for the economy. Jobs in breweries, distilleries and bars were lost by the thousands. Truckers, waiters, barrel makers and many other related workers had large numbers of jobs lost. Perhaps the largest unintended consequence was the loss to the government in tax revenues. The state of New York lost almost 75 percent of its revenue. The federal government lost over $11 million in tax revenues while the cost to enforce it was over $300 million.\n\nThe prohibition laws had many loopholes (ways to get around the law) that were quickly taken advantage of. The biggest loophole was that neither the Eighteenth Amendment nor the Volstead Act made it illegal to drink or be drunk in public. Farmers who grew fruit quickly learned to sell their harvests in dehydrated bricks. The warning label included instructions on how to easily turn the bricks into alcoholic drinks. Pharmacists were allowed to prescribe whiskey for any number of ailments from anxiety to the flu. As bootleggers learned of this, the number of pharmacies tripled in places like New York state. Tools and ingredients to make alcohol at home were sold in hardware and grocery stores. Books on how to make liquor were also legal. \n\nDrinking under prohibition did not stop, it simply went underground. In New York City alone there were thousands of speakeasy clubs. The mob made millions in illegal sales of alcohol on the black market. Most Americans simply ignored the law. The agents who enforced prohibition laws were poorly paid and were easily bribed. Gangsters made money and became powerful under prohibition. They even cooperated with one another in setting prices. Organized crime gained a national foothold due to prohibition. One of the better known gangsters was Al Capone. When Capone arrived in Chicago in 1920 he immediately saw the opportunities that prohibition offered. He organized illegal bootlegging on an international scale. He even controlled the distribution of his alcohol. He hired his own delivery trucks, salespeople, and his own heavily armed guards to protect his investments. Capone was making over $100 million a year. He had no trouble bribing all the politicians and law enforcement members in his district.\n\n", "id": "535123", "title": "Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

The amendment marked the end of a long struggle for women in the United States that began in the mid-nineteenth century. The movement, called women's suffrage, marked a radical change in how women were viewed in America. When the Constitution was written, it was accepted that a woman did not have a separate legal identity from her husband. Women's suffrage challenged that concept. The Nineteenth Amendment overturned an earlier decision by the United States Supreme Court in \"Minor v. Happersett\". The Court held that the right to vote, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to all citizens of the United States, did not apply to women. Women were citizens, but did not have the right to vote. The Nineteenth Amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878 by Senator Aaron A. Sargent. The bill calling for the amendment was introduced unsuccessfully every year for the next 40 years. Finally, in 1919, Congress approved the amendment and submitted it to the states for ratification. A year later Tennessee gave the final vote needed to add the amendment to the Constitution. \n\nIn Colonial America, women had fixed gender roles they learned from their mothers. Growing up, a woman was legally subordinate to her father. When she was married she became a \"feme covert\" (French: a married woman). Her property and her legal status transferred to her husband. The intent of this protected-class status was to protect women from the evils men dealt with including politics. In addition, the custom was also used to ban women from professional jobs, higher education, voting, serving on juries and testifying in court. Single women were limited to the jobs of teaching and nursing.\n\nIn 1848, the women's suffrage movement began on a national level. A convention in Seneca Falls, New York was organized by abolitionists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott that also demanded a woman's right to vote. Susan B. Anthony, along with other activists, joined Mott and Stanton in forming organizations that demanded the right to vote. Many of the early orgainzers never lived to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment some 70 years later.\n\nWhen the Nineteenth Amendment became law, it guaranteed the right to vote could not be denied on account of sex. However, it was not the same as women being allowed to vote. The Supreme Court case of \"Leser v. Garnett\" (1922), while not intended to do so, established this right. The plaintiffs challenged the Nineteenth Amendment as being unconstitutional. They argued first, that the amendment was invalid because it increased the electorate without the state of Maryland's consent. They argued secondly that ratification was based on several states that denied women the right to vote in their state constitutions and therefore their legislatures did not have the right to ratify the amendment. The third argument was that the last two states to ratify the amendment, Tennessee and West Virginia, violated their own rules of procedure.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the court rejected all three arguments. The first argument is invalid because wording was almost the same as the Fifteenth Amendment. Each used the same method of adoption so one cannot be valid and the other invalid. The second argument, that certain state legislatures did not have the power to ratify based on their own constitutions, is rejected because they were ratifying an amendment to the federal Constitution, and so is a federal function. The Court ruled the third argument a moot point because two other states after Tennessee and West Virginia (Connecticut and Vermont) who followed their own procedures would have been enough to ratify the amendment. But in addressing the substance of the argument, the Court went on to point out that the Secretaries of State of Tennessee and West Virginia each accepted the ratification by the legislatures making the ratification by those two states valid. The Nineteenth Amendment gave women the right to vote but \"Lesser\" made it certain the right could be used even in states where the state constitution did not allow it.\n\n", "id": "535193", "title": "Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

It says that nine states need to ratify the Constitution before it takes effect. To ratify the Constitution, a special group in each state called a Convention would have to approve the Constitution.\n\nIn Simple English, this means: The approval of nine states' Conventions will be enough to make this Constitution official in those states. \n\nBefore the United States Constitution was passed, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. These Articles made the United States into a confederation. The legislature of the confederation government was called the Congress of the Confederation.\n\nAfter a few years, the Founding Fathers decided the United States needed a new constitution and a new form of government. They formed a group called the Constitutional Convention to write a new constitution. The group finished its final version of the Constitution on September 17, 1787. Three days later, the Convention gave its suggested Constitution to the Congress of the Confederation to get its support.\n\nThe Congress debated a lot about the Constitution. Members of Congress did not agree on whether Congress should support the new Constitution or not. On September 28, the Congress came to a compromise. They decided just to give the states the Constitution and let them vote on it. Congress would not suggest that the states pass the Constitution, or that they not pass it. This way, the decision would truly be up to the states; no state would be affected by Congress's opinion.\n\nIn 1787 and 1788, there were debates across the United States about the suggested new Constitution. Each state's Convention would have to vote on the Constitution. For a state to ratify the Constitution, more than half of the members of its Convention would have to vote for the Constitution.\n\nOn December 7, 1987, Delaware became the first state to ratify the suggested Constitution. All 30 of the members of its Convention voted for the Constitution.\n\nOn June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution. Now that nine states had ratified the Constitution, it became the highest and most important law of the United States. The United States would have a new form of government, based on the ideas set out in the Constitution.\n\nHowever, four states still had not approved the Constitution. These states were Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. If they did not approve the Constitution, they would not be a part of the new government of the United States.\n\nThe Congress of the Confederation decided that the United States would start using the new Constitution on March 4, 1789. Before that day, Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution. However, when the first United States Congress gathered on March 4 to form the new government, North Carolina and Rhode Island still had not approved the Constitution. After the new Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, though, North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution was ratified by the states in this order:\n\n", "id": "535210", "title": "Article Seven of the United States Constitution"}

It also says that the United States will pay debts from before the Constitution was written. Finally, it says that members of the United States government have to swear that they will obey the Constitution. However, they will never have to swear that they follow a certain religion.\n\nBefore the United States Constitution was written, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. The Articles made the states into a Confederation.\n\nThe first part of Article Six says that the United States will still honor and pay all of its debts from before the Constitution was written. The Article says that \"these debts are as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as [they were] under the Confederation [governed by the Articles of Confederation].\"\n\nThe second clause of Article Six is often called the \"Supremacy Clause.\" It says that these things are the \"supreme\" laws in the United States the most powerful and most important laws in the country:\n\nBecause these laws are supreme:\n\nFor example, part of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights gives people the right to freedom of religion. Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land:\n\nA few Supreme Court decisions helped make the Supremacy Clause clearer.\n\nThe first important case was \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that it had the power to review state courts' decisions, if those decisions seemed like they did not follow the supreme law. This power is called judicial review.\n\nIn \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\" (1816), the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was more powerful than the state Supreme Courts. In the case, the Virginia Supreme Court said that a United States Supreme Court decision was unconstitutional, and told all of the Virginia state courts not to obey it. The United States Supreme Court ruled that it had the final say in legal issues that had to do with federal laws not the state courts. If a state court and the United States Supreme Court disagree, the Supreme Court is the supreme law of the land.\n\nThree years later, in \"McCulloch v. Maryland\" (1819), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot control federal institutions. The state of Maryland had tried to tax a federal bank. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot tax government property. This was another example of a case where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the \"supreme laws of the land\" were more powerful than state laws or court decisions.\n\nIn 1824, the Supreme Court ruled on \"Gibbons v. Ogden\" (1824). The state of New York had given Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. However, Thomas Gibbons got the same power from a federal government permit. The Supreme Court decided that the federal permit was more powerful than the state monopoly. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote: \nFinally, in \"Reid v. Covert\" (1957), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no branch of the United States government can be given extra powers by a treaty, if those powers were not given to it by the Constitution. This case showed that the Constitution could even limit the power of treaties, and was truly the supreme law of the land.\n\nThe last part of Article Six is sometimes called the \"No Religious Test Clause.\"\n\nThis clause says that people have to swear to support the Constitution if they are:\n\nCongress gets to decide the exact words in this oath to support the Constitution. However, in this oath, they cannot require a \"religious test.\" This means they cannot make a person swear that they follow a certain religion.\n\nUnder this clause, Congress may include the words \"so help me God\" in the oath. However, a person cannot be required to say those words. A person cannot be required to swear or say anything about religion in order to work for the United States government.\n\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy was running for President. If he were elected, he would be the first Catholic president ever. Many people were unsure that Americans should elect a Catholic as president. This raised the question of whether Americans not their government were requiring a \"religious test\" for their President. Would they require that a President be a Protestant in order to get elected? \n\nOn September 12, 1960, Kennedy talked about this issue directly in his :\n\nKennedy won the election.\n\n", "id": "535225", "title": "Article Six of the United States Constitution"}

It moved the start and end dates for members of Congress from March 4 to January 3. In both cases the start and end time is at noon. It also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect.\n\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century, when the Constitution was written, travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards. To cross the Atlantic Ocean could take several weeks. Traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the US could take even longer. Communications were mainly by letter or messenger. For these reasons the framers of the Constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages. Four months, the time from the election in November to the swearing-in in March, was necessary at the time.\n\nBy the 1930s, a railroad passenger could cross the country in 3 days. The Post Office had been using airmail since 1918. But vastly improved travel times and communications were not the only reasons behind the Twentieth Amendment. The joint resolution calling for the amendment was sponsored by Republican Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska. Called the \"Lame Duck\" Amendment, Norris wanted to eliminate the lame-duck sessions of Congress where outgoing members still held office and voted on bills for several months before the new members could be sworn in. The bill he wrote applied to both houses of Congress, the offices of President and Vice-President.\n\nAnother area the amendment addressed was with the succession of the president if the president-elect died before taking office. It provides for the vice-president elect to become the president-elect and take office on January 20. The amendment also give Congress the power to legislate on other issues dealing with the succession of the president.\n\nThe sessions of Congress between the election and the beginning of a new term are called \"lame duck\" sessions because members of Congress who were voted out of office still attend and can still vote. Originally the term \"lame duck\" was a financial term meaning those who could not repay a loan. As used in politics, a representative who lost an election was no longer accountable to the voters. As the framers of the Twentieth Amendment saw it, lame duck representatives should not be able to vote since voters had already rejected their views. The Twentieth Amendment only shortened the lame duck period by six weeks. Between 1933 and 2012, 18 lame-duck sessions of Congress have passed laws. \n\n", "id": "535310", "title": "Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535317", "text": "Preamble to the United States Constitution\n\nThe Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introduction to the Constitution's purposes and guiding principles. It provides the Founding Fathers' intentions for creating the Constitution and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve. It was added to the Constitution as an afterthought and was not discussed on the floor of the Constitutional Convention nor was it voted on. Gouverneur Morris, one of the writers of the Constitution, wrote and added it at the last moment. The Preamble itself did not have any legal meaning. The Supreme Court upheld this view in \"Jacobson v. Massachusetts\" (1905).\n\n\"We the People\" means all of the citizens of the United States.\nThe first few words of the Preamble \"We the People of the United States\" were very different than any treaty or law the United States had ever written before. For example, the United States' first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, describes itself as \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States,\" and then gives a list of all thirteen states. The treaties the United States had signed were the same. They were agreements between states, not people.\n\nAt the time, Gouverneur Morris chose to write \"We the People\" instead of saying \"We the United States of...\" and then listing all thirteen states. First of all, Article Seven of the Constitution said that only nine states had to approve the Constitution for it to take effect. At the time, nobody knew which states would ratify the Constitution and which would not. Because of this, the Preamble could not list all thirteen states as if they had all already agreed. Also, if other states joined the United States later, it would be impossible to add their names to the list. For these reasons, the Preamble had to start with \"We the People.\"\nThe words \"We the People\" turned into a strong statement that this new government was made by the people of the United States, to benefit the people of the United States. When Virginia's delegates were debating the Constitution, Governor Edmund Randolph pointed out: \"The government is for the people; and the [problem] was, that the people had no [power] in the government before.\" If the people are going to have to follow the government, he said, should not the people be the ones to create that government?\n\n\"In order to form a more perfect union\" is a concept most likely based on \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" by Sir William Blackstone. It was widely read at the time and many of the framers were students of his work. Blackstone stated the constitution of England was perfect, but steadily improving. The phrase \"a more perfect union\" simply meant a better one than any before the Constitution.\n\nBefore the government based on the Constitution, the United States was based on the Articles of Confederation. However, had very little power as a federal government. They did not give the United States government enough power for the country to work and grow. Every state was for itself, instead of working cooperatively. Sometimes they acted like thirteen separate countries that would only come together if another country attacked them.\n\"Establish justice\" meant to establish the rule of law. It meant that everyone was equal before the law with no distinction between the status or wealth of a person. With their new government, the Founding Fathers wanted to establish (create) justice and fairness. When the British Empire governed the American colonies, the colonists did not think the government was fair. For example, Parliament would decide that the colonists had to pay taxes on items like stamps and things that were made in other countries. The colonists did not have any say in this.\n\nEven after the United States became independent, many of the Founding Fathers thought that the states had too much power under the Articles of Confederation. They thought the states had taken away people's rights.\n\nFor example, during the Shays' Rebellion in Springfield, Massachusetts, the state of Massachusetts:\n\nShays' Rebellion was still fresh in the minds of the framers. It cause many to fear the spirit of the American Revolutionary War might be getting out of hand. There was a need to keep peace in the new country.\n\nJust five years after the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781, many Americans were unhappy with the Articles. Many of the Founding Fathers thought that the Articles had made the United States government too weak. Shays' Rebellion made it very clear that the national government under the Articles of Confederation was not strong enough. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, led the rebel farmers trying to overthrow the Massachusetts government. The farmers had formed an entire army, which neither the state or federal governments had enough soldiers or money to fight. In desperation Massachusetts offered to pay for a private army to fight the rebellion. Finally, in 1787, that private army defeated the rebels.\n\nJohn Jay, one of the Founding Fathers, said that after the United States government could not pay for soldiers to defend against any armed rebellion: \"the inefficiency of the Federal government [became] more and more [obvious].\" Another Founding Father, Henry Knox, said that Shays' Rebellion convinced many people that the United States needed a stronger federal government. The Rebellion made it clear that the states were not protected, and if they were attacked, they would be on their own. \n\n\"Provide for the common defense\" meant the framers were well aware that independence from Great Britain did not mean they were secure. British Canada to the north was still full of angry loyalists. To the west were unknown numbers of hostile Native American tribes. Farther west was the vast Louisiana territory held by France. To the south the Spanish held Florida. Worse, these powers were fighting a series of wars in Europe that affected much of North America. The framers knew America needed to protect itself. Providing for the common defence meant the new government would make sure all of the states were protected and defended if attacked.\n\n\"Promote the general welfare\" is the basic goal of all governments. It was the main reason for having a constitution.\n\nIn general, this part of the Preamble means that one of the new government's jobs would be to make things better for the whole country. Specifically, this part of the Preamble has to do with the government's powers to tax people and spend money. It means that the new government will only have the power to tax and spend on things that are good for the entire country. The government will not be allowed to spend money on things that will be good for only a part of the country, or only some people in the country.\n\nFor example, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax people and spend money on creating Post Offices and building roads for mail carriers to use. Congress can do this because Post Offices will \"promote the general Welfare\"—everybody in the country will benefit from being able to send and get mail. \n\n\"Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity\" was important since many had come to America from places with little political or religious freedom. This phrase demonstrates the intent of the new government to protect the newly-won freedoms and protect against a tyrannical government.\n\nHowever, the Articles of Confederation were all about the states' rights. At that time, many people were afraid of having a federal government that was too strong. These people were called anti-federalists. They included some of the Founding Fathers, like Patrick Henry and James Monroe. The anti-federalists worried that a strong federal government could become tyrannical and take away the rights of individual states, like they thought the British colonial government had done. They also worried that a government ruled by a President might turn into a monarchy, where the President would become a King and have total power. Because of these worries, the Articles of Confederation talked all about states' rights, and not about individual people's rights. The framers wanted to establish these rights for the people of the United States and their \"posterity\" meaning all the generations of Americans who would follow.\n\n\"Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America\" is perhaps the strongest statement in the Preamble. It says in effect that the people made the Constitution and it is the people who give it power.\nThe Preamble to the United States Constitution, is the beginning of the Constitution. It is not a law. Instead, it talks about the Founding Fathers' reasons for writing the Constitution, and what they hope the Constitution will do.\n\n", "id": "535317", "title": "Preamble to the United States Constitution"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535360", "text": "Article Five of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle Five of the United States Constitution outlines how the Constitution can be changed. Changes to the Constitution are called Constitutional amendments.\n\nArticle Five also says that there are certain clauses, or parts, of Article One of the Constitution that could not be amended right away. These clauses are explained in the \"Protected clauses\" section.\n\nBefore the Constitution was approved, the United States was covered by its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation.\n\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures. Not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment. If a single state Senator or Representative in the country disagreed with an amendment, the amendment would fail. This made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed.\n\nWhen the Founding Fathers wrote Article Five, they were trying to make sure changing the Constitution was not too hard, but not too easy either. James Madison later explained that the amendment process in the Constitution \"guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults.\"\n\nIn Simple English, Madison meant that the amendment process protects equally against:\n\nThere are two steps in the process for changing the Constitution. The first step is proposing (formally suggesting) an amendment. Article Five of the Constitution allows this to be done in two different ways.\n\nThe first way is the most common way. Any member of Congress can suggest an amendment. However, two-thirds (67%) of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives have to agree that the amendment is needed. If this happens, the proposed amendment moves to Step 2 in the process.\n\nAs of 2016, the second way has never been used. However, it exists to protect the rights of the state legislatures. If two-thirds of the state legislatures ask them to, Congress has to call a Constitutional Convention. Delegates would come to the Convention from each state. The Constitutional Convention could propose as many amendments as they wanted to. All of the amendments they proposed would move to Step 2 in the process.\n\nAt first, when the Founding Fathers were writing the Constitution, they were only going to give Congress the power to propose amendments. However, some of the Founders, like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, worried that this gave Congress too much power. Madison and Hamilton re-wrote Article Five to add the second option for proposing an amendment, and the rest of the Founders agreed. Adding the second option helped make sure the states had power too the power to propose amendments if enough of their legislatures agreed.\n\nStep 2 starts when an amendment has been proposed, either by Congress or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment now has to be ratified. Like with Step 1, Article Five gives two choices for how an amendment can be ratified. Congress gets to choose which way to use.\n\nCongress has almost always chosen the first way: letting the state legislatures ratify the amendment. If three-fourths (75%) of the state legislatures ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.\n\nThe second option is for Congress to ask each state to create a \"ratifying convention.\" This is a group of people not members of the state legislature who would decide whether or not to ratify the amendment. If ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution.\n\nCongress has only used the second option once: after it proposed the 21 Amendment. (This amendment cancelled the 18 Amendment, which made alcohol illegal in the United States. The 21 Amendment made alcohol legal again.)\n\nAt the time, Congress thought that this would be the more democratic option. A large majority of the people in the United States wanted the 21 Amendment to pass. However, Congress thought the state legislators would refuse to pass the amendment because of pressure from powerful groups that were against alcohol. In other words, Congress did not think that the state legislatures would vote the way the people of the United States would want. This example shows why the Founding Fathers included the \"ratifying convention\" option in the amendment process. If the state legislatures get too powerful, or do not represent what the people who elected them want, the people have the power to pass amendments too.\n\nBetween 1789 and December 16, 2014: \n\nArticle Five protects two clauses in Article One from being amended until 1808. These clauses are:\n\nArticle Five also puts one absolute limit on Constitutional amendments. It completely protects Section 3, Clause 1 of Article One. This clause says that every state will have the same number of United States Senators. It does not set a time limit on how long this clause is protected for. It just says: \"no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.\" As of 1808, when the protections on the other two clauses expired, this is the only limit that the Constitution puts on suggested amendments. Any amendment, about anything else, could be suggested.\n\nArticle Five gives all of the power for creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch: the United States Congress and the state legislatures. The President of the United States cannot amend the Constitution. He has no part in the process of changing the Constitution. The United States Supreme Court confirmed this in a 1798 case called \"Hollingsworth v. Virginia\". In its decision, the Court wrote: \"[T]he President ... has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution.\" However, the Supreme Court cannot create an amendment either. \n\nThis is an example of the separation of powers (also called \"checks and balances\") that the Founding Fathers built into the new American government. If the President or the Supreme Court could change the Constitution any time they wanted to, they would have too much power. One person (or nine Supreme Court Justices) could make decisions that would affect every American. \n\nInstead, the Founders gave the job of creating Constitutional amendments to the Legislative Branch. By requiring that two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and three-quarters of the states, approve of every Constitutional amendment, they made sure that there would have to be a lot of debate, compromise, and thought before an amendment was approved. Also, because so many legislators have to approve every amendment, it is very difficult for small \"special interest\" groups (like people who only care about a certain part of the country, or a certain issue) cannot control the vote.\n\nThe Founders even put checks and balances on the Legislative Branch's powers. If Congress gets too powerful, the states can make it call a Constitutional Convention. If the states get too powerful, ordinary Americans can vote on a Constitutional amendment through ratifying conventions. As a legal scholar wrote later: \"The ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment [by ratifying conventions] might be called one of the most democratic moments in American history. ... Almost all voters in America had the unprecedented opportunity to [support] or condemn a federal constitutional amendment directly. ... The conventions ratified the choices of the people without fail.\"\n\nAlmost right away, the amendments process became very important. North Carolina and Rhode Island refused to ratify the Constitution without a Bill of Rights. This meant they would not be a part of the new United States Government. In 1789, James Madison wrote the Bill of Rights. They were ratified together, as the first ten amendments to the Constitution, in 1791. Having a Bill of Rights convinced North Carolina and Rhode Island to ratify the Constitution.\n\nThe amendments process set out in Article Five has allowed for many other important amendments to be added to the Constitution. For example, these amendments have included:\n\nIf Article Five had made the Constitution too hard to change, African-American people might still be slaves, and women might still not have the right to vote.\n", "id": "535360", "title": "Article Five of the United States Constitution"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535381", "text": "Article Two of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution creates the executive branch of the United States government. The executive branch includes the President; the Vice President; the Cabinet; executive departments, like the Department of State; independent agencies, like the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and other things like committees and commissions.\n\nSection One begins by giving federal executive power to the President only. This is part of the separation of powers that the Founding Fathers built into the Constitution. To prevent any part of the government from getting too powerful, they split the power between three branches. This clause gives executive power to the President. Another clause in Article One of the Constitution gives federal legislative (law-making) power to the United States Congress only. A third clause in Article Three gives judiciary power to the federal courts. No branch is allowed to do a job that the Constitution has given to another branch. For example, the President cannot make laws; that is the Legislature's job.\n\nThis clause says the President is the head of the Executive Branch. It also mentions the Vice President, though the Constitution does not give him any executive powers. However, the Constitution does say that the President and Vice President must be elected at the same time, for the same term (amount of time), and by the same constituency. The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure the Executive Branch would survive, and stay independent, if the Vice President had to become the President.\n\nUnder the U.S. Constitution, the President and Vice President are chosen by Electors. The Constitution allows each state legislature to decide how they will choose Electors. Since the 1820s, state legislatures have usually chosen Electors through an indirect popular vote. This means that people in the state will get to vote on which Electors they want. The ballot that people use to vote will have the Electors' names on it. Usually, it will also say what Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates they plan to support. This allows the people to choose Electors who support the candidates they like.\nEach state has two United States Senators and a certain number of United States Representatives representing them in Congress. (The number of Representatives depends on how many people live in the state.) Each state gets a number of Electors that is equal to the number of Members of Congress the state has. (For example, if a state has 2 Senators and 10 Representatives, they have 12 total Members of Congress, so they get 12 Electors.)\n\nThe only people who cannot be Electors are Senators, Representatives, and federal officers. This is meant to make sure that the Electoral College is made up of regular Americans, not politicians.\n\nThis clause talks about Electors and how they choose a President. Once they are chosen, the Electors meet in their states to vote for the President and Vice President. Originally, candidates only ran for President; there were no candidates for Vice President. Each Elector voted for two different candidates for President. They had to vote for at least one candidate who did not live in the Elector's home state. The candidate who got more than half of the votes became President. The candidate who got the next highest number of votes (the second-place winner) became Vice President.\n\nThis clause gives instructions for several possible problems:\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment changed this process in a few ways:\n\nArticle Two allows Congress to set a national Election Day.\n\nThis clause simply means that to be President, a person must meet three requirements:\n\nIf a person does not meet all of these requirements, they cannot be President.\n\nTwo later amendments changed these rules about who can be President and Vice President:\n\nThis clause talks about the possibility that the Presidency might become \"vacant\". This might happen because:\n\nIf the Presidency becomes vacant, the Vice President becomes President. If the Vice President is \"also\" unable to be President, Congress can decide who will become President. Whoever takes over the Presidency will act as President until the actual President gets better (if he is sick or disabled), or until a President is elected in the next Presidential election.\n\nCongress has come up with a \"line of succession\" a list of the people who would become President, and in what order, if both the Presidency and Vice Presidency became vacant. As of 2016, the order is: the Speaker of the House of Representatives; the President \"pro tempore\" of the Senate; and then the fifteen Cabinet Secretaries, in order of when their Departments were first created.\n\nThis clause was partially changed by the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967. That Amendment creates a process for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President. It also says that the Vice President can become Acting President (temporary President) if:\nIf the President declares himself unable to discharge his duties, he can take the Presidency back at any time. For example, in 2002, George W. Bush became the first President to formally use the Disability Clause. He gave power to his Vice President for about two hours while he had a medical test which required anesthesia. Once he felt ready to be President again, Bush took back the Presidency.\n\nIf the Vice President and the Cabinet say a President is unable to do his job, the President can still try to take control back. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet still think the President cannot do his job, they can challenge the President's return. If two-thirds of both the House and Senate agree, the President is declared unable to discharge his duties and the Vice President stays in control of the Presidency.\n\nThis means the President can receive a salary. However, the salary cannot be changed during the President's four-year term in office. Also, the President cannot receive any other salary, either from the federal government, or from any state government.\n\nBefore he becomes President, Clause 8 requires the new President to take an oath, promising that he will do his best as President, and will also do his best to protect and defend the Constitution. Usually, the Chief Justice of the United States gives the oath (\"swears in\" the new President) at the President's inauguration.\n\nSection 2 talks about the powers that Article Two grants to the President.\n\nThe Constitution gives the President the most powers in areas that have to do with national security and protecting the country.\n\nThe President is the military's Commander-in-Chief. However, as part of the system of checks and balances in the Constitution, Article One says that only Congress can declare war. Still, the President can take actions like sending soldiers to certain places without needing Congress's approval, or a declaration of war.\n\nThe President may ask the \"principal (head) officer\" of any executive department to give him advice in writing. The Constitution actually does not require a formal Cabinet. However, America's first President, George Washington, organized his principal offices into a Cabinet, and every President has done the same since.\n\nThe President may grant pardons or reprieves to people who were convicted of crimes (except when the person was impeached). A \"reprieve\" cancels or changes a punishment for example, changing a death sentence to a sentence of life in prison.\n\nThis part of Section 2 is called the \"Advice and Consent Clause\". It gives the President powers, but he has to use them with the \"advice and consent\" (agreement) of the Senate. This is another example of checks and balances in the Constitution.\n\nHere, the Constitution gives the President the power to make treaties with other countries. However, two-thirds of the Senators must agree with the treaty for it to take effect. If two-thirds of the Senate does not agree with the treaty, it is not approved, and there is nothing the President can do about it.\n\nThe Constitution does not say how the United States can \"end\" a treaty. Since the Constitution has passed, the government has done this in a few ways. In 1798, the first time the government wanted to end a treaty (the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France), Congress passed a law ending the treaty. Other times, in the 1800s, a few Presidents ended treaties after Congress asked them to. The first time a President ended a treaty without Congress's approval was in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter ended a treaty with the Republic of China. In a lawsuit called \"Goldwater v. Carter\", members of Congress asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether a President could end a treaty on his own. The Supreme Court could not agree on a decision, and the case was dismissed (ended without a decision).\n\nThe President may also choose judges, ambassadors, consuls (diplomats), ministers, and other officers; but again, he needs the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\nIf Congress chooses, it can let the President, heads of executive departments, or the courts appoint less important officials on their own, without needing Congress's approval.\n\nOnce the Senate gives advice and consent to the President (approves the President's choice for a job), and that person is given the job, the Senate cannot go back and change its mind. It cannot take away its advice and consent once the person gets the job.\n\nHowever, after the Senate grants advice and consent, the President \"can\" change his mind, and decide not to give the job to the person he nominated.\n\nIt is not clear whether the President can fire a person who was hired with the advice and consent of the Senate. Congress has limited this power many times. For example, during the Reconstruction Era, President Andrew Jackson wanted to fire people that Congress had approved. Congress passed a law saying he could not do that, but Jackson ignored the law. Later, Congress impeached him, but the Senate did not convict him.\n\nA Supreme Court case called \"Bowsher v. Synar\" (1986) decided that Congress can fire a person it approved. Congress can do this by repealing the law that gave the President permission to appoint that person.\n\nClause 3 has to do with Senate recesses (times when the Senate is not meeting). In the past, fast transportation was not available, and it could take a long time for members of Congress to get to Washington, D.C. Because of this, Congress would usually meet only during planned \"sessions,\" so everyone would have time to get there. After the planned sessions were over, the Senate would go into recess, and all the Senators would go home.\n\nDuring Senate recesses, the President may appoint officers to stand in for the missing Senators. However, these officers are temporary, and their permission to act as Senators expire (end) when the Senate finishes its next session.\n\nClause 1 of Section 3 is called the \"State of the Union Clause\". It says that \"from time to time,\" the President must give Congress information on the \"State of the Union.\" (\"State of the Union\" basically means \"The Situation in the United States.\")\n\nOriginally, Presidents personally delivered State of the Union Addresses to Congress every year. Thomas Jefferson thought this was too much like a King speaking from a throne. Instead, he would send Congress written messages, and clerks (assistants) would read them. Other Presidents did the same for over 100 years, until President Woodrow Wilson went back to speaking in front of Congress. Every President since Wilson has kept doing that .\n\nThe purpose of the State of the Union is to make sure the President shares information with Congress, as well as the entire country. This information helps Congress decide whether anything is happening that they need to pass laws for. It also lets the people in the country know what is happening in their government.\n\nThe President has the power to suggest to Congress anything he thinks is \"necessary [needed] and expedient [appropriate]\". This is called the \"Recommendation Clause\".\n\nThe Recommendation Clause is another part of the checks and balances in the Constitution. The President cannot just do anything he thinks is needed; he has to get Congress's approval. If the President gives recommendations to Congress, Congress can approve them. However, if the President gives no suggestions to Congress, Congress has no power to force him to.\n\nAlso, just by asking Congress, the President shows that he respects them as equals, and is not more powerful or important than they are, like a King would be. One scholar explains: \"The Recommendation Clause empowers the President to represent the people before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government, for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances [for problems to be fixed].\"\n\nClause 3 gives the President the right to call one or both Houses of Congress \"on extraordinary Occasions.\" This clause is meant to allow the government to act quickly in case a major emergency comes up when Congress is not in session. If the two Houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for when to adjourn a special session, the President may adjourn both Houses whenever he thinks it is appropriate.\n\nPresidents have called extraordinary sessions 27 times in history to deal with crises like wars or emergencies with the economy. The last time this happened was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session to try to get civil rights, Social Security, and health care laws passed.\n\nAfter airplane travel became common around the 1950s, Congress began meeting year-round. Since that time, no President has had to call a special session.\n\nThe President receives (greets and hosts) all foreign Ambassadors. This clause of the Constitution is called the \"Reception Clause\".\n\nThe President must \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed [used and followed].\" This clause in the Constitution is sometimes called the \"Take Care Clause\", the \"Faithful Execution Clause,\" or the \"Faithfully Executed Clause\".\n\nThis clause gives the President power, limits, and a duty, all at the same time:\n\nSupreme Court cases have focused on the duties and limits the Take Care Clause puts on the President. For example:\n\nThe President commissions \"all the Officers of the United States.\" (This means he gives these officers the power to do their jobs.) These include officers in both the military and foreign service (people who work for the United States government in other countries, like Ambassadors). However, Article One of the Constitution, Section 8, gives each state the power to appoint officers in their own militias.\n\nThe Constitution also allows some government officials to be removed from office (fired). The President, Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and other executive officers, as well as judges, may be impeached by the House of Representatives, and then tried in the Senate.\n\nAnyone who is convicted by impeachment is fired immediately. The Senate may also choose to prevent the person from holding any federal office in the future. These are the only punishments that an impeachment proceeding can give. However, the person can still be tried for civil and criminal charges in the courts, and punished if they are found guilty.\n\nImpeachment is a power that only Congress has. In \"Nixon v. United States\" (1993), the Supreme Court ruled that even they cannot review or change the Senate's decision in an impeachment trial. Its impeachment powers give Congress a way to make sure that no executive officials or judges are getting corrupt.\n\nThe Constitution says clearly that officials can be impeached for treason or bribery. But it does not say exactly what \"High crimes and Misdemeanors\" includes or does not include. \"High crimes\" is a phrase from old British law that means crimes committed by people with political power. However, in British history, \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" could include many different things (even losing a ship by not tying it up). After the Constitution was written, Alexander Hamilton explained in \"The Federalist Papers\" what kind of causes for impeachment the Founders had in mind: \"offences which [come] from the abuse or violation of some public trust. [They cause] injuries done immediately to the society itself.\"\n\nCongress has made the meaning of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" clearer by who they have chosen to impeach, and why. Since the Constitution was ratified, the House of Representatives has impeached 18 people - mostly judges, but also two Presidents. All but three of these 18 were impeached for crimes other than treason or bribery. For example:\n", "id": "535381", "title": "Article Two of the United States Constitution"}

They are also delivered and published at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. However, they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law. A later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular rule of law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often highlight the precise holding of the majority opinion. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes stated in 1936: \"A dissent in a Court of last resort is an appeal\".\n\nThe dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the existing case law, the application of different principles, or a different interpretation of the facts. \n", "id": "535412", "title": "Dissenting opinion"}

When no absolute majority of the court can agree on the basis for deciding the case, the decision of the court may be contained in a number of concurring opinions. The concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is called the plurality opinion.\n\nHaving failed to receive a majority of the court's votes, concurring opinions are not binding precedent (common law) and cannot be cited as such. But concurring opinions can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive precedent (assuming there is no binding precedent already in effect). The conflict in views between a majority opinion and a concurring opinion can assist a lawyer in understanding the points of law in the majority opinion. Occasionally, a judge will use a concurring opinion to signal that he or she is open to certain types of \"test cases\" that would allow the development of a new legal rule. In turn, such a concurring opinion may become more famous than the majority opinion in the same case. A well-known example of this phenomenon is \"Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.\" (1944).\n\nIn some courts, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered parts. Concurring justices may state that they join some parts of the majority opinion, but not others, for the reasons given in their concurring opinion.

It is a four-day event that starts the third Thursday of January through Sunday. This festive is in honor of Saint Sebastian. January 20th is the day that Catholic Church celebrates the life of this Saint. More than 200,000 people participate in this festival, making this activity be recognized internationally. Also, some Puerto Rican have started this festive in the United Sates.\n\nFather Juan Manuel Madrazo, the priest of the San José Church in the 1950’s, was the first person who organized the festival. The purpose of this festival was to commemorate the life of this Saint and raise money to repair the church. When the father was moved out of San Juan, this festival came to an end. It was not until 1970 when an historian and anthropologist named Ricardo Alegría propose to Rafaela Balladares de Brito, a resident of San Sebastian street, to revive this tradition. Balladares de Brito with the help of her neighbors began to reorganize the festival and recollect money for an elementary school directed by Sisters of Charity.\n\nDuring the past celebrations, a group of musicians in the early morning of the first days walked and announced the festivity though the street. People in costumes of Spanish Kings, Queen Isabel and King Fernando, wear huge mask over their heads and were called “Cabezudos”, also participated in the parade. During the procession, people carried the Saint’s Image from San Sebastian Street and ended at the San José Church. In addition, the neighbors decorated their home’s balcony and the streets. They also prepared typical food, wore dresses and participated as host of the music shows.\n\nIn the present, the addition of artisans has acquired more importance, as well as music and dance in the nights. Also, artists perform at different stages localized around the Old San Juan. “Cabezudos” now include characters representing the Puerto Rican folklore that pass through the streets dancing and singing followed by the public. Now, the parade is longer than the past ones and the municipality of San Juan is responsible in organizing the entire festival. Festivities vary year by year, but mainly include the ones mentioned above. \n\nIn the recent years, several of San Sebastian Festivals have been celebrated in different areas of Florida. This has been a result of many Puerto Ricans moving to this state and wanting to maintain a connection with their typical island traditions. The festivals programed in Florida have a duration of one to two days compared to the one celebrated in Puerto Rico which last four days.

The first group of LDCs was listed by the UN in November 1971. \n\nIndicators are used to determine whether a country is a least devleoped country.\n\nTo be considered a least developed country, a country must have high levels of poverty, low human resources and a vulnerable economy. The UN looks at indicators, such as gross national income, nutrition, health, education and literacy. Economic vulnerability is recorded on the Economic Vulnerability Index.\n\nLDC criteria are reviewed every three years. Countries may stop being considered an LDC when indicators show that they have become developed enough.

Although the Convention was called to revise the Articles of Confederation, it became clear from the beginning that many members, including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, intended to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the United States Constitution. This makes the meeting one of the most significant events in the history of the United States.\n\nMost of the disputes were about the makeup and election of the Senate. Other disagreements concerned how \"proportional representation\" was to be defined (whether to include slaves or other property). They needed to decide whether to divide the executive power between three persons or invest the power into a single president. They also had to work out how to elect the president, how long his term was to be and whether he could stand for reelection. There were issues over what offenses should be impeachable. Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues, while the powers of legislature, executive, and judiciary were not heavily disputed. Once the Convention began, the delegates first agreed on the principles of the Convention, then they agreed on Madison's Virginia Plan and began to modify it. A Committee of Detail assembled during the July 4 recess and produced a rough draft. Most of this rough draft remained in place, and can be found in the final version of the constitution. After the final issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final version, and it was voted on and sent to the states.\n\nJames Madison had spent the winter of 1787 making a study of various confederations throughout history. He came to Philadelphia armed with a wealth of knowledge and an idea for what the United States government should be. His plan was presented to the Convention by Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia. It became the broad outline of what would be a new government under the U.S. Constitution. His plan called for three branches of government with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from abusing their power. Madison's idea for a legislature had two houses. One would feature members elected by the people for a three-year term. The other would have its members elected by the state legislatures and would serve for 7 years. Both would have the seats determined by the population of the country.\nAfter debating the Virginia plan for two weeks, William Patterson presented his plan called variously, the New Jersey Plan, the Patterson Plan and the Small State Plan. It was very similar to the Articles of Confederation and featured a unicameral (one house) legislature. All states would have one vote. He had one idea that was kept; that state laws that ran counter to federal laws would be voided.\n\nA third plan was offered by Alexander Hamilton. It was a copy of the British Constitution. It also was bicameral with an upper house and a legislature in which members served on their good behavior.\n\nFinally they worked out a compromise between all three plans. The new government would have an upper house, having an equal number of delegates from each state, and a lower house with representation based on population. The executive branch would have most of the responsibilities of foreign affairs while other important powers, like ratifying treaties, would be the responsibility of the legislative branch. After the new Constitution was ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789.\n", "id": "535591", "title": "Constitutional Convention (United States)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535597", "text": "Article Four of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle Four of the United States Constitution outlines the relationship between the various states, as well as the connection between the states and the federal government.\n\nThe first section requires states to recognize the \"full faith and credit\" of the public acts, records and court proceedings of other states. \nThis clause makes certain that any judicial decisions made in courts of one state are recognized and honored in all other states. This eliminates the practice of \"forum shopping\", the practice of having a legal case heard in the court thought most likely to provide a favorable judgment. It also prevents someone moving from one state to another to escape a judgment. \nIn \"Mills v. Duryee\" (1813), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the merits of a case, as settled by courts of one state, must be recognized by the courts of other states. state courts may not reopen cases which have been conclusively decided by the courts of another state. Later, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that the judgment of one state court must be recognized by other states' courts as final. However, in \"McElmoyle v. Cohen\" (1839), the court heard a case where one party obtained a judgment in South Carolina and sought to enforce it in Georgia, which had a statute of limitations that barred actions on judgments after a certain amount of time had passed. The court upheld Georgia's refusal to enforce the South Carolina judgment. The court found that out-of-state judgments are subject to the procedural law of the states where they are enforced, notwithstanding any priority it may be given in the state in which they it was issued.\nClause One of Section 2 requires interstate protection of \"privileges and immunities\". The apparent ambiguity of the clause has given rise to a number of different interpretations. Some contend that the clause requires Congress to treat all citizens equally. Others suggest that citizens of states carry the rights accorded by their home states while traveling in other states.\n\nNeither of these theories has been endorsed by the Supreme Court. A state may not discriminate against citizens of other states in favor of its own citizens. But certain exceptions are allowed. For example a state may give their own citizens the right to buy a hunting or fishing license at a lower cost than to nonresidents. \n\nClause Two requires that fugitives from justice may be extradited on the demand of executive authority of the state from which they flee. The Supreme Court has held that it is not compulsory for the fugitive to have fled after an indictment was issued, but only that the fugitive fled after having committed the crime. The Constitution provides for the extradition of fugitives who have committed treason, felony or other crime. That phrase incorporates all acts prohibited by the laws of a state, including misdemeanors and small, or petty, offenses.\n\nIn \"Kentucky v. Dennison\" (1860), the Supreme Court held that the federal courts may not compel state governors to surrender fugitives through the issue of writs of mandamus. The \"Dennison\" decision was overruled by \"Puerto Rico v. Branstad\" (1987). Now, the federal courts may require the extradition of fugitives. Alleged fugitives generally may not challenge extradition proceedings.\nPierce Butler and Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, submitted this clause to the Constitutional Convention. James Wilson and Roger Sherman both objected and Butler withdrew the clause. However, on the next day the clause was reinstated and adopted by the Convention without objection. At the last moment the language was changed from \"Person legally held to Service or Labour in one state\" to read \"Person held to Service or Labour in one state, under the Laws thereof\". \n\nIn 1865, the Fugitive Slave Clause was repealed by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery.\nThe First Clause of Section Three grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to 50. It also forbids the creation of new states from parts of existing states without the consent of both the affected states and Congress. This latter provision was designed to gave Eastern states that still had claims to Western lands (e.g., Virginia and North Carolina) to have a veto over whether their western counties (which eventually became Kentucky and Tennessee) could become states. It would later be applied with regard to the formation of Maine (from Massachusetts) and West Virginia (from Virginia).\n\nThis clause, commonly known as the \"Property\" or \"Territorial\" Clause, grants Congress the constitutional authority for the management and control of all territories or other property owned by United States. Additionally, the clause also proclaims that nothing contained within the Constitution may be interpreted to harm (prejudice) any claim of the United States, or of any particular State. The exact scope of this clause has long been a matter of debate.\n\nThe federal government owns or controls about thirty percent of the land in the United States. These holdings include national parks, national forests, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, vast tracts of range and public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, reservations held in trust for Native American tribes, military bases, and ordinary federal buildings and installations. Although federal property can be found in every state, the largest concentrations are in the west, where, for example, the federal government owns over eighty percent of the land within Nevada. \n\nThis clause, sometimes referred to as the Guarantee Clause, has long been at the fore-front of the debate about the rights of citizens compared to those of the government. The Guarantee Clause mandates that all U.S. states must be grounded in republican principles, such as the consent of the governed. By ensuring that all states must have the same type of government (a republic), the Guarantee Clause is one of several portions of the Constitution which mandates symmetric federalism between the states.\n\nSection Four requires the United States to protect each state from invasion, and, upon the application of the state legislature (or executive, if the legislature cannot be convened), from domestic violence. This provision was discussed during the 1967 Detroit riot, but was not invoked.\n\n\n", "id": "535597", "title": "Article Four of the United States Constitution"}

Herschel left Hanover for England on August 16, 1772, with her brother.\n\nHerschel left for England in August, 1772. Her neighbor taught how to cook, market, and to speak English. This expanded her horizons. William encouraged Herschel to be independant. She signed up to learn how to sing and to play the harpsichord. This led her to being a part of William’s musical shows in small gatherings. Herschel and William discussed astronomy in their free time. This caused her interest for constellations to grow. Herschel began including English society in her everyday life. This was because of the influence William had on her. Herschel was asked to be a soloist for oratorios. She eventually decided to devote her time to astronomy. This helped William because he needed Herschel’s talents in copying papers. \n\nHerschel helped her brother with his studies and career in science. She helped him to discover Uranus with a six-foot telescope. Herschel’s brother was credited with the discovery of Uranus. He was knighted because of their discovery, and she became his assistant. Herschel was the first woman to have a governmental position in England. She dedicated herself to helping her brother. She recorded and completed tasks for him. Her calculations and record keeping were always accurate. They saved her brother a lot of time. Herschel often worked on discoveries of her own. She discovered the Andromeda and Cetus nebulae. Nebulae are clouds of gasses that turn into stars. Herschel had discovered 14 other nebulae by the end of the year. She also discovered 8 comets.\n\nHerschel's family loved each other very much. She had a brother, William Herschel which was very famous for his work. William Herschel got married in 1788 and Caroline Herschel was worried about having to share a home with him and his wife. His wife became one of her good friends. Herschel's brother died in 1822 and left her without his financial support. She returned to Hanover after his death and received her stipend from the British royal family. She also helped her brother's son finish his father's work. \n\nCaroline Herschel was awarded a gold medal for her works in science from the Royal Astronomical Society in 1828. She was made an honorary member at the Royal Astronomical Society ten years later. Herschel also received a similar award from the Royal Irish Academy. She was awarded the gold medal for science by the King of Prussia on her ninety-sixth birthday.\n\nHerschel died on January 9, 1848 in Germany. She died at the age of 97. Herschel was never married. \n\nAn asteroid was discovered in 1888. It was called Lucretia, Herschel's middle name. Herschel continued to have a legacy after her death because she discovered several comets. \n\nShe was the first woman to discover a comet. She discovered seven more comets between 1789 and 1797. The comet 35P/Herschel-Rigollet is named in her honor, as well as the lunar crater C. Herschel, and the planetoid (281) Lucretia. She also is famous for her work with her brother.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535634", "text": "Article Three of the United States Constitution\n\nArticle Three of the United States Constitution creates the judicial branch of the United States government. It creates the Supreme Court of the United States, and allows the United States Congress to create less powerful federal courts. It also sets out the powers that these courts have.\n\nSection 1 of Article Three starts out by creating the Supreme Court one court that will be more powerful than any other court in the country. It also gives Congress the power to create \"inferior\" (less powerful) federal courts.\n\nIt allows judges in these courts to get a regular salary for their work. Section 1 protects the judges by saying that their salaries will not be decreased while they are in office (working as a federal judge).\n\nSection 1 says that judges \"shall hold their Offices [keep their jobs] during good Behavior.\" This is meant to protect federal judges, and also to make sure that the federal judiciary is independent.\nBefore it won its independence in the American Revolutionary War, America was a colony of the British Empire. The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution just four years after the War ended. They still remembered what the courts in the American colonies were like. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, Britain's King George III \"made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\" \n\nThis meant that the judges could not be independent or impartial. If they made a decision that King George did not like, they could be fired, or not paid. Judges who wanted to keep their jobs made decisions based on what King George would want, not based on what the law said. If judges are cannot be independent, or do not follow they law, courts are not fair, and there is no way for regular people to get justice.\n\nThe Constitution makes sure that this will not happen to United States federal judges. By saying judges \"shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,\" Section 1 is basically allowing judges to keep their jobs for the rest of their lives. In , the Constitution does say that Congress can take away a judge's job but only after being convicted in a trial, and only for \"Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors.\" (This is what Section 1 means by behavior that is not \"good.\") In other words, the Constitution makes sure that all judges will lose their jobs for making even the slightest unpopular decision. This denies judges the freedom to be independent, and to make the decisions that they think are fair, and makes them choose between right and reelection.\n\nArticle III clearly allows only one Supreme Court. However, it does not say how many Supreme Court Justices (judges) there should be. Congress solved this problem in 1948 by passing a law. The law says that the Supreme Court will have 9 Justices, including one Chief Justice.\n\nIn both Section 1 and in , the Constitution gives Congress the right to create courts that are \"inferior\" to the Supreme Court. However, the Constitution does not say how many \"inferior\" courts there should be, or how they should be set up. It leaves those decisions to Congress. Congress decided to create two different kinds of \"inferior\" courts (also called \"lower courts\"). In the Judiciary Act of 1789, they created:\n\n\nClause 1 of Section 2 explains the powers the federal court has, and the limits of those powers. \n\nClause 1 gives the federal courts the power to hear and judge actual \"cases and controversies\" only. For example, they cannot hear a case about a situation that might come up in the future.\n\nWhen Clause 2 talks about \"jurisdiction,\" it is talking about who has the power to hear a case. \n\n\"Original jurisdiction\" is the power to hear a case first, before any other court. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in:\n\nIn all the other cases mentioned in Clause 2, the Supreme Court has \"appellate jurisdiction.\" That means another court has the power to hear the case first. If somebody appeals that court's decision, the Supreme Court can take the case on appeal. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court the power to hear appeals on:\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court can only review a case on appeal if it thinks the lower court's decision breaks a law or goes against the Constitution.\n\nThere is one specific power that Clause 2 does not give the federal judiciary. Clause 2 says that the federal judiciary has power over \"the laws of the United States.\" However, it does \"not\" say that the federal courts have power over the laws of \"individual\" states. Also, when Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, they also never gave the federal courts this power. This means that the federal courts can only review or change the decisions of state supreme courts if the state decision may have broken a federal law or the Constitution. The federal courts had no power to review or change state supreme court decisions that were just based on state laws. Basically, this gave each state supreme court the final say over the laws in their state. Different states could decide completely different things, so the laws might be completely different in one state than another.\n\nIn 1795, the Eleventh Amendment changed part of Clause 2. It took away the federal judiciary's power to get involved in lawsuits between states and citizens of other states or countries.\n\nIn \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress cannot change the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. However, the appellate jurisdiction of the Court is different. Congress is able to make the rules for the federal courts' appellate division, including rules about their jurisdictions. \n\n\"Marbury v. Madison\" also created an important power called judicial review. This is the Supreme Court's ability to review whether a law, treaty, or executive rule breaks a law that already exists, a state Constitution, or the United States Constitution. After \"Marbury\", the Supreme Court started keeping an eye on what the state and federal governments were doing, instead of just trying cases that people brought to them.\n\nClause 2 says that the Supreme Court has \"judicial power [over] all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution [and] the Laws of the United States...\" However, it does not say exactly what this means. The Supreme Court clarified this in a case called \"Osborn v. Bank of the United States\" (1824). Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote an opinion about what a \"federal\" case is, and what \"arising under\" the Constitution or federal laws means. Basically, he said a case is federal and under the federal courts' original jurisdiction if:\n\nClause 3 of Section 2 says that federal crimes have to be tried in front of a jury, unless the defendant does not want a jury. The only type of federal crime that is not tried before a jury is an impeachment. (Article One, Section 3 of the Constitution says that only the United States Senate can try impeachment cases.)\n\nClause 3 also says the person's trial must be held in the state where they did the crime. If they did not do the crime in any particular state, then Congress gets to choose where the trial will be held.\n\nSeveral of the Constitutional Amendments in the Bill of Rights talk more about the rights of people who are on trial in criminal or civil court.\n\nThe last section of Article 3 talks about treason and how it should be punished. The Founding Fathers wanted to make sure that Americans' rights were protected. They also knew that in the past, in England, some kings had gotten rid of their political opponents just by accusing them of treason. For these reasons, the Founders wanted to make sure the Constitution said specifically what crimes were treason; what would be needed to find people guilty; and what the punishments could be.\nThe Constitution is very specific about what crimes are treason:\n\nSection 3 also makes it clear that treason must be an \"overt act.\" This means that to commit treason, a person must actually do something, not just plan to do it. For example, if a group of people got together and planned to attack part of the United States, that would not be treason because they had not actually done anything yet to hurt the country. If they did attack the United States, that would be an overt act, and it would be treason.\n\nIt also says that there are only two ways for a person to be convicted of treason. Two different witnesses must say in court that they saw the person do that overt act. If there are not two witnesses, then the person must admit in court that they committed treason. If neither of these things happen, the person cannot be found guilty of treason. Parts of this rule came from a British law called the Treason Act 1695.\n\nFinally, Section 3 talks about punishment for people found guilty of treason. It gives Congress the power to decide the punishment. However, there is one punishment that the Constitution does not allow: punishing a person's family and descendants for that person's crime. In English law, if a person was convicted of treason, their punishment would include an \"Attainder\" (also called a \"Corruption of Blood\"). This meant that not only the person, but their family and heirs, would be punished and thought of as guilty. Once a person was \"attainted,\" they would be executed. However, their heirs would also lose the right to inherit that person's land, property, or money.\n\nThe end of Section 3 specifically says that this punishment is not allowed. When the Founders wrote \"no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted,\" they meant: \"No heirs may be punished, and Congress can make the traitor forfeit (give up) their property, but only during their lifetime.\" Their heirs would have to be able to inherit their property when the traitor died.\n", "id": "535634", "title": "Article Three of the United States Constitution"}

It is the only Amendment to repeal another amendment. It is also the only Amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures.\n\nThe Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had started a period in the US known as Prohibition. During this time the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement. but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime had soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol. The federal government was unable to enforce the Volstead Act. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time. This was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933, it chose the \"other\" ratification method established by Article V. That is by state conventions. \n\nThe second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages. Many U.S. states still remained \"dry\" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until 1966. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments have tried to revoke liquor licenses.\n\nSection 2 has been the source of every Supreme Court ruling directly addressing Twenty-first Amendment issues. Early rulings suggested that Section 2 enabled states to legislate with exceptionally broad constitutional powers. \n\nIn \"State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co.\", (1936), the Supreme Court held that a state could require a license fee for importing beer from other states and also for manufacturing beer within the state. The court recognized that \"Prior to the Twenty-first Amendment it would obviously have been unconstitutional\" for a state to require a fee for such a privilege. \n\nIn \"Craig v. Boren\" (1976), the Supreme Court addressed the issue of proposed legislation with different ages for males and females regarding alcohol consumption in Oklahoma (age 18 for females, age 21 for males). The Court overturned the motion because of a presumed violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn \"South Dakota v. Dole\" (1987), the Supreme Court upheld the withholding of some federal highway funds to states in which the legal drinking age is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful. The Court held that the limitations on spending power in the Twenty-First Amendment did not prohibit Congress to indirectly achieve federal objectives.\n\nIn \"44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island\" (1996), Rhode Island passed a law that banned liquor advertising from places that did not sell liquor. The petitioners based their suit on their First Amendment right to free speech. In a unanimous decision the Court held that states cannot use the Twenty-first Amendment to abridge freedom of speech protections under the First Amendment. However, the Court acknowledged the state was empowered to regulate the sale of liquor under the Twenty-First Amendment.\n\n", "id": "535719", "title": "Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

The amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961.\n\nAccording to the terms of the amendment, the district is allocated as many electors as it would have if it were a state, but no more electors than the least populous state (currently Wyoming, which has three electors); thus, the district cannot have more than three electors. Even if it were a state, the district's population would entitle it to only three electors. Since the passage of this amendment, the District's electoral votes have been cast for the Democratic Party's presidential and vice presidential candidates in every election.\n\nWhen the Constitution was ratified, the nation's capital was New York City. However, Article one, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution states:\nSelecting the site for the new capital was a political compromise. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury and bankers, mainly from the northeast, got the Bank of the United States located in Philadelphia. In exchange, a special District of Columbia would be located on the Potomac River, closer to the southern states and controlled by Congress.\n\nWashington DC was founded on July 16, 1790 on a site selected by George Washington. He appointed three commissioners to prepare the city for the new government, scheduled for 1800. While this was taking place, from 1790 until 1800, the capital was Philadelphia. \n\nIn 1800, as planned, the District of Columbia became the nation's capital. At the time the population was only about 5,000 residents. As a district and federal territory, the population did not have a local or state government. They also could not vote in federal elections.\n\nPassed by Congress on June 17, 1960, and ratified by the states on March 29, 1961, Amendment XXIII, for the purposes of the Electoral College, treats the District of Columbia the same as if it were a state. This gives the citizens of the District the right to vote in presidential elections. The Amendment does not make the district a state, it gives the residents the same number of electors the same number as if it were a state. But, per the amendment, no more than the smallest state. The Amendment does not give district citizens any representation in Congress. Congress continues to govern the district.\n\nWhile the District of Columbia is considered politically neutral at the time of passage in 1961, the District swung dramatically toward the Democratic Party since. African-Americans have voted in greater numbers than they had in the 1940s and 1950s. According to the 1970 census, 71% of the Federal District was black, a dramatic jump. As a result, the District has sent its 3 electoral votes to the Democratic candidate in every single presidential election since 1964. However, the District's electoral votes have yet to prove decisive in a presidential election. The smallest Electoral College majority won by a Democratic president since the Twenty-third Amendment's ratification was the 56 vote majority achieved by Jimmy Carter in 1976.\n\n", "id": "535745", "title": "Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535761", "text": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution says that if the President becomes unable to do his job, the Vice President becomes the President. This can happen for just a little while, if the President is just sick or disabled for a short time. It could also happen until the end of the President's term (his time in office), if the President died, resigned, or lost his job.\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also says what should happen if there is a \"vacancy\" in the Vice President's office (meaning there is no Vice President). Finally, it makes rules about who would do the President's job if neither the President or the Vice President could (for example, if both were killed at the same time). \n\nThe United States Congress ratified (approved) the Amendment on February 10, 1967.\n\n of the Constitution says:\nThis means that if the President is fired, dies, resigns, or is unable \"to discharge [his] Powers and Duties\" (unable to do the things a President has to do), the Vice President will take over his job. The Vice President will do the President's job until he gets better (if he is just sick or disabled), or until the next Presidential election (if the President resigned or is dead). If neither the President or the Vice President can do the President's job, Congress can decide who takes over the President's job. This is all the Constitution says about this subject.\n\nThis clause was not very specific. It did not say:\n\nBecause the Constitution did not include rules for any of these things, it was not clear what the government should do when presidents died or resigned.\nIn 1841, the ninth President, William Henry Harrison, became the first United States President to die in office. Before this, Representative John Williams had suggested that the Vice President should become Acting President if the President died. Also, after Harrison died, his Cabinet had met and decided that Vice President John Tyler would become \"Vice-President Acting President.\" However, Tyler did not like this idea. He announced that he had become the President, and was not just doing the old President's job. He refused to look at any papers that were addressed to him as \"Acting President.\"\n\nTyler took the Presidential Oath, moved into the White House, and took over all of the old President's powers. Nobody formally challenged Tyler's claim to the Presidency. Eventually, both Houses of Congress passed a resolution saying that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States. This created \"the precedent of full succession.\" A precedent is a rule or law that might be followed in the future if a similar situation came up again. \"Full succession\" means that the Vice President would become the President, not Acting President, if the actual President died. The \"precedent of full succession\" became known as the \"Tyler Precedent.\"\n\nAt other times, Presidents did not die, but they were unable to do their jobs because of illness. For example, during his Presidency, Woodrow Wilson had a stroke. However, the First Lady, Edith Wilson, and the official White House doctor kept the stroke a secret. Because of this, no one took over the Presidency, even though Wilson could not do the job at that time.\n\nBefore the 25th Amendment, the office of Vice President had been empty eighteen times because the Vice President died, resigned, or had to take over for the President. For example, there was no Vice President for nearly four years after Franklin D. Roosevelt died.\n\nThese problems made it clear that the government needed more specific rules.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was murdered. Kennedy's assassination made it very clear to Congress that they needed to figure out a solution about presidential succession right away. The United States was in the middle of the Cold War. The new President, Lyndon B. Johnson, had once had a heart attack. The next two people in line for the presidency were the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John McCormack (who was 71 years old), and the President pro tempore of the Senate, Carl Hayden (who was 86 years old). Congress started moving more quickly.\n\nMembers of Congress suggested two different amendments to fill in the details missing from Clause 6.\n\nThe KeatingKefauver Proposal suggested allowing Congress to make a law about who should decide when a President is disabled. It was proposed in 1963 by Senator Kenneth Keating of New York, and supported by Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver. However, other Senators were worried that Congress could abuse this power, or would not actually make the law after the amendment was passed.\n\nThe BayhCeller Proposal ended up becoming the Twenty-fifth Amendment. On January 6, 1965, Senator Birch Bayh proposed the amendment in the United States Senate, and Representative Emanuel Celler (Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee) proposed it in the United States House of Representatives. Unlike the KeatingKefauver Proposal, it suggested a way to fill the Vice President's position if it was empty, and also set out rules for how a President could be declared \"disabled.\"\n\nOn February 19, 1965, the Senate passed the amendment. However, the House passed a different version of the amendment on April 13. The House and Senate had to form committees to figure out a version of the amendment they could all agree on. On July 6, 1965, both Houses of Congress passed the final version of the amendment and sent it to the states for ratification.\n\nFor the Twenty-fifth Amendment to be added to the Constitution, three-fourths of the state legislatures (38 out of the 50) would have to ratify the Amendment. It took almost two years for 38 states to ratify the Amendment. After the Amendment was added to the Constitution, another nine states ratified it. Three states never did.\n\nThe states ratified the Amendment in this order:\n\nSection 1 made the \"Tyler Precedent\" a law. It says that if a President is removed from office, dies, or resigns, the Vice President immediately becomes President (not \"Acting President\").\n\nBefore the Twenty-fifth Amendment, if the Vice President's position was empty, it stayed empty until the next election.\n\nUnder Section 2, whenever there is a vacancy in the office of Vice President, the President nominates someone to replace the Vice President. If a majority of both Houses of Congress agree, that person becomes the Vice President.\n\nSection 3 says that a President can declare himself \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\" (unable to do his job). He must say this in a written letter to both the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Once the President does this, the Vice President becomes Acting President. The President can take back the Presidency at any time by sending letters to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House, saying he is able to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency again.\n\nSection 4 is the only part of the Amendment that has never been used. It allows other executive officials to declare the President unable to do his job. The Vice President must agree to do this. So must:\n\nTo declare the President unable to do his job, these people would have to sign and give a letter to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. Like with Section 3, the Vice President would then become the Acting President.\n\nThe President may take back the Presidency by sending a letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. However, if the Vice President and the Cabinet think the President is still disabled and still cannot do his job, they can challenge his return. They have four days to write another declaration saying the President is still unable to do his job. Congress then has to get together within 48 hours, if they are not already in session. Then Congress has 21 days to make a decision. In the meantime, the Vice President is still Acting President.\n\nIf two-thirds of each House of Congress votes that the President still cannot do his job, the Vice President would continue to be Acting President. If Congress does not vote this way, or if they do not vote at all within 21 days, the President takes over the Presidency again.\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment has been invoked (used) six times since it was added to the Constitution. Section 1 has been used once; Section 2 has been used twice; and Section 3 has been used three times. Only Section 4 has never been used, though it was considered twice.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, before the House could vote on whether to impeach him for crimes related to the Watergate scandal. Vice President Gerald Ford became President as soon as Nixon resigned.\n\nOn October 10, 1973, Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned. Two days later, President Richard Nixon nominated United States Representative Gerald Ford of Michigan to be the new Vice President. According to Section 2, more than 50% of each House of Congress had to approve Ford as Vice President. By December 6, 97% of the Senate and 92% of the House had approved Ford. Ford was sworn in to the Vice Presidency later on December 6 before both Houses of Congress. Ford is the only person in United States history ever to be Vice President, and later President, without being elected to either office.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned, the Vice Presidency became vacant. On August 20, 1974, the new President Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to be the new Vice President. On December 10, 1974, the Senate confirmed Rockefeller with a vote of 90–7. Nine days later, the House voted 287-128 to confirm Rockefeller. He was sworn into office later on December 19, 1974, before the Senate.\n\nPresidents have used Section 3 of the 25th Amendment three times. Each time, they have given power to their Vice Presidents for a short time because they needed to get anesthesia for medical tests or surgery. The three Acting Presidents in United States history are listed below.\n\nOn July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan found out that he had a small growth in his colon that could turn into colon cancer. His doctor told him he needed surgery. Reagan decided to have surgery right away.\nHowever, Reagan did not want to invoke Section 3 of the 25th Amendment. He was worried that giving Presidential power away would set a bad precedent. The White House's head lawyer and Reagan's Chief of Staff suggested that he use Section 3 and give power to Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nTwo letters were created. The first invoked Section 3 and said Reagan would be unable to discharge his duties. The second said that Reagan knew about Section 3, and did not think it applied to his situation, but still wanted Bush to take over during his surgery. On July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and had it delivered to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House.\n\nReagan's autobiography, and other books, argue that Reagan clearly meant to give power to Vice President Bush. The White House lawyer, Fred Fielding, said:\nHowever, since Reagan did not specifically mention Section 3 and say he could not do his job as President, he did not officially invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nOn June 29, 2002, President George W. Bush became the first President to officially invoke Section 3. He needed a colonoscopy, a test of the colon, and would be getting anesthesia. He formally gave power to his Vice President, Dick Cheney, using the rules that the 25th Amendment set out. Unlike Reagan, he specifically said he was using Section 3 of the 25th Amendment in his letter to the President pro tempore and the Speaker of the House. After about two hours, Bush was awake and took back the Presidency.\n\nOn July 21, 2007, President Bush again invoked Section 3 so he could have another colonoscopy. Again, Cheney was Acting President for about two hours, until Bush was ready to take back the Presidency.\n\nTwice, President Ronald Reagan's staff thought about using Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to have him declared unable to do his job.\n\nOn March 30, 1981, a man named John Hinckley tried to kill President Ronald Reagan. Reagan was shot and needed surgery, so he could not invoke Section 3 to give power to his Vice President. His Vice President, George H.W. Bush, did not invoke Section 4, because he was on an airplane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush got to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1995, Birch Bayh, who had written the Senate version of the 25th Amendment, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.\n\nIn 1987, Reagan's Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, resigned. Howard Baker replaced him. Regan's staff told Baker that Reagan seemed lazy and unable to do his job. They told him to be ready for Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to be invoked.\n\nAccording to the PBS program \"American Experience\":\n\nIn an interview on the program, Edmund Morris, who had written a biography of Reagan, said:\n", "id": "535761", "title": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

People allergic to rice might have sneezing, runny nose, itching, asthma, stomachache or eczema after they eat rice. Besides eating rice, people with a rice allergy can have reactions breathing rice steam from cooked rice. Allergic people might have skin rashes and swellings. Moreover, they might stop breathing and die due to cardiac arrest.\n\nPeople suspected of having a rice allergy can try diet avoidance on their own. First, they have to avoid rice for a couple of weeks. If they don’t have symptoms in the avoidance period, but have those when exposed to rice, they are most likely allergic to rice.\n\nSpecific rice IgE, a kind of antibody in human blood, will rise significantly when people are allergic to rice. A blood test shows the level of the antibody. \n\nA skin prick test, the most efficient diagnosis, shows the reactions in a short period.

They were sent to the legislatures of the several states for ratification. If adopted, it would establish a formula for determining the appropriate size of the House of Representatives following each constitutionally required wikt:decennial census. It is the only one of the twelve proposed amendments that has not been adopted, as it has not been ratified by enough states for it to become part of the Constitution.\n\nBecause Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the Congressional Apportionment Amendment is still technically pending before the states. Ratification by an additional 27 states is now necessary for this amendment to be adopted. The other 1789 article of amendment (\"Article the Second\") of the original 12, was finally ratified in 1992. It became the Twenty-seventh Amendment.\n\nThe \"ideal\" number of seats in the House of Representatives has been a subject of controversy since the country's founding. The delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention set the representation ratio at one representative for every 40,000 people. Upon the suggestion of George Washington, the ratio was changed to 1:30,000. This was the only time Washington voiced an opinion on any of the actual issues debated during the convention.\nIn Federalist No. 55, James Madison argued that the size of the House of Representatives has to balance the ability of the body to legislate with the need for legislators to have a relationship close enough to the people to understand their local circumstances, that such representatives' social class be low enough to sympathize with the feelings of the mass of the people, and that their power be diluted enough to limit their abuse of the public trust and interests. \n\nAnti-Federalists, who opposed the Constitution's ratification, noted that there was nothing in the document to guarantee that the number of seats in the House would continue to represent small constituencies as the general population of the states grew. They feared that over time, if the size remained relatively small and the districts became more expansive, that only well-known individuals with reputations spanning wide geographic areas could secure election. It was also feared that those in Congress would, as a result, have an insufficient sense of sympathy with and connectedness to ordinary people in their district.\n\nThis concern was evident in the various state ratifying conventions, where several specifically requested an amendment to secure a minimum size for the House of Representatives. Virginia's ratification resolution proposed,\n\nAnti-Federalist Melancton Smith declared at the New York ratifying convention that, \nFederalists, who supported the Constitution's ratification, placated those opposing its ratification by agreeing that the new government should immediately address Anti-Federalist concerns and consider amending the Constitution. The assurance that these issues would be addressed in the First Congress was essential to the ratification of the new form of government.\n\nAn amendment establishing a formula for determining the appropriate size of the House of Representatives and the appropriate apportionment of representatives among the states was one of several proposed amendments to the Constitution introduced first in the House on June 8, 1789, by Representative James Madison of Virginia. Madison's original intent was, \n\nThis, along with Madison's other proposals, was referred to a committee consisting of one representative from each state. After emerging from committee, the full House debated the issue and, on August 24, 1789, passed it and sixteen other articles of amendment. The proposals went next to the Senate, which made 26 substantive alterations. On September 9, 1789, the Senate approved a culled and consolidated package of twelve articles of amendment. Changed in this amendment was the apportionment formula to be followed once the number of House members reached 100.\n\nAt the time it was sent to the states for ratification, an affirmative vote by ten states would have made this amendment operational. That number rose to eleven on March 4, 1791, when Vermont joined the Union. By the end of 1791, the amendment was only one state short of the mark. However, when Kentucky attained statehood on June 1, 1792, the number climbed to twelve, and, even though Kentucky ratified the amendment that summer (along with the other eleven amendments), it was still one state short. No additional states ratified this amendment since. To become part of the Constitution, 27 additional ratifications are required.\n\nEugene Martin LaVergne, a former attorney claims to have found evidence that the entire proposed Bill of Rights, including this proposed amendment, was ratified by Connecticut in 1790. As such, Kentucky's 1792 ratification would have been sufficient for the amendment to meet the constitutional requirement to become part of the Constitution. However, according to LaVergne the Connecticut ratification was never forwarded to Congress for action. LaVergne argued the point in a lawsuit against a number of federal officials, but the case was dismissed. The dismissal was summarily affirmed \"per curiam\" by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third CircuitThird Circuit, ending the case.\n\n", "id": "535830", "title": "Congressional Apportionment Amendment"}

Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but this was uncertain for decades. The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962. It is approaching the Milky Way at about 350 km/s. This strengthened the evidence for its being in the Local Group. Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by measurements of its distance by observations of Cepheids. Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the galactic plane of the Milky Way. It is heavily obscured by interstellar matter.\n\nThe apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup.\n\nIC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies. It has many more Wolf-Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpc²) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpc²) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpc²). Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is much smaller. The evolutionary status of the Wolf-Rayet stars suggests they all formed in a relatively short period. The galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04–0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for a few billion years longer.\n\nObservations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. Perhaps small grains were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars.\n\nThe galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68′ × 80′, which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5′ × 7.0′). IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope.

It was signed by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787. It replaced the Articles of Confederation, that served as new nation's first constitution. The government under the Articles proved to be weak and inefficient. When the convention was called to meet in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787, most of the members were aware a new stronger government was necessary.\n\nThe history of the (second) Constitution of the United States begins with the history behind the creation of the Articles of Confederation, the first constitution. The Articles of Confederation were, in effect, a loose confederation that joined together thirteen independent states to mainly deal with foreign policy. For all other purposes they remained sovereign states. The greatest weakness of the Articles of Confederation is that it had no direct connection to the people themselves. It recognized state sovereignty. Each state collected its own taxes, provided its own militia and printed its own currency. A weak Congress was the chief instrument in the new government. There was no executive branch. The recent tyranny suffered under Britain's King George III made the new country's leaders wary of a strong central government. In Congress, each state only had one vote. States with small populations had the same voting rights as states ten times their size. Amending the Articles required a unanimous vote, which was virtually impossible with thirteen states each having their own interests. \n\nHowever, the weaknesses became rapidly apparent. Congress could not levy taxes and so could not effectively support any war effort. The central government did not have the ability to negotiate trade agreements with foreign governments. It could not settle quarrels between states. The country could not protect its ships which were being robbed at by pirates. The states themselves were in a near disastrous condition economically. The widespread use of paper money was causing inflation. So much so that in some places a pound of tea could cost $100. Farmers were being thrown in jail because they could not pay their debts. Many farms were being sold off for the unpaid taxes that were owed. \n\nThere was an attempt at reforming the Articles. The Articles Congress received a report on August 7, 1786 from a twelve-member \"Grand Committee\". They were appointed to develop needed amendments. Seven amendments to the Articles of Confederation were proposed. Under these reforms, Congress would gain \"sole and exclusive\" power to regulate trade. States could not favor foreigners over citizens. Tax bills would require a 70% vote, public debt 85%, not the 100% currently required. Congress could charge states a late payment penalty fee. A state withholding troops would be charged for them, plus a penalty. If a state did not pay, Congress could collect directly from its cities and counties. There would have been a national court of seven judges. No-shows at Congress would have been banned from any U.S. or state office. These proposals were, however, sent back to committee without a vote and were not taken up again.\n\nCongress had given the delegates the task of amending the Articles of Confederation. But almost immediately they began discussing a completely new form of government. The debates lasted through the summer of 1787 and at times became so heated it threatened to end the convention prematurely. \n\nAppointed to the convention were 74 delegates—only 55 of which actually attended the sessions. The state of Rhode Island refused to send any delegates. They believed the convention was actually a conspiracy to overthrow the Confederation government. Patrick Henry of Virginia was another who refused to attend declaring he \"smelt a rat.\" In particular he suspected James Madison, also of Virginia, of wanting to create a new form of government. Henry was a firm believer that the states offered the best protections for personal rights and wanted nothing to do with upsetting that arrangement. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were away on diplomatic missions. John Jay was in New York at the diplomatic office. For various reasons many of the country's major political leaders were not at the convention. But the list of those who did attend was impressive. It included Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson, Alexander Hamilton, George Mason, John Dickinson, Gouverneur Morris and George Washington. Many others also became famous as framers of the Constitution. \n\nThe sessions were held in secret. Reporters and spectators were not allowed. To those who already had suspicions, the secrecy of the proceedings only confirmed what they feared. There were even armed guards at the doors. Many of those present had already risked being hanged by the British as traitors during the revolution. Now they worried about what their states would think of abandoning the Articles of Confederation.\n\nJames Madison spent the winter of 1787 making a study of various confederations throughout history. He came to Philadelphia armed with a wealth of knowledge and an idea for what the United States government should be. His plan was presented to the Convention by Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia. It became the broad outline of what would be a new government under the U.S. Constitution. His plan called for three branches of government with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from abusing their power. Madison's idea for a legislature had two houses. One would feature members elected by the people for a three year term. The other would have its members elected by the state legislatures and would serve for 7 years. Both would have the seats determined by the population of the country.\n\nAfter debating the Virginia plan for two weeks, William Patterson presented his plan called variously, the New Jersey Plan, the Patterson Plan and the Small State Plan. It was very similar to the Articles of Confederation and featured a unicameral (one house) legislature. All states would have one vote. He had one idea that was kept; that state laws that ran counter to federal laws would be voided.\n\nA third plan was offered by Alexander Hamilton. It was a copy of the British Constitution. It also was bicameral with an upper house and a legislature in which members served on their good behavior.\nFinally they worked out a compromise between all three plans. The new government would have an upper house, having an equal number of delegates from each state, and a lower house with representation based on population. The executive branch would have most of the responsibilities of foreign affairs while other important powers, like ratifying treaties, would be the responsibility of the legislative branch. After the new Constitution was ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789.\n\n", "id": "535878", "title": "History of the United States Constitution"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=535884", "text": "Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nThe Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Amendment XXVI) lowered the minimum voting age in the United States from 21 to 18. \n\nThe United States Congress approved the amendment on March 23, 1971, and sent it to the states to be ratified. Within three months and eight days, the states had ratified the amendment, and it became part of the Constitution. This was the quickest amendment to be ratified in United States history.\n\nLowering the minimum voting age was not a new idea. In the United States, some people started trying to get the voting age lowered during World War II. During the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to 18. This meant that men as young as 18 could be forced to join the military. To many people, it did not seem fair that the government thought these young men were old enough to fight a world war, but not old enough to vote in the country they were fighting for. \"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" became a common slogan.\n\nUnited States Senator Harley Kilgore had begun supporting a lowered voting age in 1941. Many other Senators, Representatives, and the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, supported the idea. However, Congress never made any changes. \n\nKilgore's ideas did interest some of the states. In 1943, the Georgia state legislature passed a law lowering the voting age in the state to 18; in 1955, Kentucky did the same thing.\n\nIn his State of the Union address in 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower became the first president to say publicly that he supported letting people ages 18 and older vote.\n\nIn 1963, the President's Commission on Registration and Voting Participation made a report to President Lyndon B. Johnson. The report encouraged Johnson to lower the voting age.\n\nDuring the 1960s, many Americans pushed both Congress and the state legislatures to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was mostly because of to the Vietnam War. As the war went on, more and more people started to protest the war and become active. During that war, many young men were drafted and sent to fight in the war before they were old enough to vote. This meant they had no way to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. Protesters started to use the slogan \"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" again.\n\nSupporters also argued that the law treated eighteen-year-olds as adults in many other ways. For example, they had to pay income taxes. Supporters argued that this was \"taxation without representation\" meaning that 18- to 20-year-olds had to pay taxes, but had no say in what those taxes were or what they were spent on, because they could not vote.\n\nIn 1967, United States Representative William St. Onge pointed out: \"\"To tax our 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds without giving them the right to vote ignores the great rallying cry of our War of Independence that there [should] be 'no taxation without representation.'\"\n\nSimilarly, in 1970, in a committee that was debating a possible Constitutional amendment to lower the voting age, Representative Thomas Railsback said: \"\"Our laws tax these 18-year-olds but our voting laws do not permit them representation in enacting that tax law. The Boston Tea Party was supposed to have been the spark that put that issue to rest in this country.\"\n\nNot everybody supported lowering the minimum voting age. Opponents to giving younger people the vote had several arguments. Many argued that teenagers were not mature or responsible enough to vote.\n\nOther people argued that teenagers did not know enough to have the right to vote. One historian writes:\nOthers criticized the \"old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" argument. For example, in 1953, the popular magazine \"Collier's Weekly\" said this argument \"doesn't justify giving young ladies of eighteen the right to franchise [vote].\" They added: \"If a man if old enough to vote when he's old enough to fight, then logically the man who is too old to fight out to lose the right to vote.\"\n\nAnother example comes from an editorial written by the \"New York Times\" in 1967. The paper wrote: \"The requirements for a good soldier and for a good voter are not the same. For the soldier, youthful enthusiasm and physical endurance are [of most] importance; for the voter, maturity of judgment far outweighs other qualifications.\"\n\nFinally, some people thought lowering the voting age was not that important for the country, and that it should be left up to each individual state.\n\nIn 1970, United States Senators Ted Kennedy and Mike Mansfield suggested changing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to lower the voting age in the United States.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment says that the government has to give every person \"the equal protection of its laws.\" People who supported the addition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, like Ted Kennedy, said that by not allowing 18- to 20-year-olds to vote, the government not treating them equally by not letting them vote.\n\nPresident Nixon disagreed with Kennedy. He was not against lowering the voting age. However, he did not agree with Kennedy's legal argument. He also worried that if the Supreme Court thought the new Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional, they could overturn it  cancel the entire law. Nixon thought this could cause a lot of damage to the country.\n\nHowever, on June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension (an addition) to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The change required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections. After signing the change, Nixon said: \n\nAfter Nixon signed this change, about 17 states refused to change their minimum voting ages to 18.\n\nAfter Nixon signed the change to the Voting Rights Act, Oregon and Texas challenged the law in court. The case, \"Oregon v. Mitchell,\" made it to the Supreme Court in October 1970. This was just four months after Nixon signed the change. By this time, four states had lowered their minimum voting ages: Georgia, Kentucky, Alaska, and Hawaii.\n\nIn \"Oregon v. Mitchell\", the Supreme Court looked at whether the voting age changes that Congress added to the Voting Rights Act were constitutional. This means they looked at whether the changes agreed with the rules in the Constitution, or broke them. The judges on the Supreme Court strongly disagreed with each other in this case. Eventually, five out of the nine judges agreed on a decision - just enough to reach the majority needed for a decision. However, most of the judges did not agree on which legal reason was behind their decision.\n\nThe Court ruled that Congress could set a voting age for federal elections, but not state or local elections. This meant that for state and local elections, states could keep the voting age at 21 if they wanted to. However, they would have to keep two different voting registers (lists of people who had signed up to vote): one for federal elections, which would include people as young as 18, and another for state and local elections, which would only include people over age 20.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's decision, both Congress and the states wanted to find a way to lower the minimum voting age throughout the country. Congress decided to propose a Constitutional amendment that would set the minimum voting age at 18 everywhere in the country. This would be different than the change to the Voting Rights Act in a few ways.\n\nFirst of all, the states did not want to deal with the cost and difficulty of having to keep two different voting registers, so they supported the idea of a Constitutional amendment. Also, when they changed the Voting Rights Act, Congress had made a law about state and local elections without the states having any say. However, for an amendment to be added to the Constitution, two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and then three-fourths of the state legislatures, have to agree on it. (These rules are set out in Article Five of the Constitution.) An amendment would be something that both Congress \"and\" the states agreed on. Congress would not be over-using its power and breaking the Constitution by making laws for the states.\n\nOpinion polls said that most Americans wanted the Twenty-sixth Amendment to pass. Younger people were most likely to support the Amendment. However, even in people over age 50, over half of Americans supported the Amendment. Even the \"New York Times\" changed its official opinion and supported the Amendment.\n\nOn March 10, 1971, the United States Senate voted 94–0 in support of proposing an amendment that would lower the minimum voting age to 18 everywhere in the country. On March 23, the United States House of Representatives voted 401–19 for the amendment. Congress sent the amendment to the states.\n\nFor the Twenty-sixth Amendment to be added to the Constitution, three-fourths of the state legislatures (38 out of the 50) would have to ratify the Amendment. It took just three months for 38 states to ratify the Amendment. After the Amendment was added to the Constitution, another five states ratified it. Seven states never did.\n\nThe states ratified the Amendment in this order:\n\nOn July 5, 1971, President Richard Nixon held a ceremony at the White House, where he signed the Twenty-sixth Amendment just to show his support. (The President does not have to sign an amendment in order for it to be added to the Constitution.) During the signing ceremony, he talked about his confidence in the United States' young people:\n", "id": "535884", "title": "Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}

Members of the United States Senate serve six-year terms, and members of the United States House of Representatives serve two years each. The Twenty-seventh Amendment says that no law can change Congresspeople's salaries until a new two-year term for Representatives starts.\n\nAs of 2016, the Twenty-seventh amendment is the last amendment that has been added to the Constitution. It took longer for the states to ratify this amendment than any other in history. The 1st United States Congress sent the suggested amendment to the states for their approval on September 25, 1789. It was not until May 7, 1992, that enough states ratified the amendment for it to be added to the Constitution. The ratification process had taken 202 years, 7 months, and 12 days the longest in United States history.\n\nWhen Congress first proposed the amendment in 1789, this is the text they suggested:\n\nOn September 25, 1789, the first United States Congress gave a group of 12 amendments to the states for their approval. Written by James Madison, these were the first 12 Constitutional amendments ever written. One of them was an amendment about salaries for Members of Congress. Madison wanted to protect against Congresspeople being able to give themselves raises whenever they wanted to, while they were in the middle of their terms and the people could not vote them out.\n\nIn 1791, the states ratified ten of the 12 suggested amendments. These ten amendments became the Bill of Rights. However, the state did not ratify the other two amendments out of the 12 including the one on limiting pay for Congresspeople.\n\nJames Madison first proposed this amendment in the United States House of Representatives on June 8, 1789. On August 24, 1789, the House passed the suggested amendment and sixteen others. The proposals went next to the United States Senate, which made 26 different changes to the House's suggested amendments. After taking out some parts of the House amendments, and combining others, the Senate approved a package of twelve suggested amendments on September 9, 1789.\n\nNow a committee of House and Senate members had to meet to figure out a compromise and come up with amendments that they could all agree on. After three days, they had come up with 12 suggested amendments, which they brought back to the full House and Senate. That same day September 24, 1789 the House agreed on the 12 proposed amendments. The next day, the Senate agreed too. The 12 amendments included the one on Congressional pay.\n\nCongress sent the package of 12 amendments to the states on September 25, 1789. For these amendments to be added to the Constitution, three-fourths of the state legislatures would have to ratify (approve) the amendments. At the time, there were only 11 states (North Carolina and Rhode Island had not ratified the Constitution yet). This meant just nine states would have to approve the amendments to add them to the Constitution.\n\nOn December 15, 1791, the states ratified ten of the twelve suggested amendments. These got added to the Constitution together as the Bill of Rights.

It was approved by the 11th Congress on May 1, 1810, and submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. It would strip United States citizenship from any citizen who accepted a title of nobility from a foreign country. On two occasions between 1812 and 1816 it only needed ratifying by two states to become a valid part of the Constitution. Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, so the amendment is still pending before the states. Now, since the number of states has increased, ratification by an additional 26 states would be needed for this amendment to be adopted.\n\nThis proposed amendment would amplify both , which prohibits the federal government from issuing titles of nobility or honor, and , which prohibits the states from issuing them.\n\nThere is speculation that the Congress proposed the amendment in response to the 1803 marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte's younger brother, Jerome, and Betsy Patterson of Baltimore, Maryland. She gave birth to a son for whom she wanted aristocratic recognition from France. The child, named Jérôme Napoleon Bonaparte, was not born in the United States, but in Great Britain on July 7, 1805. Nevertheless, he would have held U.S. citizenship through his mother. In turn, his son, Charles Joseph Bonaparte, was born in 1851 and died 1921. He graduated from Harvard Law School, and became Secretary of the Navy and then, in the Theodore Roosevelt Administration, Attorney-General – and created the FBI. Another theory is that his mother actually desired a title of nobility for herself. She is referred to as the \"Duchess of Baltimore\" in many texts written about the amendment. The marriage had been annulled in 1805. This was well before the amendment's proposal by the 11th Congress.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536019", "text": "Republicanism in the United States\n\nRepublicanism in the United States is a set of ideas that guides the government and politics. These ideas have shaped the government, and the way people in the United States think about politics, since the American Revolution.\n\nThe American Revolution, the Declaration of Independence (1776), the Constitution (1787), and even the Gettysburg Address (1863) were based on ideas from American republicanism.\n\n\"Republicanism\" comes from the word \"republic.\" However, they are not the same thing. A republic is a type of government (one where the people can choose their leaders). Republicanism is an ideology set of beliefs that people in a republic have about what is most important to them.\n\nRepublicanism in the United States grew out of some very old ideas. It includes ideas from ancient Greece, ancient Rome, the Renaissance, and England.\n\nSome of the most important ideas of republicanism are that:\n\nRepublicanism is different than other forms of democracy. In a \"pure\" democracy, the majority rules. If a majority of the people voted to take rights away from a certain group, that is what would happen. Alexis de Tocqueville, a famous French political thinker, called this the \"tyranny of the majority.\" He meant that a pure democracy could still turn into an unfair, unequal, corrupt society if the majority of the people decided to take away others' rights.\n\nHowever, republicanism says that people have \"unalienable\" rights that cannot be voted away. Republican governments are different than \"pure\" democracies, because they include protections to make sure people's rights are not taken away. In a true republican government, one group - even if it is a majority - cannot take another group's unalienable rights away.\n\nAmerican republicanism was created and first practiced by the Founding Fathers in the 18th century. For them, \"republicanism represented more than a particular form of government. It was a way of life, a core ideology, an uncompromising commitment to liberty, and a total rejection of aristocracy.\" Republicanism shaped what the Founders thought and did during the American Revolution, and after.\n\nThe leaders of colonial America in the 1760s and 1770s read history carefully. Their goal was to compare governments and how well different types of governments worked. They were especially interested in the history of liberty in England. They modeled American republicanism partly after the English \"Country Party.\" This was a political party which opposed the Court Party, which held power in England.\n\nThe Country Party was based on ancient Greek and Roman republicanism. The Party criticized the corruption in the \"Court\" Party, which focused mostly on the King's court in London. It did not focus on the needs of regular people in England, or on areas outside of the capital city.\n\nBy reading history, The Founders came up with a set of political ideas that they called \"republicanism.\" By 1775, these ideas were common in colonial America. One historian writes: \"Republicanism was the distinctive political [way of thinking] of the entire Revolutionary generation.\" \n\nAnother historian explains that believers of American republicanism saw government as a threat. He writes that colonists felt constantly \"threatened by corruption.\" Government, to them, was \"the [biggest] source of corruption and operat[ed] through such means as patronage, faction, standing armies ( [instead of] the ideal of the militia); [and] established churches\" which people would have to belong to.\n\nBy the 1770s, most Americans were dedicated to republican values and to their property rights. This helped cause the American Revolution. More and more, Americans saw Britain as corrupt; hostile; and a threat to republicanism, freedom, and property rights. Many people thought that the greatest threat to liberty was corruption not just in London, but at home too. They thought corruption went along with inherited aristocracy, which they hated.\n\nDuring the Revolution, many Christians connected republicanism with their religion. When the Revolution started, there was a major change in thinking that \"convinced Americans ... that God was raising up America for some special purpose,\" according to one historian. This made the Revolutionists believe that they had a moral and religious duty to get rid of the corruption in the monarchy.\n\nAnother historian, Gordon Wood, writes that republicanism led to American Exceptionalism: \"Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy.\" \n\nIn his \"Discourse of 1759,\" Revolutionist Jonathan Mayhew argued that people should only obey their governments if they \"actually perform the duty of rulers by exercising a reasonable and [fair] authority for the good of human society.\" Many American colonists were convinced that British rulers were not using their power \"for the good of human society.\" This made them want to form a new government which would be based on republicanism. They thought a republican government would protect not threaten freedom and democracy.\n\nThe \"Founding Fathers\" were strong supporters of republican values, especially Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton.\n\nFor example, Thomas Jefferson once wrote that a government that had the most possible participation by \"its citizens in mass\" (all the people together) was the safest kind. He said a republic is:\nIn Simple English, Jefferson was saying: 'A republic is a government where all its citizens act together, based on rules that most of them have agreed on. The government's powers should be divided, and each power should be carried out by representatives that the people choose. They should serve terms (times in office) that are short enough to make sure they are doing what the people want. All the people, together, are the best protectors of their own rights.'\n\nThe Founding Fathers often talked about what \"republicanism\" meant. In 1787, John Adams defined it as \"a government, in which all men, rich and poor, magistrates and subjects, officers and people, masters and servants, the first citizen and the last, are equally subject to the laws.\"\n\nSome other ideas also affected the Founding Fathers. For example, in the 1600s, John Locke, an English philosopher, had created the idea of the \"social contract.\" This idea said that people agree to obey governments, and in in return, those governments agree to protect the people and their rights. This is like a contract made between the people and the government. If the government breaks this contract, and does not protect the people's rights, then the people have the right to overthrow their leaders. This idea was important to the Revolutionists.\n\nWhen they were writing state and national constitutions, the Americans used ideas from Montesquieu, an 18th-century French political thinker. Montesquieu wrote about how the perfect British constitution would be \"balanced.\" The idea of a balance of power (also called \"checks and balances\") is a very important part of the Constitution. It is one of the strategies the Founders used to make sure their government would be republican and protect the people from government corruption.\n\nThe Founding Fathers wanted republicanism because its ideas guaranteed liberty, with limited powers checking and balancing each other. However, they also wanted change to happen slowly. They worried that in a democracy, the majority of voters could vote away rights and freedoms. They were most worried about poor Americans (who made up most of the United States) turning against the rich. They worried that democracy could turn into \"mob rule.\" \n\nTo guard against this, the Founders wrote many protections into the Constitution. For example:\n\n\nMost adult white males were able to vote. In 1776, most states required people to own property to be able to vote. However, at that time, America was 90% rural, and most people owned farms. As cities grew bigger and people started doing work in the cities, most states dropped the property requirement. By 1850, this requirement was gone in every state.\n\nUnder the new government after the Revolution, \"republican motherhood\" became an ideal. Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren were held up as the perfect \"republican mothers.\" This idea said that a republican mother's first duty was to teach her children republican values. Her second job was to live simply and avoid luxury, which the Founders linked with corruption.\n\nMany of the Founders did not think \"democracy\" was a good idea. Their idea of \"democracy\" was the \"pure democracy\" that de Tocqueville had described. They worried often about the problem of 'tyranny of the majority' that de Tocqueville had warned about. They wrote many protections into the Constitution to prevent this from happening. As historians Richard Ellis and Michael Nelson write: \"The principles of republican government embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to [make sure] that the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness would not be [destroyed] by majorities.\" Thomas Jefferson warned that \"an elect[ed] despotism is not the government we fought for.\" \n\nJames Madison, in particular, worried about this, and wrote about it in \"The Federalist Papers\". The \"Federalist Papers\" talk about democracy as being dangerous, because it allows a majority to take away the rights of a smaller group. However, Madison thought that as more people came to the United States, the country would get more diverse, and it would be harder to form a majority big enough to do this. In Federalist No. 10, Madison also argued that a strong federal government would help protect republicanism. The United States' first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, gave most power to the states and had a very weak federal government that could not get anything done. In Federalist No. 10, Madison argued that a small but powerful group might be able to take control of a small area, like a state. However, it would be much harder to take over an entire country. The bigger the country, he argued, the safer republicanism would be.\n\nAs late as 1800, the word \"democrat\" still had a very bad meaning to most Americans. It was mostly used to attack an opponent of the Federalist party. In 1798, George Washington complained that a \"Democrat ... will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the Government of this Country.\" This changed over the next few decades.\n\nUnited States Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story (1779–1845) made the protection of property rights by the courts a major part of American republicanism. James Madison appointed Story to the Court in 1811. Story and Chief Justice John Marshall made the Court a protector of the rights of property against runaway democracy. Story believed that \"the right of the citizens to the free enjoyment of their property\" (if they got it legally) was \"a great and fundamental principle of a republican government.\" Historians agree that Story—as much or more than Marshall or anyone else—reshaped American law in a conservative direction that protected property rights.\n\nRepublicanism saw military service as one of a citizen's most important duties. John Randolph, a Congressman from Virginia, once said: \"When citizen and soldier shall be synonymous terms, then you will be safe.\" \n\nHowever, at this time, the word \"army\" meant \"foreign mercenaries.\" After the Revolutionary War, Americans did not trust mercenaries. Instead, they came up with the idea of a national army, made of citizens. They changed their definition of military service from a choice of careers to a civic duty something every good republican should do. Before the Civil War, people saw military service as an important show of patriotism, and a necessary part of citizenship. To soldiers, military service was something they chose to do, something they had a say in, and it showed that they were good citizens.\n\nThe term \"republic\" is not used in the Declaration of Independence. However, it does appear in Article Four of the Constitution, which \"guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government.\"\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has created a basic definition of what a \"republic\" is. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), the court ruled that the \"equal rights of citizens\" were inherent to the idea of a republic. Later, the Court's decision from \"In re Duncan\" (1891) ruled that the \"right of the people to choose their government\" is also part of the definition of a republic.\n\nOver time, most Americans changed their opinion about the word \"democracy.\" By the 1830s, most Americans saw democracy as a great thing, and members of the new Democratic Party proudly called themselves \"Democrats.\"\n\nAfter 1800, the limitations on democracy (like rules that limited who could vote) were removed one by one:\n", "id": "536019", "title": "Republicanism in the United States"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536054", "text": "Child Labor Amendment\n\nThe Child Labor Amendment is a proposed and still-pending amendment to the United States Constitution that would specifically authorize Congress to regulate \"labor of persons under eighteen years of age\". The amendment was proposed in 1924 following Supreme Court rulings in 1918 and 1922 that federal laws regulating and taxing goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 and 16 were unconstitutional.\n\nThe majority of the state governments ratified the amendment by the mid-1930s. However, it has not been ratified by the required three-fourths of the states according to Article V of the Constitution. None of the states have ratified it since 1937. There was not much interest in the amendment after the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which implemented federal regulation of child labor with the Supreme Court's approval in 1941.\n\nBecause Congress did not set a time limit for its ratification, the amendment is still technically pending before the states. Currently, ratification by an additional ten states would be necessary for this amendment to become law.\n\nWith the Keating–Owen Act of 1916, Congress had attempted to control interstate commerce involving goods produced by employees under the ages of 14 or 16, depending on the type of work. The Supreme Court found this law unconstitutional in \"Hammer v. Dagenhart\" (1918). Later that year, Congress attempted to levy a tax on businesses with employees under the ages of 14 or 16 (again depending on the type of work), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in \"Bailey v. Drexel Furniture\". It became apparent that a constitutional amendment would be necessary for such legislation to overcome the Court's objections.\n\nThe amendment was offered by Ohio Republican Congressman Israel Moore Foster on April 26, 1924, during the 68th Congress, in the form of House Joint Resolution No. 184. The text of the proposed amendment reads:\n\nHaving been approved by Congress, the proposed amendment was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. It was ratified by the following states:\n\nThe following fifteen state legislatures rejected the Child Labor Amendment and did not ratify it: Connecticut (1925), Delaware (1925), Florida (1925), Georgia (1924), Louisiana (1924), Maryland (1927), Massachusetts (1925), Missouri (1925), North Carolina (1924), South Carolina (1925), South Dakota (1925, 1933 and 1937), Tennessee (1925), Texas (1925), Vermont (1925), and Virginia (1926). Although the act, on the part of state legislatures, of \"rejecting\" a proposed constitutional amendment has no legal recognition, such action does have political implications.\n\nOf the 48 states in the Union in 1924, five have taken no action of record on the amendment: Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York and Rhode Island. Neither have Alaska or Hawaii, which became states in 1959. Because there are now 50 states in the Union, it cannot become law unless it is ratified by 38 states (an additional 10), although when it was submitted to the states 36 ratifications were enough.\n\nIf ever ratified by the required number of U.S. state legislatures, the Child Labor Amendment would give the Congress of the United States jurisdiction concurrent with that of the states to legislate on the subject of child labor. In this case, child labor laws would no longer only fall under the jurisdiction of the states under the 10th Amendment. The states would have to yield to federal law where the two conflict—which is normal procedure anyway. After several state legislatures initially objected to the proposal during the 1920s, a number of them re-examined their position during the 1930s and decided to ratify. Those delayed actions resulted in much controversy. They also resulted in the 1939 decision of the United States Supreme Court in the landmark case of \"Coleman v. Miller\". In this case it was determined that the Child Labor Amendment remains pending business before the state legislatures because the 68th Congress did not specify a deadline within which the state legislatures must act upon the Child Labor Amendment. The \"Coleman v. Miller\" ruling formed the basis of the unusual and belated ratification of the 27th Amendment which was proposed by Congress in 1789 and ratified more than two centuries later in 1992 by the legislatures of at least three-fourths of the 50 states.\n\nThe common legal opinion of federal child labor regulation reversed in the 1930s. Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 regulating the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of that law in \"United States v.

It was proposed by Congress on August 22, 1978. It was ratified by only 16 states by the time of its expiration on August 22, 1985.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536097", "text": "Federalism in the United States\n\nFederalism in the United States is the relationship between the state governments and the federal government. This relationship is set out in the United States Constitution. The Constitution says which powers the federal government has, and which powers belong to the states. The goal of federalism is to create a balance of power, so neither the states or the federal government can get too powerful.\n\nWhen America was a colony of the British Empire, it was ruled by the government of King George III. Many American colonists thought this government was corrupt and did not care about the colonists' rights.\n\nThe Founding Fathers of the United States started to believe in an idea they called republicanism. This idea said that the people in a country should be able to choose their government. It said that the government's job was to protect people's natural rights, and if the government did not do this, the people had the right to overthrow it. By 1775, these ideas were common in colonial America.\n\nIn the 1760s and 1770s, the British government began passing laws that forced the colonists to pay taxes on items like printed materials and things that were made outside the colonies. To many Americans, these were examples of corruption and unfairness in the government. The government was making them pay taxes, but the colonists had no say in what tax laws were passed, or even what their money was spent on.\n\nIn 1775, the American Revolutionary War began. The next year, the colonies passed the United States Declaration of Independence, making them the new country of the United States. By 1783, thanks to help from France, Spain, and some Native American tribes, the United States won the war and its independence from the British Empire.\n\nHowever, British rule had made most Americans distrust federal governments. Many Americans did not like the thought that people far away from them could make rules about their lives, like the British government had. They saw government as the biggest threat to their freedom. Because of this, the United States' first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, gave most of the power to the states. The Articles created a federal government, but gave it very little power. For example, the Articles allowed the Continental Congress to sign treaties and declare war, but it could not raise taxes to pay for an army. Also, all major decisions required all of the state governments to agree. This made it very difficult for the federal government to get anything done.\n\nThe Founding Fathers and regular Americans began to see that the Confederation government was not working well. Some of the Founding Fathers began to suggest federalism as a solution to the problems with the Articles of Confederation.\n\nMany more Americans began to support federalism after Shays' Rebellion of 1786-1787. Shays' Rebellion started out as a protest by poor farmers in western Massachusetts, and ended up as an armed rebellion. Neither the federal government or the state government had enough soldiers or money to pay for an army that could stop the rebellion. Merchants in Massachusetts had to pay for a private army to stop the rebellion. Also, during the Rebellion, Massachusetts' state government took away people's right to habeas corpus (so they could keep people in jail without a trial) and their right to say bad things about the government. Many Americans began to realize that under the Articles of Confederation, their government was unable to protect them or their rights. This was not the republican government they had fought for.\n\nIn 1787, fifty-five delegates met at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. There, they created ideas about a new type of government, called federalism. In this type of government, they decided:\n\nThe delegates at the Constitutional Convention wrote a new Constitution. The last part of the Constitution, Article 7, said that nine states would have to ratify (approve) the Constitution for it to go into effect. The Federalist movement started working to get the Constitution ratified.\n\nSome of the Founding Fathers argued strongly for federalism, especially James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay. They created the strongest defense of the new Constitution in a book called \"The Federalist\" Papers. This was a collection of 85 essays supporting federalism. Its goal was to convince people to vote to ratify the Constitution. Although they were published anonymously at the time (with nobody's real names listed), the essays were written by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay. The essays explained the new Constitution and all the protections in it. It answered many of the arguments against federalism, and explained how the Constitution would help protect people's rights. For example, in \"Federalist No. 10,\" James Madison wrote that federalism would help protect the republican values most Americans supported, like the importance of personal freedoms.\n\nPeople who did not support the new Constitution were called \"Anti-Federalists\". The Anti-Federalists included Founding Fathers like Patrick Henry and George Mason. They worried that under the new Constitution, the federal government was too strong, and had too much power over the states. They wanted the states to have more power. They also did not like the fact that the Constitution had no bill of rights. Without a bill of rights, they worried that the federal government would take their rights away.\n\nAfter the Federalists promised to add a bill of rights to the Constitution after it was ratified, and after George Washington said he supported the new Constitution, the states ratified the Constitution.\n\nThe new Constitution took effect on March 4, 1789. That same year, Congress wrote and proposed twelve amendments to the Constitution. Three-fourths of the states would have to ratify these amendments in order to add them to the Constitution. The states ratified ten amendments on December 15, 1791. Together, they became the Bill of Rights. The Tenth Amendment set the guidelines for federalism in the United States. It said that any powers that the Constitution did not give to the federal government belonged to the states. This was meant to calm people's worries that the federal government would try to take more and more power from the states.\n", "id": "536097", "title": "Federalism in the United States"}

It concerned the constitutionality of military commanders, under an executive order by the President, which ordered Japanese Americans into internment camps during World War II. This was regardless of their citizenship. In February of 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 9066. This gave military commanders the power to evacuate all persons considered a threat to national security from the West Coast of the United States to relocation centers. Fred Korematsu, a Japanese-American who was born in the United States, refused to comply with the order. He became a fugitive, but was arrested and sentenced to five years probation. He appealed his conviction with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. After having his conviction upheld, the case was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a 6-3 decision, the Court upheld his conviction and ruled the exclusion order was constitutional.\n\nThe question before the Court was did the President and Congress exceed their powers. Did they violate the rights of Japanese and American citizens of Japanese descent?\n\nIn the majority opinion by Justice Hugo Black, the Court ruled 6-9 that the need to protect the country from \nespionage outweighed the rights of Mr. Korematsu. The issue of discrimination against a person due to prejudice against his ancestry is not a factor. Neither is there any question of his loyalty to the United States. The sole issue is his refusal to comply with a legal order during a time of war.\n\nOn May 19, 1942, during World War II, Japanese Americans were ordered to be move into relocation camps by Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1, 8 Fed. Reg. 982. This order, and other similar orders, were based upon Executive Order 9066 (February 19, 1942). Fred Korematsu was a Japanese-American man who decided to stay in San Leandro, California and knowingly violated Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the U.S. Army. Korematsu argued that the Executive Order 9066 was unconstitutional and that it violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He was arrested, tried and convicted. No question was raised as to Korematsu's loyalty to the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and the Supreme Court granted \"certiorari.\"\n\nThe decision in \"Korematsu v. United States\" has been very controversial.

Director, Missouri Department of Health, , was a United States Supreme Court case. It had to do with the right to die. Nancy Cruzan was a woman who was in a persistent vegetative state. Her family wanted to stop life support treatments so she could die. Hospital workers refused to do this without a court order. Eventually, the case made it to the Supreme Court. On June 25, 1990, the Court decided it was legal to require \"clear and convincing evidence\" that stopping life support is what a person would have wanted.\n\nOn January 11, 1983, Nancy Cruzan's car ran off the road. She landed 35 feet away, face-down in a ditch filled with water. When paramedics arrived, her heart had stopped and she was not breathing. The paramedics resuscitated her, but her brain was damaged by not having enough oxygen. The brain damage caused a persistent vegetative state. \n\nDoctors put a feeding tube into her stomach so food and water could be given through the tube. Without the feeding tube, Cruzan would die from starvation or dehydration, because she could not swallow anything.\n\nIn 1988, Cruzan's parents asked her doctors to stop feeding her through the feeding tube. They believed Nancy would not have wanted to live in a persistent vegetative state. She had recently told a friend that if she got badly injured or sick, she would not want to live unless she could live \"at least halfway normally.\" Nancy's parents wanted her to be able to die. However, the hospital refused to take out the feeding tube without a court order.\n\nThe Cruzans asked a trial court to order the hospital to remove Nancy's feeding tube. The trial court agreed. \n\nThe court said that a person has a \"fundamental natural right\" in the Constitution to have someone make the decision to remove life support \"when the person has no more cognitive brain function ... and there is no hope of further recovery.\" The court said Nancy's conversation with her friend showed that she would not want to live in a persistent vegetative state.\n\nThe state of Missouri appealed this decision. The case went to the Supreme Court of Missouri, which reversed the trial court's decision. The Supreme Court of Missouri ruled that no one can refuse treatment for another person, unless:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of the Missouri Supreme Court's decision. This was the first \"right to die\" case that the United States Supreme Court had ever heard. \n\nThe Cruzan case divided the Supreme Court. Five of the Supreme Court Justices (judges) wrote their own opinions about the case. Four disagreed with the decision the Court made. However, the Court ruled, in a 5-4 vote, that the Supreme Court of Missouri made the right decision. They ruled that Missouri did not violate the Constitution when it required 'clear and convincing evidence' that Nancy would have wanted her life support to be ended.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court did rule that competent people (people who are able to make decisions for themselves) have the right to refuse medical treatment. They said the Constitution gives competent people this right in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \n\nHowever, it said things are different for people who are incompetent (people who cannot not make decisions for themselves for example, because they are in a persistent vegetative state). If another person wants to refuse treatment for someone who is incompetent, they have to show \"clear and convincing proof\" that refusing treatment is what the person would want.\n\n After the Supreme Court's decision, the Cruzans went back to the first trial court with new evidence. The court ruled that the Cruzans now had clear and convincing evidence that Nancy would have wanted her life support ended if she was in a persistent vegetative state. On December 14, 1990, Nancy's feeding tube was taken out. \n\nProtesters filed seven different petitions with the court to try to get Nancy's feeding tube put back in, but the court refused. Then, on December 18, nineteen people went into Nancy's hospital room and tried to reattach her feeding tube themselves; they were arrested. \n\nNancy Cruzan died on December 26, 1990. She had been in a persistent vegetative state for eight years.\n\nAt Nancy's funeral, her father told reporters: \"I would prefer to have my daughter back and let someone else be this trailblazer.\" Six years later, he killed himself.\n\nThe \"Cruzan\" case is one of the most important \"right to die\" cases in United States history. It set precedents that courts would follow in many cases in the future.\n\nThe case also made many Americans interested in writing living wills and other advance directives (documents that tell doctors and family members what they want in certain medical situations, if they cannot make decisions for themselves).\n\n", "id": "536168", "title": "Cruzan v.

He is the vocalist for Behemoth and plays the guitar, bass, synthesizer and drums.\n\nDarski was born Adam Michał Darski in Gdynia, Poland. He was raised Catholic and began to play the guitar at age eight. He likes to call himself Nergal (which comes from Babylonia mythology and is the god of plague and war). He founded the band Behemoth while he was just a teenager in 1991. Darski also is the main lyricist, composer and manager of the band. For a brief time, he called himself Holocausto, which was inspired by Beherit leader Nuclear Holocausto. He was a member of a band called Wolverine, which showed his skills at clean singing.\n\nHe was inspired by Norway's Black Circle, so he formed together with Blasphemous (from the band Veles) and Venom (from Xantotol) and called themselves the Temple of Infernal Fire. Later other bands joined and far-right politics were introduced, and the group renamed the Temple of Fullmoon. Darski didn't want to be involved with politics, so he distanced himself from the group. This led to some members of the group accusing him of betrayal. Some members even sent him death threats. He says that he is now in good terms with the members.\n\nDarski has completed six years of history at the University of Gdańsk.

Darski reportedly donated all of the money he earned for his placement to one of the world's best bone marrow donor centers.\n\nIn October 2012, he got into legal troubles again over the ripped up Bible incident in 2007. The Supreme Court said that Darski could be guilty of the crime of “offending religious feelings” even though he did not mean to. The case was returned to a lower court which found him guilty of “intentionally insulting the Holy Bible” but the case was dismissed because of to the statute of limitations.\n\nDarski dated the famous Polish pop singer, Dorota Rabczewska, from mid-2009 to early 2011.

Two bombs exploded at Brussels Zaventem Airport and one exploded at Maalbeek metro station. According to the Belgian Health Ministry, there have been at least 31 confirmed deaths and over 250 reported injuries. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has publicly claimed responsibility for the attack. There are three suspects. Two were suicide bombers and Belgian police are currently searching for the third one.\n\nBelgium is part of the war on ISIL in Iraq. About 500 foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq are Belgian. The fighters mostly come from immigrant families.\n\nBelgium has been under attacks in the past. In May 2014, a gunman attacked the Jewish Museum of Belgium, killing four people. In January 2015, Security men stopped a group maybe planned a second \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting. The operation resulted in the deaths of two members of the group. In August 2015, a man shot and stabbed people on a train in Brussels, before being stopped by passengers.\n\nThe attackers that were part of the November 2015 Paris attacks were based in Molenbeek, and the city of Brussels was closed for five days to search for people. On 18 March 2016, Salah Abdeslam, who possibly was part of the Paris attacks, was caught, and at least one other suspect is still free.\n\nTwo explosions took place in the airport's departure hall.\n\nAt least 31 people were killed and more than 230 others were harmed. Three Americans, Mormon missionaries, were seriously injured, as well as a member of the U.S. military and his family. The U.S. Embassy in Brussels asked U.S. citizens not to use buses and subways.\n\nTwo men used bombs to kill themselves at Brussels Airport. The police is looking for a third man seen with them in CCTV photo from the airport. ISIL said it was behind the attack.\n\nHours after the attacks, police went into a home in Schaarbeek, a north of Brussels, where they found a nail bomb, chemicals, and an ISIL flag. One man was arrested, but then released.\nBelgian authorities said two brothers, Khalid and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, both Belgians with criminal records — were among the three suicide bombers who attacked the Brussels metro and airport.The brothers are believed to have links to last year’s Paris attacks, and to Salah Abdeslam. There third man who appeared on the cameras is still free after he ran away when his bomb didn't explode.\n\nAfter the attacks in Brussels, European leaders said terror will not scare them. In Belgium, officials declared three days of national mourning. Belgian Prime Minister said that Charles Michel sent a message to the people behind the attacks, saying, \"to those who have chosen to be barbarous enemies of freedom, democracy and fundamental values ... we remain united as one.\"\n\nIn its message claiming responsibility, ISIS noted in a twitter post that \"What will be coming is worse.\"\n\nPeople shared cartoons and showed sadness in black, yellow and red, the colors of the Belgian flag. Others put messages of solidarity with #JeSuisBruxelles, or \"I am Brussels,\" an ode to a similar outpouring with #JeSuisCharlie after the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015. Some people invited tourists stuck after the airport was shut into their homes using #OpenHouse.\n\nFrench cartoonist Jean Plantureux, who goes by Plantu, drew an emotional cartoon for French newspaper Le Monde.

New York had made physician-assisted suicide illegal. A group of doctors challenged this law. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1997, the Supreme Court decided that New York's law against physician-assisted suicide was constitutional and legal. They ruled that the Constitution of the United States does not guarantee the \"right to die.\"\n\nThe state of New York had made physician-assisted suicide illegal. This law made it a crime for a doctor to give a patient medications that would kill them. It also made it illegal for a doctor to do anything else that would end a patient's life. These things were crimes even if the patient was terminally ill, wanted to die, and was competent (able to make decisions).\n\nA group of doctors filed a lawsuit in federal court. They argued that this law was unconstitutional. They said the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause says that every state must give everyone \"the equal protection of the laws.\" The doctors argued that because of the law against physician-assisted suicide, terminally ill people did not have equal rights under the law. They pointed out that terminally ill patients could refuse treatment, which would lead to their death. However, these same patients did not have the right to give a doctor permission to end their lives. Basically, they were arguing that refusing treatment in order to cause death, and asking a doctor to help cause death, were the same thing.\n\nFirst, the case went to the United States District Court. This court ruled that New York's law was constitutional. It said that the state of New York had a good reason to care about keeping its citizens alive and protecting people who might need protection. \n\nNext, the case was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It reversed the District Court's opinion. The Court of Appeals said that the law did not treat all competent patients equally when they wanted to end their lives. For example, if a patient were attached to a life support machine, like a ventilator, they had the right to have a doctor disconnect it. This would cause their death. However, a person in the same situation, on a life support machine, could not ask a doctor to give them medications to cause their death instead. The Court agreed that asking doctors to remove life support devices (which was legal) was the same as physician-assisted euthanasia (which was not legal). They ruled that this was not equal treatment, and that New York's law against physician-assisted suicide was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nThe case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. On June 26, 1997, the Supreme Court voted 9-0 that New York's law was legal and constitutional. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, but five other Justices wrote separate concurring opinions.\n\nAs legal scholar Susan Stefan writes: \"Justice Rehnquist's short, curt opinion reversing \"Quill\" is almost angry.\" Rehnquist writes that assisted suicide is completely different from allowing a patient to refuse treatment. The difference is that with assisted suicide, the doctor means to cause the patient's death. When the doctor gives the patient medication that will kill them, they are \"causing\" the patient's death. When a doctor lets a patient refuse treatment, they are letting the patient's \"disease\" cause their death.\n\nThe Court also wrote that there is no \"fundamental\" right to die in the Constitution. Because of this, laws that make physician-assisted suicide illegal do not violate terminally ill people's Constitutional rights. The Court added that the law allowed everyone to refuse treatment, and banned everyone from assisting suicide. This was equal treatment, and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the decision said.\n\nFinally, the Court said that the state of New York had \"a legitimate interest\" (good, valid reasons) in banning physician-assisted suicide. They said the ban would help the state prevent euthanasia, protect doctors' medical ethics, and protect terminally ill people who might feel pressured to end their lives. Most importantly, they said, New York's ban helped protect human life. The right to life (however long it may last) is an \"unalienable right\" (a natural right) guaranteed by the Constitution. The right to death, the Court said, is not.\n\n", "id": "536236", "title": "Vacco v. Quill"}

Many countries have laws against cruel and unusual punishment. There are also international laws and treaties against this type of punishment.\n\nFor most of recorded history, the death penalty was often painful on purpose. Severe historical punishments included being burned or boiled to death; cut or torn apart; crushed by stones; sawed in half; crucified; and many other extremely painful methods of execution. Punishments that were not meant to cause death were also often painful on purpose.\n\nThe exact words \"cruel and unusual punishment\" were first used in the English Bill of Rights 1689. In 1791, the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution made \"cruel and unusual punishment\" illegal in the United States. Seven years later, the British Leeward Islands used the same words in their Slavery Amelioration Act. \n\nHere are some examples of other laws that include protections against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThe Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that \"cruel and unusual punishments [shall not be] inflicted.\" However, the Constitution does not define exactly what cruel and unusual punishments are.\n\nIn a case called \"Furman v. Georgia\" (), the Supreme Court of the United States decided what questions they would use to figure out whether a punishment was cruel and unusual. Justice William Brennan wrote the opinion in the case. He made four rules about punishments:\n\nIn this decision, the Supreme Court set a precedent that if a punishment broke any of these four rules, it would be viewed as \"cruel and unusual,\" and would be illegal under the Constitution.\n", "id": "536260", "title": "Cruel and unusual punishment"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536264", "text": "History of racial segregation in the United States\n\nRacial segregation means separating people because of their races. In the United States, racial segregation has existed since before the United States was its own country. Slavery, racist laws, racist attitudes, and many other things caused the United States to segregate white and non-white people for centuries. Although segregation is now against the law, racist attitudes still remain, and new forms of segregation have formed over time.\n\nThe first African slaves were brought to America in 1619. This was just nine years after British settlers created the first permanent settlement in America, at Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nPeople in all thirteen American colonies used slaves. Many of the Founding Fathers of the United States owned slaves, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, James Madison, Patrick Henry, and John Jay.\n\nAbolitionists started trying to make slavery illegal in the mid-1700s. By 1804, all of the northern states had ended slavery. However, none of the Southern states had. The Southern states believed that slavery was their right, and they did not want to give it up. Cotton had become a very important crop in the South. Owners of large cotton plantations were used to having slaves to do work for free, which made the plantation owners richer because they did not have to pay anybody to work.\n\nEventually, the South tried to leave the United States. This caused the American Civil War. The North won, and in 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution made slavery illegal everywhere in the country. In 1868 and 1870, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments gave African-Americans citizenship, and gave them the right to vote.\n\nLosing the Civil War did not change people's ideas about African-American people. During slavery, slave owners had not seen slaves as humans. They saw them as property, things to buy and sell, like animals you would use on a farm. After the War, many white people still did not see African-Americans as equal to whites.\n\nStarting in 1890, the all-white legislatures in the Southern states began to pass state laws that required segregation. These racist laws became known as Jim Crow laws. For example, blacks could not:\n\nIn 1896, in a case called \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", the Supreme Court ruled that these laws were legal. They said that segregation was fine, as long as things were \"separate but equal.\" In the South, everything was separate. However, places like black schools and libraries got much less money and were not as good as places for whites. Things were separate, but not equal.\n\nSegregation kept African-Americans from having the basic rights that the Founding Fathers had written into the Constitution of the United States. Law-makers, government officials, voting officials, and police officers were all white. This prevented African-Americans from having any say in their government; being able to get the same voting rights as white people; having police officers protect them; or being able to get justice for crimes against them. Because they could not count on all-white police forces to protect them, violence against African-Americans, especially lynchings, increased. Because African-Americans could not vote, they also could not serve on juries. This meant that if a black person was ever on trial for a crime, the jury would be all-white.\n\nProblems were worst in the South. However, African-Americans went through different kinds of segregation in other places.\n\nAcross the United States, segregation in housing was a problem. Many African-Americans could not get mortgages to buy houses. Realtors would not sell black people houses in the suburbs, where white people lived. They also would not rent apartments in white areas. Until the 1950s, the federal government did nothing about this.\n\nWhen he was elected in 1913, President Woodrow Wilson made government offices segregated. He believed that segregation was best for everyone.\n\nBlack people fought in both World War I and World War II. However, the military was segregated; black officers even had to enter some military bases through separate entrances as white officers. Black soldiers also were not given the same opportunities as white soldiers. Finally, in 1948, President Harry Truman de-segregated the military.\n\nAfrican Americans tried to fight back against discrimination in many ways. Mostly, they tried to use the courts to get justice. For example, in 1909, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was created. Its goal was to end race discrimination through lawsuits, education, and lobbying.\n\nHowever, eventually, many African Americans became frustrated and began to dislike the idea of using slow, legal strategies to achieve desegregation. Instead, African American activists decided to use a combination of protests, nonviolence, and civil disobedience. This is how the African-American Civil Rights Movement of 1954-1968 began.\n\nFrom about 1954 to 1968, many African-American people and white allies fought to end racial segregation. The movement depended on non-violent protests, sit-ins, marches, civil disobedience, and lawsuits. Its victories included:\n\nThese victories were not easy. Protesters were often threatened and attacked. Leaders' homes were bombed. In Birmingham, the police attacked protesters, including children, with police dogs and fire hoses, then took them to jail. In other cities, police beat protesters with clubs and fired into student protests. Three of the movement's leaders Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Medgar Evers were murdered. \n\nNobody knows exactly how many people were killed during the Civil Rights Movement. However, at least 37 people were murdered, either because they were doing civil rights work, or because racist white groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the White Citizens' Council wanted to terrorize black people. Twelve of these people were children or teenagers when they were murdered.\n\nEventually, the Movement was successful in removing the laws that allowed segregation. However, attitudes are harder to change, and racism still exists in the United States.\n\nIn the early 1800s, the United States was growing farther into the South. White Americans wanted more land to plant cotton. However, many different Native American tribes lived in the lands the United States wanted to take over.\n\nAndrew Jackson was a big supporter of \"Indian removal\" convincing or forcing Native Americans to leave the South and move west, outside of the United States. First as a Major General in the United States Army, and then as President, he led the United States' \"Indian removal\" program.\n\nThe program started in 1814, when Jackson led a group of soldiers who defeated the Creek Indians. He forced them to sign a treaty giving up over 20 million acres of their land to the United States. Over the next ten years, Jackson got nine other tribes to sign treaties giving up their land.\n\nIn 1829, Jackson became President. That same year, gold was found in Georgia, which caused a gold rush. This only made people in the United States want control of the South even more. In 1830, Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830. This law said Jackson could give land west of the Mississippi River to Indian tribes if they agreed to give up their lands in the South. The law promised the tribes that they could live on their new lands forever, and be protected by the United States government. By the time his presidency ended in 1837, Jackson had gotten Native Americans to sign almost 70 treaties giving up their land. Almost 50,000 Native Americans moved to \"Indian Territory\" west of the Mississippi River. However, the government already had a plan to force them into a smaller area, in what is now eastern Oklahoma.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation refused to leave their lands. They even got the United States Supreme Court to rule that they were sovereign and did not have to follow the laws of the United States. Jackson simply ignored this ruling. In 1835, he got a small group of Cherokee to sign a treaty agreeing to leave their lands. The rest of the Cherokee Nation tried to keep their lands. However, in 1838, the United States Army and the Georgia militia forced them to leave their lands. On what is known as the \"Trail of Tears,\" about 15,000 Cherokee were forced to walk over 2,000 miles to Oklahoma. About 4,000 died along the way.\n\nBy the 1840s, except for a few Seminole Indians living in Florida, there were no Native Americans left in the American South.\n\nIn 1851, the United States Congress passed a law that created Indian reservations in Oklahoma. White settlers had already begun to move into the lands the Native Americans had been forced to move to. This was causing conflicts between whites and Native Americans. The goal of the reservations was to segregate the Native Americans from white settlers.\n\nIn 1868, President Ulysses S. Grant decided to create more reservations, and force Native American tribes that lived in the west to move to them. Along with segregating the Native Americans and clearing their land for white use, Grant planned to have church officials run the reservations so they could teach Christianity to the tribes.\n\nMany tribes refused to leave their lands, and were forced onto reservations by the United States Army. If Native Americans left their reservations, the Army went after them to try to force them back onto the reservations. This led to massacres of Native Americans, and some wars.\n\nIn 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act. This law stopped giving land to whole tribes, and broke up the land into small pieces for individual families to use for farming. Indians who took the land, started living alone instead of with their tribes, and started farming were viewed as \"civilized,\" and they were made United States citizens. Indians who refused to segregate themselves even more on small pieces of land were not allowed to be citizens. Whatever land was left was sold to white settlers, which made the reservations even smaller.\n\nIt was not until 1975 that the Supreme Court ruled that tribes are sovereign over tribal lands and members of the tribe.\n\nAs of 2015, all of the Indian reservations in the United States, together, make up 87,800 square miles an area about the size of Idaho. However, Native Americans are now allowed to live or work anywhere they want to, and as of 2016, more than half have left the reservations.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and declared war on the United States. This caused the United States to enter World War II and start fighting Japan, as well as Nazi Germany and Italy.\n\nIn February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order that allowed the military to force people to leave the West Coast. However, Japanese-Americans were the only people on the West Coast who were forced to leave. They were given 48 hours to leave their homes for internment camps. These were camps where Japanese-Americans were kept separate from everybody else. The camps were surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by soldiers with guns.\n\nThe United States government forced over 110,000 Japanese-American people into internment camps. (This was over 80% of the Japanese-American people who lived in the continental United States at the time.) More than three out of every five of these people were born in the United States, and were United States citizens. About half were children.\n\nBecause the United States was fighting Nazi Germany and Italy as well as Japan, some German-Americans and Italian-Americans were forced into internment camps too. So were some Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany. However, this was not as common as it was with Japanese-Americans.\n\nIn 1945, the year World War II ended, the United States let people out of the camps. However, many of the people who were interned had lost everything they had. In 1988, the United States government finally apologized and said that there was no reason for the internment other than racism.\n\n", "id": "536264", "title": "History of racial segregation in the United States"}

This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers had appeared before the US Supreme Court. \n\nPete Hernandez, a Mexican-American agricultural worker, was convicted for the 1950 murder of Joe Espinosa. Hernandez's \"pro bono\" legal team, including Gustavo C. García, wanted to challenge what they knew was \"the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican origin\" from all types of jury duty in at least seventy counties in Texas. His defense lawyers argued that persons of Mexican descent had not been allowed to serve on juries even though numerous Mexican Americans were citizens and had qualified for jury duty in Jackson County. Even though 14 percent of the county was Hispanic, none had served on juries for at least the last 25 years. This meant Hernandez had been deprived of his Fourteenth Amendment rights. Hernandez and his lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas, then to the United States Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari. \n\nThe unanimousmajority opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The Court ruled the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons beyond the racial classes of white or black, and extends protection to other racial or national groups, as well as legal classes. Mexican Americans were such a \"special class\" and were entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPete Hernandez was granted a new trial with a jury that included Mexican Americans. Hernandez was found to be guilty of murder. The ultimate effect of this ruling was that the protection of the 14th Amendment was ruled to cover any racial, national and ethnic groups of the United States for which discrimination could be proved. The Court's ruling served as a legal precedent used in legal challenges against unfair housing laws, school segregation, and voting rights of Mexican Americans nationwide. \n\n", "id": "536356", "title": "Hernandez v.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536358", "text": "Gideon v. Wainwright\n\nGideon v. Wainwright, , is a landmark case in United States Supreme Court history. The Court decided that if a person is charged with a crime, and they cannot pay for a lawyer, the state has to give them one for free. This case caused the public defender program to be created in the United States. (A public defender is a lawyer who defends clients who cannot pay them.)\n\nBetween midnight and 8:00 a.m. on June 3, 1961, some broke into the Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida. The person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole coins from a cash register. Later that day, a witness said he had seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the pool room at around 5:30 that morning. The witness said Gideon left with a wine bottle and money in his pockets. Based only on this information, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny. This charge means a person broke into a place, meaning to steal someone else's property. (In Florida, at the time, \"petty\" larceny meant that the person stole something that was worth less than $50.) Under Florida law, if Gideon was found guilty, he could be put in prison for up to five years. \n\nGideon was too poor to afford a lawyer, so he appeared in court alone. He asked the judge to assign him a lawyer (called \"counsel\" in court). He and the judge had this conversation:\n\nThe Florida court refused to assign a lawyer for Gideon. Because of this, he had to act as his own lawyer in court and defend himself. Gideon had quit school in the eighth grade, and had no training in the law. He tried to defend himself and argue that he was not guilty. However, he made many legal mistakes during the trial. For example, he asked witnesses questions that only made him seem more guilty. He also chose witnesses for his defense (witnesses that were supposed to help prove his innocence) who just supported the prosecution's evidence against Gideon. The judge also made some mistakes, and did not tell Gideon about legal rights that a lawyer would have known about.\n\nAfter the trial ended, the jury found Gideon guilty. The judge sentenced Gideon to five years in prison the most severe punishment the law allowed.\n\nIn 1961, state courts had to follow the Supreme Court's decision in \"Betts v. Brady.\" In this case, the Court ruled that if a defendant was charged with a capital crime, he had to be be assigned a lawyer if he could not pay for one. However, as long as the defendant was not charged with a capital crime, the states did not have to assign free lawyers to every defendant who could not afford them. The Court ruled that having a lawyer was not a basic right, and was not necessary for a fair trial.\n\nIn their decision, the Court did rule that there were special cases where a court should assign a lawyer. In these special cases, not having a lawyer would make it difficult for a defendant to get a fair trial. These \"specialized circumstances\" included things like a defendant not having education or not knowing the rules of the court.\n\nThe Supreme Court had set different rules for federal courts. In 1938, in a case called \"Johnson v. Zerbst\", the Court ruled that in federal courts, any person who was charged with a crime and could not afford a lawyer had to be assigned a lawyer for free. The Court also ruled that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution applied to federal courts, but not state courts. (The Sixth Amendment says that \"In all criminal [trials], the accused shall ... have the assistance of counsel for his defence.\")\n\nWhat this meant was that in 1961, throughout the state of Florida, most defendants did not have lawyers. They had two choices: to plead guilty, or to defend themselves at trial. A Florida lawyer remembers that \"[before] 1963, lawyers were likely to appear in Florida courtrooms only for the wealthy.\"\n\nIn a letter he wrote from prison, Gideon once wrote:\n\nFirst, Gideon filed a writ of habeas corpus with the Florida State Supreme Court. This is a request to be set free from unfair imprisonment. The Florida Supreme Court summarily denied his request meaning they refused to even hold a court hearing or hear Gideon's arguments.\n\nFrom his prison cell, using the prison library and writing in pencil on prison paper, Gideon then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. He asked the Supreme Court to review his case \"because the 'due process clause' of the fourteenth admendment of the constitution and the fifth and sixth articales of the Bill of rights has been violated\" \"sic\".\n\nGideon argued that he had been denied a lawyer, which violated his Sixth Amendment rights. In \"Betts v. Brady\", the Supreme Court had ruled that the Sixth Amendment did not apply to the states. However, Gideon argued that it did, because of the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment says that no state can take away any person's \"life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws.\" Gideon argued that without assigning lawyers to poor defendants, the state of Florida was not giving those defendants due process or equal protection under the laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed to hear Gideon's appeal. They had decided to think about whether \"Betts v. Brady\" should be \"reconsidered\" (re-thought).\n\nThe basic question the Supreme Court had to answer had to do with the Sixth Amendment. They had already decided that under the Sixth Amendment, everyone accused of a crime in \"federal\" court had the right to have a lawyer, even if they could not pay for one. Now they needed to decide whether the Sixth Amendment applied to the states like it did to the federal government. In other words, did every person accused of a crime in \"state\" court have the right to a lawyer?\n\nThe Supreme Court had assigned Gideon a well-known lawyer from Washington, D.C. named Abe Fortas. (In 1965, Fortas would become a United States Supreme Court Justice.) \n\nFortas argued that it was impossible for a person to get a fair trial without a lawyer. He argued that under the Fourteenth Amendment's \"due process\" requirement, the states had to give a person a fair trial before taking away their freedom. By denying Gideon a lawyer, the state of Florida denied him a fair trial and violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nA lawyer named Bruce Jacob argued the case against Gideon in front of the Supreme Court. He made a few different arguments.\n\nJacob argued that the Constitution allows states to make their own rules about the criminal procedure (how to run criminal trials). He talked about federalism the separation of powers between federal and state governments that is written into the Constitution. By making a rule saying the states always had to give poor defendants free lawyers, the federal government would be over-stepping its powers. The states would be unable to make their own rules, and this would take away a right the Constitution gave to the states.\n\nJacob also argued that a person does not need a lawyer to get a fair trial. He said that judges, and even prosecutors, help protect the rights of people who defend themselves in court.\n\nIn addition, Jacob said that if the Court ruled in favor of Gideon, the effects would be harmful. If the Court ruled that a lawyer was needed for a fair trial, then the state would also have to give poor defendants free lawyers for other types of trials, like appeals and civil trials. The state would never have enough lawyers for this or enough money to pay them, he said. Also, out of Florida's 8,000 prisoners, 65% 5,200 prisoners had not had lawyers. Jacob argued that many of these prisoners could go free if the Court ruled in favor of Gideon.\n\nOn March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court voted 9-0 that Gideon was right. His rights \"had\" been violated.\n\nThe Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment's right to a lawyer does apply to the states. It reasoned that without a lawyer, a person cannot get a fair trial. If a person does not get a fair trial, they are not getting the \"due process of law\" that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. In other words, because people have the right to due process, they have the right to a fair trial; and because they cannot get a fair trial without a lawyer, they also have the right to a lawyer.\n\nThe Court also said that its earlier decision in \"Betts v. Brady\" had been wrong. This ruling overturned the Supreme Court's earlier decision in \"Betts v. Brady\" (meaning the \"Betts\" decision was no longer valid). Justice Black (who had disagreed with the \"Betts\" decision when the Court made it) wrote:\nThe Supreme Court's ruling did not mean that Gideon could automatically go free. It meant he got a new trial this time, with a free lawyer assigned to him. \n\nGideon asked for a lawyer named Fred Turner, who had a very good reputation, and the judge agreed. With Turner arguing the case, it took jurors less than an hour to find Gideon not guilty. Gideon was set free that day.\nGideon died on January 18, 1972, from cancer and tuberculosis. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Missouri. \n\nAlmost thirteen years later, the American Civil Liberties Union paid for a headstone to be put on Gideon's grave. On the gravestone, there is a quote based on something Gideon wrote in a letter to Abe Fortas: \"I believe that each era finds an improvement in law for the benefit of mankind.\"\n\nBased on the Supreme Court decision, each of Florida's 5,200 prisoners who had been convicted without counsel had the right to a new trial this time with a lawyer. However, about 1,200 of these prisoners were set free without a new trial. This happened because witnesses in their cases had died or moved away, and the state of Florida did not have enough evidence to try them again.\n\nThe same year \"Gideon\" was decided, the Florida state legislature set up their public defender system. Throughout the 1960s, states that did not already have public defender systems created them.\n\nWhen \"Gideon\" was decided, there were still 13 states that did not always give lawyers to poor criminal defendants. Like in Florida, many of these poor defendants did not get fair trials because they did not have a lawyer's help. After the \"Gideon\" decision, every person who is charged with a crime, in any court in the United States, has the right to a lawyer even if they cannot pay for one. Defendants can decide they do not want a lawyer, but when they do that, they are giving up their right to a lawyer because they want to.\n\nFour years after \"Gideon\", in a case called \"Burget v. Texas\", the Supreme Court ruled that the \"Gideon\" decision applied \"retroactively.\" This means it applies even to defendants who were convicted before \"Gideon\" was decided in 1963. In other words, the Court was admitting that defendants should have had the right to counsel all along, even before \"Gideon\". The Court decided in \"Gideon\" that people could not get a fair trial without lawyers; that was just as true for people who were convicted before 1963. These people, too, now deserved new trials, with free lawyers to help them.\n\nThe \"Gideon\" decision still guarantees free counsel to every poor individual charged with a crime in the United States. However, many legal scholars agree that there are many problems with the public defender system in the 21st century. Because of these problems, they argue, many poor defendants are not getting the rights the \"Gideon\" decision gave them.\n\nAccording to these scholars, one of the biggest problems with today's public defender programs is that they do not get enough money from the government to deal with the number of poor defendants they have to represent. This means:\n\nWhen public defenders cannot do their jobs well because they have too many cases, have too little experience, or are too overwhelmed, defendants get more severe punishments when they are convicted.\n\n", "id": "536358", "title": "Gideon v.

The Court held that Congress lacked the constitutional authority under the Fourteenth Amendment to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals and organizations, rather than state and local governments.\n\nThe Court held that the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which provided that \"all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude\" was unconstitutional.\n\nThe decision itself involved five consolidated cases (United States v. Stanley, United States v. Ryan, United States v. Nichols, United States v. Singleton, and Robinson v. Memphis & Charleston Railroad 109 U.S. 3, 3 S. Ct. 18, 27 L. Ed. 835.) coming from different lower courts in which Black Americans had sued theaters, hotels and transit companies that had refused them service or excluded them from \"white only\" facilities.\n\n The Court, in an 8-1 decision by Justice Joseph P. Bradley, held that the language of the 14th Amendment, which prohibited denial of equal protection by a state, did not give Congress power to regulate these private acts. This was because it was the result of conduct by private individuals, not state law or action, that blacks were suffering. Section five empowers Congress only to enforce the prohibition on state action. Legislation by Congress on subjects which are within the domain of the state are not authorized by the 14th Amendment. Private acts of racial discrimination were simply private wrongs that the national government was powerless to correct. Bradley commented that \"individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [14th] Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThe Court also acknowledged that the 13th Amendment does apply to private actors, but only to the extent that it prohibits people from owning slaves, not exhibiting discriminatory behavior. The Court said that \"it would be running the slavery argument into the ground to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car; or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business.\"\n\nMany African-American leaders were outraged and disappointed that the Supreme Court declared the first two sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional. On October 20, 1883, T. Thomas Fortune, the editor of the \"New York Globe\" wrote: \"The colored people of the United States feel to-day as if they had been baptized in ice water\". Many felt it was the end of an era in which the Federal government would protect the rights of African-American citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision severely restricted the power of the federal government to guarantee equal status under the law to blacks. State officials in the South took advantage of the decision and began to enact laws that legalized the treatment of blacks as second-class citizens for another seventy years. The court's decision thus ultimately led to the enactment of state laws, such as Jim Crow laws, which made racial segregation the law.\n", "id": "536455", "title": "Civil Rights Cases"}

The bill was passed by the 43rd United States Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875. Several years later, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883) that sections of the act were unconstitutional.\n\nThe drafting of the bill was done in early in 1870 by Senator Charles Sumner. It was with the assistance of John Mercer Langston, a prominent African-American who established the law department at Howard University. The bill was proposed by Senator Sumner and co-sponsored by Representative Benjamin F. Butler, both Republicans from Massachusetts, in the 41st United States Congress in 1870. The act was eventually passed by the 43rd Congress in February 1875 and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 8–1 decision, declared the act unconstitutional in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" on October 15, 1883. Justice John Marshall Harlan provided the lone dissent. The Court held the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination by the state and local government, but it does not give the federal government the power to prohibit discrimination by private individuals and organizations. The Court also held that the Thirteenth Amendment was meant to eliminate \"the badge of slavery,\" but not to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last civil rights bill to be signed into law in the United States until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1875 is notable as one of the major pieces of legislation related to Reconstruction that were passed by Congress after the American Civil War. These include the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the four Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, the three Enforcement Acts of 1870 and 1871, and the three Constitutional Amendments adopted between 1865 and 1870.\n\nProvisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later adopted by Congress during the Civil Rights Movement as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. This legislation relied on the Commerce Clause contained in of the Constitution of the United States.\n", "id": "536467", "title": "Civil Rights Act of 1875"}

Louisiana, , was an important civil rights case argued by Thurgood Marshall before the Supreme Court. On December 11, 1961, the court ruled that Louisiana could not convict peaceful sit-in protesters who refused to leave dining establishments under the state's \"disturbing the peace\" laws. \n\nAfrican-American students from Southern University sat at a \"whites only\" segregated lunch bar at Sitman's Drugstore in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The manager called the Police after the students quietly remained even though they were asked to move to another counter. After ordering the black patrons to leave, the Police arrested them and charged them with disturbing the peace. The claim was that their behavior could \"foreseeably disturb or alarm the public,\" according to the state's \"disturbing the peace\" statute.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People defended the student demonstrators as did the Kennedy administration's Justice Department, which filed a legal brief on their behalf. \n\nIn a 9-0 decision, the court ruled in the African-American students' favor, arguing the state violated due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment and finding there was no evidence the students' behavior could have foreseeably disturbed the peace. In his written opinion, Justice John Marshall Harlan compared sit-in demonstrations to verbal expression as a form of free speech. \nJustice William O. Douglas in his concurring opinion said, “For the police are supposed to be on the side of the Constitution, not on the side of discrimination. Yet if all constitutional questions are to be put aside and the problem treated merely in terms of disturbing the peace, I would have difficulty in reversing these judgments. I think, however, the constitutional questions must be reached and that they make reversal necessary.” \n\"Garner v. Louisiana\" was an important case for the Civil Rights Movement, and one of many civil rights cases argued before the Warren Court (1953-69). \nEventually, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce.\"\n", "id": "536481", "title": "Garner v.

Article III of the Constitution requires the establishment of a Supreme Court and permits the Congress to create other federal courts, and place limitations on their jurisdiction. Article III United States federal judges are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate to serve until they resign, are impeached and convicted, retire, or die.\n\nThe federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting of writs of certiorari. There is generally no right of appeal to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.\n\nThe United States courts of appeals are the intermediate federal appellate courts. There are 13 appellate courts that determine if the law was applied correctly in trial courts. In some cases, Congress has diverted appellate jurisdiction to specialized courts, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.\n\nThere are 94 United States district courts. These are general federal trial courts, although in many cases Congress has diverted original jurisdiction to specialized courts, such as the Court of International Trade, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, or to Article I or Article IV tribunals.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536488", "text": "Capital punishment in the United States\n\nCapital punishment (the death penalty) has existed in the United States since before the United States was a country. As of 2016, capital punishment is legal in 31 of the 50 states. The federal government (including the United States military) also uses capital punishment.\n\nThe United States is the only Western country that uses the death penalty.\n\nBefore the United States became an independent country, it was a colony of the British Empire. The first known death sentence in colonial America happened in 1608. Captain George Kendall was executed by firing squad at the Jamestown colony after being accused of spying for the Spanish government.\n\nIn colonial America, people could be executed for many things. In the Jamestown colony, the first set of rules and punishments the colony's Lieutenant Governor wrote was very strict. There were 48 different capital crimes (crimes that were punishable by death). They included:\nWhen some colonists decided they did not like these strict rules, they ran away from the colony to live with nearby Native Americans. They were brought back to the colony, tortured, and executed.\n\nEach of the Thirteen Colonies came up with its own death penalty laws. For example, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which was mostly Puritan, laws were harsh. Under its first capital punishment laws, which were effective from 1636-1647, people were executed for sodomy, adultery, witchcraft, blasphemy, bestiality, assault, rape, statutory rape, perjury in a capital trial, and murder. Later, the colony continued to execute people for witchcraft, including 20 people during the Salem Witch Trials. They also executed people for being Quakers and pirates.\n\nUnder the New York colony's Duke's Laws of 1665, a person could be executed for \"denial of the one true God\" or for hitting their mother or father.\n\nSome colonies were not as strict. For example, the New Jersey colony had no death penalty, and in the Pennsylvania colony only murder and treason were capital crimes.\n\nBy 1776, most of the colonies had similar laws about the death penalty. In most colonies, the capital crimes were arson, piracy, treason, murder, sodomy, burglary, robbery, rape, stealing horses, slave rebellion, and counterfeiting (making fake money). Usually, people sentenced to death were hanged.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, British Major John André was hanged by the Continental Army on October 2, 1780. He was convicted of spying and helping Benedict Arnold.\n\nThe first slaves were brought to the Jamestown colony in 1619. Slavery was legal in the United States for the next 246 years, until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution made it illegal in 1865. Until that time, slaves had no rights.\n\nSlaves could be punished or tortured for any reason, or for no reason at all. Slaves who tried to escape or rebel were often tortured and executed where other slaves could see, to warn them not to do the same thing.\n\nFor example, in 1755, in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a slave named Mark was accused of poisoning his \"master.\" He was executed, then hung in chains at Boston Harbor so his body would rot. This was supposed to remind other slaves not to rebel every time they passed Mark's body. Twenty years later, when Paul Revere made his \"Midnight Ride,\" Mark's skeleton was still hanging in chains at Boston Harbor.\n\nDuring the 1700s, in the Southern colonies, an unknown number of slaves were executed, sometimes for things like hitting another slave, \"fussing,\" or \"sassing\" a white person. Laws in the Southern colonies were passed allowing cruel and unusual punishments as well as capital punishment for slaves.\n\nIn the late 1700s, activists like Benjamin Rush began to argue that the death penalty should not be used. Between 1794 and 1815, eight states passed laws that made fewer crimes punishable by death. However, many southern states made more crimes punishable by death, especially for slaves.\n\nMajor reforms started to happen between 1833 and 1853. At that time, many executions were public events. By 1849, fifteen states had switched to private hangings.\n\nIn 1846, Michigan became the first state to abolish the death penalty, just after it entered the United States.\n\nIn 1852, Massachusetts's state legislature voted to allow the death penalty only for first-degree murder. The next year, Wisconsin outlawed capital punishment. In 1887, Maine's state legislature banned the death penalty.\n\nThe focus on the death penalty slowed while the country was busy with the issue of slavery and the American Civil War. However, in 1897, the United States Congress passed a law that made fewer federal crimes punishable by death. In 1911, Minnesota abolished capital punishment. Several other states also abolished the death penalty, but would start using it again later.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1973, six other states permanently abolished the death penalty:\n\nIn 1972, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Furman v. Georgia\" that the way death penalty laws were written made them unconstitutional. They ruled that sentencing rules were discriminatory, because black people got sentenced to death more often than whites for the same crimes. Because of this, the death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment, which violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. This ruling stopped all executions in the country. Between 1972 and 1976, there were no executions in the United States.\n\nHowever, by early 1975, thirty states had passed new death penalty laws that they thought would satisfy the Supreme Court. They did. In \"Gregg v. Georgia\" (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that Georgia's new death penalty law was constitutional. It ruled that capital punishment was not always cruel and unusual punishment, as long as it was done fairly. This meant that states could start executing people again, as long as they had rewritten their death penalty laws like Georgia did, to say that the death penalty would be applied fairly. In 1977, executions began again in the United States.\n\nIn two major cases, the Supreme Court has limited who may be executed. In \"Atkins v. Virginia\" (2002), the Court decided that executing people with intellectual disabilities is cruel and unusual punishment, and is against the Eighth Amendment. Before this decision, between 1984 and 1992, forty-four people with intellectual disabilities were executed in the United States.\n\nAlso, in \"Roper v. Simmons\" (2005), the Supreme Court made it illegal to execute a person who was younger than 18 when they committed their crime.\n\nIn 2004, two researchers named M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykia put together a list of executions that became known as \"The ESPY File.\" The Espy File says that between 1608 and 1991, in the American colonies and then the United States, 15,269 people were executed. The Espy File is \"the most often cited and used list of America's legal executions.\" However, in a 2011 study, two researchers criticized The Espy File. They wrote that researchers should not use the File as a complete source of information about executions.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, between 1930 and 2002, the United States executed 4,679 people. About two-thirds of these people (about 3,100 people) were executed between 1930 and 1950.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1955, the United States military executed 135 soldiers. The military has not executed anyone since 1955.\n\nIn 2016, only 5 of 50 or 10% of US states had executions. They were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Texas.\n\nThroughout American history, different methods of execution have been used. During colonial times, cruel and painful methods like burning or crushing people to death were sometimes used. However, since 1776, all but a few executions have been carried out in one of five ways: hanging, firing squad, the electric chair, the gas chamber, or lethal injection.\n\nSince the Bill of Rights was added to the United States Constitution in 1791, \"cruel and unusual punishment\" has been against the law in the United States. This means that even if a person commits a terrible crime, the Constitution says their punishment cannot be painful or cause suffering on purpose.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, hanging was the most common method of execution in the United States.\n\nHowever, hanging did not always work the way it was supposed to. If the rope and noose were not put in the correct position, a person could be decapitated. If the rope was not long enough, the person could slowly die of strangulation. People started looking for more 'civilized' ways to execute people.\n\nAfter Thomas Edison discovered direct current (DC) electricity in 1882, his company showed how powerful it was by using it to kill animals. The idea of using electricity to kill humans grew out of this. New York built the first electric chair, and first used it to execute a prisoner on August 6, 1890. Other states also adopted the electric chair as a method of execution, believing that it was a less painful way to die than hanging.\n\nHowever, it became clear, even to some members of the Supreme Court, that dying in an electric chair was very painful. Also, even up until the 1990s, electric chairs would work incorrectly, causing prisoners to catch fire or be awake while they were being electrocuted. Around the 1980s, most states began to use lethal injection instead.\n\nStill looking for a more \"humane\" methods of execution, in 1924, Nevada prison officials tried to secretly pump cyanide gas into death row prisoner Gee Jon's cell to kill him while he slept. This did not work, and they had to build a gas chamber. On February 8, 1924, Jon became the first person to be executed by gas chamber.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1972, the United States executed about 600 people in gas chambers. Most states used hydrogen cyanide gas. However, by the mid-1970s and 1980s, many people had started to criticize the use of gas chambers. Death from hydrogen cyanide poisoning can be long and painful, and in some executions, prisoners suffered long deaths. After one of these executions, a federal court in California ruled that \"execution by lethal gas under the California protocol is unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nAlso, according to sociologist Clifton Bryant, the way it is used in the United States, \"the gas chamber is ... the most dangerous, most complicated, and most expensive method of administering the death penalty.\" By the late 20th century, most states had switched to using lethal injection.\n\nIn the 1970s, Oklahoma passed the first law that allowed executions by lethal injection. This was a practical decision: Oklahoma's old electric chair would need expensive repairs, and building a gas chamber would cost over $200,000. However, executing a person by lethal injection would only cost $10 to $15 per person. Lethal injection grew more and more popular in death penalty states. It was viewed as less painful, with less suffering, than the electric chair or gas chamber. Texas was the first state to execute someone by lethal injection, in 1982. Over the next 30 years, all of the death penalty states passed laws making lethal injection their first-choice (or only) method of execution.\n\nHowever, in the 2010s, American prisons started having trouble getting enough of the medications used to carry out lethal injections. The states had been using three medications for lethal injections:\n\nThen, in 2011, Hospira, the only American company that made sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug. The European Union makes other anesthetics, like propofol. However, since the European Union is against the death penalty, they made it illegal to export any product that could be used in an execution. Another anesthetic, pentobarbital, is also only made in the European Union, and the company that makes it has put limits on selling it to U.S. government customers. A few states have tried mixtures of other drugs, but those executions have not gone well.\n\nAs of 2016, many death penalty states have temporarily stopped using lethal injection until they can find a solution to this problem.\n\nAs of January 1, 2016, fifteen states have laws that allow them to use a method of execution other than lethal injection. Before the lethal injection drug shortages, these other methods were rarely used. From 1976 to March 23, 2016, there were 1,431 executions:\nHowever, since they stopped being able to get lethal injection drugs, some states have thought about going back to other methods of execution. Here are the states whose laws allow them to use other methods, as of January 1, 2016:\n\nThis table shows the death penalty laws in each of the states; Washington, D.C.; the federal government; and the United States military, as of January 1, 2016. Under the category \"Status,\" there are four possibilities:\n\nClick on the little triangle at the top of each header box to sort the information in this table by a certain category.\n\nIn some areas, prosecutors ask for the death penalty, and judges grant the death penalty, more often than in other areas. Also, once people are convicted and are on \"death row,\" how quickly they are executed depends on the state they are in. On average, in 2004, death penalty states had executed about 10% of the people on their \"death rows.\" However, California had executed only 1% of its prisoners who are sentenced to death. Texas executed 40% of theirs.\n\nOn of the controversies about the death penalty is whether it is given unequally to people of different races.\n\nIn a report in 1983, David Baldus and others wrote a famous report that looked at whether the death penalty was applied equally to people of different races in Georgia. They found that:\n\nIn 1987, the Supreme Court decided a case called \"McCleskey v. Kemp\". McCleskey's lawyers showed that in Georgia, where McCleskey lived, black people convicted of killing whites were four times more likely to get the death penalty than people convicted of killing non-whites. The Supreme Court accepted this, but ruled against McCleskey. They wrote: \"[inequalities] in sentencing are an inevitable part of our criminal justice system.\" Since then, judges have not allowed lawyers to argue that racial bias plays a part in the death penalty.\n\nAnti-death penalty groups like Amnesty International say:\n\nThe United States Department of Justice says that between 1980 and 2008, African Americans committed 52.5% of the murders in the United States; whites committed 45.3%; and Native Americans and Asians committed 2.2%. This means African Americans are less likely to be executed on a per capita basis. The Department of Justice also says that as of 2009, Hispanic or Latino people make up 17.4% of the United States population, but only 13.5% of death row prisoners.\n\nA 2012 study found that non-white soldiers in the United States military are twice as likely as white soldiers to be given the death penalty. Of the 16 soldiers the military has sentenced to death between 1985 and 2012, 10 (62.5%) were non-whites, one of the study's authors said.\n\nThe death penalty is definitely given much more often to men than women. As of October 1, 2014:\n\nThe University of Michigan Law School keeps a list of people who have been exonerated from death row. The list counts \"exonerations\" as cases where \"a person who has been convicted of a crime is officially cleared based on new evidence of innocence.\"\n\nAccording to the list, between 1989 and 2015, 116 people have been exonerated from death row. The most common reasons why these people were exonerated were:\n\nDNA evidence proved that 25 of these people about 22% were innocent of the crimes they were sentenced to death for.\n\nOf the 116 people who were exonerated, 62 (about 53%) were black, 43 (37%) were white, 9 (8%) were Hispanic, and two were members of other races (2%). In the 88 cases where a government official abused their power, 51 of the exonerated people (about 58%) were black; 29 were Caucasian (33%); and 8 (9%) were Hispanic. Seventeen of the 31 people who received an \"inadequate legal defense\" (about 55%) were black; 12 (about 39%) were white; and two (about 6%) were Hispanic.\n\nThe death penalty is a very controversial topic in the United States. People have argued about it since before the Thirteen Colonies became the United States. There are many different arguments for and against the death penalty. This list does not include all of them, just some of the most common ones.\n\nPeople who do not agree with the death penalty (death penalty \"opponents\") say our trial system is not perfect. Judges and juries make mistakes. One study done by Columbia Law School found that there were serious mistakes in two-thirds of all capital trials. In these trials, the defendants were sentenced to death anyway. However, when their cases were appealed, over 80% of the defendants were not sentenced to death; 7% were found not guilty.\n\nOpponents argue that because mistakes are so common in capital trials, people can be executed even though they were innocent. As proof, they point the 116 people who were exonerated from death row between 1989 and 2015.\n\nPeople who support the death penalty (death penalty \"supporters\") say that mistakes are very rare, especially since new laws were made in the 1970s to add protections for death row inmates. For example, Steve Stewart, Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the Clark County, Indiana, Fourth Judicial Court, says:\nDeath penalty supporters say that capital punishment is a \"deterrent\". This means that people are scared of the death penalty and are less likely to commit a capital crime if they know they could get the death penalty.\n\nSupporters also argue that the next most serious punishment for capital crimes is life in prison. In some states, this means the person could be let out of prison someday. Also, even being in prison for life does not keep killers from killing more people in prison. Executing people is the only way to make sure they will never kill another person.\n\nOpponents argue that nobody has ever proved that capital punishment is more of a deterrent than a long prison sentence. They point out that most states and countries that do not have the death penalty have lower murder rates than death penalty states. They also say that the death penalty is not a deterrent because people often commit murders when they are very upset and are not thinking about what might happen in the future.\n\nAmong scholars and researchers, there is no agreement about whether capital punishment is more of a deterrent than any other punishment. Some researchers have done studies that say the death penalty is a deterrent. Other studies have found that the death penalty is not a deterrent in the United States, or in other countries.\n\nOpponents argue that defendants who are poor and/or non-white are more likely to get the death penalty than whites, even if they have committed the same crimes. Supporters say that opponents misuse statistics and exaggerate the situation. For more information, see the section on Sentencing: Among races farther up on this page.\n\nDeath penalty debaters argue about whether capital punishment is \"cruel and unusual punishment\" (which would be unconstitutional). Even the people on the Supreme Court have disagreed on this issue. In 2004, the Court ruled in \"Baze v. Rice\" that even if an execution causes pain, that does not make it cruel and unusual. However, in his dissenting opinion in \"Gregg v. Georgia\", Justice William Brennan wrote that the death penalty is \"an unusually severe punishment, unusual in its pain... [it] is today a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the ... Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an anti-death penalty group, adds that capital punishment is \"unusual\" because:\n\nReligion plays a complicated role in death penalty arguments. To support the death penalty, some people quote from the Old Testament of the Bible, which says: \"An eye for an eye, a life for a life.\" This means that if you take a life, you should pay with your own life. However, others use parts of the New Testament, where Jesus talks about forgiveness and nonviolence, to oppose the death penalty. They say that no one has the right to take a life but God even if that person has taken a life himself.\n\nIn 1999, a group of Jewish rabbis and Catholic Bishops had this to say:\nOpponents also point out:\n\n", "id": "536488", "title": "Capital punishment in the United States"}

A smaller difference means that model fits the data better. Ordinary least squares is a special case of a method commonly called least squares. The resulting estimator can be expressed by a simple formula.\n", "id": "536540", "title": "Ordinary least squares"}
