Autistic people typically show an impaired ability to recognize other people's minds. Therefore they experience difficulties with explaining and predicting other people’s behaviour.

They have difficulties with it throughout their lives. However, autistic people's performance on theory of mind tasks varies.\n\nFor testing whether someone lacks the theory of mind, the \"Sally-Anne\" test is performed. The child sees the following story: Sally and Anne are playing. Sally puts her ball into a basket and leaves the room. While Sally is gone, Anne moves the ball from the basket to the box. Now Sally returns. The question is: where will Sally look for her ball? The test is passed, if the child correctly assumes that Sally will look in the basket.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560051", "text": "Secession in the United States\n\nSecession in the United States refers mainly to state secession. It applies to the outbreak of the American Civil War when on December 20, 1860, South Carolina officially declared their secession from the United States. It was followed four months later by the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. These initial seven seceding states formed the Confederate States of America based in Montgomery, Alabama. Then, on April 12, 1861, hostilities began at Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. After this, the states of Virginia (except the northwestern counties), Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina joined the Confederacy. The capital was then moved Richmond, Virginia. The Northern and Border states remained with the Union.\n\nIn 1860, secession was not a new threat. It had been discussed as early as 1776 when the Continental Congress wanted to tax all of the colonies based on a population count that included slaves. South Carolina threatened to separate themselves from the other 12 colonies over the issue. From then until the outbreak of the American Civil War, anytime a minority sectional dispute came up (often over slavery) the threat of secession would be used. It was a matter of concern when the Constitutional Convention met in 1787 in Philadelphia. Secession was closely tied to the thinking of members of the Whig party. Their thinking was that rebellion (such as in 1776) was a right of a state against any form of despotic government.\n\nWhen the South seceded in 1860-61, one argument was that in 1776, when the thirteen Colonies rebelled against Great Britain, it was a secession. Others argued the two situations were very different. The thirteen colonies revolted against Great Britain, they did not secede from it. What resulted was the American Revolutionary War. Each of the colonies was regarding itself as a sovereign state and was waging a war of independence in cooperation with twelve other sovereign nations.\n\nFollowing the war, scholars disagreed on what caused the Civil War. The disagreements still go on today. Many said that slavery was the main cause of the war. The Southern states wanted to continue it while the Northern states wanted to stop it. Others say slavery was not the main issue. They point to states' rights and taxation as leading causes.\n\nEach state that seceded wrote an \"Article of Secession\" formally declaring they were leaving the Union.

In the aftermath of the war, the League of Nations gave South Africa a mandate to administer the territory. \nAfter World War II, South Africa refused to surrender its mandate for replacement by a United Nations Trusteeship agreement requiring closer international monitoring of the territory's administration. Although the South African government wanted to incorporate South-West Africa into its territory, it never officially did so, although it was administered as the de-facto \"fifth province\", with the white minority having representation in the (whites-only) Parliament of South Africa.\nIn the wake of the South Africa government's refusal and the implementation of its apartheid policies in South-West Africa (SWA), SWAPO became increasingly militant and in 1962 its military wing, the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), was formed.\nIn the mid-1960s, a number of SWAPO bases had been established in the neighbouring country of Zambia and its insurgents began infiltrating SWA. The first such incursion took place in September 1965 and the second in March 1966, but it was only on 26 August 1966 that the first major clash of the conlict took place, when a unit of the South African Police (SAP) - supported by South African Air Force helicopters - exchanged fire with SWAPO forces.

They are also protected by the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights. The discussion over states' rights is the oldest constitutional debate in the United States. In one form or another it still goes on today.\n\nStates' rights, meaning the sovereignty and independence of individual US states, was guaranteed in the Articles of Confederation, the precursor to the U.S. Constitution. It stated that the individual states \"hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare\". The articles created a weak central government with most of the power being kept by the individual states. Within a short time, it was realized that a stronger central government and a constitution was needed.\n\nThe question of states' rights were debated at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787. They were the subject of debates between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists while the Constitution was being ratified.\n\nFueled mainly by the issue of slavery, the question of what rights belonged to the state and what belonged to the federal government came up during the 1820s and 1830s. This is when the United States was expanding westward. Southern states wanted the new territories to allow slavery. Northern states wanted the territory to be free of slavery. As the North's economy grew and the South's economy stalled, the two began moving farther apart on the issue. By the 1840s and 1850s, each had adopted extreme positions based on the morality of slavery and economic self-interests. As long as both North and South had equal representation in the United States Senate, neither side could dictate to the other. But with each new state applying for statehood, the balance of power was threatened. In the 1850s the issue of secession was raised again. The Southern argument was that when they agreed to join the United States in the late 1780s, they kept the power to cancel the agreement. South Carolina threatened to secede unless the Senate passed a constitutional amendment to give the South “the power she possessed of protecting herself before the equilibrium of the two sections was destroyed.”\n\nSeveral peaceful attempts were made to find a compromise. The Compromise of 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act were all aimed at reaching a compromises. However, only the Fugitive Slave Act clearly benefited the South. Northerner bitterly resented the law. It made all citizens responsible to catch any runaway slaves and return them to their masters.\n\nWhile many people believe that the Civil War was about states' rights and not slavery, the Southern states were in favor of states' rights for themselves, but not for all states. They did not favor states' rights for new states joining the Union on the question of slavery. They wanted the federal government to decide these would all have to accept slavery within their own borders. This can be seen in the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and the 1850 Compromise. All were designed to force the Northern states to accept slavery. \n\nIn December 1835, Representative James Hammond of South Carolina proposed the House of Representatives force a gag rule against any member bringing up any anti-slavery petitions. It was referred to a committee which decided the gag order should go into effect for anything regarding slavery. Speaker of the House James Polk of Tennessee referred the issue to a special committee. The committee chairman was Henry L. Pinckney of South Carolina who decided that any issues regarding slavery should be tabled without discussion permanently. John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts objected but was outvoted. He fought against the gag rule for the next four Congresses. Each session he brought up the issue until finally on December 3, 1844 it was overturned.\n\nBleeding Kansas was another case of Southerners fighting against states' rights. Most settlers came to Kansas from Northern States. They were not interested in the conflict over slavery, they just wanted to create farms and live in peace. Kansas was on the border with Missouri, a slave state. Many in Missouri were driven to believe that all the settlers in Kansas were \"negro thieves\" and abolitionist. Missourians believed they had to defend slavery and attacked Kansas communities across the border trying to kill or drive out those who would vote against slavery. Abolutionists also came to Kansas to make certain it would vote to become a free state. It turned Kansas into a battleground.\n\nWhile many in the North were in favor of states determining their own course, when it came to slavery there was a considerable anti-slavery political faction at work in the North. Although many in New England had grown wealthy in the slave trade before it was banned, that part of the North became a center for abolitionist movements. Beginning in the 1830s, Northern churches and politicians became prominent in the movement. This contributed to the resentment felt by Southerners. Abolitionists took a hard line against slavery and wanted all slaves freed and an immediate end to racial segregation everywhere in the country. Other groups in the North, notably free-soilers wanted to end slavery in the new western territories, but for different reasons. While they didn't have slaves themselves most were prejudiced against black people. They believed the popular idea at the time that blacks were inferior. They wanted the new lands to be for whites only. Southern slaveholders saw little difference between the two groups and only saw they both were against slavery.\n\nDuring the Civil War era, the struggle over states' rights was between the individual Southern states and the federal government over who ultimately had the political power. While some historians argue slavery was the man cause of the war and others say states' rights was the cause, the two were very closely connected. At issue was whether the federal government could regulate or even end slavery within a state's borders. There were other factors that divided the country between Southern slaveholding states and Northern industrial states. The South saw the institution of slavery as necessary to their economy and their way of life. Even Southern churches supported slavery when Northern churches saw the ownership of another person as an abomination.\n\nThose who defended Southern states' rights pointed to the Tenth Amendment. It states:\nThe Constitution does not even mention the word \"slave\". The framers of the Constitution (many of them slave owners) wanted to avoid the problem at the federal level. The only reference was to the three-fifths rule which counted three-fifths of a state's slave population which gave a state extra representation and extra votes in the Electoral College. There, the framers did not say slaves, but rather \"all other persons\" meaning slaves.\n\nOn March 4, 1861, Lincoln gave his first inaugural address as part of his being sworn in as 16th President of the United States. The speech was primarily addressed to the people of the South. It was intended to lay out Lincoln's intended policies and desires toward the South where seven states had formed the Confederate States of America. His speech was written in a spirit of friendship toward the seceded states. He touched on several points. Lincoln promised not to interfere with slavery in the states where it already existed. He said there would be no Federal hostility towards the states that had seceded for the time being. The Federal Government would “hold, occupy, and possess” its property. It would also collect its taxes. He closed his speech with the warning:\n\nBy 1863, two years into the war, Lincoln changed the focus of the war to slavery and issued the Emancipation Proclamation. The Proclamation made freeing the slaves a goal of the Civil War. It also weakened efforts within England and France to officially recognize the Confederacy. As Union troops advanced into Confederate territory, they freed thousands of slaves per day. Many did not wait, but fled their owners to claim their freedom. Five slave states (the Border States) had remained loyal to the Union and were not at war with the federal government. Thus, Lincoln did not have authority to free slaves in those states so this Proclamation was not applied to those states. The Proclamation also did not apply to Tennessee, nor to areas within Virginia and Louisiana which Union forces already controlled.\n\nPassed on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery in the United States. It also gave Congress the power to enforce the provisions.\n\nThe following Supreme Court decisions had to do with states' rights. Some were later overturned.\n\n\n", "id": "560347", "title": "States' rights"}

Others use a wider definition and include general-purpose programming languages that are interpreted, not compiled. \"General-purpose\" means it can be used in many ways for different things. Some general-purpose languages (such as Java) have variations that can be scripted (Javascript). There is no specific rule on what is, or is not, a scripting language.\n\nSome common examples of scripting languages:\n\nMost scripting languages are made to be easy to learn. They often can be either short files with source code, or entered one command at a time in a command line interface, which has a read–eval–print loop (REPL, language shell). This usually means a simple set of commands. There might not be functions or a \"main\", it just runs from start to finish. If something doesn't work, a programmer can make quick changes and run it again. This makes a scripting language good for making a \"rapid prototype\" to see if an idea works.\n\nFor example, most people do not call Java a scripting language, because of its lengthy syntax and rules about which classes exist in which files, and because Java cannot be executed interactively in a REPL. It needs files with source code, and they can only contain definitions that must be used by a host application or application launcher. (Java is not the same as JavaScript).\n\nBut Python allows choices - functions can be put in a file, it can be run without functions and use imperative programming style, or even use it interactively (type and run one line at a time).\n\ncodice_1\n\nThis one line of Python code prints \"Hello World\"; no \"main()\" function or anything else is needed.\n\nA scripting language is usually interpreted from source code or bytecode. However, something has to run the script (interpret it) so the computer understands it. This is an application, or something in the OS. That is often written in a compiled language and distributed in machine code form (as an \"executable\" that doesn't make sense to humans).\n\nScripting languages may be designed to be used by the people using a program — end-user development. Other times they may be built by programmers for their own use. Scripting languages often use abstraction, a form of information hiding. This means users do not need to know the details of variable types, data storage, and memory management.\n\nScripts are often made or changed by the person executing them, but some are shared or sold to others. For example, when large parts of games are written in a scripting language. Sometimes a script can be compiled before others use it. Once compiled, it will run faster and doesn't need another application to run it. And this prevents end users from changing the code.\n\nEarly mainframe computers (in the 1950s) were not interactive, but used scripts stored in \"batch files\". IBM's Job Control Language (JCL) is the common example of a scripting language used to control batch processing.\n\nThe first interactive shells were made in the 1960s to help remote operation of the first time-sharing systems. These used shell scripts, which can run computer programs within a computer program, the shell. Calvin Mooers in his TRAC language is generally given credit with inventing \"command substitution\". This lets commands change the script (self-modifying code). Multics calls these \"active functions\". \nLouis Pouzin wrote an early processor for command scripts called RUNCOM for CTSS around 1964. Stuart Madnick at MIT wrote a scripting language for IBM's CP/CMS in 1966. He originally called this processor COMMAND, later named EXEC. Multics included an offshoot of CTSS RUNCOM, also called RUNCOM. EXEC was eventually replaced by EXEC 2 and REXX.\n\nLanguages such as Tcl and Lua were made from the start to be general-purpose scripting languages that could be put into any application. Other languages such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) could do much of the same, but needed to work only with certain applications. Using a general-purpose scripting language instead of making a new language for each application usually makes it easier for both the person writing the application and the user writing the scripts.\n\nScripting is sometimes used to connect different applications. This is called glue code, and a language made just for this purpose is a \"glue language\". Pipelines and shell scripting are common examples of glue languages. But if a lot of logic is written in a script file, it is better to think of it as simply another software application, not \"glue\".\n\nGlue languages are especially useful for writing and maintaining:\n\nGlue language examples:\n\nDevices like programmable calculators may also have their own glue languages. For example, the Texas Instruments TI-92, by factory default can be programmed with a command script language. The TI-NSpire calculator understands the Lua language. Others understand some kind of Basic language, or maybe Lisp or something else.\n\nThis group has come from the automation of job control, which relates to starting and controlling the behavior of system programs, starting from IBM's JCL. Many of these languages' interpreters also work as command-line interpreters such as the Unix shell or the MS-DOS codice_2. Others, such as AppleScript offer the use of English-like commands to build scripts.\n\nWhen building graphical user interfaces, a way of testing it is needed. Specialized scripting languages were made to control graphic windows, menus, buttons, and so on just like a human user would. Many times, these can be used to copy exactly what a person does (moving a mouse, clicking or typing on a keyboard). This action or set of actions that is copied and remembered is called a macro.\n\nMany large applications include a scripting language built just for that application. The application can be a game or a business program. This type of language is made for a single application. They make look like a general-purpose language (e.g. QuakeC, modeled after C), they have custom features that distinguish them.\n\nThis is like an application-specific scripting languages, in that it controls an application, but the language can be used in many applications.\n\nJavaScript started as a language for scripting inside web browsers; but it is now a general-purpose embeddable language. It is also used in Adobe products for instance.\n\nSome languages shift from one type to another over time, usually as they add capability to do more things.\n\n", "id": "560430", "title": "Scripting language"}

She was partly of Italian origin. Her father was Baptist Bassano. He was a musician. He came from Venice. Her mother was Margaret Johnson. For some years she was in informal relation with Henry Carey. He was a cousin and chamberlain of the queen Elizabeth the Great. She got pregnant. She married her cousin Alphonso Lanyer, who was a musician like her father. In 1593 she gave birth to her son Henry who was named after his father, Henry Carey. In 1598 she gave birth to a daughter, Odillya, who lived for only ten months. The poet lived with her son's family. In 1623 he married Joyce Mansfield. Emilia Lanier had two grandchildren, Mary (born 1627) and Henry (born 1630).\n\nEmilia Lanier published her collection of poems in 1611. It contains pieces of religious poetry. They differ from each other in the field of poetic form. Emilia Lanier used many stanzas, build of six lines (rhymed ababcc), seven lines (ababacc or ababbcc that is rhyme royal) or eight lines (abababcc that is ottava rima).\n\nEmilia Lanier is considered to be the Dark Lady of William Shakespeare's sonnets.

As some bones join together, there are 206 bones in adulthood. The bones are at their stongest around age 20. The human skeleton can be divided into the \"axial skeleton\" and the \"appendicular skeleton\". The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs.\n\nThe human skeleton performs six major functions. These are: support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals, and endocrine regulation.\n\nThe male and female skeletons are not so different as those of many other primates. There are subtle differences between sexes in the morphology of the skull, teeth, long bones, and pelvis. In general, female skeletal elements tend to be smaller and less robust than corresponding male elements. \n\nThe human female pelvis is different from that of males in order to facilitate child-birth. The hips on a female are proportionately wider than males, and so the ball joints at the top of the legs are set more apart than in males. This, and the pelvic shape, gives a birth channel which allows the newborn foetus to pass through. The critical factor is the baby's head, which is much larger than in other primates.\n\nUnlike most primates, human males do not have penile bones. This is an adaptation to the human upright stance.\n\n", "id": "560552", "title": "Human skeleton"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560772", "text": "Dakota people\n\nThe Dakota people are a Native American tribe. They are also a part of the First Nations. They make up two of the three main subcultures of the Sioux people. They are usually divided into the Eastern Dakota and the Western Dakota.\n\nThe Eastern Dakota are also called the Santee, and are located in the eastern Dakotas, central Minnesota and northern Iowa. They have many federally recognized tribes.\n\nThe Western Dakota are also called the Yankton or Yanktonai, and are located in the Missouri River area. They also have many notable federally recognized tribes. They were often mistaken to be the Nakota (who are actually a group of tribes that broke away from the main branches of the Sioux nation in earlier times).\n\nThe Dakota lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota in the 17th century. By 1700 some had moved to present-day South Dakota. Late in the 17th century, the Dakota became alliances with French merchants. The French tried to use this alliance to help them control the North American fur trade against the English.\n\nIn the late 1850's, treaty violations by the United States and unfair payments by Indian agents (governmental people who were allowed to interact with the natives) led to increasing hunger and hardship among the Dakota. Even though the Dakota tried to negotiate with the U.S. government, nothing was successful. On 16 August 1862, a group of Dakota hunters killed a family of settlers. This led to more attacks on settlers, and soon a full war had begun. On 5 November 1862, 38 Dakota warriors were sentenced to death by hanging. This would later become the largest mass execution in U.S. history.\n\nDuring and after the revolt, many Eastern Dakota and their family left Minnesota and Eastern Dakota to go to Canada, or settle in the James River Valley in a short-lived reservation. They were then forced to move to the Crow Creek Reservation on the east bank of the Missouri river. Some joined the Western Dakota and moved further west to help the Lakota tribes to continue their fight against the U.S. military.\n\nOthers remained in Minnesota and the east, in small reservations that still exist, including Sisseton-Wahpeton, Flandreau, and Devils Lake (Spirit Lake or Fort Totten) Reservations in the Dakotas. Some moved to Nebraska, where the Santee Sioux Tribe today has a reservation on the south bank of the Missouri river.\n\nThose who fled to Canada left nine small reservations for their families in Manitoba (Sioux Valley, Long Plain, Dakota Tipi, Birdtail Creek, and Oak Lake [Pipestone]) and the four more (Standing Buffalo, Moose Woods [White Cap], Round Plain [Wahpeton], and Wood Mountain) in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Dakota language is part of the Siouan languages. People who speak Dakota can also understand the Lakota language. Dakota is written in the Latin script. The language has two major dialects between the Eastern and Western Dakota tribes.\n\n", "id": "560772", "title": "Dakota people"}

This was the beginning the American Civil War. President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for a period of 90 days. This was the amount of time he thought it would take to put down the rebellion. \n\nLincoln wrote the proclamation himself showing his lawyer's style of writing:\nThere was a great deal of tension over the issue of slavery in the Western territories during the presidency of James Buchanan (1857-61). People were taking sides in the issue as never before. When open war broke out in the Kansas Territory (called Bleeding Kansas), Southern slaveholders, Northern abolitionists and Free-soilers flooded into Kansas. Each was trying to influence the vote whether Kansas would join the Union as a slave state or a free state. President Buchanan sent part of the Regular Army to stop the violence but they were too few and too scattered to stop the fighting. \n\nThe abolitionist John Brown who played a part in Bleeding Kansas, seized the Harpers Ferry Armory in 1859. He intended to use the weapons to start a slave uprising in the South. Federal troops were called on to put down the outbreak and capture Brown. \n\nOn November 6, 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States. South Carolina seceded from the Union. Followed by six more Southern states, on February 18, 1861, at Montgomery, Alabama they formed the Confederate States of America. Their elected president, Jefferson Davis, called for 100,000 volunteers to serve for one year. In less than six weeks, other Southern states seceded. The Confederates seized federal property in the South including several military posts. The exceptions were Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina and Fort Pickens near Pensacola, Florida.\n\nWhen these seven states seceded, it caused a breakup in the U.S. Army. Many were from the South and felt they had a responsibility to resign from the U.S. Army and join the Confederate Army. In April of 1861, the United States Army had only 16,000 men organized into fewer than 200 companies. Most of them were at posts west of the Mississippi River. While the army was made up of trained professional soldiers, Lincoln realized he could not put down a rebellion of this size with the army he had.\n\nDuring the Colonial Period in North America, each colony had the right to summon all able-bodied white males to provide for the defense of that colony. Colonies had militia laws that required every able-bodied man to be available for militia duty and to provide his own arms. In 1774 and 1775, the British government, which now had a larger presence, attempted to disarm American colonists. This caused the colonists to form private militias, independent of any control by the governors who were appointed by the British government. The Minutemen who fought the British Army at the Battles of Lexington and Concord were an independent militia. The American colonies saw standing armies as tools of a despotic monarch. \n\nAfter the formation of the United States, the founding fathers saw state militias as the main force to defend the new country. They were controlled by the individual states and not by a central government. When the United States Constitution was ratified, it gave the federal government the right to raise a standing army but the feeling at the time was that such an army was to be kept small. This was the prevailing thought up to the 20th century. The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and other laws of 1792 gave the President the power to call out the state militias to put down rebellion and to fight against any foreign invaders. But, the call for militias had to be authorized by the state legislatures and the militias themselves could only serve for three months in any given year. \n\nDuring the War of 1812 militia units had the reputation of being poorly trained and poorly disciplined. Massachusetts and Connecticut refused to call out their militias during this time. Vermont would not allow its militia to serve outside of state borders. From 1815 until 1845, many of the Northern states did not require militia service by their citizens. The Mexican-American War was fought mainly by the regular army and volunteers served for one year terms of service. Very few state militias participated. By the 1840s, with no state laws requiring militia service in many states, the militias were replaced by voluneteer groups who served on weekends and provided their own weapons. In exchange for state-supplied weapons and uniforms, many agreed to become part of their respective state militias, especially in Northern states.\n\nState militias had several shortcomings. During the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, they developed a reputation as poor fighters and frequent deserters.\n\nWhen Lincoln called for 75,000 men for federal service, members of his cabinet had advised him to ask for as many as 200,000. Lincoln probably recognized the army did not have the arms or supplies to equip a larger number and settled for 75,000. This was still four times the size of the regular army. Each state was given a quota it had to meet based on its population. New York's quota was 17 regiments (13,280 men). Pennsylvania was to send 16 regiments. Other states were given their quotas as well. The states filled out their quotas quickly. Some states did not send any more than their quota required while other states sent more. Rhode Island sent four times their quota. Connecticut and Missouri each sent three times their quota. Massachusetts sent two and a half times their quota.\n\nAll the new officers and soldiers had to undergo military training. Officers spent their evenings learning tactics and other military matters from books and field manuals. Soldiers spent their days learning to drill and shoot their weapons. Many quickly found that military life was not as romantic as they had pictured it. None realized that training could be the difference between life and death on a battlefield. So training suffered, but the Confederate army had the same problems with their militia units. When the war started, both sides had to depend on their militias.\n\n", "id": "560804", "title": "President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers"}

In October 2017, Paul Heyman said Brock was challenging Goldberg because he was the one wrestler Brock could never beat. That month, Goldberg returned and agreed to fight Brock. \n\nTo start the match, Brock pushed Goldberg into the corner and rammed him between the ropes but Goldberg pushed him back hard and Brock fell back. When Brock got up, he took a spear from Goldberg.

From April 5, 2009 to August 16, 2010 it was made into one with the World Tag Team Championship until the other title was retired.\n\nAfter the Brand Extension in World Wrestling Entertainment, the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship became the only titles allowed to be fought for on both the Raw and SmackDown! brands, while the remaining titles were made where they could only be fought for on their own brands. Originally a part of the SmackDown brand after the company's first brand extension in the spring of 2002, the Tag Team Championship was moved to the Raw brand that following summer. The Tag Team Championship became apart of the Raw brand only, leaving the SmackDown! brand without a tag team title. As a result, SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon, introduced the new \"WWE Tag Team Championship\" and made it the tag team title for the SmackDown! brand. She stated that the first champions would be the winners of an eight-team tournament. On October 20, 2002, the team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit beat Rey Mysterio and Edge at No Mercy 2002 in the tournament final to become the first ever WWE Tag Team Champions. \nOn October 17, 2007, SmackDown! and ECW announced a talent sharing agreement that made it where talent from either brand's roster can compete on both brands. As a result, the title became to be fought for on both brands. In late 2008 through early 2009, WWE Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) engaged in rivalry with the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz, which resulted in the announcement on the March 17 edition of \"ECW\" that at WrestleMania XXV both teams would fight for their titles against each other and the winning team would hold both titles. \n\nThe result was the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship, a combination of the two titles though both were kept active by themselves (and thus keeping their own title histories), they were defended as one by one tag team. The champions could appear on and defend the titles on any WWE brand. Though eventually, on August 16, 2010, the World Tag Team Championship was retired in favor of continuing the history of the WWE Tag Team Championship following the introduction of new championship belts to then-champions David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd of The Hart Dynasty. The champions continued to compete on any brand until the end of the brand extension in August, 2011. However, WWE decided to bring back the brand split in July 2016. During the draft for this, the current champions, The New Day, were chosen to wrestle on Raw. This meant that SmackDown didn't have a tag team title. So, SmackDown's general manager Daniel Bryan and commissioner Shane McMahon created the SmackDown Tag Team championship. After this, the WWE Tag Team Championship was renamed the Raw Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe current champions are The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), who are in their second reign as a team. Individually, it is Big E's second reign, Kingston's fourth, and Woods' second. They defeated Los Matadores, The Lucha Dragons and then-champions The Prime Time Players in a Fatal 4-Way tag team match at SummerSlam on August 23, 2015. Woods is also recognized as the champion due to the Freebird Rule.\n\n", "id": "560815", "title": "WWE Raw Tag Team Championship"}

Its main function is to constantly supply fresh air, usually from the outside, while sending stale air back out. Fans and pumps, vent grates and air flow tunnels are common in these structures.\n\nThe simplest systems are called “natural ventilation,” which usually means that they get their airflow through vents opening to the outside. Mechanical systems are more popular for industry. Mechanical systems are able to regulate other things, including temperature, relative humidity, and oxygen levels.\n\nFresh air prevents issues like mold and bacteria growth, as well as the spread of disease. It helps eliminate dust, which can lead to cleaner living standards. Single rooms can sometimes be ventilated by opening a window or door, but this isn’t as successful for larger structures.\n\nVentilation usually collaborates with heating and cooling systems, but not always and they aren’t only limited to buildings. Vehicles frequently have ventilation systems that control air circulation and air quality.\n\nIn ancient Persia, structures called windcatchers were built to create natural ventilation.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=561033", "text": "African Americans in the American Civil War\n\nThe history of African Americans in The American Civil War includes the over four million slaves and approximately 500,000 free African Americans who were living in the United States at the beginning of the war. Alltogether they made up 14% of the population of the country. They served as soldiers in both the Union and Confederate Armies.\n\nSlavery began in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619. It started with the purchase of 20 Africans—not as reported by John Rolfe from a Dutch ship—but rather from an English warship named the \"White Lyon.\" The Colonists in the Virginia Colony bought the contracts of the Africans as indentured servants. Not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies. During the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became the most important crop. At this point slavery became a critical part of the South's economy. With westward expansion, the question of slavery in the new territories became a subject of great debate. It polarized the nation between the interests of the Northern industrial economy and the South's agricultural economy.\n\nThis led to the American Civil War. Millions of slaves were brought to America between the 17th and 19th centuries. Slavery was one of the main issues that led to the outbreak of the Civil War.\n\nThe United States Navy, during the Civil War termed the Union Navy, had separate traditions regarding African Americans. The Militia Acts of 1792 excluded black men from serving in the United States Army. This policy remained in place until the second year of the Civil War. The Navy, however, never had such a policy. In the 1840s they limited the number of blacks serving to 5 percent of the enlisted force. But before and after, black and white men served together often performing the same duties. Up to the start of the Civil War, several hundred black men were serving in the Navy. After Fort Sumter was captured by Confederates, a large number of men enlisted in the Navy. The percentage of black men in the Navy rapidly increased. In 1861, they made up about 6 percent of the force. By the summer of 1862 they made up about 15% of the enlisted men. \n\nMany of the African Americans who joined the Navy were from the East Coast of the United States. Many were experienced sailors. Others had worked on the docks and in other related jobs in the shipping industry. The largest number came from Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay area. Also, a large number were transferred from the Army to the Navy in 1864.\n\nAfrican Americans fought in every major campaign and naval battle of the Civil War. They served in the blockading squadrons on the South and Gulf Coasts and in the brown-water navy in the tributaries in the South. African American women served also, most as nurses aboard the \"USS Red Rover (1859)\", a hospital ship on the Mississippi River. African Americans served in the Navy with great distinction and eight were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest honor.\n\n Unfortunately, this was exactly what President Abraham Lincoln was did not want at the time. He was afraid that if he armed African Americans, especially escaped or former slaves, the border states would secede. This would only make the situation worse for the Union than it already was. But after two years of war, Lincoln began to reconsider the idea. The war was not going well for the North and they badly needed soldiers.\n\nThe Militia Act of 1862 allowed the army to use African Americans as laborers and soldiers for the first time since 1792. It did not invite blacks to join the Army but it did cause some blacks to form private militia units. In New Orleans three all-black Louisiana Native Guard units were formed (they later became the 73rd, 74th and 75th U.S. Colored Infantry). In Kansas the First Kansas Colored Infantry was formed (later officially becoming the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). They fought in a skirmish at Island Mound, Missouri in November 1862. The First South Carolina Infantry, African Descent, fought for the first time in November 1862 (later becoming the 33rd U.S. Colored Infantry). In January 1863, these unofficial units were allowed to become part of the Union Army.\n\nProbably the most famous unit was the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. In February 1863, Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew, issued the first call for for black soldiers in the North. Over 1,000 men joined, many from as far away as Canada and even the Caribbean. To lead them the governor chose Robert Gould Shaw, a young white officer. On July 18, 1863, they attacked Fort Wagner guarding the southern approach to Charleston Harbor. The 54th lost 600 men in the attack including Colonel Shaw—nearly half of the regiment. The fort was defended by 1,700 Confederates.\n\nBlack soldiers did not receive equal pay to the white soldiers. They also did not receive the same treatment. Their pay was $10 a month, less $3 for uniforms. White soldiers received $13 a month and had no deductions for uniforms. This was changed in June 1864 when Congress voted to grant black soldiers equal pay and made the change retroactive. While black soldiers were allowed to fight for their country, they were not treated as equals to white soldiers. Their units were racially segregated and were commanded by white officers. Some of their officers had very low opinions of black soldiers and did not train them well.\nCaptured black Union soldiers were a problem for the Confederacy. They could not treat them the same as captured white soldiers or they would be legitimizing them as being equal. It would also imply they accepted Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which they did not. Three days before the Emancipation Proclamation was to take effect, Jefferson Davis stated: “All negro slaves captured in arms be at once delivered over to the executive authorities of the respective States to which they belong.” The Congress of the Confederate States decided to take it a step further. They later adopted a resolution that any negroes taken in arms would be put on trial for \"inciting servile insurrection\" and would be punished by the death penalty.\n\nLincoln declared that “the law of nations … permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war.\" He stated that if the Confederacy executed any Union soldier, the Union would do the same to a Confederate soldier. If the Confederacy enslaved a Union soldier, a Confederate soldier would be put to hard labor. While Davis publicly denounced Lincoln's order, it did have the desired effect on black prisoners of war. No more were executed or sent into slavery. But, afterwards it depended on the commander of the Confederate units as to what to do about taking black prisoners. Many simply did not take prisoners of war but shot them as they were surrendering. This happened at the Battle of Poison Spring, the Battle of Fort Pillow and at the Siege of Petersburg.\n\nAfrican Americans did serve with the Confederacy. Some went with their masters or were used as labor behind the front lines. They also worked as teamsters and cooks. But for most of the war black men were not allowed to serve as soldiers.\n\nThere are, however, nine known photographs of African American men dressed in Confederate uniforms. But the photos do not come with explanations. Of the men in the photos, four are known by name and were slaves who went with their masters to the front lines. \n\nNear the end of the war the idea of using black soldiers was debated. In 1864, General Patrick Cleburne suggested enlisting black slaves into the army. The idea was considered, but it raised the question by at least one Southern politician: \"What did we go to war for, if not to protect our property?\" Another said: \"If slaves will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" General Robert E. Lee knew he needed soldiers. He stated: \"We must decide whether slavery shall be extinguished by our enemies and the slaves be used against us, or use them ourselves.\" Lee suggested the slaves be freed in exchange for their service as soldiers. But that condition was not in the bill that was approved by the Confederate Congress on March 13, 1865. Only a few thousand blacks enlisted before the war ended. By that time over 200,000 African Americans had served with the Union army.\n\n", "id": "561033", "title": "African Americans in the American Civil War"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=561179", "text": "History of the automobile\n\nThe early history of the automobile can be divided into a number of eras, based on method of propulsion. Later periods were defined by trends in exterior styling, size, and utility preferences. The question of who invented the first automobile depends on how you define the words \"automobile\" and \"invent\". The history of the automobile is rich and varied. It goes back to Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century who created early designs and models of transportation vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the period starts with the car made by Karl Benz in 1885. There were earlier inventions that used mainly steam-power to move the vehicles but the Benz car was the first to use a gasoline powered internal combustion engine in what could be called an automobile. The period goes up to the start of the production of Henry Ford's Model T.\n\nThis period dates from 1908 to 1914 and the beginning of World War I. While earlier designs were more ornamental, vehicles from this period are simpler and more affordable. It is the time when hundreds of smaller automobile manufacturers were trying to compete for attention and sales. A number of improvements were developed during this time. These include the electric ignition system, four-wheel brakes and the independent suspension. Transmissions were adopted. Along with throttle controls, these allowed the vehicles to travel at a number of speeds depending on conditions.\n\nFrom about 1920 to 1930, car manufacturers began creating a closed body on the vehicle. This protected the driver and passengers from the weather. Vehicles began using curved glass and the new enclosed bodies gave a sense of privacy. Heaters were added for comfort. Many of the features of modern cars came from this period. These include four-wheel drive, front-wheel drive, and hybrid electric vehicles. Safety glass protected those inside the car from sharp glass in cases of an accident. By the end of the 1920s cars were becoming faster and were showing a level of style and beauty.\n\nThe classic era began about 1930 during the Great Depression and ended just before World War II. The Great Depression was a time when many in the United States were just trying to survive. But it is also the era of some of the most significant improvements to the automobile. Cars took on a great deal of style and sophistication. They became works of art in many cases. \n\nMany new features were introduced during this era including the automatic transmission, the V-8, the V-12 and the V-16 engines. The gearshift lever moved to the steering column, hydraulic brakes were introduced for faster stopping and cars got trunks to carry luggage and cargo.\n\nThe car industry changed during the 1930s. It saw the rise of the Big Three automakers. These were General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. They were able to successfully design and sell cars during the Great Depression when fewer people could afford a new car. \n\nIn 1949, the automobile industry finally got back on its feet after World War II. This same year General Motors, Cadillac and Oldsmobile introduced the integrated one-piece automobile body. The process joined all the different parts of the body into one body shell. Cars produced during this period concentrated on safety. Cars were big during this time. But in the late 1960s carmakers tried to market much smaller cars. The attempts by General Motors, Chrysler and Ford were all marketing failures. Instead, what sold was the performance car. Cars like the Ford Mustang and the Plymouth Barracuda were very successful. During the late 1950s, many smaller countries began producing cars. Both India and Iran were making cars from about 1959. The first Indian car design from 1950 was very similar to the Opel Kapitän. The first Iranian cars were very similar to several American cars. Both were designed in the United Kingdom.\nThis period started about 1968 and continues to today. Body styles changed dramatically. The three most popular are the hatchback, the Minivan and the Sport utility vehicle (SUV). Starting in the Integration period, car manufacturers began designing cars for men while others are designed to attract women. The body shapes, colors and other cues are designed to appeal to a particular sex. \n\nToday, women tend to prefer crossovers more than men. Examples are the Kia Sportage and the Honda CR-V. Men seem to prefer powerful cars like the Chevrolet Camaro and the GMC Sierra pickup truck. In car colors, men seem to prefer brighter colors while more women seem to prefer traditional neutral colors.\n\n\n", "id": "561179", "title": "History of the automobile"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=561275", "text": "Fugitive slave laws\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Acts were two federal laws that concerned runaway slaves in the United States. The two acts were passed in 1793 and in 1850. They required federal involvement in catching runaway slaves in Northern States. The laws were designed to protect Southern slave owners. They required those states and jurisdictions to help in the capture and delivery of fugitive slaves. The laws were very unpopular in the North. They caused a great deal of resentment in the years leading up to the American Civil War.\n\nSlavery in America began in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619. It started with the purchase of 20 Africans from an English warship named the \"White Lyon.\" The Colonists in the Virginia Colony bought the contracts of the Africans as indentured servants. Not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies. During the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became the most important crop. At this point slavery became a critical part of the South's economy.\n\nThe issue of slavery caused difficulties for the United States almost from its beginning as a country. The framers of the Constitution used ambiguous language regarding the holding of slaves. Neither the word \"slave\" or \"slavery\" were used in the Constitution. The problem was in creating a democracy that ensured its citizens freedom while keeping a considerable part of the population in slavery without any freedoms.\n\nIn the United States, up to the 1860s, slaves and indentured servants were treated as personal property. They were subject to the property laws of the individual states. At first, most of the laws concerned indentured servants. But the laws began to differentiate between indentured servants and slaves around the middle of the 17th century. They also began to differentiate between races. People of African descent began to be held as slaves for life. \n\nMen and women slaves were generally treated the same under most state laws. However, some states had laws that applied only to women slaves. For example, Virginia passed laws punishing women who had children by their masters. They also confirmed the slave status of any children born of a \"Negro or mulatto women\". Great Britain had a structured system whereby children claimed their lineage through their father. This also applied to illegitimate children (parents were not married). Virginia was the first colony to change this. Slave children were considered the same race and status as the mother, even if the child was fathered by a white man. Laws concerning repe did not apply to black and Indian women. A slave woman could not defend herself against the attack by a white person. If she did, she was subject to beatings. While it was illegal to have relations with a slave woman, the laws were not usually enforced. This system increased the wealth of slave owners. They did not have to buy slaves if they could breed their own.\n\nSlaves, whether born into slavery or purchased as a slave, had no legal rights. The United States Supreme Court decision \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857) confirmed that slaves were not citizens of the United States nor of any state they reside in. In 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment overturned the Dred Scott decision.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance (1787) was an act of the Congress of the Confederation of the United States (before the United States Constitution). It created the Northwest Territory, the first organized territory of the United States. The Ordinance provided that the territory would be formed into \"not less than three nor more than five States\". \n\nThe territory was made up of lands beyond the Appalachian Mountains. It was south of British North America and the Great Lakes. It was north of the Ohio River. Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the new territory. However, it contained a provision that any fugitive slaves caught in the territory would be returned to their owners. It also did not place any restrictions on slavery within any new states formed from the Northwest Territory. Southerners had no problems with the ban on slavery. They thought that most of the new settlers would come from Southern states. Once a state was formed, the former Southerners would vote to allow slavery. However, none of the states formed from the Northwest Territory ended up allowing slavery.\n\nWhen the United States Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789, Article Four of the United States Constitution contained the Fugitive Slave Clause. It states:\nWhile Article IV, Section 2 of the United States Constitution did guarantee the right of slave owners to reclaim fugitive slaves. However, it did not set up the legal mechanism. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 passed by the second Congress added that mechanism. It authorized the arrest of runaway slaves and gave any magistrate of a town, city or county to rule on the arrest. The slave hunter only had to state the person captured was a runaway slave. No proof was required and there was no trial. It added a fine of $500 to any person who helped a runaway slave. It was passed in response to the rise of abolitionism in the North and also to the Underground Railroad that was set up to help slaves escape the South.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was a controversial part of the Compromise of 1850. The 1850 slave law added penalties for officials who did not arrest alleged runaway slaves. It fined them $1,000. Any law enforcement official was required to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave. All that was required was a persons sworn testimony of ownership. As before there was no trial and the suspect could not testify on their own behalf. Anyone who provided food or shelter to any suspected runaway slave was subject to six months in prison and a fine of $1,000. An officer who captured a runaway slave would get a bonus or a promotion. The 1850 law provided for special commissioners to decide if the alleged fugitive was to be returned to slavery. He received $10 if the fugitive was returned, but only $5 if the fugitive was freed. This amounted to a legal form of bribery. This caused a large number of free blacks to be sent into slavery.\n\nThe 1850 Fugitive Slave Law caused outrage in the Northern States. It caused thousands of Northerners to be convinced slavery should not be allowed in the western territories. Eight states in the North passed \"personal liberty\" laws. These prevented any official from helping to return a runaway slave. Southerners regarded these laws as being illegal attempts to prevent the return of their slaves. In the North, free black communities provided runaway slaves with sanctuary and hid them from the hired kidnappers searching for them. About 15,000 free blacks emigrated to Canada, the Caribbean and Africa after the 1850 law was passed.

His 1992 painting, \"The Singing Butler\", became a best-selling image in Britain.\n\nJack Vettriano grew up in the industrial seaside town of Methil, Fife. He was raised in poverty, and lived with his mother, father and older brother in a spartan miner’s cottage, sharing a bed with his brother and wearing hand-me-down clothes. From the age of 10, his father sent him out to earn money. His father took half his earnings. Vettriano left school at 16.\n\nMuch of his art education came from studying paintings at the Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nIt is fair to say that Vettriano is controversial. Professional art critics do not seem to like his work, but the public does. He is one of at least three modern British artists to make a great deal of money from his works.\n\nIn 1989 Vettriano had two canvases in the Royal Scottish Academy annual show. Both paintings sold on the first day and Vettriano was approached by several galleries. Further exhibitions followed in Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. In November 1999, Vettriano’s work was shown for the first time in New York City, when 21 paintings were displayed at The International 20th Century Arts Fair at The Armory. More than 40 collectors from the UK flew out for the event and 20 paintings were sold on the opening night.\n\nHis easel paintings cost between £48,000 and £195,000 new. According to \"The Guardian\" he earns £500,000 a year in print royalties. Vettriano's 1992 painting, \"The Singing Butler\", has been the best-selling image in Britain. On 21 April 2004 the original canvas of \"The Singing Butler\" sold at auction for £744,500. It had been rejected in 1992 by the Royal Academy summer exhibition.\n\nIn March 2010, \"Days Of Wine And Roses\" was opened by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond at the Kirkcaldy Museum. The exhibition then transferred to Vettriano's gallery in London.\n\nIn February 2011, it was announced that Vettriano's self-portrait \"The Weight\" would be displayed at the re-opened Scottish National Portrait Gallery from November 2011, the first time he had exhibited at a national gallery. Deputy director Nicola Kalinsky said Vettriano was \"a figure we have wanted on our wall for a while for obvious reasons\". First Minister, Alex Salmond said of Vettriano, \"He is a wonderful artist of considerable talent and achievement and this is a magnificent tribute to the special place he holds in the hearts of people in Scotland.\"\n\nIn September 2013, a major retrospective of Vettriano's work opened at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. 'Jack Vettriano: A Retrospective' ran until 23 February 2014 and featured over 100 works.\n\n", "id": "561314", "title": "Jack Vettriano"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=561390", "text": "Slave Power\n\nSlave Power, also called the Slave Power conspiracy and Slaveocracy, was a term first coined by abolitionists in 1839 and was in common use by the 1850s. It referred to the economic, social and political influence held by slaveholders in the South. Southern slaveholders had a great deal power in Congress and many other federal offices up to and including the presidency. This is in spite of the fact they made up only a small minority of the population of the nation. These few very powerful men used their influence to maintain the institution of slavery. The fear in the North was that the slave power conspiracy intended to not only to spread slavery to the Western territories but to all the states in the North.\n\nSlavery in America began in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619. It started with the purchase of 20 Africans from an English warship named the \"White Lyon.\" The Colonists in the Virginia Colony bought the contracts of the Africans as indentured servants. Not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies. During the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became the most important crop. At this point slavery became a critical part of the South's economy.\n\nBy the late 1850s, there was a widespread belief that a slaveholding oligarchy ran the country. That they ran it for their own benefit to spread slavery was also a popular belief. It was what Abraham Lincoln and the new Republican Party used to gain political power. It was also popular among conspiracy theorists, which pro-slavery opponents tried to use to discredit the idea. But it was members of the Free Soil Party in the 1840s and the Republicans in the 1850s that gave Slave Power its credibility. On March 12, 1857, the Cincinnati Daily Commercial published an article about Slave Power. The article called the United States \"one great homogeneous slave-holding community\" and that slavery had removed all state boundaries. It charged that Slave Power had three objectives. These were: to reopen the slave trade; to extend slavery to the entire country and beyond; and to make the white man a slave to the slave-holding Southern aristocracy and the Northern capitalists.\n\nAfter 1850, Southern slaveholders had been lobbying for the reopening of the slave trade. So that charge seemed valid. Abolitionists had ample evidence Slave Power wanted to extend slavery to all the states and even the hemisphere. The third claim, that white men would become slaves to the Slave Power was harder to prove even though many believed it was true. \n\nThose who defended slavery had a number of arguments to justify the institution. They said it would destroy the economy of the South. Without slave labor they could not raise cotton, tobacco or rice. Freeing the slaves would cause widespread unemployment, it would lead to uprisings, bloodshed and complete chaos. They pointed to the French Revolution as an example. They pointed out slavery had existed all through history. It was in the Bible and even Abraham had slaves. Their legal argument pointed to the Supreme Court of the United States who decided in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857) that blacks were not citizens but were property.\n\nSouthern plantations could be extremely profitable. Sources differ as to just how profitable they were. According to one source, between 1770–1860, land was abundant and easy to obtain making it virtually worthless by itself. It was hard to get rich by just owning land. The Southern elite got very wealthy by owning the labor force that produced the crops on the land. The value of the slaves themselves equaled between one and two years of the entire national income of the United States. When you consider that only a small minority held slaves and that it was limited to the Southern United States, slaves were the real wealth.\n\nA study by Alfred Conrad and John Meyer computed the rate of return for \"slave capital\". They calculated that slave ownership was at least equal to other forms of investments and higher than most. Slave ownership alone could return as high as 13% per year while railroad bonds would return 6–8%. \n\nThe slave trade was banned in the United States after January 1, 1808. Slave ownership was still legal, but no more African slaves could be brought into the country. Until that time slave traders had become very wealthy by transporting slaves.\n\nExamples of the enormous wealth of Southern slave owners includes Joshua John Ward of Georgetown County, South Carolina. He owned 1,130 slaves and controlled six large plantations. In 1850, he grew of rice earning his nickname as the \"King of the Rice Planters\". Another was Stephen Duncan. He was the wealthiest cotton planter before the Civil War. Over his lifetime he owned more than 2,000 slaves. He owned 15 plantations, the largest one used 858 slaves.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was a large political concession given to the South. It created a new commission that acted similar to the United States Marshals Service but with several differences. They were paid a reward by the federal government for each slave (or those who were claimed to be slaves) that was captured. They quickly became the largest federal employer at the time. The new act was anything but pro-States' rights as Northern state laws were ignored. There was no due process of law. In short, the Fugitive Slave act gave Southern states the power over the laws of Northern states by using the federal government to do their bidding.\n\nThe Act of 1850 alarmed Northerners both black and white. Free blacks had much to fear about being kidnapped and finding themselves a captive slave in the South. Northern whites were alarmed because their communities were being assaulted by slave hunters. Northerners saw this as proof positive of a Slave Power conspiracy that was threatening their liberty.\n\nNorthern Free-Soilers and Republicans had their differences. But one thing they agreed on was they both opposed slavery expanding to the territories. Both opposed the Southern planters who they called \"slave oligarchs\". Together they had an advantage over earlier attempts by political parties to oppose slavery. Earlier, Northern politicians had to go easy on slavery issues because they needed the political power of the Southerners to win national elections. For that reason they supported slaveholding presidents, congressmen and senators. But the Republicans and Free-Soilers did not need to please the Southern politicians and they attacked their power at every opportunity. They brought up old arguments that Slave Power had too long held power in American politics. That argument was used when Thomas Jefferson had been elected president. It came up when Missouri was admitted as a slave state in 1820 and again in 1845 when Texas was annexed. This time the Republicans hammered the idea hard. It hurt Northern Democrats the most. Republicans won many offices in the North that had been held by Democrats for decades. In the 1860 election, the Democrats split between North and South with each supporting their own candidate. This allowed Lincoln to win even though he did not have a majority. This ended the Slave Power dominance in politics and was a contributing factor to the American Civil War.\n\nMost Antebellum Period presidents were not only from the South, but also owned slaves themselves. Many figured prominently in maintaining the economics of slavery. One reason for so many Southern presidents is that they benefited from the electoral college advantage they held, especially those from the largest slaveholding state, Virginia. In the Constitutional Convention (1787) delegates from Northern states did not want slaves counted as each being one person for the purposes of a state's representation in Congress. Southern delegates wanted slaves to count as individuals even though they could not vote. The delegates finally arrived at the Three-Fifths Compromise. In Article I, section 2 of the United States Constitution, calling slaves by the euphemism \"all other persons\", the founders counted each slave as three-fifths of a person. This gave slave states one-third more seats in Congress than they would otherwise have based on the number of citizens they had. This factor was decisive in the 1800 presidential election giving Thomas Jefferson the win by the House of Representatives. \n\nOne of the key reasons Washington, D.C. was selected as the United States Capitol was that it located around a slave town, Alexandria, Virginia. New York City was in a free state and in Philadelphia a slave could only be kept for six months before being freed. This was inconvenient for slave owning politicians. Also, Washington D.C. was promoted by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison—three key Southerners who owned slaves. \n<br>\n", "id": "561390", "title": "Slave Power"}

He is a Canada Research Chair Professor in mathematics at the University of Toronto, and a senior director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in Paris.\n\nTodorčević was born at Ubovića Brdo, Bosnia and Herzegovina where he lived until the second grade of primary school. After, his family moved to Banatsko Novo Selo where he finished primary school. He enrolled \"Uroš Predić\" grammar school in Pančevo. He demonstrated his talent and affinity toward mathematics in the third and forth years of the grammar school. After finishing grammar school he enrolled Faculty of Science, Belgrade University, where he studied pure mathematics. During his undergraduate studies he attended Đuro Kurepa's advanced mathematical classes. In 1978 he enrolled graduate studies. Kurepa validated Todorčević's master thesis as good enough to be accepted as a doctoral thesis. Regardless, Todorčević wrote his doctoral thesis in 1979 with Kurepa as his advisory. In his address, preceding the oral defense of the doctoral thesis, Kurepa stressed that he was not able to find external readers of the Stevo's doctoral thesis in Yugoslavia, capable of fully understanding and evaluating Stevo's work, and turned to two university professors from England. Kurepa added that Stevo's talent was a miracle and that Stevo was the most talented out of the 40 Ph.D. students he advised in the past.\n\nAccording to the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques, the Fields Institute and the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences announcement, as of December 14, 2014,his work is recognized for its striking originality and technical brilliance. He was an invited speaker at the 1998 ICM in Berlin for his discovery and work on rho-functions. He made major contributions to the study of S- and L-spaces in topology, proved a remarkable classification theorem for transitive relations on the first uncountable ordinal, made a deep study of compact subsets of the Baire class 1 functions thus continuing work of Bourgain, Fremlin, Talagrand, and others in Banach space theory. Together with P. Larson he completed the solution of Katetov’s old compact spaces metrization problem. Among the most striking recent accomplishments of Todorčević (and co-authors) are major contributions to the von Neumann and Maharam problems on Boolean algebras, the theory of non-separable Banach spaces, including the solution of an old problem of Davis and Johnson, the solution of a long-standing problem of Laver, and the development of a duality theory relating finite Ramsey theory and topological dynamics.\n\nFurther, Todorčević is known for his the side-condition method in set-theoretic Forcing, the invention and development of walks on ordinals and their characteristics, and other research that bridge between different areas of mathematics.\nTodorčević's first recognized contribution to Set theory was given in his 1978 Master’s Thesis. He constructed a model of formula_1 in a way to allow him to make the continuum any regular cardinal and derived a variety of topological consequences of formula_2 Here formula_3 is an abbreviation for Martin's Axiom and formula_4– for weak Kurepa Hypothesis.\n\nTodorčević earned his doctoral degree in 1979 at the University of Belgrade with Đuro Kurepa as advisor and Keith Devlin as outside reader. Devlin attended the defense; he encouraged Todorčević to visit Jerusalem where he attended Saharon Shelah's lectures on forcing.\n\nIn the July–August 1980 Todorčević attended the six-week summer school called Settop held in Toronto. At the conference, Todorčević along with Abraham had proved the existence of rigid Aronszajn trees and the consistency of formula_5 + there exists a first countable formula_6-space. formula_7 is an abbreviation for the Continuum Hypotesis.\n\nHe gave a survey of work on trees from combinatorial and set-theoretic perspectives, in the 1980s., and continued this work on exploring consistent possibilities for various types of trees, looking for results for trees on multiple cardinals, or with required or forbidden types of subtrees. The elegance of his presentation drew a wide audience for this work.\n\nAs to the partition calculus in 1980’s, \"Todorčević proved a startling square bracket partition result for the uncountable and introduced new technology whose ramifications are still unfolding, and proved a stepping up lemma for negative square bracket partition relations.\"\n\nTodorčević was a Miller Research Fellow in Berkeley from 1983 to 1985. In the 1985/6 academic year, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nFor his proof of the partition relation formula_8, Todorčević earned explicit appreciations. Paul Erdös wrote, \"This certainly is an unexpected and sensational result.\" and Jean A. Larson added, \"... (it) was a wonderful shock that introduced a wide audience to the walks on ordinals and the oscillation function.\" Todorčević obtained this partition relation in September 1984, while lecturing on it in the Berkeley seminar, wrote up the notes of his lectures and circulated them in January 1985 and published the result later, in 1987. The walks on ordinals method Todorčević devised in May 1984 when he came up with a new proof of the existence of a Countryman line. \n\nIn order to establish this partition relation, Todorčević discovered an entirely new mathematical object called rho functions. Sierpinski in 1933 coloured the edges of the complete graph formula_9 whose vertices are the elements of the smallest uncountable cardinal number. He coloured the edges of formula_9 with 2 colours in such a way that each colour appears on some edge of any uncountable subgraph of formula_9. Galvin and Shelah in 1980s had increased the number of colours from 2 to 3. Improving 3 to 4 seemed beyond any available methods. Todorčević used his newly discovered rho functions to increase the colours not just to 4, but all the way up to the smallest uncountable cardinal, which is the maximum conceivable number. This was one of the results for which he was invited to the Berlin ICM.\n\nThe discovery of rho functions (and the various applications they have found), an entirely new mathematical object, one out of the five in Set theory in the twentieth century, is celebrated as a major advance in understanding of mathematics and an extended period of exciting progress. \n\nIn 1989 Todorčević published a monograph, \"Partition Problems in Topology\". He wrote that proof techniques developed for solving\nthe S-space problem and the L-space problem turn out to be useful in many other problems in general topology, writing \"this is so because Ramsey-type theorems are basic and so much needed in many parts of mathematics and (S) and (L) happen to be Ramsey-type properties of the uncountable most often needed by the topologist\".\n\nHe became a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts as of 1991 and a full member of the Academy in 2009.\n\nHe was invited to deliver the Tarski Lectures in 2014.\n\nTodorčević is the Royal Society of Canada fellow.

By 64 BC, after nearly two centuries of independent rule, those struggling for the Judean crown asked Emperor Pompey the Great to decide. Pompey stepped in and made Judea a client state. It briefly became a procuratorship between 41 and 44 AD under King Herod Agrippa. After his death it was returned to a province again. It was the scene of several wars called the Jewish–Roman wars. In 70 AD it was the scene of the Great Jewish Revolt resulting in the institution of the Fiscus Judaicus.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=561770", "text": "Blockade runners of the American Civil War\n\nThe blockade runners of the American Civil War were specially outfitted Confederate ships designed to slip through the blockade of Southern by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. On April 19, 1861, one week after Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, President Abraham Lincoln ordered the blockade. In response, the Confederacy used small fast ships known as blockade runners. During the first two years of the Civil War, the blockade had very limited success. As many as two out of every three ships entering or leaving Southern ports were successful. The Union Navy had to patrol nearly 3,500 miles of seashore along the Atlantic and Gulf coastlines. But as the Union built more ships, the blockade became more effective. As few as 25% of blockade runners were successful later in the war. \n\nThe blockade was part of General Winfield Scott's Anaconda Plan to put economic pressure on the Confederacy until it returned to the Union. It was the most ambitious blockade ever attempted in world history. In 1861, the Confederate states had little manufacturing compared to the North. They did not have the capacity to make the weapons and ammunition they needed to wage a war. What they did have was cotton, which was highly profitable because they used slave labor. At the time, the South supplied cotton to both England and France for use in their textile mills. The South needed to export cotton to Europe and import arms and food for its army in return. A successful blockade could severely damage the Confederate government's ability to continue fighting.\n\nPresident Lincoln issued two proclamations regarding the blockade. On April 19, he declared a blockade of the Southern ports from South Carolina to Texas. On April 27, he issued a second proclamation, extending the blockade to include Virginia and North Carolina. It read:\nThe proclamation raised an immediate question of whether the action by the seceding states was a rebellion or a war. Legally, based on the United States Constitution it was an armed insurrection \"levying war against the United States\" which made them guilty of treason. But, in dealing with foreign governments, the U.S. always treated the Confederates as rebels and not belligerents at war with the United States.\n\nLincoln knew very well the importance of semantics. He treated the act of secession as an act of rebellion against the democratic self-government of a state. In his view a minority of people had taken over the governments in the South because they did not like the way the 1860 presidential election had turned out. This act defied a main principle of democracy, which is a freely elected government. Lincoln stated \"It is now for [us] to demonstrate to the world, that those who can fairly carry an election, can also suppress a rebellion.\"\n\nWhen Lincoln ordered the blockade, the United States Navy had fewer than 9,000 men. By the end of 1861 it had increased to 24,000 men. The blockade was made up of squadrons of ships set up at different points along the Southern coast line. Each group was responsible to monitor a particular area. Two early victories aided the blockade. In April 1862, Union forces captured Fort Pulaski and Savannah, Georgia. A few weeks later New Orleans was captured. In August of 1865, Mobile, Alabama, the last Confederate port in the Gulf of Mexico fell to Union forces.\n\nAt first, blockade running was done by ships of all sizes. The most successful were the steamboat that were put out of work when the war broke out. They could hug the coast and haul their cargoes of cotton to Cuba or The Bahamas and bring back items of lesser value. This collection of mostly small boats worked well at first when the Union Navy could not effectively guard all areas of the coast. So they did not need to be fast or stealthy and the work was fairly easy. The captains knew the coast very well which allowed them to avoid the warships. Cotton is gathered in September and shipped during the winter and spring. When the blockade went into effect in April 1961, most of that year's cotton had already been shipped. Only about one-seventh remained for the smaller ships to haul. The 1860 cotton crop had been huge and there was no shortage of cotton either in the Northern states or in England. So there were no great profits to be made or money available to buy war supplies. This worked in favor of the Union even though the blockade was not that effective yet. Still, the blockade runners could make a fair profit, but not nearly as much as later in the war.\n\nAs the war progressed and more Union warships became available for the blockade and the number of available ports became fewer and fewer. But blockade running became more specialized. In 1863, 199 blockade runners arrived in Confederate ports. In 1864 the number grew to 244. In 1865, by the end of the war another 30 had successfully carried their cargoes to Southern ports. More and more this depended on a very special type of ship. They were steamers, built for speed, they had large cargo capacities and had a very low silhouette making them harder to see at a distance. The work was dangerous but a successful trip could gain enormous profits for the crews. They became the South's main outlet for trade with Europe. Without them the Confederacy could not have lasted as long as they did. Risking war with the United States, England secretly built several blockade runners for the South. \n\n", "id": "561770", "title": "Blockade runners of the American Civil War"}

On 25 September 1066, an English army under King Harold Godwinson fought an invading Norwegian army led by King Harald Hardrada. The English king's brother Tostig Godwinson, joined Hardrada's forces. After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with a large number of the Norwegians were killed. Godwinson's achieved a complete victory. This battle marks the end of the Viking Age in England. Less than three weeks later, Godwinson's English army was defeated by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. \n\nKing Edward the Confessor of England died in January 1066 without leaving an heir. This caused a struggle over who would be king after him. A number of claimants from across northwestern Europe each thought they should be the next king. These included the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" the Norwegians assembled a fleet of 300 ships to invade England. The Norwegian army numbered about 11,000 men. Arriving off the English coast in September, Hardrada was joined by forces recruited in Flanders and Scotland by Tostig Godwinson. Tostig was angry with his older brother Harold (who had been elected king by the Witan on the death of Edward). He lost his position as Earl of Northumbria and was exiled in 1065. Tostig had mounted a series of attacks on the Sussex coast England in the spring of 1066. The king believed Tostig's raid on the coast was a sign that William, the Duke of Normandy, was about to invade England.\n\nIn the late summer of 1066, the Norwegian-led invaders sailed up the Humber River, then the Ouse before advancing on York. When they landed at Riccall, this was when Godwinson first learned of their invasion. On 20 September they defeated a northern English army led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and his brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, at the Battle of Fulford. Following this victory they received the surrender of York. They briefly occupied the city and took hostages and supplies from the city. Then they returned to their ships at Riccall. Hardrada offered peace to the Northumbrians in exchange for their support for his bid for the throne. Then he demanded more hostages from all of Yorkshire.\n\nAt this time Godwinson was in Southern England. He was waiting for an invasion from France by the Duke of Normandy. Duke William was another contender for the English throne. Learning of the Norwegian invasion, Godwinson headed north at great speed with his houscarls and as many thegns as he could gather. He made the journey from London to Yorkshire, a distance of about 190 miles, in only four days. Godwinson learned that the Northumbrians had been ordered to send the additional hostages and supplies to the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge. Godwinson hurried on through York to attack them at this place on 25 September. Until the English army came into view, the invaders did not even know there was an English army anywhere in the vicinity.\n\nNo one is certain of the exact location of the battle. There is no abbey, wikt:marker or cross to mark the place. However, an area southwest of the town called \"battle flats\" may be the actual location of the battle. The Vikings were taken completely by surprise. They were resting in the heat of the day. Hardrada was confident enough that he left one-third of the Viking forces, along with much of the army's armor, at their camp at Riccall. As the English army attacked downhill many of the Vikings were completely unprepared. The main part of the Viking army was on the other side of the bridge. A small Viking force held the approach to the bridge but they were quickly swept aside. According to legend, a single Viking warrior held the narrow bridge against the English for a time. He killed about 40 English warriors before he was killed.\n\nIn the fierce fighting that followed, both Hardrada and Tostig were killed. Most of the Vikings at the bridge were killed. Out of the original fleet of 300 ships, there were only enough men left to man 24 ships on the return to Norway. It has been said that before fighting started, Godwinson offered to return his brother's earldom if he would change sides. But Tostig flatly refused.\n\nStamford Bridge was a major victory for Godwinson. It showed he was a very capable commander. It also demonstrated how well trained his Housecarls were. But Stamford Bridge will always be overshadowed by the Battle of Hastings which took place just under three weeks later. The battle at Stamford Bridge left Godwinson's army very tired and in need of rest. He had lost the forces of his two Earls from the earlier battle. But he received news that Duke William had landed. He quickly marched his tired army down to London, stopping at Waltham Abbey long enough to pray for another victory. On October 12 he was in London trying to find more soldiers to add to his army before facing William at Hastings. On October 14, Godwinson formed his army on the ridge looking down on the battlefield. This started the Battle of Hastings and the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England.\n\n", "id": "561862", "title": "Battle of Stamford Bridge"}

He was a British mathematician, university professor, and author. \n\nAfter the war he moved to the US, and later took American citizenship.\n\nWelchman was one of four early recruits to Bletchley park (the others being Alan Turing, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry). They were also the four signatories to the letter to Winston Churchill in October 1941, asking for more resources for the code-breaking work at Bletchley Park. Churchill responded with one of his 'Action This Day' written comments. \n\nWelchman's main work at Bletchley was \"traffic analysis\" of encrypted German communications. This is, first, looking for an increase in signals. Major events in warfare are signalled in advance by a huge increase in messages. Second, there are standardized parts of a message, such as message origination, message destination, time/date information, and so on. These are much easier to decipher than the actual message content. Welchman developed this approach. Today we describe this as \"meta-data\" analysis.\n\nWelchman helped improve Alan Turing's design of the Polish electromechanical Enigma-cipher-breaking machine, the bombe. Welchman's 'diagonal board', made the device much more efficient in the attack on the ciphers of the German Enigma machine. Bombes became the main mechanical aid in breaking Enigma ciphers during the war. They speeded up the search for current wheel order settings being used with the Enigma machines. The settings were changed often, initially at least once per day.\n\nWelchman was initially head of Hut Six, the section at Bletchley Park responsible for breaking German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers. During his time at Bletchley, Welchman opposed engineer Tommy Flowers' efforts on the Colossus computer (the world's first programmable electronic computer) because Colossus used vacuum tubes.\n\nIn 1943, he became Assistant Director in charge of mechanisation and also had responsibility for cryptographic liaison with the US.\n\nWelchman moved to the United States in 1948 where he taught the first computer course at MIT in the United States. He followed this by employment with Remington Rand and Ferranti. Welchman became a naturalised American citizen in 1962. In that year, he joined the MITRE Corporation, working on secure communications systems for the US military. He retired in 1971 but was retained as a consultant.\n\nIn 1982 his book \"The Hut Six Story\" was published, initially by McGraw-Hill in the US and by Allen Lane in Britain. The British Secret Service objected, and so did the National Security Agency. The book was not banned but Welchman lost his security clearance (and therefore his consultancy with MITRE). He was forbidden to discuss with the media either the book or his wartime work.\n\nWelchman died in 1985; his final conclusions and corrections to the story of wartime code breaking were published posthumously in 1986 in the paper 'From Polish Bomba to British Bombe: the birth of Ultra' in \"Intelligence & National Security\", Vol 1, No l. The entire paper was included in the revised edition of \"The Hut Six Story\" published in 1997 by M & M Baldwin.\n", "id": "562244", "title": "Gordon Welchman"}

The Boieng of SVA763 lost its control and went into a descending spiral motion towars the ground and hit the ground at 1135 kmph.The Ilyushin remained structurally intact as it went in a steady but rapid and uncontrolled descent until it crashed in a field.In the end, all 312 people on board SVA763 and all 37 people on KZA1907 were killed.\n\nThe collision took place about west of Delhi. The wreckage of the Saudi aircraft crashed near Dhani village, Bhiwani District, Haryana. The wreckage of the Kazakh aircraft hit the ground near Birohar village, Rohtak District, Haryana.\n\nThe crash was investigated by the Lahoti Commission, headed by then-Delhi High Court judge Ramesh Chandra Lahoti.The flight data recorders were decoded by Kazakhstan Airlines and Saudi Airlines under the supervision of air crash investigators in Moscow and Farnborough, England, respectively.\nThe commission determined that the accident had been the fault of the Kazakh Il-76 commander, who had descended from the assigned altitude of and subsequently and even lower. The report says that the cause of this serious problem in operating procedure is due to the lack of English language skills on the part of the Kazakh aircraft pilots; they were depended entirely on their radio operator for communications with the ATC.\n\nJust a few seconds from impact, the Kazakh plane climbed slightly and the two planes collided. This was because the radio operator of Kazakhstan 1907 discovered only then that they were not at 15,000 feet and asked the pilot to climb.The tail of the Kazakh plane clipped the left wing of the Saudi jet, severing both parts from their respective planes. \n\nThe disaster was again the subject of an episode in the documentary series \"Mayday (TV series)\" on 2 March 2009 entitled \"Sight Unseen\", in a wide-screen format with sophisticated computer animations on National Geographic Channel.\n", "id": "562263", "title": "Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562301", "text": "Confederate States Navy\n\nThe Navy of the Confederate States (CSN) was the Navy of the Confederate States of America. After the Confederacy established itself in 1861, the elected president, Jefferson Davis appointed Stephen Mallory as his Secretary of the Confederate Navy. At the time the South had no ships capable of challenging the United States Navy's frigates. It did not have the shipbuilding capability or the raw materials necessary to build a navy. While they had limited resources, and did not have the firepower of the Union Navy, they developed a number of technologies. The Confederates developed naval mines, ironclad techniques and managed to sink a Union warship with a working submarine. \n\nThe Republican Party, led by Abraham Lincoln, won the 1860 presidential election. Southerners were outraged by the election of Lincoln, who opposed slavery in territories and new states. After the election seven Southern states seceded and declared their independence from the Union. They formed the Confederate States of America, even before Lincoln became president on March 4, 1861. The outgoing U.S. president, James Buchanan, said this was against the law, but did nothing to stop them. Lincoln and his Republican party treated this secession as a rebellion.\n\nFighting started when the Confederates bombarded Fort Sumter, a Union Army fort. Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for a period of 90 days. He also set up a blockade of the Southern coast and ports. Lincoln had no more than 40 usable warships and needed to start building up his Navy. This was to prevent the South from exporting its cotton and importing the war materials they needed to wage war. The North also needed to develop a fleet of gunboats for a \"brown-water navy\". This was to support the Union Army in operations around major rivers like the Mississippi.\n\nIn 1861, Virginia joined the Confederate States of America. Fearing that the Confederacy would take control of the facility, the shipyard commander Charles Stewart McCauley ordered the burning of the shipyard. At the time it was called the Gosport Navy Yard. Despite conflicting orders from the Secretary of the Navy, the resignation of many of his officers, and most of his yard workers leaving, his remaining men began destroying the shipyard. Ships that could not leave on their own were burned. This included the Union warship \"USS \"Merrimack\"\". Finally the two men who were placing explosives to blow up the dry dock were captured before they could finish their work. The Confederates were able to repair Gosport and make it a working shipyard again.\n\nThe capture of the shipyard allowed a tremendous amount of war material to fall into Confederate hands. In all, 1,195 heavy guns were taken and used by the Confederacy. They were used in many areas from Hampton Roads all the way to Fort Donelson Tennessee. When they left the shipyard, the Union forces withdrew to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. This was the only land in the area which remained under Union control. \n\nIn early 1862, the Confederate ironclad warship CSS \"Virginia\" was rebuilt using the burned-out hulk of the \"USS Merimack\". In the haste to abandon the shipyard, the \"Merrimack\" had only been destroyed above the waterline. The Confederates built an armored superstructure over the burned out hull. In March and April of 1862 the Confederate ironclad came close to upsetting the Union Navy's superiority. At Hampton Roads, the \"Virginia\" began sinking the blockading Union warships almost at will. The fleet was saved by the arrival of the Union ironclad \"USS Monitor\" which engaged the Virginia at the Battle of Hampton Roads. But after hours of fighting neither ship was able to defeat the other. Both ships left the fight claiming the victory. But the Confederates failed to break the blockade. When Norfolk fell in May 1862, the CSS \"Virginia\" was destroyed by its crew so it wouldn't be captured. The Confederate Navy had two more ironclads under construction. But before they could be completed the Union fleet captured the port and city of New Orleans where they were being built.\n\nThe Confederate Navy realized the Union Navy had more ships, guns and men they had with their limited resources. This called for a change in strategy. First, they would build forts to guard their key rivers and ports. They would build gunboats to assist this effort. Secondly, the South set up a fleet of naval vessels to attack Union merchant ships at sea. They also commissioned privateers to help with this effort.\n\nThis was not a new concept. The Americans had been successful using commerce raiding against British merchant ships during the American Revolutionary War. Outgunned by the Union Navy they realized building lighter and faster cruisers would allow them to outrun the larger warships and go after the slower and usually unarmed merchant ships. Because the South had little shipbuilding capacity, they had these ships built in Great Britain. This was technically illegal, since Great Britain was a neutral country. So these ships had to be built in secret.\nSome the more successful and famous of the Confederate commerce raiders were:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Confederacy also issued a Letter of marque to any private ship captain who wanted to make a profit raiding United States merchant vessels. At first the risk was low and they kept the ship and its cargo much the same as pirates did. The the owner and crew divided up the large profits. They avoided doing battle with Union warships and were usually fast enough to outrun them.\n\nThere was only one problem with the scheme. In the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law signed in 1865, privateering was outlawed. All privateers were considered pirates and were subject to the death penalty when they were captured. Even though the United States had not signed the agreement, President Lincoln declared Confederate privateers were pirates and pirates were subject to death. This didn't stop a number of enterprising Southerners from outfitting a ship and getting involved in piracy on the high seas. One of the first ships seized actually hurt the South. It was a cargo of fruit going to the port of New Orleans.\n\nSoon the illegal privateers were taking cargo ships in the Gulf of Mexico and all up and down the East Coast of the United States. An early Union victory was the capture of the \"CSS Savannah\" which had just been out to sea two days. The crew quickly found themselves on trial for piracy. The Confederacy threatened to hang captured Northern seamen if the crew was executed. In the end, the Union court dropped the charges of piracy and held the crew as prisoners of war. The crew was later traded in a prisoner exchange.\n\nA modern torpedo is a cigar-shaped, self-propelled, underwater explosive device designed to destroy another ship or submarine. During the Civil War, what was then called a torpedo would be best described as a naval mine.Confederate president Davis was opposed to their use. He thought they were cowardly weapons and it was unethical to use them against anyone. Despite Davis' objections, the Congress of the Confederate States passed a law authorizing rewards for anyone inventing new ways to blow up enemy vessels using submersibles and mines.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri Confederates were hiding explosives in the firewood used to fuel the boilers of Union steamships on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. In 1861, Matthew Fontaine Maury first used mines as a weapon against enemy ships. In Virginia, his \"infernal machines\" made the James River almost completely impassible. \n\nAnother invention was the coal torpedo. Disguised to look like a lump of coal it exploded when shoveled into a boiler. Another invention was called the \"horological torpedo\". It had a timer that allowed a delay in the explosion. They also developed better fuses and more powerful explosives. \n\nUnderwater mines were used by both sides. The Confederacy had more success. In 1862 Confederate mines sank the Union ironclad, the USS Cairo. The destroyed or damaged dozens more Union ships while Union torpedo mines sank only about six Confederate naval ships.\n\nThe Confederate secretary of war, James Seddon, decided to issue rules that \"passenger vessels of citizens of the United States on the high seas and private property on the water and [on] railroads or within the territory of the United States … not be subject of operations.\" But he added, \"The public property of the enemy may be destroyed wherever it may be found.\" Seddon hired up to 25 secret agents to place torpedoes and explosives wherever they could across the Confederacy.\n\nKnown as the \"Singer Secret Service Corps\" and Singer's Torpedo Company\", they were a group of middle age Freemasons from a wide variety of backgrounds. They developed and used inventions such as torpedo boats, underwater mines and submarines during the last two years of the war. Some of these inventions had never been seen before while others were advancements on earlier designs. One of their main weapons was patented by Edgar C. Singer, the underwater contact mine. It contained of black powder. They used up to seven different types of mines, torpedos, torpedo boats, and submarines. \nThey built the The submersible \"H. L. Hunley\". This submarine destroyed the Union warship \"USS Housatonic\" by ramming it with a torpedo mounted on a pole. \n\nFrom their headquarters in the Spotswood Hotel in Richmond, Virginia, Singer and his agents set up secret workshops all over the South in coastal cities. During their two years of operations they blew up ships, trains, and railroad bridges killing a large number of people. Most of their missions were done at night close to Union patrol boats and sentries. Northern newspapers called Singer's inventions \"infernal machines\" and condemned their use as unchristian and assassinations of the worst kind. To cover up who they were and what they had done, their records were burned at the end of the war. They were constantly hunted as saboteurs and spies by Northern authorities. Admiral David Dixon Porter ordered that any of Singer's agents were caught with any of these inventions they were to be \"shot on the spot\". Names and descriptions of Singer's operatives were distributed by Union commanders. \n\nOne group, under the notorious Henry Dillingham, was sent by Davis near the end of the war to occupied Kentucky and Missouri to destroy a key bridge and any federal transportation they could. They were known to use the \"coal torpedos\" and several sources say one was used to blow up the \"Sultana\" in April 1865. It was in the area Dillingham was operating in and it was ferrying ex-confederate prisoners of war at the time it was destroyed.\n\n\n", "id": "562301", "title": "Confederate States Navy"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562568", "text": "Military glider\n\nMilitary gliders (a variation of the common glider) have been used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment into a war zone. They were used mainly during the Second World War. These aircraft with no engines were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes. One of the most popular tow aircraft was the C-47 Skytrain or Dakota. They could also be towed by bombers. Military gliders do not soar. Once released from the tow craft near the front lines, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to their target. \n\nThey tried to landed with as little damage as possible to the cargo and crew as possible. But most landing zones (LZ) were far from ideal. The one-way nature of the missions meant that military gliders were treated as being disposable. This is why they were made from common and inexpensive materials such as wood. They were unarmored, fragile, aircraft with crude steering and no brakes. This is why a large number of them crashed on landing. Troops landing by glider were referred to as airborne infantry. Pilots called themselves \"tow targets\" while the soldiers referred to the gliders as \"flying coffins.\" Casualties for some missions ran as high as 40%. \n\nGilders had certain advantages, however. Paratroopers, soldiers landing by parachute, were usually spread over a large area. They could easily be separated from other paratroopers and from air-dropped equipment, such as vehicles and anti-tank guns. Gliders, on the other hand, could land troops and equipment precisely at the target landing area. Once released from the tow aircraft, military gliders were silent and difficult for the enemy to identify. Larger gliders were developed to land heavy equipment like anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, small vehicles, such as jeeps, and also light tanks (e.g., the Tetrarch tank). This heavier equipment made glider forces much more capable. During World War II, the United States had about 6,000 trained glider pilots. Some were given a second chance to fly as glider pilots after failing to complete conventional aircraft training. The Soviets also experimented with ways to deliver light tanks by air, including the Antonov A-40, a gliding tank with detachable wings.\n\nBy the time of the Korean War, helicopters had largely replaced gliders. Helicopters have the advantage of being able to deliver and extract soldiers to and from the battlefield with more precision. Also, modern advances allow even light tanks to be dropped by parachute. Only special forces use gliders for silent, small-scale insertion today.\n", "id": "562568", "title": "Military glider"}

They rescued Jews from extermination. They fought against the Nazis, who had taken over Poland. They also fought against people who cooperated with the Nazis. They lived and fought around Nowogródek (Navahrudak) and Lida in Poland (now western Belarus). They were named after the Bielskis, a family of Polish Jews who led the group.\n\nUnder the Bielski partisans' protection, 1,236 Jews survived the war. This was one of many remarkable rescue missions in the Holocaust. The group spent more than two years living in the forests and was initially organised by members of the Bielski family.\n\nThe Bielski family were millers and grocers in Stankiewicze (Stankievichy) near Nowogródek. At the beginning of WWII, this area belonged to the Second Polish Republic. It was taken over by the Soviet Union in September 1939 (cf. Polish September Campaign and Soviet invasion of Poland) as part of an agreement between Nazi Germany and Josef Stalin's Soviet Union that they would not fight each other.\n\nThe Bielski family served as low-level administrators in the new government set up by the Soviets. This made many local Poles unhappy, because they saw the Soviets as occupiers. \n\nOn 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa and invaded the Soviet Union. Nowogródek became a Jewish ghetto. The Nazis took over and began their genocidal policies in Poland and Belarus.\n\nThe Bielski's parents and older family members were killed in the ghetto on 8 December 1941. The four Bielski brothers - Tuvia, Alexander (also known as \"Zus\"), Asael, and Aron Bielski - managed to escape to the nearby forest. Together with 13 neighbours from the ghetto, they formed their partisan combat group in the spring of 1942. Originally, about forty people were in the group, but it grew quickly.\n\nThe oldest brother, Tuvia, was the group's commander. Tuvia had served in the Polish Army from 1927 to 1929, rising to the rank of corporal. He had been interested in the Zionist youth movement. He sent people to sneak into the ghettos in the area, recruiting new members to join the group in the Naliboki Forest. Hundreds of men, women and children eventually found their way to the Bielski camp. At its largest, 1,236 people belonged to the group. Seven out of every ten members were women, children, or elderly. No one was turned away. About 150 group members used weapons to fight the Nazis and the people who cooperated with them.\n\nThe partisans lived in underground dugouts (zemlyankas) or bunkers. In their forest camp, they built many things, including:\n\nMembers of the group did many different jobs. For example:\n\nThe group also set up a school in one of the dugouts. The camp even had its own jail and court of law.\n\nSome accounts say that poor members of the group were not treated as well as richer members.\n\nThe Bielski group's partisan activities were aimed at the Germans and their collaborators (people who cooperated with the Nazis, like Belarusian volunteer policemen or local residents who had betrayed or killed Jews). The group also used sabotage to fight the Nazis. The Nazi regime offered a reward of 100,000 Reichsmarks to anyone who could help them catch Tuvia Bielski. In 1943, the Nazis led major efforts to get rid of all partisan groups in the area. Some of these groups suffered major casualties, but the Bielski partisans fled safely to a deeper part of the forest, and continued to offer protection to the non-fighters among their band.\n\nLike other partisan groups in the area, the Bielski group would raid nearby villages and force people to give them food. Sometimes, peasants who refused to share their food with the partisans were attacked or even murdered. This made many of the peasants in the villages angry at the Bielski partisans, though some would willingly help the Jewish partisans.\n\nThe Bielski partisans eventually teamed up with with Soviet groups around the Naliboki Forest under General Platon (Vasily Yefimovich Chernyshev). Soviet commanders tried several times to get Bielski fighters to join their units, but they refused. Tuvia continued to command the Bielski partisans. This allowed him to continue in his mission to protect Jewish lives along with engaging in combat activity. However, it would also cause problems later on.\n\nThe Bielski partisan leaders split the group into two units, one named \"Ordzhonikidze\", led by Zus, and the other \"Kalinin\", commanded by Tuvia. Fighting on the Soviet side, they took part in fights between Polish and Soviet forces. On 1 December 1943, they helped the Soviets disarm a group of Polish partisans. According to records kept by the partisans, the Bielski fighters from both units claimed to have killed a total of 381 enemy fighters, sometimes during joint actions with Soviet groups.\n\nIn the summer of 1944, the Soviets began to fight back against the Nazi occupiers in Belarus, and took over the area. At this pint, the \"Kalinin\" unit, which included 1,230 men, women and children, came out of the forest and marched into Novogrodek.\n\nEven though they have previously worked and cooperated with the Soviets, relations between the Soviets and the Bielski partisans got worse quickly. The NKVD started interrogating the Bielski brothers about the rumours of loot they had reportedly collected during the war, and about their failure to \"implement socialist ideals in the camp\". Asael Bielski was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army and fell in the Battle of Königsberg in 1945. The remaining brothers escaped Soviet-controlled lands, emigrating to the West. Tuvia's cousin, Yehuda Bielski, was sought by the NKVD for having been an officer in the pre-war Polish Army. However, with Tuvia's help, he managed to escape to Hungary, then to Israel.\n\nAfter the war, Tuvia Bielski returned to Poland, then emigrated to present-day Israel in 1945. Tuvia and Zus eventually settled in New York, where they ran a successful trucking business. When Tuvia died in 1987, he was buried in Long Island, New York. However, a year later, surviving partisans in Israel got his body to be exhumed (taken out of the ground). He was given a hero's funeral at Har Hamenuchot, the hillside graveyard in Jerusalem. His wife, Lilka, was buried beside him in 2001.\n\nThe last living Bielski brother, Aron Bielski, emigrated to the US in 1951. He changed his name to \"Aron Bell.\" The remainder of the Bell family now lives in upstate New York and California. Aron lives in Florida. None of the Bielskis ever sought any praise or reward for their actions.\n\nYehuda Bielski, their first cousin and fellow partisan, moved to Israel to fight in the Irgun.\n\nStankiewicze (Stankevichi) no longer exists. It was at , just off Route P11, approximately halfway between Biarozauka and Navahrudak.\n\nSome of the members of the Bielski partisans (but not the Bielski brothers themselves) have been accused of war crimes in the villages near them. In particular, Bielski partisans have been accused of being involved in the 1943 Naliboki massacre of 129 people, committed by Soviet partisans. Some witnesses and some historians say that members of the Bielskis' unit were at the massacre. However, former group members and other historians, say this is not true. They say that the partisans did not arrive in the area until several months later. \n\nThe Polish Institute of National Remembrance has been investigating the massacre since the early 2000s. As of April 2009, it has not issued official findings. However, some historians working at the Institute have written in other publications that the Bielski brothers had not been involved in the massacre.\n\nTwo recent English language books have focused on the Bielski story: \"Defiance\" (1993) by Nechama Tec, and \"The Bielski Brothers\" (2004) by Peter Duffy. The group is also mentioned in numerous books about this period in history. A new book (January 2009) in Polish by two reporters from Gazeta Wyborcza, \"Odwet: Prawdziwa historia braci Bielskich\" (\"Revenge: The True Story of the Bielski Brothers\") focuses on the larger political and historical context in which the partisans operated, specifically the fighting between Polish and Soviet resistance groups in the Kresy (former Eastern Poland) region. \"Fugitives of the Forest: The Heroic Story of Jewish Resistance and Survival During the Second World War\", by Allan Levine (first published 1998, 2008 reissue, by Lyons Press), tells the story of Jewish fighters and refugees in forests across Europe, including the Bielski partisans. \"With Courage Shall We Fight: The Memoirs and Poetry of Holocaust Resistance Fighters Frances \"Fruma\" Gulkowich Berger and Murray “Motke” Berger\" tells the story of two Bielski Brigade fighters before, during and after the War.\n\nIn 2006, the History Channel aired a documentary titled \"The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods\", written and directed by filmmaker Dean Ward.\n\nAn episode of the BBC series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" featured UK television personality Natasha Kaplinsky discovering that her great uncle Ytsak Kaplinski was a member of the Bielski partisans. He survived the war and emigrated to South Africa.\n\nThe BBC series Ray Mears's \"Extreme Survival\" featured an episode about the Bielski partisans.\n\nThe feature film \"Defiance\", co-written, produced and directed by Edward Zwick, was released nationwide on 16 January 2009. It stars Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell, and George MacKay as Tuvia, Zus, Asael and Aron Bielski respectively. It opened to mixed reviews and raised questions about the roles various groups played during the war.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "562673", "title": "Bielski partisans"}

The main battle she was in was the Battle of Jutland where she hit another German ship which then sank. \n\nThe ship served with her three sister ships for the majority of World War I. She saw extensive service in the North Sea, where she took part in several fleet sorties. These culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where \"Posen\" was heavily engaged in night-fighting against British light forces. In the confusion, the ship accidentally rammed the light cruiser SMS \"Elbing\", which suffered serious damage and was scuttled later in the night.\n\nThe ship also conducted several deployments to the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. In the first of these, \"Posen\" supported a German naval assault in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. The ship was sent back to the Baltic in 1918 to support the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War. At the end of the war, \"Posen\" remained in Germany while the majority of the fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. In 1919, following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow, she was ceded to the British as a replacement for the ships that had been sunk. She was then sent to ship-breakers in the Netherlands and scrapped in 1922.\n\nPosen was 146 m long and 27 m wide. She weighed 18,873 tonnes. Her crew was 40 officers and 968 sailors, 1008 total.

It is one of the official languages of the Indian state of Assam. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages that is given a special constitutional status in India. The Bodo language has been written using Devanagari script since 1963. It was formerly written using bodobscript.\n\nBodo is a Sino-Tibetan language of the Bodo group. It is closely related to the Dimasa language and Tiwa (Lalung) Language of Assam. It is also related to the Garo language of Meghalaya and the Kokborok language of Tripura. The Bodo speaking areas of Assam stretch from Dhubri in the west to Sadiya in the east. In Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri and other parts of Bengal, the Boros are known as \"Mech\". According to the 1991 census, the population of Boro speakers was 1,984,569 (Bodo 1,324,748), (Mech 659,821). The census reports of Bodo tribe, however, includes only the Bodos. It excludes the Mech tribe. The word \"Boro\" means the language and the community. It is pronounced with a high tone on the second syllable.\n\nThe dialects spoken in this area can be divided into three main groups:\n\n\nThe Western Boro dialects are spoken in the districts of Kokrajhar and Bongaigaon. The Eastern Bodo dialects are found mainly in the districts of Barpeta, Nalbari and Kamrup and some parts of Darrang. The Western Boro dialect has gained the status of a standard dialect. It has also developed a written form. The variations between these two dialect groups are mainly phonological and lexical.\nThe Bodo language of Assam has at least four clear-cut dialect-areas with a sufficient number of dialectal variations. There are the northeastern, southwestern, north-central and southern dialect areas. Each has distinct differences.\n\n\"Ethnologue\" lists the following districts where Bodo is spoken. Bodo is spoken mainly in the lowlands and foothills of Assam and West Bengal.\n\n\nAlthough the Bodo language is a rich and ancient language, it did not have any written literature until the second decade of the 20th century. Christian missionaries, who entered the Bodo speaking areas to preach their religion, published some books on religion, tales, rhymes and songs. These missionaries also published some books on grammar and dictionary. Reverend Sidney Endle compiled \"An Outline of the Kachari Grammar\" in 1884. The grammar is based on the dialect of Darrang district. Endle also wrote an important book on the Bodos. It is titled \"The Kacharis\". The book was published in 1911 and it contains chapters on social customs, agriculture practices, festivities, food habits, rituals, crafts and textiles of the Bodos. The book also included examples of Bodo folktales, rhymes and grammars. J.D. Anderson's \"Collection of Bodo Folktales and Rhymes\" (1895) included seventeen Bodo folktales translated into the English language. This is in addition to the original versions in the Bodo language.\n\nIn 1963 the language was used in teaching in the primary schools in Bodo dominated areas. The Bodo language is used in schools up to the secondary level. The language has become a matter of pride with the opening of the post-graduate course in the Bodo language. Bodo literature has been used in the University of Guwahati since 1996. The Bodo language now has a large number of books of poetry, drama, short stories, novels, biography, travel, children's literature and literary criticism. Though the spoken language has been affected by other communities and dialects, it is still to be heard in its pure form in and around the Udalguri district.\n\nThe language is officially written using the Devanagari script. It also has a long history of using the Latin script and the Assamese script. Some researchers have suggested that at one time the language used a now-lost script called Deodhai. But there is a difference in using the letters in Bodo than the Devanagari.\n\n\n", "id": "562867", "title": "Bodo language"}

It consists of the Prelude and thirty books. It comprises over than six hundred pages and more than twenty thousand lines. Because of that it is one of the longest epic poems in English and European literature. Nineveh was the capital city of the Assyrian empire. It was really destroyed in 612 B.C. \n\nEdwin Atherstone was a romantic poet. He is forgotten now. He was the author of some poems, dramas and two novels, \"Sea kings in England\" and \"Handwriting on the Wall\".\n\nThe poem is written almost entirely in blank verse. This form, unrhymed iambic pentameter, is typical for long poems in English literature. It was introduced into English literature by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in 16th century. It was widely used in Elizabethan drama, for example by Thomas Kyd and William Shakespeare. In 17th century John Milton employed it in \"Paradise Lost\". From that time blank verse prevails in English epic poems. From time to time the poet used alliteration: \"Thus in her pride of power I see her now;/Her swarming streets; her splendid festivals;/Her sprightly damsels\" (\"The Prelude\").\n\nThe poem is based on the strory written by Greek physician and historian Ctesias. Lord Byron wrote a tragedy about Sandanapalus earlier. \n\nThe poem narrates about a great war. It was a conflict between the Assyrian and the coallition of nations that had been conquered by them earlier. The Assyrian were ruled by Sardanapalus, king of Nineveh. He was a tyrant. All the nations around had to pay high taxes and send some soldiers to the king. They did not want to do it any longer. They started a war for independence. After many battles they won the whole war. They took the city of Nineveh, but it was destroyed by an earthquake. \n\nEdwin Atherstone's poems were never much appreciated by critics. Sometimes he was even called \"stupid\".\n\n\"The Fall of Niniveh\" has not been probably translated in any language.

The strength of the Corps were authorized for 46 officers and 944 enlisted men. But it always had fewer marines than it was authorized to have. One of the reasons was that Marines were paid $3 a month less than other Confederate enlisted men. Late in the war they drew men from Confederate Army conscripts and were finally given bounties. Both of these helped to fill out their ranks. Lloyd J. Beall served as a colonel and as Commandant of the Corps. He had no marine experience and was a former United States Army paymaster. \n\nWhile similar to the United States Marine Corps, there were some differences. They replaced the Marine Corps fife with the bugle. Their uniforms were similar to the British Royal Marines. The Confederate Marines were organized into permanent companies, unlike the U.S. Marines. Their tasks were much the same as the U.S. Marines. They provided detachments of marines for warships, commerce raiders, shore batteries and to guard shipyards. They served as landing forces and sharpshooters. Later their duties including manning the main guns of warships. A detachment of Company A served as part of the crew of the ironclad \"CSS Virginia\" during the Battle of Hampton Roads.\n\nDuring the entire Civil War, a total of 148 Confederate Marines were killed in action. Another 312 Marines died from other causes.\n\nOfficers wore a French \"Kepi\" of different colors, but most were grey and blue. They wore frock coats in a shade of gray. The coats had two rows of seven brass buttons (for a total of 14) which were made in England. They wore dark trousers, usually blue in color.\n\nThe Marines used the Confederate Army's rank insignia. One collar stripe for a second lieutanant, two for a first lieutanant and three for a captain. A major wore a star on his collar. A lieutenant colonel wore two stars while a colonel wore three. Officers also wore Austrian knots on their sleeves. A lieutenant wore one braid, a captain wore two and field officers wore three.\n\nThe enlisted ranks also wore the \"kepis\". They wore a grey coat trimmed in black around the collar and cuffs. Non-commissioned officer coat sleeves were trimmed in flax-colored linen. All enlisted men had one row of brass buttons on their coats. Like the officers' buttons, they had a Roman numeral \"M\". Enlisted ranks were indicated by black chevrons. They were the same as those worn by the army, but instead of wearing them with the points down, marines wore them with the points up. The ranks insignia was the same. A corporal had two stripes while a sergeant had three. A first sergeant wore three stripes with a diamond in the center. A sergeant major wore three stripes up with three arcs below.\n\nBoth officers and men also wore Fatigues when not in their dress uniforms.\n\n", "id": "563070", "title": "Confederate States Marine Corps"}

Coverture holds that a man and a woman are a single legal entity—that of the husband. A married woman loses her own legal obligations and rights, and becomes \"covered\" by her husband. Traditionally a woman took her husband's last name as a symbol of this identity. A female child was covered by her father's identity. When she married that coverage transferred to her husband.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=563456", "text": "Land of Punt\n\nLand of Punt is a name for a geographic place, mentioned in Ancient Egyptian texts. At times it is also called Pwenet or Pwene.\nAncient Egypt traded with this place, at least since 6.000 BC. It was known for producing and exporting gold, aromatic resins, blackwood, ebony, ivory, and wild animals. The region is known from ancient Egyptian records of trade expeditions to it. Some biblical scholars have identified it with the biblical land of Put.\n\nAt times Punt is referred to as Ta netjer, the \"Land of the God\".\n\nIt is not known, where this territory was, exactly. Most scholars today believe Punt was located to the southeast of Egypt, most likely in the coastal region of what is today Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, northeast Ethiopia and the Red Sea coast of Sudan. However, some scholars point instead to a range of ancient inscriptions which locate Punt in the Arabian Peninsula. It is also possible that the territory covered both the Horn of Africa and Southern Arabia. Puntland, the Somali administrative region situated at the extremity of the Horn of Africa, may be named in reference to the Land of Punt.\n\nInhabitants formed three groups which wore different clothing, and hairstyles. They held cattle and lived in stil houses. \nStarting from the Nile a caravan could reach Punt in five days. \n\nThe earliest recorded Egyptian expedition to Punt was organized by Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty (25th century BC). However, gold from Punt was in Egypt as early as the time of Pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty.\n\nThere were more expeditions to Punt in the Sixth, Eleventh, Twelfth and Eighteenth dynasties of Egypt. In the Twelfth Dynasty, trade with Punt was celebrated in popular literature in the \"Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor\".\n\nIn the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, Hatshepsut built a Red Sea fleet to make it easier to trade between the head of the Gulf of Aqaba and points south as far as Punt to bring mortuary goods to Karnak in exchange for Nubian gold. Hatshepsut personally made the most famous ancient Egyptian expedition that sailed to Punt. During the reign of Queen Hatshepsut in the 15th century BC, ships regularly crossed the Red Sea in order to obtain bitumen, copper, carved amulets, naptha and other goods transported overland and down the Dead Sea to Elat at the head of the gulf of Aqaba where they were joined with frankincense and myrrh coming north both by sea and overland along trade routes through the mountains running north along the east coast of the Red Sea.\n\nA report of that five-ship voyage can still be seen on reliefs in Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Throughout the temple texts, Hatshepsut \"maintains the fiction that her envoy\" Chancellor Nehsi, who is mentioned as the head of the expedition, had travelled to Punt \"in order to extract tribute from the natives\" who admit their allegiance to the Egyptian pharaoh. In reality, Nehsi's expedition was a simple trading mission to a land, Punt, which was by this time a well-established trading post. Moreover, Nehsi's visit to Punt was not inordinately brave since he was \"accompanied by at least five shiploads of [Egyptian] marines\" and greeted warmly by the chief of Punt and his immediate family. The Puntites \"traded not only in their own produce of incense, ebony and short-horned cattle, but [also] in goods from other African states including gold, ivory and animal skins.\" According to the temple reliefs, the Land of Punt was ruled at that time by King Parahu and Queen Ati. This well illustrated expedition of Hatshepsut occurred in Year 9 of the female pharaoh's reign with the blessing of the god Amun:\nThe Egyptians were not particularly good at travelling at sea. For them, the travel to Punt must have been similar to modern-day explorers travelling to the moon. But the reward [of obtaining frankincense, ebony and myrrh] clearly outweighed the risks. Hatshepsut's 18th dynasty successors, such as Thutmose III and Amenhotep III also continued the Egyptian tradition of trading with Punt. The trade with Punt continued into the start of the 20th dynasty before terminating before the end of Egypt's New Kingdom. Papyrus Harris I, a contemporary Egyptian document which detailed events that occurred in the reign of the early 20th dynasty king Ramesses III, includes an explicit description of an Egyptian expedition's return from Punt:\nAfter the end of the New Kingdom period, Punt became \"an unreal and fabulous land of myths and legends.\"\n\nAt times, the ancient Egyptians called Punt \"Ta netjer\", meaning \"God's Land\". This referred to the fact that it was among the regions of the Sun God, that is, the regions in the direction of the sunrise, to the East of Egypt. These eastern regions' resources included products used in temples, notably incense. Older literature (and current non-mainstream literature) maintained that the label \"God's Land\", when interpreted as \"Holy Land\" or \"Land of the gods/ancestors\", meant that the ancient Egyptians viewed the Land of Punt as their ancestral homeland. W. M. Flinders Petrie believed that the Dynastic Race came from or through Punt and E. A. Wallis Budge stated that \"Egyptian tradition of the Dynastic Period held that the aboriginal home of the Egyptians was Punt...\". \nThe term was not only applied to Punt, located southeast of Egypt, but also to regions of Asia east and northeast of Egypt, such as Lebanon, which was the source of wood for temples.\n\nQueen Ati, shown in the reliefs of Hatshepsut, demonstrate advanced Steatopygia, associated though not limited to Khoi-San people of East and South Africa. It has been suggested that this may be evidence of the survival of Khoi-San cultures since the Sangoan culture in North Eastern Africa prior to the arrival of Cushitic speaking cultures in the region.\n\nThe products of Punt (as they are shown in Hatshepsut's temple) are easily found in the Horn of Africa. They are less common or absent in Arabia. For this reason, most scholars think that Punt was in Northeast Africa. These products included gold and aromatic resins such as myrrh, frankincense, and ebony; the wild animals depicted in Punt included giraffes, baboons, hippopotami, and leopards. According to Richard Pankhurst: \"[Punt] has been identified with territory on both the Arabian and the Horn of Africa coasts. Consideration of the articles which the Egyptians obtained from Punt, notably gold and ivory, suggests, however, that these were primarily of African origin. ... This leads us to suppose that the term Punt probably applied more to African than Arabian territory.\"\n\nSome scholars disagree with this view and point to a range of ancient inscriptions which locate Punt in Arabia. Dimitri Meeks has written that \"Texts locating Punt beyond doubt to the south are in the minority, but they are the only ones cited in the current consensus about the location of the country. Punt, we are told by the Egyptians, is situated – in relation to the Nile Valley – both to the north, in contact with the countries of the Near East of the Mediterranean area, and also to the east or south-east, while its furthest borders are far away to the south. Only the Arabian Peninsula satisfies all these indications.\"\n\nIn 2010, a genetic study was conducted on the mummified remains of baboons that were brought back from Punt by the ancient Egyptians. Led by a research team from the Egyptian Museum and the University of California, the scientists used oxygen isotope analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the British Museum. One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the other's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of modern-day baboon specimens from regions of interest. The researchers at first found that the mummies most closely matched modern specimens seen in Eritrea and Ethiopia as opposed to those in neighboring Somalia, with the Ethiopian specimens \"basically due west from Eritrea\". The team did not have the opportunity to compare the mummies with baboons in Yemen. The scientists believed that such an analysis would yield similar results since, according to them, regional isotopic maps suggest that baboons in Yemen would closely resemble those in Somalia. Professor Dominy, one of the lead researchers, concluded from this that \"we think Punt is a sort of circumscribed region that includes eastern Ethiopia and all of Eritrea.\" In 2015, the scientists conducted a followup study to confirm their initial findings, and concluded that \"our results reveal a high likelihood match with eastern Somalia and the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor, suggesting that this region was the source of Papio hamadryas exported to Ancient Egypt.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "563456", "title": "Land of Punt"}

Continuing rains led to low-lying parts of Chennai becoming sunk by 13 November, resulting in the evacuation of over 1000 people from their homes. The flooding in Chennai city was worsened by years of illegal development and inadequate levels of flood preparedness. \n\nThe flooding in Chennai city was described as the worst in a century. The continued rains led to schools and colleges remaining closed across Puducherry and Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in Tamil Nadu and fishermen were warned against sailing because of high waters and rough seas.\nPuducherry sustained relatively minor damage in November as the depression largely remained offshore; some trees were downed and several banana and sugarcane plantations at Kutchipalayam were severely damaged. Puducherry reported receiving 55.7 mm of rainfall over the 24-hour period from 14–15 November. Water entered several houses in low-lying areas, while three houses collapsed in Uppalam. \nOn 5 December, the territorial government announced that nearly 9,000 hectares of paddy fields had been damaged by torrential rainfall, including 4,420 hectares of paddy fields in Puducherry,4,248.34 hectares in Karaikal and 287.15 hectares in Yanam. The government also reported 1,544 hectares of sugercane fields under cultivation had been damaged, along with 297.73 hectares of plantains, 231.9 hectares of tapioca and related tubers, 168.10 hectares of vegetable fields and eight hectares under betel-leaf cultivation. Proposed compensation rates would be as follows: per hectare for betel-leaf losses, ) per hectare for plantains, ) per hectare for paddy fields and ) per hectare for losses of vegetables, tapioca, tubers and sugercane. Compensation scales had also been set for losses of cotton, lentils and flowers.\nSupplies of basic necessities, including milk, water and vegetables, were affected due to logistical difficulties. During the December floods in Chennai and the adjoining areas, milk packets sold for , five times more than their usual cost. Water bottles and cans were sold at prices between to .

Most of the waste from the city is drained into this river and the Cooum River.\n\nAdyar river starts from Malaipattu tank near Manimangalam village in Sriperumbudur Taluk at about west of Tambaram near Chennai. It starts to appear as a stream only from the point where water from Chembarambakkam lake joins the river. It flows through Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai district for about before joining the Bay of Bengal in Adyar, Chennai. Here it forms an estuary, which extends from the Adyar Bridge to the sandbar at the edge of the sea, with some small islets in-between. The estuary attracts a wide variety of birds. The estuary covering an area of about was made a protected wildlife reserve in 1987. The river forms a backwater near the mouth, known as the Adyar creek, due to the formation of sand bar at the mouth. This creek is a natural channel which carries tidal water back into the sea.\n\nThe river is almost stagnant except during the rain season. Rapid industrialisation and urbanisation has led to severe contamination of this river. However, the river gets just 10 per cent of the untreated sewage being let into the three principle waterways of Chennai daily, with the other two, namely, the Buckingham Canal and the Cooum River, taking the major share (60 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively).\nThe problem of sedimentation was not severe as the Adyar's width near Thiru.Vi.Ka. Bridge is nearly that enabled tidal effect into the waterway for about . However, it was essential to provide groynes to keep the river mouth open for adequate width and prevent inundation during monsoon. In 2011, the Water Resources Department (WRD) proposed to construct groynes to reduce formation of sand bars near the mouth the river.In 2012, the state government allotted 3,000 million towards construction of 337 sewage cleaning systems in the waterways in the city, including 49 locations in the Adyar river.

At 11 am on May 3, more than 100 large kites fly in the sky by a trumpet call. The place is the Nakatajima Sand Dunes, which is one of three largest sand dunes in Japan. The Nakatajima Dunes overlook Enshu-nada sea, so the place is very useful for flying kites due to strong winds from the sea.

It existed during the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865. Like the United States Congress, the Confederate Congress consisted of two parts. The upper house was the Senate. It was made up of two senators from each state who were chosen by their state legislatures. The lower house was called the House of Representatives. Its members were elected by the citizens of the individual states. \n\nOn February 4, 1861, the Provisional Congress met at Montgomery, Alabama. Representatives of each state were appointed by their state secession conventions. The session ended on February 17, 1862 which also ended the Provisional Congress.\n\nOn February 18, 1862 the first congress held its first session. After four sessions, the congress adjourned \"sine die\" (without setting a day for another meeting) exactly two years later.\n\nThe Second Congress met for two sessions before the end of the war. Its last session ended on March 18, 1865.\n\nThe first act of the Confederate Congress was to keep in force all laws of the United States which did not conflict with the Confederate States Constitution. \n\nThe Confederate States Constitution, however, was not adopted until March 11, 1861. It was almost the same as the United States Constitution but with a few changes. These included the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis, having a line-item veto. The president served only one six-year term and could not be voted president again. Members of the president's cabinet also served as non-voting members of Congress.\n\nThe central government of the Confederacy, the president and the Congress, could not make laws that overruled those of the individual Confederate states. The Confederacy did not have a Supreme Court because no agreement was ever reached on how it would work. Because the Confederate government was limited, they could not raise much money. States could and sometimes did refuse to send their militias if they felt they were needed in their own state. Congress was not able to control inflation and as prices went up drastically there were food riots in the South including the Capital city of Richmond, Virginia.\n\nWhile during this time the United States Congress made a great number of changes in U.S. law. At the same time, the Confederate Congress was just trying to keep the Confederacy alive and working. Of the many acts passed was the first military draft passed in 1862. They also approved black men as soldiers in March of 1865. It had been debated for some time as it became apparent the South could lose the war. About this same time, in 1864, the Confederate Congress was in a near-panic. The Army needed more soldiers. Among the resolutions was for members of Congress to join the military and fight. Another resolution was to exempt men over the age of 50 from military service. This included most of the members of Congress. Others wanted to Congress to leave Richmond and find a place of safety. While the Confederate Congress debated, the Union Army was pushing closer and closer to Richmond.

It is one type of diving which has belonged to the Olympic games since 2000 Sydney Olympics. The competition consists of five or six rounds depending on the events. Divers dive two basic dives during the first two rounds. Then they dive more complex freestyle dives from the third to the fifth round. The winners are determined according to total scores from judges. There are two types of judges. One is a technical judge who evaluates degree of completion of their dives.  Another is a synchro judge who evaluates the synchronization of two divers.\n\nSynchronized diving was internationally introduced at the 1995 FINA world cup. In 1999, four synchronized diving events were added as the Olympic programme at the IOC Executive Board meeting held in Lausanne. Then, it became an Olympic sport with its debut at the 2000 Sydney games with three-meter springboard and ten-meter platform events for both men and women.\n\nThere are six groups of dives. The first four show the direction the diver rotates.\n\n1. Forward group: The diver faces the front of the board and jumps toward the water.\n\n2. Backward group: Backward dives begin on the end of the board with divers back to the water.\n\n3. Reverse group: Reverse dives begin with the diver facing the front of the board and then  rotates toward the board.\n\n4. Inward group: these dives begin on the end of the board with divers’ back to the water but then rotates toward the board.\n\n5. Twisting group: Any dive that uses a twist excluding armstands.\n\n6. Armstand group: The dives begin with a handstand position on the end of the platform before the dive.\n\nA dive may be performed using one of the following four positions.\n\nPike: The legs are straight with the body bent at the waist. arm placement can be different according to the dives by each diver.\n\nTuck: The Body is bent at the waist and knees with thighs drawn to the chest.  Heels kept close to the buttocks, and feet should be kept together.\n\nStraight: without bend at the waist or knees. Arm placement can be varied by diver’s choice or is decided by the dive performed.\n\nFree: using any of the above three positions, or combinations them, when performing a twisting dive.\n\nWhile it takes seven judges to score individual events, 11 judges score synchronized diving. During a synchro event, three judges score the completion of Diver A’s performance, while three other judges score the completion of Diver B’s performance. The remaining five judges score the synchronization of two divers. Each judge scores a dive between 0 and 10 points, in half-point increments.\n\n10: Excellent\n\n8.5-9.5: Very good\n\n7-8: Good\n\n5-6.5: Satisfactory\n\n2.5-4.5: Deficient\n\n0.5-2: Unsatisfactory\n\n0: Completely failed\n\nJudges evaluate the following parts of a dive to determine an overall score:\n\nApproach: several steps forward to the end of the board before takeoff. It should be smooth but forceful with good form.\n\nTakeoff: A diver’s jump from the board prior to execution of the dive. showing control and balance is important with appropriate angle and distance from the board.\n\nElevation: The amount of the jump has an effect on the appearance of the dive.A higher jump allows divers to dive with accuracy and smoothness of movement.\n\nExecution: proper mechanical performance, skills, form, and grace.\n\nEntry: The entry into the water is important because it’s the last moment the judge watches. It should be vertical with a minimal amount of splash.\n", "id": "563824", "title": "Synchronized diving"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=563939", "text": "Herod the Great\n\nHerod I (73/75–4 BC), also known as Herod the Great, was the King of Judea from 37 to 4 BC. At the time Judea was a client state of Rome. During his 33 year reign, Herod was an excellent administrator. But he is most famous for the Bible account of his killing the children of Jerusalem. While his killing of the children may be a legend, he did murder countless rivals, a mother-in-law, a wife and three of his sons. \n\nHerod was born about 73–75 BC. He was the son of Antipater the Idumaean and his wife Cyprus, the daughter of an Arabian sheik. Both Herod's grandfather and his father were political officials in Judea. Both had close ties to the Romans. When Antipater came to the aid of Julius Caesar after the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, Caesar made Antipater the governor of Judea. In 47 BC Antipater made his oldest son, phasael, the governor of Jerusalem. He made Herod governor of Galilee. As governor, Herod won favor with the Romans by his dealing with hostile revolts. At the same time his actions were censured by the Great Sanhedrin. \n\nHerod was friends with Octavian and Mark Antony who in 40 BC had the Roman Senate designate Herod as the next king of Judea. Herod traveled to the Temple of Jupiter to give thanks to the gods of Rome. When the king of Judea was beheaded in 37 BC, Herod became the \"de facto\" king.\n\nDuring Herod's early years as king, Mark Antony's relationship with Cleopatra allowed the Egyptian queen to keep taking small parts of Herod's kingdom. When Octavian defeated Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Herod made a new alliance with Octavian. He gained a reputation for his harsh taxes but was able to keep the peace in the region. He sent expensive gifts to Rome but did not have to pay tribute. By 30 BC, he had regained all the territory Cleopatra and the Hasmoneans had taken. He expanded his rule into northern Galilee and resettled several areas. By giving extravagant gifts to Athens and supporting the Olympic Games he increased the status of Judea in the Mediterranean world.\n\nHerod saw himself as the perfect example of a refined king even if Bible writers saw him as a tyrant. He became completely involved in Greco-Roman history, culture and philosophy. At the same time he began neglecting the affairs of state and the study of Halakha (Jewish law). He needed the consent of the Pharisees in order to rule so he kept trying to gain their approval in a number of ways. He never won them over completely. When he built the Caesarea Maritima (22–10 BC) in honor of his patron Caesar Augustus, the pagan symbols decorating his cities upset the Jewish leaders. He organized fights between gladiators every five years and celebrated with orgies, which further upset the Jewish leaders. In 20 BC, Herod turned his attention to building the Second Temple, also called Herod's Temple. While Herod wanted the temple to be the crowning monument to the Jewish faith, he used Greek architects. He allowed moneylenders to operate in the temple courtyard which angered many Jews. \n\nHis greatest religious scandal was digging up King David's Tomb to find the treasure it was rumored to contain. He had spent great sums of money on his other projects and thought that by secretly robbing the tomb he could profit from any treasure he found there. But on opening the tomb, there was no treasure.\n\nHe rebuilt the fortresses at Masada and Herodium. After a severe earthquake in 31 BC, he built a new market, a new \namphitheater and a new building for the Sanhedrin. He built a new royal palace for himself. He also improved the water supply for Jerusalem.\n\nHerod is thought to have had as many as nine wives and may have been married to more than one at a time. He had a large number of concubines. Herod seems to have been plagued by paranoia. He continuously thought there were conspiracies and plots to overthrow him as king. He may have married too often and produced too many sons. Herod worried each one was plotting to take his place. In all he had three of sons killed. He became suspicious of the brother of his favorite wife, Mariamme, and had him drowned in a game of water polo. He ordered Mariamme's grandfather killed and finally, Mariamme herself. \n\nAs Herod realized he would die soon, he ordered all the leading men in Judea to be brought together in a large arena. As soon as the king died, they were all to be put to death. This was to keep others from celebrating his death. Herod had probably been suffering from chronic kidney disease, gangrene and possibly other diseases that left him mentally unbalanced.\n\n", "id": "563939", "title": "Herod the Great"}

At the time people were not as directly involved in the political process as they would become. There were 24 states and six of them left the choice of president up to their state legislatures. So a presidential campaign was not the popularity contest it would later become. The choice of a president was in part made by other elected officials and in part by citizens who could vote. Unlike modern politicians, presidential candidates did not campaign personally. Instead, their campaign managers and others would place ads in newspapers that criticized their candidate's rivals while promoting the virtues of their candidate. The candidates left the campaigning to their friends.\n\nIn the summer of 1824, about one-third of the eligible congressmen met in an informal caucus to nominate Crawford to be president. The Massachusetts legislature followed by nominating Adams as their favorite son candidate. Clay was nominated by the Kentucky legislature. Calhoun decided to run for Vice President instead. All four candidates were Democrat-Republicans so there was no official party endorsement. By this time the Federalist party no longer existed. \n\nunofficial caucus of less than a third of the congressmen eligible to attend nominated Crawford for President. Supporters for Adams denounced the caucus bid, and the Massachusetts legislature nominated Adams as their favorite-son candidate. The Kentucky legislature did the same for Clay. Both nominations followed the pattern set by the Tennessee legislature, which had nominated Andrew Jackson in 1822. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina dropped out of the presidential race by announcing his bid for the vice presidency, a move that both Adams and Crawford endorsed. Because all four candidates were nominal Democratic-Republicans—the Federalist Party had disintegrated by this point—the election would be decided without reference to party affiliation.\n\nMadison turned out to be the last of the Virginia dynasty of presidents. But three members of his cabinet decided to run. Adams, from Massachusetts, was the Secretary of State. Crawford, from Georgia, was the Secretary of the Treasury. Calhoun, of South Carolina, was the Secretary of War. Clay, nearly as popular in the Western territories as Jackson, was the powerful Speaker of the House of Representatives. As a heroic General, Jackson was by far the best known by the public. He had only a brief term in Congress and had been a territorial governor. He had few other qualifications. He was not experienced in diplomacy, never held a cabinet post and did not speak any foreign languages. Up to this time all U.S. presidents had diplomatic and administrative experience before becoming president.\n\nAdams, was undoubtedly the most qualified to be president. He was a son of the second president and had studied at Harvard College. He was fluent in Dutch, French and German. In 1794 he was the U.S. minister to the Netherlands. During his father's presidency he served as the minister to Prussia. Under President Madison he helped negotiate the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 ending the War of 1812. As Secretary of State he played a key role in foreign policy. Adams helped to formulate the Monroe Doctrine. He was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1802 and the next year was elected to the United States Senate. \n\nAdams, however, almost completely lacked charisma. He was short, bald and always had a frown on his face. If he had campaigned in person, his appearance would have prevented him from getting many votes. He described himself saying \"I am a man of reserved, cold, austere and forbidding manners.\"\n\nCrawford had run for president once before in 1816. He had served two terms as a U.S. Senator. He served two presidents as a cabinet member and had experience as a foreign diplomat. Crawford was a strong supporter of states' rights. He was a member of a group called the \"Old Republicans\" or \"Radicals\". He was against protective tariffs and wanted limited budgets to keep the federal government weak. While generally easygoing and friendly, he had a temper every bit as bad as Jackson's. He suffered a severe stroke in 1823 and nearly died. This left him frail and weak. At the time of his nomination he was blind and still paralyzed. But he refused to give up another bid for the presidency.\n\nCalhoun was a strong Jeffersonian Republican. He was elected in 1807 to South Carolina's state legislature and in 1811 he represented his state in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was in favor of a war against Great Britain as early as 1807. In 1817 he became secretary of war under James Madison. Calhoun briefly ran for president in 1824, but withdrew early and ran for Vice President instead.\n\nHenry Clay was a leading candidate in 1824. He was born in Virginia in 1777. After becoming a lawyer in Virginia in 1797, he moved to Kentucky to establish a law practice there. He was elected to the Kentucky General Assembly in 1803. Another follower of Jeffersonian politics he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1811. There he served several terms eventually rising to become Speaker of the House. He was one of the five delegates from the U.S. who negotiated the Peace Treaty at Ghent. It was Clay who proposed and got the passage of the Missouri Compromise in 1820.\n\nIn some ways the candidate to beat was General Andrew Jackson of Tennessee. He was the hero of the Battle of New Orleans. During the War of 1812 he had fought against the Creek Indians along with another hero, Davy Crockett. His men had nicknamed him \"Old Hickory.\" This made him better known than most of the other candidates. Like George Washington he had risked his life to serve his country. He was a political outsider. Unless other candidates could put together a coalition, Jackson would be difficult to defeat.\n\nThere was no election \"day\" in 1824. All through the fall of 1824, voters cast their ballots either for individual candidates or for electors to vote in the Electoral College. Electors were chosen in the states of Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, South Carolina and Vermont. Some electors were pledged to support certain candidates while others were not. Of those who were pledged, some changed their minds and voted for another candidate.\n\nJackson received the majority of the popular vote and the majority of the electoral vote. But, no candidate received the necessary 131 electoral votes required by the Constitution. Based on the Twelfth Amendment, the election would be decided by the House of Representatives between the top three candidates. Clay, as the fourth candidate, was eliminated. But, as Speaker of the House he would play a large part in the decision of who would become President. Clay used all his influence to support Adams. He also convinced other members of the House that Jackson was not qualified to be President. This was in spite of the fact that Clay had instructions from the Kentucky legislature to vote for Jackson. Clay's arguments apparently succeeded and Adams was elected President by the House on February 9, 1825. A few days later, Adams nominated Clay to be his Secretary of State.\n\nJackson and his supporters called the actions of Clay and Adams a \"corrupt bargain.\" The presidential race of 1828 began even before Adams was sworn in as President. The apparent agreement between Adams and Clay was used to show the corruption of the system that ignored the will of the people. Jackson began campaigning as the \"champion of the common man\".\n\nThe 1824 election caused several changes to American presidential politics. It was the end of the system of Congressional caucuses for nominating candidates. From 1800 to 1820, Congressional caucuses selected presidential candidates. There was very little direct voter involvement in the system. But in 1824, only one candidate was selected by a caucus. The other candidates decided to appeal directly to the people. This led to a major change in the system. By the 1830s politics had become a subject of wide national interest. \n\nThe election of 1824 saw the end of the one-party political system. The Democratic-Republicans split into two parties. The new Democratic Party was formed by Jackson and his followers. The National Republican Party (not to be confused with the later Republican Party) was led by Adams and Clay.\n\nJackson resigned his Senate seat returning to Tennessee. He and his followers began the groundwork for his 1828 presidential campaign. His support grew across the United States. In Congress, his supporters opposed spending programs put forward by Adams. Jackson was the champion of the common man while Adams was said to represent everything that was wrong in American politics. After three years in office, Adams accomplished very little. This was in part because of his own shortcomings and in part by the pressure put on him by Jackson's followers. \n\n", "id": "564011", "title": "United States presidential election, 1824"}

The aircraft was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10. On March 3, 1974, the airplane crashed into the Ermenonville Forest, shortly after it had left Paris. All 346 people on board were killed in the accident. An investigation after the crash found out that one of the cargo doors at the rear of the aircraft was not properly closed and secured. After takeoff, part of the door broke off and caused an explosion in the rear of the aircraft. The explosion also damaged cables needed to fly the aircraft. This meant that after the explosion, the aircraft could not be completely controlled. \n\nAn American Airlines DC-10, flying as American Airlines Flight 96, had experienced the same problem about two years earlier. At that time, the crew had managed to land the plane safely. On the ground it was discovered the rear cargo door had opened in flight. This caused damage to the fuselage but not the explosive damage in the case of Turkish 981. The two planes were also configured differently above the baggage compartment. There were three rows of seats added to Turkish 981 which added a greater load to the floor.

But Turkish 981 had additional damage to the plane that may have made it uncontrollable in flight.\n\nAn Airworthiness Directive was immediately issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FFA). It called for strengthening the load floor and control cables. It also required improving the electrical wiring having to do with the cargo door.\n\nAfter takeoff the plane reached an altitude of when the rear hatch cover blew off.

It is loosely based on the myths of Theseus, the Minotaur and the Titanomachy. The movie it stars Henry Cavill, Freida Pinto and Mickey Rourke. It was released on November 11, 2011. The reviews were mixed to negative. But it was a commercial success.\n\nBefore the age of man or beast, the immortals wage war on each other in the heavens. The winners become the gods. The ones who were lose become the Titans who were imprisoned in Mount Tartarus. During the war, a powerful weapon called the Epirus Bow was lost. In 1228 B.C., the Heraklion king Hyperion (Mickey Rourke), lays waste to Greece searching for the bow. With it he can free the Titans and destroy the gods who failed to save his wife and children from dying of disease. Hyperion captures the virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto). This was in the hopes that her psychic visions will help him locate the bow.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of a village prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus to escape from Hyperion's soldiers. One of them is the warrior Theseus (Henry Cavill). He was mentored by a mysterious old man (John Hurt). Theseus and his mother Aethra (Anne Day-Jones) are considered as outcasts as he is the product of Aethra being raped. They are forced to stay behind by soldiers from Athens including Lysander (Joseph Morgan). Theseus beats off multiple opponents until the Athenian officer Helios (Peter Stebbings) has Lysander dismissed for his actions. Lysander travels to Hyperion offering him his service the location of the village. The king accepts but labels Lysander a traitor and, to punish him, has his testicles hammered, so he is unable to produce children. Hyperion's soldiers attack the village and, after murdering Aethra and the villagers, take Theseus captive.\n\nIt is revealed that the old man in Zeus (Luke Evans). He warns his fellows gods Athena (Isabel Lucas), Poseidon (Kellan Lutz), Ares (Daniel Sharman), Heracles (Steve Byers) and Apollo (Corey Sevier) not to interfere with mortal affairs unless the Titans are freed and they must have faith in the humans to defeat Hyperion.\n\nTheseus is enslaved alongside the thief Stavros (Stephen Dorff). Phaedra, who is being held prisoner nearby, sees a vision of Theseus and organizes a riot, and Theseus uses the chaos to escape with Stavros and the other slaves. Theseus attempts to pursue Hyperion by hijacking a boat, but he and his allies are attacked by Hyperion's soldiers. Poseidon deliberately disobeys Zeus by diving into the sea from Olympus and causing a tidal wave which drowns Hyperion's men.

When the Civil War started, Wisconsin raised 91,379 soldiers for the Union Army. They were organized into 53 infantry regiments, 4 cavalry regiments, a company of Berdan's sharpshooters, 13 light artillery batteries and 1 unit of heavy artillery. Most of the Wisconsin troops served in the Western Theater. However, several regiments served in Eastern armies, including three regiments within the famed Iron Brigade. A total of 3,794 were killed in action or mortally wounded. Another 8,022 died of disease. About 400 were killed in accidents. The total casualties were 12,216 men. This was about 13.4 percent of total Wisconsin enlistments.\n\nApproximately 1 in 9 residents (regardless of age, sex or qualification for service) served in the army. In turn, half the eligible voters served. Wisconsin was the only state to organize replacements for troops that had already been sent to war. This led northern generals to prefer having Wisconsin regiments in their command if possible.\n\nA number of Wisconsin regiments were distinguished, including three that served in the celebrated \"Iron Brigade\"&mdash. These were the 2nd Wisconsin, 6th Wisconsin, and 7th Wisconsin. All were noted for their hard fighting and dashing appearance. They were among the only troops in the Army of the Potomac to wear Hardee hats and long frock coats. They suffered severely at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. The 8th Wisconsin, another hard-fighting regiment, was often accompanied into battle by its mascot, Old Abe, a bald eagle.\n\nIn a January 1863 letter to his sister, Union soldier Chauncey Herbert Cooke, a private from Company G of the 25th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, gave his reasons for fighting for the Union in the war, stating that \"I have no heart in this war if the slaves cannot go free.\"\n\nWhile men were fighting, many women needed to learn how to farm and do other manual labor. Besides having to tend to the home and children while the men were away at war, women also contributed supplies. Quilts and blankets were often given to soldiers. Other items women often sent included: shirts, sheets, pillows, pillowcases, coats, vests, trousers, towels, handkerchiefs, socks, bandages, canned fruits, dried fruits, butter, cheese, wine, eggs, pickles, books, and magazines. At one point, after the Battle of Resaca, women sent every wounded man within a certain distance a fresh orange or lemon. These fruits were to quench the strong thirst that was known to accompany a wound.\n\n\n", "id": "564276", "title": "Wisconsin in the American Civil War"}

The State of California did not send its units east, but many citizens traveled east and joined the Union Army. California's Volunteers also conducted many operations against the Native American peoples within the state and in the other Western territories of the Departments of the Pacific and New Mexico.\n\nFollowing the Gold Rush, California was settled primarily by Midwestern and Southern farmers, miners and businessmen. Democrats dominated the state from its foundation. Southern Democrats were sympathetic to the Confederate States of America who seceded, but they were a minority group in the state. California businessmen played a significant role in Californian politics through their control of mines, shipping, finance, and the Republican Party. But they were a minority party until the secession crisis.\n\nWhen California was admitted as a state under the Compromise of 1850, Californians had already decided it was to be a free state. The constitutional convention of 1849 unanimously abolished slavery. As a result, Southerners in Congress voted against admission in 1850 while Northerners pushed it through, pointing to its population of 93,000 and its vast wealth in gold. Northern California, which was dominated by mining, shipping, and commercial elites of San Francisco, favored becoming a state. In the United States presidential election, 1856, California gave its electoral votes to the winner, James Buchanan.\n\nFollowing California's admission to the Union, Californios and pro-slavery Southerners in lightly populated, rural Southern California attempted three times in the 1850s to achieve a separate statehood or territorial status. The last attempt, the \"Pico Act\" of 1859, was passed by the California State Legislature. It was signed by the State governor John B. Weller and approved overwhelmingly by voters in the proposed \"Territory of Colorado\". The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate in Senator Milton Latham. However the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a vote.\n\nIn 1860 Lincoln won 38,733 popular votes, only 32% of the total. But it was enough to win all four of California's [[Electoral college|electoral votes.\n\nOn July 24, 1861, the [[Secretary of War]] called on the [[Governor]] of California for [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] volunteer to guard the [[Butterfield Overland Mail|overland mail]] route from [[Carson City]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. They were also to guard [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]]. The initial call was for five [[Company (military unit)|companies of [[cavalry]] plus one [[regiment]] of [[Infantry]]. On August 14, four more regiments of infantry and one regiment of cavalry were requested. They were to report to General [[Edwin Vose Sumner]]. These volunteers replaced the regular troops transferred to the east before the end of 1861. California would have to protect itself using its own [[manpower]] during the Civil War.\n\nBoth the Union and the Confederacy wanted California's gold. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] once said \"I do not know what we would do in this great national emergency if it were not for the gold sent from California.\" The Confederates also needed [[port]]s that were not being [[blockade]]d by the [[United States Navy|Union Navy]]. If they could get control of [[Southern California]] it would give them the ports it badly needed. Southern California had a number of Southerners who moved to California during the Gold Rush. While they were a minority, they wanted Southern California to secede from the Union and join the Confederate states. At the time, [[Northern California]] was very pro-Union. A number of pro-Confederate groups were organized in Southern California. These included the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles and chapters of the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]], a secret pro-slavery organization.\n\nThe pro-Union state [[militia]]s and Union forces used a number of forts and camps in California. One of the best known is [[Alcatraz Island]]. Before it was a [[federal prison]], it was a [[prisoner of war]] camp for Confederate prisoners. The last army fort still standing is the [[Drum Barracks]]. It was the headquarters of the Union Army in Southern California and the [[Arizona Territory]].\n\n[[Category:American Civil War| ]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the United States]]\n[[Category:California]]", "id": "564279", "title": "California in the American Civil War"}

In a system of extermination by labour, prisoners are forced to do very heavy work without enough food or medical care. Eventually, prisoners die from malnutrition, illness, or injury.\n\nNazi Germany and the Soviet Union both had systems of extermination through labor. Some people describe North Korea's prison system as a system of extermination through labor.\n\nThe term \"extermination through labor\" was first used during World War II. Most of the Nazi SS did not use the term (\"Vernichtung durch Arbeit\" in German). However, Albert Bormann, Joseph Goebels, Otto Georg Thierack, and Heinrich Himmler used the term during the fall of 1942, while talking about moving prisoners to concentration camps. Thierack and Goebbels specifically used the term. The phrase was used again during the Nuremberg Trials after World War II ended.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, historians have argued over whether this term is appropriate. For example, Falk Pingel believed the phrase should not be applied to all Nazi prisoners. On the other hand, Hermann Kaienburg and Miroslav Kárný believed \"extermination through labour\" was one of the SS's specific goals. More recently, Jens-Christian Wagner has also argued that not all Nazi prisoners were targeted with death, so \"extermination through labor\" might not be the best way to describe the Nazis' goals for those prisoners.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the Nazis, led by Adolf Hitler, persecuted, tortured, and killed millions of people because of differences in race, ethnicity, politics, religion, sexual orientation, and disability. \n\nThe Nazis also persecuted people who were \"German-blooded,\" but who the Nazis thought of as \"social misfits\" (\"aisoziale\"). The Nazis said these people led useless \"ballast-lives\" (\"Ballastexiltenzen\"). These people included:\nThe Nazis lists of these people and persecuted them in many ways. For example, some were forced to be sterilized. Many were eventually sent to prison camps for \"extermination through labor.\" Along with them, anyone who spoke out against the Nazi regime (like communists, social democrats, democrats, and conscientious objectors) were sent to prison camps. Many of them did not survive.\n\nExtermination through labor was an important part of the Nazis' Final Solution - their plan to kill all the Jews in Europe.\n\nIn the Nazi prison camps, prisoners were treated like slaves: \n\nWorkers were also tortured and physically abused. For example, victims of \"Torstehen\" (\"Gate Hanging\") had to stand outside naked with their arms raised – like a gate hanging on its hinges. When they collapsed or passed out, they would be beaten until they re-assumed the position. Victims of \"Pfahlhängen\" (\"Post Attachment\") were tied with their hands behind their back and were hung by their hands on a tall stake. This would dislocate the prisoner's arm joints, and the pressure would be kill them within hours.\n\nDuring the Holocaust, the Nazis built concentration camps and then extermination camps to imprison their victims. These \"camps\" were not just prisons. Their goal was not just to keep people locked up. Their goal was to torture and destroy people. All parts of camp life came along with humiliation and harassment. Forced labour was a part of this. Prisoners were whipped and treated like animals. Some forced labor was meant to help the German war machine grow. However, other prisoners were forced to do pointless heavy labor just to wear them down. There were \"no limits to working hours,\" according to official Nazi policy.\n\nA slave worker on a work assignment usually lived less than four months, on average. Up to 25,000 of the 35,000 prisoners forced to work for IG Farben at Auschwitz concentration camp died. Some died from exhaustion or disease. Others were killed after the Nazis decided they were not healthy enough to work any more. \n\nSome work assignments were deadlier than others. Some prisoners were assigned to dig tunnels for German weapons factories during the last months of the war. About 30% of them died. In the satellite camps, which were near mines and industrial firms, death rates were even higher. In these satellite camps, the supplies were often even less adequate than in the main camps.\n\nThe phrase \"Arbeit macht frei\" (\"work shall set you free\") appeared on the entry gates at Auschwitz and other Nazi labor camps.\n\nSome historians call the Soviet Gulag a system of death camps,<ref name=\"Joel Kotek / Pierre Rigoulot \"Gefangenschaft, Zwangsarbeit, Vernichtung\"\"> Joel Kotek / Pierre Rigoulot \"Gefangenschaft, Zwangsarbeit, Vernichtung\", Propyläen 2001</ref> particularly in post-Communist Eastern European politics. Other historians argue that this trivializes the Holocaust (makes the Holocaust seems like it was not so bad) because, at least after the war ended, a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive. \n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn introduced the expression \"camps of extermination by labour\" in his non-fiction work \"The Gulag Archipelago\". In the book, Solzhenitsyn argues that the Soviet Union beat its enemies by making them work as prisoners on big state-run projects (like the White Sea-Baltic Canal, quarries, remote railroads, and urban development projects) under terrible conditions. Roy Medvedev comments: \"The penal system in the Kolyma and in the camps in the north was deliberately designed for the extermination of people.\" Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev writes that Stalin was the \"architect of the gulag system for totally destroying human life.\"\n\nAccording to formerly secret internal Gulag documents, some 1.6 million people must have died in the period between 1935 and 1956 in Soviet forced labour camps and colonies. This does not include people who died in prisoner-of-war camps. Most (about 900,000) of these deaths fell between 1941 and 1945. At that time, World War II was ongoing, and food supplies were low in the entire country.\n\nRussian historian Oleg Khlevniuk writes that about 500,000 people died in the camps and colonies from 1930 to 1941. However, these figures do not include people who died in transport (on their way to the camps). It also does not include the number of people who died shortly after their release due to the harsh treatment in the camps (there were many of these people, according to both archives and memoirs). \n\nHistorian J. Otto Pohl estimates that 2,749,163 prisoners died in the labour camps, colonies, and special settlements. He says this figure is incomplete. \n\nThough the death toll is still widely debated, no state or national institution has recognized the Gulag system as a genocide.\n\nIt is believed that similar camps are operating in North Korea, and killed at least 20,000 political prisoners in 2013 alone, with at least 130,000 held therein.\n\n\n\n", "id": "564313", "title": "Extermination through labor"}

On January 1, 1934, the Lagerordnung became the official rules of every concentration camp in Nazi Germany. \n\nAlso known as the \"Strafkatalog\" (Punishment Catalogue), it set out the rules the prisoners had to follow. SS guards were told to report to the camp commandant when a prisoner broke a rule. \n\nThe Concentration Camps Inspectorate was in charge of carrying out punishment. They did this without making sure the prisoner had actually broken the rule. Once they were accused, prisoners had no way of proving themselves innocent.\n\nAt first, the Nazis had built temporary concentration camps, like Kemna concentration camp. These earlier camps did not have common, agreed-upon rules. Instead, they took the \"Lagerordnung\" from rules that were often used in police departments and prisons at the time. \n\nThere was not much difference between the rules at the early concentration camps. Some did not allow smoking; others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members. The rules were still based on existing laws, and the camps were patterned after ordinary prisons. The early camps had penalties like having privileges taken away, or for more severe cases, solitary confinement, a hard bed, not being given food, or being left in solitary confinement in a darkened cell. However, there was no corporal punishment. The early camps were primarily controlled by the SA or the Gestapo.\n\nHowever, Dachau was under the control of the SS. Sometime in May 1933, SS camp commandant Hilmar Wäckerle wrote the first \"Lagerordnung\" for a concentration camp. It gave all legal powers to the camp commandant. The Dachau Lagerordnung allowed prisoners to be executed based on a decision from two SS men who had been chosen by the commandant. The accused prisoner would no longer have a defense. The executive, judicial, and legislative parts of government were all placed together under the camp commandant's power. There would be no system of checks and balances. The threat of the death penalty was always there, which created a constant state of emergency for Dachau's inmates.\n\nThe first legalized murders took place at Dachau. (There would never be as many political murders in any of the other, earlier concentration camps than there were in Dachau's first few months.) Sophie Handschuh, the mother of one of the murdered prisoners, filed a formal complaint to find out what had really happened to her son. The resulting prosecution forced Himmler to replace Wäckerle. Himmler chose Theodor Eicke, a fanatical \"SS-Oberführer\" who had, in March 1933, been committed for evaluation at a psychiatric clinic at the University of Würzburg due to extremely violent behavior. Himmler arranged for Eicke to be released, asking his doctor, Werner Heyde, to talk to Eicke and get him to promise to control himself.\n\nSix months later, on October 1, 1933, Commandant Eicke wrote a second edition of the \"Lagerordnung\", adding the Postenpflicht and introducing corporal punishment (flogging). The \"Lagerordnung\" established a \"state within a state.\" The second edition established an orderly system in which \"legally\" arrested political opponents could be tortured and executed.\n\nFrom this point on, all SS concentration camps were to follow the Dachau model and become a \"state within a state\": shielded centers of terror with their own laws and judges, without legal defense, and with their own executable violence.\n\nAfter January 1, 1934, all subsequent versions of the \"Lagerordnung\" were effective for all SS-run concentration camps.\n\n[Translator's note: The sometimes odd phrasing, inconsistencies of capitalization, and style itself are from the source, not the translator.]\n\nDachau Concentration Camp<br>\nOffice of the Commandant, October 1, 1933\nDisciplinary and Penal Code for the Detention Camp\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following penalties are issued within the scope of existing camp regulations, to maintain order and discipline on the grounds of Dachau concentration camp, \nThese regulations apply to all prisoners of the DCC from the time of admission on, till the hour of discharge.\n\n\"These rules are added on to the list of rules Dachau already has.

It comes from putting together three different laws about the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gas. They explain what happens to two of the values of that gas while the third stays the same. The three laws are:\nThe combined gas law shows how the three variables are related to each other. It says that:\n\nThe formula of the combined gas law is:\n\nwhere:\n\nTo compare the same gas with two of these cases, the law can be written as:\n\nBy adding Avogadro's law to the combined gas law, we get what is called the ideal gas law.\n\nBoyle's Law states that the pressure-volume product is constant:\nCharles's Law shows that the volume is proportional to the absolute temperature:\nGay-Lussac's Law says that the pressure is proportional to the absolute temperature:\nwhere \"P\" is the pressure, \"V\" the volume and \"T\" the absolute temperature of an ideal gas.\n\nBy combining (1) and either of (2) or (3), we can gain a new equation with \"P\", \"V\" and \"T\". If we divide equation (1) by temperature and multiply equation (2) by pressure we will get:\nAs the left-hand side of both equations is the same, we arrive at\nwhich means that\n\nSubstituting in Avogadro's Law yields the ideal gas equation.\n\nA derivation of the combined gas law using only elementary algebra can contain surprises. For example, starting from the three empirical laws\nwhere \"k\", \"k\", and \"k\" are the constants, one can multiply the three together to obtain\nTaking the square root of both sides and dividing by \"T\" appears to produce of the desired result\nHowever, if before applying the above procedure, one merely rearranges the terms in Boyle's Law, \"k\" = \"PV\", then after canceling and rearranging, one obtains\nwhich is not very helpful if not misleading.\n\nA physical derivation, longer but more reliable, begins by realizing that the constant volume parameter in Gay-Lussac's law will change as the system volume changes. At constant volume, \"V\" the law might appear \"P\" = \"k\"\"T\", while at constant volume \"V\" it might appear \"P\" = \"k\"\"T\".\nDenoting this \"variable constant volume\" by \"k\"(\"V\"), rewrite the law as\nThe same consideration applies to the constant in Charles's law, which may be rewritten\n\nIn seeking to find \"k\"(\"V\"), one should not unthinkingly eliminate \"T\" between (4) and (5), since \"P\" is varying in the former while it is assumed constant in the latter. Rather, it should first be determined in what sense these equations are compatible with one another. To gain insight into this, recall that any two variables determine the third. Choosing \"P\" and \"V\" to be independent, we picture the \"T\" values forming a surface above the \"PV\"-plane. A definite \"V\" and \"P\" define a \"T\", a point on that surface. Substituting these values in (4) and (5), and rearranging yields\nSince these both describe what is happening at the same point on the surface, the two numeric expressions can be equated and rearranged\nNote that and are the slopes of orthogonal lines parallel to the \"P\"-axis/\"V\"-axis and through that point on the surface above the \"PV\" plane. The ratio of the slopes of these two lines depends only on the value of at that point.\n\nNote that the functional form of (6) did not depend on the particular point chosen. The same formula would have arisen for any other combination of P and V values. Therefore, one can write\nThis says that each point on the surface has its own pair of orthogonal lines through it, with their slope ratio depending only on that point. Whereas (6) is a relation between specific slopes and variable values, (7) is a relation between slope functions and function variables. It holds true for any point on the surface, i.e. for any and all combinations of \"P\" and \"V\" values. To solve this equation for the function \"k\"(\"V\"), first separate the variables, \"V\" on the left and \"P\" on the right.\nChoose any pressure \"P\". The right side evaluates to some arbitrary value, call it \"k\".\nThis particular equation must now hold true, not just for one value of \"V\", but for all values of \"V\". The only definition of \"k\"(\"V\") that guarantees this for all \"V\" and arbitrary \"k\" is\nwhich may be verified by substitution in (8).\n\nFinally, substituting (9) in Gay-Lussac's law (4) and rearranging produces the combined gas law\n\nNote that while Boyle's law was not used in this derivation, it is easily deduced from the result. Generally, any two of the three starting laws are all that is needed in this type of derivation – all starting pairs lead to the same combined gas law.\n\nThe combined gas law can be used to explain the mechanics where pressure, temperature, and volume are affected. For example: air conditioners, refrigerators and the formation of clouds and also use in fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n", "id": "564561", "title": "Combined gas law"}

It also acts as a sedative. It has a short duration of action and a rapid onset. The two most common forms are patches that are put on the skin, and an intravenous solution. Paul Janssen developed Fentanyl in 1960. Fentanyl is about 120 times as potent as morphine; this means, much less Fentanyl is needed to get the same effect. \n\nThe effects of the intravenous solution can be seen after three to five minutes. In about twelve hours, the concentration in the bloodstream will have halved. \n\nFentanyl is also used as a recreational drug. This has led to thousands of overdose deaths each year from 2000 to 2015. Deaths have also resulted from improper medical use. Fentanyl has a relatively wide therapeutic index (270) which makes it a very safe surgical anesthetic when monitored carefully. Because it is so potent, finding the right dose to use requires great care: Fentanyl comes as a highly diluted solution. There is also a powder, but its use is impractical without advanced scientific equipment: The effective dose needed and a lethal dose of fentanyl powder placed next to each other would be difficult or impossible to differentiate with the naked eye.\n", "id": "564775", "title": "Fentanyl"}

The second line is free and can rhyme with a line in the next strophe. \n\nTerza rima occurs in sonnets. Sonnets are often composed of two quatrains and two terza rimas, for example abba abba cdc dcd. This scheme can be found in many Italian, Spanish and Portuguese sonnets. This sonnet by the 16th century Portuguese poet Francisco de Sá de Miranda is a good example.\n<poem>\n\"O sol é grande, caem co’a calma as aves,\"\n\"do tempo em tal sazão, que sói ser fria;\"\n\"esta água que d’alto cai acordar-m’-ia\"\n\"do sono não, mas de cuidados graves.\"\n\n\"Ó cousas, todas vãs, todas mudaves,\"\n\"qual é tal coração qu’em vós confia?\"\n\"Passam os tempos vai dia trás dia,\"\n\"incertos muito mais que ao vento as naves.\"\n\n\"Eu vira já aqui sombras, vira flores,\"\n\"vi tantas águas, vi tanta verdura,\"\n\"as aves todas cantavam d’amores.\"\n\n\"Tudo é seco e mudo; e, de mestura,\"\n\"também mudando-m’eu fiz doutras cores:\"\n\"e tudo o mais renova, isto é sem cura!\" \n</poem>\n\nUsually terza rimas are linked to each other making long chain-like sequences. There is an extra line at the end of the sequence. The scheme of rhymes is: aba bcb cdc ded... xyx yzy z. Terza rimas are suitable for long poems. The best known example is The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. Perhaps every child in Italy knows these lines by heart.\n<poem>\n\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\"\n\"mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,\"\n\"ché la diritta via era smarrita.\" \n\n\"Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura\"\n\"esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte\"\n\"che nel pensier rinova la paura!\" \n\n\"Tant’è amara che poco è più morte;\"\n\"ma per trattar del ben ch’i’ vi trovai,\"\n\"dirò de l’altre cose ch’i’ v’ ho scorte.\" \n</poem>\nSpanish poet Bernardo de Balbuena, who lived in Mexico, wrote a long poem in terza rima named \"Grandeza mexicana\"\n<poem>\n\"Oh tú, heroica beldad, saber profundo,\"\n\"que por milagro puesta a los mortales\"\n\"en todo fuiste la última del mundo;\"\n\n\"criada en los desiertos arenales,\"\n\"sobre que el mar del sur resaca y quiebra\"\n\"nácar lustroso y perlas orientales;\"\n\n\"do haciendo a tu valor notoria quiebra,\"\n\"el tiempo fue tragando con su llama\"\n\"tu rico estambre y su preciosa hebra;\"\n</poem>\n\nIn Britain Robert Browning used terza rima in \"The Statue and the Bust\":\n\n<poem>\n\"There ’s a palace in Florence, the world knows well,\" \n\"And a statue watches it from the square,\" \n\"And this story of both do the townsmen tell.\" \n\"Ages ago, a lady there,\" \n\"At the furthest window facing the east,\" \n\"Asked, “Who rides by with the royal air?”' \n\"The bridesmaids’ prattle around her ceased:\"\n\"She leaned forth, one on either hand;\" \n\"They saw how the blush of the bride increased.\"\n</poem>\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley invented a sonnet built of fout terza rimas and a couplet. It rhymes aba bcb cdc ded ee. Shelley used it in \"Ode to the Western Wind\". It consists of five sonnets. Let us look at the first one.\n<poem>\n\"O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn's being,\"\n\"Thou, from whose unseen presence the leaves dead\"\n\"Are driven, like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing,\"\n\n\"Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,\"\n\"Pestilence-stricken multitudes: O thou,\"\n\"Who chariotest to their dark wintry bed\"\n\n\"The winged seeds, where they lie cold and low,\"\n\"Each like a corpse within its grave, until\"\n\"Thine azure sister of the Spring shall blow\"\n\n\"Her clarion o'er the dreaming earth, and fill\"\n\"(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air)\"\n\"With living hues and odours plain and hill:\"\n\n\"Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere;\"\n\"Destroyer and preserver; hear, oh hear!\"\n</poem> American poet Robert Frost in his poem \"Acquainted with the Night\" used aba bcb cdc dad aa scheme.\n\nJan Kasprowicz, who translated Shelley's poem into Polish, used this scheme in a work by his own. It is called \"Cisza wieczorna\". (\"Evening Silence\").\n\nAnother form composed of terza rimas is a villanelle. It is made up of nineteen lines.

It is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology.\n\nReinforcement learning is different from supervised learning because the correct inputs and outputs are never shown. Also, reinforcement learning usually learns as it goes (online learning) unlike supervised learning. This means an agent has to choose between exploring and sticking with what it knows best.\n\nA reinforcement learning system is made of a \"policy\" (formula_1), a \"reward function\" (formula_2), a \"value function\" (formula_3), and an optional \"model\" of the environment.\n\nA \"policy\" tells the agent what to do in a certain situation. It can be a simple table of rules, or a complicated search for the correct action. Policies can even be stochastic, which means instead of rules the policy assigns \"probabilities\" to each action. A policy by itself can make an agent do things, but it can't learn on its own.\n\nA \"reward function\" defines the goal for an agent. It takes in a state (or a state and the action taken at that state) and gives back a number called the \"reward\", which tells the agent how good it is to be in that state. The agent's job is to get the biggest amount of reward it possibly can in the long run. If an action yields a low reward, the agent will probably take a better action in the future. Biology uses reward signals like pleasure or pain to make sure organisms stay alive to reproduce. Reward signals can also be stochastic, like a slot machine at a casino, where sometimes they pay and sometimes they don't.\n\nA \"value function\" tells an agent how much reward it will get following a policy formula_1 starting from state formula_5. It represents how \"desirable\" it is to be in a certain state. Since the value function isn't given to the agent directly, it needs to come up with a good guess or estimate based on the reward it's gotten so far. Value function estimation is the most important part of most reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\nA \"model\" is the agent's mental copy of the environment. It's used to \"plan\" future actions.\n\nKnowing this, we can talk about the main loop for a reinforcement learning episode. The agent interacts with the environment in \"discrete time steps\". Think of it like the \"tick-tock\" of a clock. With discrete time, things only happen during the \"ticks\" and the \"tocks\", and not in between. At each time formula_6, the agent observes the environment's state formula_7 and picks an action formula_8 based on a policy formula_1. The next time step, the agent receives a reward signal formula_10 and a new observation formula_11. The value function formula_12 is updated using the reward. This continues until a terminal state formula_13 is reached", "id": "564854", "title": "Reinforcement Learning"}

Chiggers are almost too small to see with the naked eye, so checking grass for them is near impossible. Chigger bites appear 2-3 hours after a host is bitten, and can last for a few weeks.

It does live in drier places, such as lawns, golf courses, and parks. They are most numerous in early summer when grass, weeds, and other vegetation are heaviest. \n\nIn their larval stage they attach to various animals and feed on skin, often causing itching. \n\nThe best known species of chigger in North America is the hard-biting \"Trombicula alfreddugesi\" of the southeastern United States, humid midwest and Mexico.

It was led by a relatively unknown Confederate General, Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson. His success in this campaign made him one of the most famous Southern generals. Jackson marched his army up and down the Shenandoah Valley for ten weeks. During that time, his army fought in five battles, winning four of them. He defeated three different Union armies. His movements tied down 70,000 Union soldiers, a force four times larger than his own. These soldiers were needed by Union general George B. McClellan for his Peninsula Campaign. Jackson's brilliant Valley Campaign is ranked among the great masterpieces of military strategy. Jackson's campaign is still studied at the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nAfter a series of victories in the West, the Union Army of the Potomac launched a major offensive on the Virginia Peninsula. Their goal was to take Richmond, the Confederate States' capital. The Union was expecting a similar victory that could quickly end the war. In Virginia, the Union army now controlled the western part of the state. They established armies in Fredericksburg and in the lower Shenandoah Valley. While the Shenandoah Valley was important to both sides, it was far more important to the Confederacy. Its geography provided a natural corridor which Confederate armies could use to attack the North. It also provided a safe refuge when the same armies needed to move south again. The Shenandoah Valley was most important because its crops fed the Confederate armies.\n\nThe battle was fought in Frederick County and Winchester, Virginia on March 23, 1862. It was the opening battle in Jackson's Valley Campaign. Jackson's cavalry commander, Colonel Turner Ashby, had skirmished with Union troops on March 22, 1862. On March 23, Jackson sent his cavalry under Ashby against the Union position. Colonel Nathan Kimball, the Union commander, concentrated his forces on Pritchard Hill and also set up his artillery there. Jackson set up his artillery west of Pritchard Hill on Sandy Ridge. During the battle he visited his artillery position. He discovered that while he thought he was attacking a moderate sized Union army, he was in fact fighting an entire division. Seeing a force much larger than his, Jackson turned to his aide and said \"We are in for it.\"\n\nJackson changed his attack plan. He placed his infantry around his guns on Sandy Ridge. Kimball, not realizing that his forces outnumbered Jackson's, attacked Sandy Ridge to silence the Confederate cannons. At about four o'clock, Kimball's infantry ran into Jackson's Stonewall Brigade at the base of Sandy Ridge with heavy fighting. Jackson only managed to hold his position even though he kept sending in more troops. The fight soon turned into a stalemate with neither side being able to push back the other. Kimball began sending in Union reinforcements and by six o'clock the Confederates were running out of ammunition. At this point they began to withdraw. Soon the withdrawal turned into a running fight that only ended after dark.\n\nAlthough the battle was a Confederate tactical defeat, it represented a strategic victory for the South. It prevented the Union from sending forces from the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce McClellan on the peninsula.\n\nAfter the battle of Kernstown, Jackson retreated south to Swift Run Gap. His army joined with Edward Johnson's Army of the Northwest. They were also joined by a division under Richard S. Ewell. Jackson now had about 17,000 Confederate soldiers.\n\nJohnson's Army of the Northwest was about the size of a brigade. At the time he joined Jackson, his army was being followed by a Union brigade commanded by General Robert H. Milroy. Milroy was expecting support by another Union brigade under General Robert C. Schenck. Milroy moved west near the village of McDowell waiting for Milroy. Jackson, now at Staunton, Virginia, advanced his forces west towards Milroy and Scheneck's Union brigades. On May 8, Milroy attacked the Confederates on Sitlington’s Hill. For four hours the two armies fought, finally throwing Milroy's army back at nightfall. While the Confederates suffered greater casualties, Milroy and Schenck retreated into western Virginia during the night. This left Jackson free to push against the other Union army in the valley. He would keep Union forces busy in the valley for another month.\n\nThe next battle was fought on May 23, 1862 at Front Royal, Virginia. Jackson's forces attacked a 1,000 man Union garrison commanded by colonel Kenly. The Confederates surprised the pickets and quickly overran them. They drove the Union force back through the streets of Front Royal to Camp Hill (now Overlook Park in the southeastern part of Winchester). Kenly's force tried to set fire to the river bridges as they retreated but the fires were quickly put out. On Camp Hill, the Union forces made a stand before falling back to Guard Hill. They were quickly outflanked by the Confederate force and retreated towards Cedarville. Confederate cavalry under Major Flournoy made two charges on the retreating Union forces. About 900 Union soldiers surrendered. \n\nJackson's victory at Front Royal caused Union general Nathaniel Banks to move his forces from Strasburg and retreat to Winchester. With Jackson now on his right flank, Banks was in danger of being cut off from his base at Winchester. President Lincoln felt Jackson's army in the Shenandoah Valley threatened the safety of Washington D.C. He ordered General Irvin McDowell's corps to hold their position at Fredericksburg, Virginia and not join McClellan's Union push towards Richmond.\n\nWhen Banks arrived at Winchester, he started organizing his defenses. Jackson's army approached from the south while Ewell's army approached from the southeast. On May 25, Jackson's forces made their first attack, but were thrown back. Ewell's division attacked Camp Hill. At the same time Jackson's Louisiana Brigade outflanked, then overran the Union position on Bower's Hill (southwestern part of Winchester). With their flanks broken, the Union troops began a disorganized retreat through the city of Winchester. Even citizens of Winchester fired on the Union soldiers. Banks retreated across the Potomac River back into Maryland. As a result of the battle, Banks lost about 2,000 men and nearly all of his supplies. The total Confederate casualties numbered only about 400. This was the decisive victory for Jackson's Valley Campaign.\n\nLincoln was now concerned that if Banks could not hold Jackson, his Confederate army might move to attack Washington D.C. On May 24, he had instructed Generals John C. Frémont and Irvin McDowell to send troops to support Banks. This was before Banks was defeated at Winchester. Frémont was ordered to move his forces towards Harrisonburg, Virginia, to the southeast. McDowell was ordered to sent 20,000 of his 40,000 troops to support Banks at Winchester.\n\nOn June 8, Frémont’s 11,500-man Union army found Ewell's Confederate division at Cross Keys, Virginia. Ewell had been ordered to block Frémont's movements towards Port Republic, Virginia. The battle started with a two-hour duel between the Union and Confederate artilleries. A Union flanking maneuver from the left was thrown back by Confederate volley fire. The surprise volley caused 258 Union casualties in just under ten minutes. Frémont did not realize he was dealing with a smaller Confederate force. Under the protection of his artillery batteries, Frémont fell back to the Keezletown Road. The following day, while two Confederate brigades held Frémont where he was, the remainder of Ewell's Confederates moved towards Port Republic.\n\nOn June 9, 1862, the last of the six battles of Jackson's Valley Campaign was fought at Port Republic, Virginia. Jackson had arrived in the area after dark on June 7. The next day he learned that Frémont's Union forces had been prevented from joining those of General James Shields at Cross Keys. Early in the morning of June 9, Jackson's forces used a makeshift bridge to cross over the South River in Virginia. Union general Erastus B. Tyler placed artillery batteries on a ridge covering the front of the Union position. When Jackson arrived he ordered an assault across the wheat field without taking the time to organize his forces. He had also not made a reconnaissance to find out what Union forces were there and how they were placed. The Stonewall Brigade led the Confederate charge. As they moved forward they came under heavy attack from Tyler's artillery batteries. Jackson sent Richard Taylor's Louisiana brigade on a flank attack against the Union artillery. But the Union gunners saw the flank attack developing and pinned down the Confederates with artillery fire. Jackson knew he had to break through the Union line before Frémont could join Shields. While Jackson was trying to find a way to solve the problem, Ewell's men arrived from Cross Keys. Ewell immediately saw the problem and he attacked the Union left flank. This gave the Stonewall Brigade time to regroup. Confederate artillery batteries opened up on the Union front. This caused the Union line to break and fall back in retreat. This last victory gave Jackson control of the upper and middle Shenandoah Valley.\n\nJackson's Valley Campaign in the spring of 1862 was a tremendous success. In just 48 days, his approximately 17,000 Confederates had marched up and down the Shenandoah Valley. They engaged and defeated three different Union armies totaling about 52,000 men. Jackson kept them from reinforcing McClellan's army on the Virginia Peninsula. The campaign cost the Union 5,735 casualties at a loss of about 2,441 Confederate casualties. They captured so many supplies from Banks' army that Confederate soldiers began referring to the Union general as \"Commissary Banks.\"\n", "id": "565041", "title": "Jackson's Valley Campaign"}

The Forester family of Northumberland provided the Crown with governors of the castle for 400 years, before the Crown granted ownership to Sir John Forester. When the family became bankrupt, the castle was sold to a series of owners. Eventually it was bought by the Armstrong family, who still own it today.

Such sails are described as fore-and-aft rigged.\n\nTwo of the earliest fore-and-aft rigged sailing designs were the Chinese junk and the triangular lateen sails of the Egyptian Feluccas and dhows. The lateen sail was used by Greek ships as early as the 9th century. By the 11th century the fore-and-aft rig began to be used in the Italian city-states and the Mediterranean Sea. The generally gentle climate made its use practical. There seems to be no record of when it was first used in Northern Europe. The square rigged sails came first in the North. The Vikings used square rigged sails which became popular in Britain and Northern Europe. They certainly had seen its use in the course of trade and during the Crusades. The Renaissance changed this. Slowly the fore-and-aft rig came into common use on rivers and in estuaries in Britain, Northern France, and the Low Countries. The square rig remained standard for the harsher conditions of the open North Sea as well as for transatlantic sailing. The lateen sail was more maneuverable and faster, while the square rig was clumsy but seaworthy.\n\n\n", "id": "565375", "title": "Fore-and-aft rig"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=565376", "text": "Sloop\n\nA sloop is a sailboat usually with one mast and fore-and-aft rigged sails. It can also describe a square rigged sailing ship of two or more masts which is sometimes called a sloop of war. The French called them corvettes. Originally the definition of a sloop was vague. A 1750 book said sloops \"are sailed and masted as men's fancies lead them, sometimes with one mast, with two, and with three.\" Modern recreational sloops are almost always one-masted sailing ships with fore-and-aft sails. Their simple layout makes them popular with amateur sailors. The sloop is a manageable sailboat layout up to a length of about .\n\nThe sloop design dates back to the early part of the 17th century. By the 20th century they became very popular. Their main advantages are their ease of handling and ability to sail upwind (into the wind). \n\nAn early 17th century design was the Bermuda sloop, so-named for the Bermuda trade with North America. It was designed to be fast and could sail in both directions. They needed to be fast to outrun French privateers. The hull was made from Bermuda cedar. The wood was light and resisted rot. They had from one to three masts. \nMost modern sailboats are based on the Bermuda sloop design. The Bermuda rig replaced the earlier gaff rig which used a four-cornered sail (instead of a triangular sail) and a spar. A gaff rig design allows more sail on a mast. Another advantage is the gaff rig and other early designs can spill wind faster in a blow (heavy wind). \n\nThe sloop of war was the most numerous design in the Royal Navy by the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Yet very little has been written about them or their French counterpart, the Corvettes. Later, the United States used sloops of war. The Royal Navy used the class of \"sloop\" right up until the end of World War II. The sailing sloop, like its larger cousin the frigate, were fast and used in a variety of roles. They were not usually used in battle, but were more often used for support in reconnaissance and for carrying messages. They were probably the best of the Royal Navy sailing ships for maneuverability and could function in all but the roughest sea conditions.\n\n\n", "id": "565376", "title": "Sloop"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=565383", "text": "Brig\n\nA brig is a sailing ship with two square-rigged masts. During the Age of Sail, brigs were seen as fast and maneuverable. They were used as both naval warships and merchant vessels. Even after the sailing age ended they were used as training ships. The brig was one of the smaller two-masted sailing ships. They popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Brigs fell out of use with the arrival of the steam ship because they required a relatively large crew for their small size. They were also difficult to sail into the wind. They are not to be confused with a brigantine, which has different rigging (a brigantine has a gaff-rigged mainsail, while a brig has a square mainsail with an additional gaff-rigged spanker behind the mainsail). A brig is different from a three-masted ship because it only has two masts.\n\nIn sailing, a full-rigged brig is a vessel with two square rigged masts (called the fore and main). The main mast of a brig is the aft (rear) one. To improve maneuverability, the mainmast carries a small (gaff rigged) fore-and-aft sail.\nBrig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached. Those attached to the main mast are called the mainsail; above that the main topsail and above that the main topgallant sail. Occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the mainsail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars. These can be extended, which lengthens the yard. This allows it to receive an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails. They are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are named after the sails to which they are fastened. For example, the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.\n\nThe brig’s foremast is smaller than the main mast. The fore mast holds a foresail, fore topsail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the running rigging. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized. This was because, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color. The standing rigging was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color.\n\nA brig is \"generally built on a larger scale than a schooner. It could approach the size of a full-sized, three-masted ship.\" Brigs varried in length between 75 and 165 ft (23–50 m) with tonnages up to 480. Historically, most brigs were made of wood. However some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron. Brigs with pine hulls were built in the 19th century. They was designed to last for about twenty years although many lasted longer.\n\nBrigs were used as small warships carrying about 10 to 18 cannons. Due to their speed and maneuverability they were popular among pirates (though they were rare among American and Caribbean pirates). Their use stretches back before the 17th century. However one of the most famous periods for the brig was during the 19th century when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the Battle of Lake Erie. In the early 19th century the brig was a standard cargo ship. It was seen as \"fast and well sailing\", but required a large crew to handle its rigging. While brigs could not sail into the wind as easily as fore-and-aft–rigged vessels such as schooners a skilled brig captain could \"manoeuvre it with ease and elegance; a brig could for instance turn around almost on the spot\". A brig's square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling in the open ocean. When fore-and aft rigged vessels sailed downwind for extended distances and where \"the danger of a sudden jibe was the large schooner-captain's nightmare\". This trait later led to the evolution of the barquentine. The need for large crews in relation to their smaller size led to the decline of the production of brigs. They were replaced in commercial traffic by gaff sail schooners (which needed smaller crews) and steam boats (which did not have the windward performance problems of square rigged ships).\n\nThe \"Telos\", built in Bangor, Maine in 1883, was reportedly the last brig to join the American merchant marine. It was \"considered to be the finest vessel of her class ever constructed in Maine\". She was wrecked on Aves Island, off Bonaire in the Caribbean, in 1900.\n", "id": "565383", "title": "Brig"}

Its tack (lower leading edge) is attached to the bowsprit, to the bow, or to the deck between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and spinnakers are the two main types of headsails on a modern boat.\n\nSchooners typically have up to three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast forestay and is generally called the \"jib topsail\". A second jib on the main forestay is called \"the jib\". The innermost jib is called \"the staysail\". Actually, all three sails are both jibs and staysails, in a general sense. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could have as many as six. \n\nFrom forward (fore) to the back of the boat (aft), these sails are called:\n\nThe first two were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds. A storm jib was a small jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.\n\nBoats may be sailed using a jib alone. More commonly jib(s) make a minor direct contribution to moving the boat, compared to a mainsail. Generally, a jib's most important function is as an airfoil, increasing performance and overall stability of the mainsail.\nOn boats with only one jib, it is common for the clew of the jib to be further aft than the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a \"genoa jib\" or simply a genoa (see illustration). These are efficiently used when reaching more broadly than a close reach. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the mainsail is reefed; these more rugged sails are called \"storm jibs\" or \"spitfires\".\n\nOn a boat with two staysails the inner sail is called the \"staysail\", and the outer (foremost) is called the jib. This combination of two staysails is called a \"cutter rig\" (or in North America a \"yankee pair\") and a boat with one mast rigged with two staysails and a mainsail is called a cutter.\n\nOn cruising yachts, and nearly all racing sailboats, the jib needs to be worked when tacking. On these yachts, there are two sheets (ropes) attached to the clew of the jib. As the yacht comes head to wind during a tack, the active sheet is released. At the same time the other sheet (the \"lazy sheet\") on the other side of the boat is pulled in. This sheet becomes the new \"active sheet\" until the next tack.\n\n", "id": "565498", "title": "Jib"}

The work was published in New York by G. P. Putnam & Company in 1876. It was author's last big book. The poem is really huge. It is composed of four parts. It consists of 150 cantos and comprises almost 18, 000 lines. It is written in rhymed verse. All the poem is written in iambic tetrameter, only final section is written in iambic pentameter. In some places the poet uses alliteration. The poem tells about a young man, named Clarel, who went on a trip to the Holy Land. The journey became for him a pilgrimage. The main theme of the poem is the seeking for faith. The main hero had lost his faith during his studies and wanted it back. One of his companions, named Vine, is believed to be a portrait of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne was Melville's friend and a writer, too. The poem ends with some words of hope for the hero.\n\n<poem>\n\"Then keep thy heart, though yet but ill-resigned --\"\n\"Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind;\"\n\"That like the crocus budding through the snow --\"\n\"That like a swimmer rising from the deep --\"\n\"That like a burning secret which doth go\"\n\"Even from the bosom that would hoard and keep;\"\n\"Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming sea,\"\n\"And prove that death but routs life into victory.\"\n</poem>\n\nMelville's poem was not much appreciated in 19th century.

This incident occurred near the city of Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Because the incident occurred near the city, this incident is sometimes referred to as the Windsor Incident.\n\nThe incident was caused because of the cargo door. The cargo door was blown out of the plane because the locks of the cargo door failed. When the locks failed, the cargo door blew out and caused rapid decompression in the cargo area of the airplane.

The rudder of the airplane was jammed to the right, and cable controls to the second engine were separated. Luckily, no hydraulics were broken. Despite having little control of the airplane, Captain Bryce McCormick was successful in landing the airplane at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.

It is one of the finest examples of sonnet form in Old Polish literature. The poem is a part of \"The Poems of Lent\" (in Polish \"Poezje postu świętego\"). It was translated into English by Michael J. Mikoś (Michael J. Mikos).\n\nStanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski was a Polish nobleman. He was born in 1642. He travelled a lot in his youth. He visited France, Spain, Italy and Austria. He as interested in literature and theatre. After he had returned to Poland, he became a politician. He was a member of Sejm (Parliament). He became also the Great Marshall (that is a secretary of internal affairs). He died in 1702.\n\nThe sonnet was not very popular in Old Polish literature. This genre existed for three hundred years in Italy, when Polish poets started writing such poems. The first poet to write sonnets in Polish was Jan Kochanowski. After him two notable poets wrote such poems. They were Mikołaj Sęp Szarzyński and Sebastian Grabowiecki.\n\n\"Sonnet on the Great Suffering of Jesus Christ\" is one of the best poems of the genre in 17th century Polish poetry. It follows the rules of Italian sonnet. It is made up of 11-syllable lines. All Italian sonnets were written in \"endecasillabo\" that is 11-syllable metre. The rhyme scheme is the most classical. There are only four rhymes. The scheme is abba abba cdc dcd.\n\n<poem >\n\"Wielkiej miłości i nieogarnionej\"\n\"Tryumf, czy piekła łupy, czy mogiły\"\n\"Zawisnej śmierci, czy niebieskiej siły\"\n\"Są cudem męki, co zniósł Bóg wcielony?\"\n\n\"Moc, myśl, żal, strach, pot, krew, sen zwyciężony,\"\n\"Zdrada, powrozy, łzy, sąd i niemiły\"\n\"Twarzy policzek, i rózgi, co biły,\"\n\"Słup, cierń, krzyż, gwóźdź, żółć i bok otworzony\"\n\n\"Są to dobroci dary, a nie męki,\"\n\"Nie dary, ale łaski źrzódła żywe,\"\n\"Nie źrzódła, ale boskie cuda ręki,\"\n\n\"Tej ręki, co nam zbawienie szczęśliwe\"\n\"Z swych ran wylała, za które niech dzięki\"\n\"Oddaje-ć serce, o dobro prawdziwe!\"\n</poem>\n\nAn unusual feature of the poem is a long enumeration in the 5th line and in the 8th line. It is composed of 1-syllable words. In Polish language such words are very rare. Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski was not the only poet to use such a poetic device.

Originate from medieval Bosnians or Bošnjani, Slavic that inhabited the then Bosnia. Medieval Bosniaks/Bosnians (called Dobri bošnjani = \"Good Bosnians\") were of different faiths and spoke Bosnian language. Today Bosniaks are mostly Bosnian-speeking, and serve Latin alphabet and Cyrillic alphabet. Most modern Bosniaks make Muslim, while a smaller number agnostic and atheists. As nation belong to European, and Islamic civilization heritage.\n\nAfter the Oxford English Dictionary, the ethnonym of \"Bosniak\" was first useewd in English by British diplomat and historian Paul Rycaut in 1680 as \"Bosnack\", cognate with post-classical Latin \"Bosniacus\" (possible earlier to 1682 ), French \"Bosniaque\" (1695 or earlier) or German \"Bosniak\" (1737 or earlier). The modern spelling is contained in the 1836 \"Penny Cyclopaedia\" V. 231/1: \n\nIt is widesprwead in the all of Slavic languages, that \"-ak\" is a common suffix to words for masculine nouns forming; for example, it also found in the ethnonym of Poles (\"Polak\") and Slovaks (\"Slovák\"). Consequently, \"Bosniak\" is logic equivalent to its non-ethnic counterpart \"Bosnian\" (which entered English around the same time via the Middle French, \"Bosnien\"): a native of Bosnia.\n\nEnglish-speakers frequently refer to Bosniaks as \"Bosnian Muslims\". This term is associatet with inaccurate since not all Bosniaks profess Islam or practice the religion. Partly because of this, since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, \"Bosniak\" has replaced \"Muslim\" as an official ethnic term in part to avoid confusion with the religious term \"Muslim\" as an adherent of Islam. or simply as \"Bosnians\", though the latter term can also denote all inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina (regardless of ethnic origin) or apply to citizenship in the country.\n\nFew million Bosniaks live in the Balkans, with an estimated additional million settled and living around the world. Ethnic cleansing and genocide during World War II (1939-1945) and the Bosnian War (1993–95) have had a tremendous effect on the territorial distribution of the population. Partially due to this, a significant Bosniaksdiaspora exists in a number of countries, including Bosnian Austrians, Germany, Bosnian Australians, Sweden, Turkey, Bosnian Canadians and the Bosnian Americans. Both within the Balkans region and throughout the world, Bosniaks are often noted for their unique culture, which has been influenced by both eastern and western civilizations and schools of thought over the course of their history.\n\n", "id": "565727", "title": "Bosniaks"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=566022", "text": "Lateen\n\nA lateen (from French \"latine\", meaning \"Latin\") or latin-rig is a triangular sail set on a long yard mounted at an angle on the mast. It runs in a fore-and-aft direction.\n\nA square sail is a very simple device. It catches a following wind and pushes the vessel forward. The lateen sail is more complex. It is set at an angle to the wind. It works be creating a difference in air pressure between the two sides (concave and convex) of the sail. This is the same way a fore-and-aft sail works. This is why the lateen sail is considered the ancestor of the fore-and-aft sail. The advantages of the lateen sail is that it is effective in lighter winds. It causes less drag and so is more efficient. It allows the vessel to sail much \"closer to the wind\" (meaning it can sail at up to about 45 degrees into the wind). This made the lateen sail a very important invention.\n\nThe lateen sail did not directly come from the square sail. There was an intermediate sail type called the lug sail. It was one of the earliest fore-and-aft rigs. It was developed for use on the Indian Ocean. Sailors knew that the wind does not always come from behind the vessel. They learned that the square sail could be made more efficient by turning it on the mast so it remained at a right angle to the wind. When used with a keel and some form of steering, it provided more options. Instead of simply sailing downwind, the vessel could move in different directions relative to the direction of the wind. If the wind came from the beam (side of the ship), rotating the sail became less effective. But, if the luff (edge of the sail) was pointed into the wind and kept taut, the sail would provide forward movement. They may not have understood the reasons why it worked only that it worked. This could be made more effective if the yard (or spar) holding the sail is sloped downward into the wind. From this discovery came the lug, then the lateen. \n\nIn ancient history the square sail was used in the Mediterranean. It was used on seagoing ships of the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Greeks and Romans. In Northern Europe at this time, they only used the square sail. This was even after the ships in the Mediterranean were using the triangular lateen sails.\n\nThe 15th and 16th century caravel was a favorite type of ship used in the Portuguese and Spanish voyages of discovery. In addition to their distinctive single sterncastle, they carried lateen sails. During this time the caravel developed into a very fast and highly maneuverable ship. Two of Christopher Columbus's ships, the \"Niña\" and the \"Pinta\" were caravels. He repeatedly praised the \"Niña\" as his fastest and favorite ship.\n\n", "id": "566022", "title": "Lateen"}

It also means the course you are on relative to the direction of the oncoming wind. A tack with the wind blowing over the port (left) side of the boat is called a \"port tack\". A tack with the wind coming over the starboard side of the boat is called a \"starboard tack\". The sailboat's helmsman is responsible for communicating with the rest of the crew when making a tacking maneuver. When making a tack the helmsman calls out \"ready about!\" When the crew is ready they call out \"ready\", and the maneuver is started. The opposite of a tack (into the wind) is a jibe (changing direction while moving with the wind).\n\nIn order to tack a boat moving into the wind, some speed is necessary. If too much time is taken in completing the tack, the forward momentum will be lost and the boat may move backwards. If a sailboat is caught going directly into the wind, it is called \"in irons.\" This stops all forward motion of the boat. A tacking maneuver is a basic skill that is learned with practice. The maneuver also is different in a single person small sailboat than in a 40 or 50 foot racing sailboat.\n\nBeating is the procedure by which a ship moves on a zig-zag course to make progress directly into the wind (upwind). No sailing vessel can move directly into the wind (though that may be the desired direction). Beating allows the vessel to advance indirectly upwind.\n\nA ship that is beating will sail as \"close to the wind\" as possible. This position is known as close hauled. In general, the closest angle to the wind that a ship can sail is around 35 to 45 degrees. Some modern yachts can sail very near to the wind, while older ships, especially square-rigged ships, cannot sail very close to the wind.\n\n", "id": "566043", "title": "Tacking (sailing)"}

It was released on July 25, 2014 and was one of two movies released in 2014 which were about the mythical warrior, the other being The Legend of Hercules; unlike the former, this film gained mixed to positive critical reviews and was a box office success.\nHercules (Dwayne Johnson), is the leader of a gang of mercenaries, comprised of the prophet Amphariaus (Ian McShane), the thief Autylocus (Rufus Sewell), the barbarian Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), the huntress Atalanta (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal) and his nephew Iolaus (Reece Ritchie). Hercules is supposedly the lovechild of Zeus and a mortal woman who engaged in 12 legendary labors, but was betrayed by Hera, who induced him with madness, which caused him to kill his wife and children while he was visiting King Eurystheus (Joseph Fiennes). Despite Hercules' origins not being clearly established in the movie, he displays powerful godlike strength and unmatched skill in combat. However, he is frequently plagued by the memory of murdering his family and visions of the three-headed hellhound Cerberus.\n\nAfter saving his nephew on the coast of Macedonia, Hercules celebrates with his team. As they drink in a tavern, the group are approached by Ergenia (Rebecca Ferguson), the daughter of Lord Cotys (John Hurt) who wants Hercules to train the Thracian armies to defend his kingdom from the warrior king Rhesus, to which the hero accepts. The band are welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles (Peter Mullan). However, Rhesus has reached the Bessi people Cotys insists that Hercules leads the army into battle to defend the tribe, despite their lack of training. However, they arrive too late as Rhesus has cursed the Bessi into turning against the Thracians.\n", "id": "566170", "title": "Hercules (2014 movie)"}

The standing rigging is used to support the masts. The running rigging supports the yards and sails. Some types of sailboats that have unsupported masts do not have any rigging. These include the junk rig and catboat rigs. Bermuda sloops with a single mast and one headsail use fairly simple rigging. Cutter-rigged ketches and schooners have the most complex rigging.\n\nA sailing ship's standing rigging is made up of the ropes used to support the masts, yards and booms. Most modern sailing vessels use wire rope for the the standing rigging. Modern standing rigging is regularly checked for tension using a special gauge. Adjusting the tension is done by use of a turnbuckle. Ropes, wires or rods that run fore-and-aft along the centerline which stabilize the masts or spars are called stays. Those that from the mast to the bow are called forestays. Those that run from the mast to the stern are called backstays.\n\nThe running rigging of a sailing vessel controls the sails. The running rigging is usually made up of various kinds of rope (ropes are also called lines). It uses blocks and Sheaves to adjust the length of the ropes. A block is a kind of pulley. A sheave is the grooved wheel inside the block. Larger sailing boats and ships use winches. The adjustability of the running rigging allows the boat to perform various maneuvers such as tacking and jibing. Common to all sailboats are the outhaul and the downhaul. The outhaul pulls the sail to the free end of the boom. The downhaul keeps the boom from rising on the mast. \n\n", "id": "566190", "title": "Rigging"}

He is known for the building of the first pyramid built in Egypt, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. The Third Dynasty, based in Memphis, was the beginning of the Old Kingdom, a period of stability, achievement and unity.\n\nThere have been claims that he was not the first king, as the Abydos King List and the Turin King List give a king by the name of Sanakht. There is no archaeological evidence to support this, and most experts agree that Djoser was the first. He ruled for at least 20 years, but he had so many temples, tombs and monuments built that some experts say he may have ruled for up to 30 years.\n\nThere is a painted limestone statue of Djoser, which is the oldest discovered life sized Egyptian statue. It was found in Saqqara during archaeological digging in 1924-1925. The statue is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nThe building of the Step Pyramid was quite an achievement. It is the first massive monument built in stone, about 62 meters in height. It is surrounded by a 10 meter high wall, which encloses an area of about 16 hectares. It shows that the kingdom must have been stable and wealthy to have spent so much time and money to build it. The man who designed it and supervised the building was Imhotep, the oldest named architect known to us. Thousands of years later, Djoser was known to Egyptians as the \"opener of stone\", recognising his legacy of using stone for buildings.\n\nThe Egyptians believed in a story of how Djoser was able to end a famine. There is no evidence from the time of his rule, but an engraved stone, a stele, was made 2000 years later giving the details. Even if the story is a legend, it does show that Djoser was remembered as a great pharaoh. Egypt had been suffering from a famine for seven years, when the god of the Nile, Khnum, spoke to Djoser in a dream. Djoser rebuilt Khnum's temple on Elephantine, an island near modern Aswan. This pleased the god, and the famine ended. The ruins of the temple are still visible today.\n", "id": "566244", "title": "Djoser"}

He became the first Republican governor of Georgia in over 130 years since Benjamin F.

He helped Georgia moved up from last place in the country in SAT scores. Although it returned to last place in 2005, Georgia rose to 49th place in 2006 in the combined math and reading mean score, including the writing portion added to the test that year. Perdue also created additional opportunities for charter schools and private schools. In 2006, Perdue signed a law that gave Georgia \"some of the nation's toughest measures against illegal immigrants\". \n\nIn 2006, Perdue was re-elected to a second term in the 2006 Georgia gubernatorial election, winning nearly 58% of the vote. His Democratic opponent was Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor. Libertarian Garrett Michael Hayes was also on the ballot.\n\nOn November 13, 2007, while Georgia suffered from one of the worst droughts in several decades, Perdue led a group of several hundred people in a prayer on the steps of the state Capitol. Perdue addressed the crowd, saying \"We’ve come together here simply for one reason and one reason only: To very reverently and respectfully pray up a storm\" and \"God, we need you; we need rain\".\n\nOn January 2, 2017, it was reported that Perdue had emerged as President-elect Donald Trump's leading contender for the nomination to be Secretary of Agriculture in his incoming administration. On January 18, 2017, senior Trump transition officials announced that Perdue would be his nominee as Secretary of Agriculture.\n\nThe Senate committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry approved his nomination on March 30, with a 19-1 vote. Senator David Perdue (R-GA) abstained, as he is the nominee's first cousin. His nomination will receive the full senate vote on April 24.\n\nPerdue is the second Secretary of Agriculture from the Deep South. The first was Mike Espy of Mississippi, who served under President Bill Clinton from January 1993 to December 1994.\n\nOn April 24, 2017, Perdue's nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate with a 87-11 vote. He was sworn-in by Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas the next day.\n\nPerdue and his wife, Mary (nee Ruff), were married in 1972 after dating for four years.

Jan Kochanowski, the greatest poet of the Renaissance in Kingdom of Poland, wrote many lyrical pieces and some stories in verse.

They were \"Jerusalem Delivered\" by Torquato Tasso and \"Orlando Furioso\" by Ludovico Ariosto. \n\nThe historical importance of Piotr Kochanowski's translation lies in its form. The poet used exactly the same form, ottava rima. It is an Italian strophe of eight lines. It is built of 11-syllable lines (endecasillabo in Italian). It rhymes abababcc. The strophe was used by Italian poets from 14th century. There are many long poems in ottava rima in Italian literature of 15th and 16th centuries.

The sail is usually attached to a boom at its foot. It has a number of variations. Due to the physics of the wind, the tall thin sails of the Bermudian rigs have more power sailing into the wind than other types. This is why it is such a popular rig with modern sailboats. It was called a Marconi rig after the inventor Guglielmo Marconi because its system of mast stays that looked like the early wireless masts. However, the name Bermuda rig was in use two centuries earlier. It came from the late 1600s when European sailors noticed how well the small sloops in Bermuda worked.\n\nIt was developed in Bermuda in the 17th century. It was based on the leg-of-mutton sail. The strong gusty winds around the Bermuda islands made sailing around the waters difficult to navigate. The prevailing winds came out of the west which lined up with the islands. In addition, the number of reefs around the islands required caution. Most other sail designs did not address these issues.\n\nIt is widely thought the first of these designs was a fore-and-aft rig built by in the 17th century by a Dutch-born Bermudan. While his name is not remembered, he may have seen the Moorish lateen rigs that were widely used during the time Spain ruled Holland. The Dutch modified early lateen rigs turning the yards into angled masts. This design was called \"bezaanjacht\" in Dutch (in English this meant \"leg of mutton\"). By the 19th century the design had d into using tall triangular sails and jibs. They also used Bermuda cedar for the hulls which is much lighter than oak. This made the Bermuda sailboats very fast and easily maneuverable. They could travel into the wind with ease and were especially fast when heading downwind. Very soon they were being raced.\n\nThe name Marconi rig came from the 1899 America's Cup yacht race held in New York. Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated his new wireless radio by reporting on the race. The masts of the Bermudan rigged vessels with their supporting cables looked like the wireless mast of Marconi's radio.

His colleague  helped him and together they prepared a gel. This gel absorbed up to 40% of water and was transparent. This new material is the Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). They patented it in 1953. Wichterle thought that it might be a good material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. In 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses. The problem was that the edges tore when the lense was getting removed. He wanted to find a better way to make them. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the beacuse of its Communist leadership in 1958. So the research at the Institute came to an end, but he did the important experiments to transform into a good shape of a contact lens by himself at home.\n\nBy late 1961 produced the first four hydrogel contact lenses on a home-made apparatus built from children's building kit (Merkur). All the glass tubing was also made by himself. On Christmas afternoon he finally made a contact lense in his apparatus. He tried the lenses in his own eyes. He said that they were comfortable. He built more new prototype machines using Merkur toys with stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these devices he made 5,500 lenses.\nWichterle was well-known all around the world not only because of his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations.

Most of the city is in Maricopa County. The the northern part is in Yapavai County. It is a major suburb of Phoenix. It was named for Peoria, Illinois because that is where many of the early settlers came from.\n\nIn the 2010 United States Census, 154,065 people lived in the city. Peoria is the the ninth largest city in Arizona. Peoria has a Mayor–council government; a mayor and six councilmen who are all elected.\n\nSmall groups of hunter-gatherers called Paleo-Indians moved through what would later become Peoria. Spear points found in Peoria date from 10,000–8,000 BC and show there was hunting activity here. About 1500 BC, there was farming here which indicates that semi-nomadic peoples used the area. From about 1–500 AD the peoples here settled into two areas. There were crops being raised here in the Peoria area during the spring and summer. At other times they lived in the upland areas where they gathered seeds, cholla, and cactus fruits.\n\nThere is evidence that the Hohokam lived here before 1150 AD. They built their houses out of wattle and daub. Later they used adobe and stone. They vanished after about the mid-1400s. They left almost no clues as to where they went or what happened to their civilization.\nAs late as the 1870s, small bands of Yavapai were farming small pieces of land in the area depending on surface runoff and springs for water. \n\nEuropean and American explorers discovered gold in 1863 near Wickenburg, Arizona. This caused a conflict with the Yavapai in the area. Ranchers were attracted to the area because of the grasslands for cattle. Relations with the Yavapai turned to war over the land. This was in part because the American Civil War caused the Army to leave the area. When the army returned, the Yavapai were eventually removed to a reservation. \n\nFor about 13 years, the area around what would become Peoria lay vacant. In the late 1880s, four farming families moved to Peoria from Peoria, Illinois, naming the new town after the town they came from. From that time Peoria steadily grew as a farming community. Peoria incorporated in 1954. \n\nLake Pleasant Regional Park is a large recreational area that is in Peoria. It serves the entire Phoenix area. Its main feature is the 10,000 acre (40 km² or 15.6 mi²) Lake Pleasant. It is an artificial reservoir that has campgrounds, boating and fishing. \n\nPeoria also is home the Peoria Sports Complex.

The number of poems increased from 150 to 645.\n\nThere is a pun in the title of the book. \"Sláva\" in Czech means \"Fame\".

This part is written in hexameter and pentameter. The metre is shaped like Greek one. It is based on lenght of vowels. \n<poem>\n\"Ai, zde leží zem ta, před okem mým selzy ronícím,\"\n\"někdy kolébka, nyní národu mého rakev.\"\n\"Stoj noho! posvátná místa jsou, kamkoli kráčíš,\"\n\"k obloze, Tatry synu, vznes se, vyvýše pohled.\" \n</poem>\nThe poem is divided into five parts.
