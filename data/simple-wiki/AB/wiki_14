{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=585784", "text": "Michael Cole (wrestling)\n\nMichael Sean Coulthard (born December 8, 1968) better known by his stage name Michael Cole, is an American professional wrestling commentator, show host, voice actor and former journalist. He is signed to WWE where he serves as the play-by-play commentator on \"Raw\" and \"Raw\" pay-per-view events.\n\nCoulthard began his career in the media as a journalist, working for CBS Radio. His first high-profile assignment was to cover the 1988 US presidential campaign of Democratic Party nominee Michael Dukakis. In 1992, he reported on the presidential campaign of Bill Clinton. Coulthard covered the 51-day siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993. The following year, he spent nine months covering the Yugoslavian civil war. In 1995, he was also selected to cover the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing. He returned to the presidential campaign trail in 1996 to cover the campaigns of Steve Forbes and Sen. Bob Dole.\n\nCoulthard came to the World Wrestling Federation in mid-1997 after being recommended to company officials by Todd Pettengill, and started using the stage name \"Michael Cole\". He provided voice-overs for promotional videos and later became the host of LiveWire show alongside Jim Cornette. Cole first appeared on screen at the June 30, 1997 episode of \"Raw is War\", interviewing the Legion of Doom and replaced Todd Pettengill as a backstage interviewer after Summerslam. In late 1997, Cole became one of the three announcers for the first hour of \"Monday Night Raw\", alongside Jim Ross and Kevin Kelly. Eventually Cole was permanently replaced by Jerry Lawler later in the year. In 1999, Cole became the regular play-by-play announcer for \"Monday Night Raw\", subbing for Jim Ross when Ross was devastated by Bell's palsy.\n\nWhen the promotion's new \"SmackDown!\" television program debuted later that year, Cole was chosen to be the show's play-by-play announcer. Originally his broadcast partner was Jerry Lawler, but when Lawler briefly left the WWF, he was replaced by Cole's \"WWE Sunday Night Heat\" broadcast partner Tazz shortly before the WWF vs. WCW/ECW invasion storyline. Cole also had a stint doing commentary on \"SmackDown!\"'s former sister show \"WWE Velocity\".\n\nAs an announcer, Cole was rarely involved in storylines; however, he has had minor roles in storylines involving Heidenreich, Stephanie McMahon, Vito, and D-Generation X (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Chyna, and Rick Rude). His 2004 angle with Heidenreich became infamous due to an implied scene where Heidenreich \"Heidenraped\" him in the arena restroom. In a 2008 interview, Heidenreich explained that the Cole rape angle was McMahon's idea, and that \"Pulp Fiction\" came to mind when Stephanie McMahon approached him with the idea. He also appeared in the \"Taxi Driver\" parody trailer in promotion of WrestleMania 21.\n\nCole called play-by-play at the 2006 Royal Rumble match because Ross, who had commentated the last two Royal Rumble matches with Tazz, had been (kayfabe) \"fired\" and replaced by former ECW play-by-play man Joey Styles, reuniting the original \"SmackDown!\" team of Cole and Lawler. On February 3, 2006, it was announced that Cole and Tazz were starting a radio show on Howard Stern's Howard 100 on Sirius Satellite Radio, but the show was a trial run that only lasted a couple of weeks.\n\nOn April 26, 2006, WWE announced that Cole would become the Managing Editor of WWE.com. Shortly after, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon told shareholders in a meeting held on September 14 that he thought that the website \"sucks\". In response, Cole replied on WWE.com about updated content for the website: a broadband network with original web-only shows have been scheduled for October, with a new mobile offering, a re-vamped subscription site and more exclusive videos and photos. Cole went on to say, \"So in summary, the web site does suck, compared to where we are going to take it, but it won’t suck for long. Wish I could say the same for the boss.\"\n\nOn the June 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Cole's broadcast partner Tazz left from SmackDown to ECW on SciFi, leaving Cole at that moment without a broadcast partner. At ECW One Night Stand, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield announced he would replace Tazz as color commentator. This proved true five days later when he appeared on that week's episode of \"SmackDown!\" as Cole's new broadcast partner. After JBL left the broadcast booth and returned to wrestling action on \"Raw\", Jonathan Coachman became Cole's new partner on January 4, 2008. Coachman was then replaced by Mick Foley beginning at Backlash on April 27, 2008.\n\nAs a part of the 2008 WWE Draft, Cole was drafted to the \"Raw\" brand as Jim Ross was drafted to the \"SmackDown\" brand. This effectively ended Cole's near 10-year run as play-by-play commentator on \"Smackdown\" in which he called every episode except for two. (The two episodes were the series premiere and the 9/11 Tribute show, both of which were called by Ross.) On the July 7, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Cole was attacked by Kane. He repeatedly asked Cole \"Is he alive or dead?\" before Cole was saved by Jerry Lawler. Cole made his in-ring debut as Lawler's partner against the tag team of Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase; a match for the World Tag Team Championship. Cole and Lawler lost after Cole inadvertently tagged himself in, and was quickly pinned by Rhodes after a lariat. At the 2009 Slammy Awards, Cole won The \"Oh My God\" Moment of the Year award for vomiting on Chris Jericho at \"SmackDown\"'s 10th Anniversary show on October 2.\n\nCole became the lead commentator for \"WWE NXT\" when the show debuted on February 23, 2010, along with Josh Mathews as the color commentator. Cole hinted at turning heel when he began showing signs of arrogance and cockiness towards face wrestlers and WWE fans alike. He also began to belittle certain rookies on the show, mainly Daniel Bryan. Cole began showing a liking to The Miz, who was Bryan's pro on that season, and who was becoming a significant heel on \"Raw\". On the May 18 episode of \"NXT\", Bryan attacked Cole as a result of Cole's comments to him over the preceding weeks. The following week, Cole called Bryan out and demanded an apology from him, or else he would sue him for the assault. Bryan insulted Cole instead. Cole retaliated by calling Bryan a \"loser\" and slapping him, which caused Bryan to be restrained by security as Cole left the ring.\n\nAfter his rivalry ended with Bryan, Cole began to belittle other rookies from other seasons of the show. In the second season of \"NXT\", Cole would do this to Kaval and in the third season with AJ Lee, calling them all \"internet darlings\". During the third season of \"NXT\", Cole criticized the competition after a challenge, which resulted in him walking out, \"quitting\" the show. The following week, Cole returned to the show. In the fourth season of \"NXT\", Cole was replaced by Todd Grisham, but made an appearance on the December 28 \"NXT\", helping Brodus Clay in a talent competition.\n\nOn the June 21, 2010 episode of \"Raw\", Cole was made the official spokesman for the Anonymous Raw General Manager, where he had to address the crowd what he had sent to him by e-mail. Cole then debuted his new catchphrase, \"and I quote...\", before reading each e-mail. On the October 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cole returned to the show to join Matt Striker and Todd Grisham on commentary. On that same episode, Cole told Striker and Grisham that the reason he was on the show was that he was the new \"Voice of the WWE\" and that he should be on all WWE shows.\nOn the November 29, 2010 episode of \"Raw\", Cole interfered in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the WWE Championship between Jerry Lawler and The Miz, costing Lawler the match and helping Miz retain his title. A week later, Cole apologized, only to take it back and demand one from Lawler. After Lawler threatened to attack Cole, the Anonymous Raw General Manager issued a \"cease and desist\" order, which barred any physicality between them and that if either of them violated the order, that individual would have their contract terminated immediately.\n\nCole continued to argue with Lawler on commentary, telling him he was \"stealing the spotlight\" and to \"stop putting his nose in other people's business\". After Lawler unsuccessfully challenged for the WWE Championship again at Elimination Chamber, Cole interviewed him about his match on the following \"Raw\". When Cole mentioned Lawler's recently deceased mother, Lawler stole the microphone from Cole and challenged him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII. Cole responded by throwing water into Lawler's face and then running backstage.\n\nA week later, Cole accepted Lawler's challenge to a match at WrestleMania, on the conditions that he could have his own personal trainer at ringside with him and if he could choose the special guest referee for the match. Cole then revealed his trainer to be Jack Swagger. On the March 7, 2011 episode of \"Raw\", Cole announced that he had chosen John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) as the referee for the match, but before he could sign the contract, Stone Cold Steve Austin interrupted and delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to JBL, and then signed the contract himself. Beginning on the March 14, 2011 \"Raw\", Cole began announcing both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" inside a glass booth which he called the \"Cole Mine\". Later that night, Cole invited Brian Christopher, Lawler's son, to the ring to reveal family secrets about Lawler. Christopher confronted his father and told him he was ashamed to use the name \"Lawler\" and accused him of being absent from most of his life. Jim Ross then interrupted and confronted Cole and called him a \"rat bastard\". Jack Swagger attacked Ross and put him in an Ankle Lock. Cole followed suit with an Ankle Lock of his own. During the following weeks he also criticized the Divas.\n\nAt WrestleMania, Lawler won the match using the Ankle Lock submission hold. While celebrating his victory with Stone Cold, the anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision, due to Stone Cold physically getting involved in the match by pushing Cole, making Cole the winner by disqualification. A month later at Extreme Rules, Cole teamed with Swagger to defeat Ross and Lawler in a Country Whipping match.\n\nLawler then challenged Cole to one last match at Over The Limit. Cole initially declined, but Swagger was provoked into agreeing to the match on Cole's behalf. A week later, Cole announced that the match would be a \"Kiss My Foot\" match. During the signing, Cole and Swagger's alliance ended when Cole insulted Swagger, causing him to walk out on Cole, who then tried to beg Lawler for forgiveness. At the pay-per-view, Lawler defeated Cole. After the match, Eve and Jim Ross came out to get their retribution on Cole. Eve delivered her signature moonsault to Cole and Jim Ross covered his face in barbecue sauce. Bret Hart also returned and put Cole in his signature submission move, the Sharpshooter, to help Lawler make Cole kiss Lawler's foot.\n\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Cole made an apology to the fans and Lawler, which Lawler accepted. Cole continued to favor most villains and question the actions of the fan favorites to regain control in matches.\n\nOn the May 30, 2011 episode of \"Raw\", Cole insulted Alex Riley during an in-ring interview, which led to Riley pushing Cole and resulted in The Miz attacking Riley from behind. On the June 20 episode of \"Raw\", Cole was voted as the opponent for Vickie Guerrero in a dance-off, hosted by Matt Striker, with Cole winning the contest from receiving the most boos from the crowd. On the July 25 \"Raw\", after Triple H announced the return of Jim Ross to commentary, Cole voiced his opposition to Triple H, who then gave Cole the choice to stay or quit. After Cole decided to stay, Triple H placed Cole in a match against Zack Ryder, which Cole lost quickly.\n\nOn the October 17, 2011 \"Raw\", Cole and Alberto Del Rio lost a tag team match to John Cena and longtime Raw announcer Jim Ross. This prompted Cole to challenge Ross to the \"Michael Cole Challenge\" (a series of three contests) the following week; Cole said that if Ross won each challenge, Cole would quit his job. The two met on November 14—the \"challenge\" had been postponed twice due to Ross being (legit) ill—and after Ross won the first two challenges (arm wrestling and dancing), Cole then declared the third contest was who weighed less, which Cole won. After Ross was \"fired,\" CM Punk came out and attacked Cole, putting him in the Anaconda Vice submission hold and injuring his arm; Cole vowed revenge and said he would sue Punk for injuring him.\n\nCole reignited his \"NXT\" rivalry with Daniel Bryan on the November 25, 2011 episode of \"SmackDown\", in response to Bryan cashing in his \"Money in the Bank\" contract and pinning an incapacitated The Big Show to win the World Heavyweight Championship; Cole called Bryan a \"hypocrite\" who wouldn't stay true to his beliefs. Several weeks later, Cole began taunting Bryan over his feud with Henry; when Bryan went to confront Cole, Cody Rhodes (who was providing color commentary) attacked Bryan. After Bryan completed his own heel turn, Cole began to cheer for him, saying on commentary that Bryan \"grew on him.\"\n\nCole was a surprise entry in the 2012 Royal Rumble match. He was eliminated by Lawler, Booker T, and the returning Kharma. Cole was put in a match with John Cena on the June 4, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", which he lost, and was forced to make an apology for all of his wrongdoings.\n\nOn the July 9 episode of \"Raw\", Cole was booked against Jerry Lawler in a WrestleMania XXVII rematch, which he quickly lost. The anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision, making Cole the winner by disqualification following interference by Booker T. Santino Marella then came out and pulled out Hornswoggle from hiding underneath the ring, claiming that he was the anonymous GM, although WWE reporters have called this assumption into question, considering it only one of several possibilities.\n\nCole was lauded for his handling of his fellow commentary partner Jerry Lawler's legitimate on-air heart attack on the September 10, 2012 episode of \"Raw\". In spite of being a heel commentator for two years, Cole provided updates to television viewers on Lawler's condition throughout the episode and was described as \"classy and professional\" for his handling of the emergency. The incident effectively turned him face for the first time since 2010, as he began favoring the face wrestlers and began receiving cheers. Cole also joined in commentary during \"Raw\" and pay-per-view events, including Night of Champions and Hell in a Cell by Jim Ross and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. Cole cemented his face turn when he hugged Lawler in the ring when Lawler returned on the November 12 episode of \"Raw\".\n\nOn the March 30, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", Cole, along with JBL and Booker T, were attacked by Brock Lesnar after Seth Rollins refused Lesnar his WWE World Heavyweight Championship rematch. Cole did not appear on commentary the following week on \"Raw\" because he was suffering from serious internal bleeding, and was replaced by Byron Saxton. Cole also welcomes Saxton as the new color commentator for \"Monday Night Raw\", replacing Booker T on June 8, 2015. Cole returned once again for one night only on December 22, 2015 as lead announcer, along with Lawler and Booker T, for a special Christmas edition of \"SuperSmackDown Live!\". On the February 19, 2016 episode of \"SmackDown\", Cole subbing for Mauro Ranallo, who was absent due to suffering from influenza, alongside Lawler and Saxton.\n\nIn December 2013, Cole served as a special guest announcer for fellow WWE employee Booker T's professional wrestling promotion Reality of Wrestling, along with Rich Brennan (formerly known as Anthony Pratt and Rich Bocchini).", "id": "585784", "title": "Michael Cole (wrestling)"}

The illness syndrome was first described in 1979 as a sickness syndrome by Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann, who previously described two cases of the disease: one in 1966 and another in 1977. Thomas Rautenstrauch in 1977 recognized the syndrome of two siblings as Progeria.\n\nNPS is associated with abnormalities in bone maturation, lipid and metabolism. Is very rare in less than 1 in million births.\n", "id": "585943", "title": "Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome (NPS)"}

Here is a list of a number of plans that are trying:\n\nLimit development of mass tourism solely to existing resorts, like Montego Bay.\n\nSpread small-scale tourism to other parts of the island.\n\nInclude more locals in the tourism sector.\n\nEncouraging visitors to explore less popular attractions to avoid honeypotting.\n\nTourist board have set up a website by where tourists and locals can get in touch and express each others' opinions.\n\nAdvertise eco-tourism as a fantastic alternative to reduce the carbon footprint of each and every tourist.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that Jamaica needs tourism. It accounts for 45% of the national income. \n\nThat said, it will get out of hand if left to its own device. It's fantastic in that tourists are able to enjoy the wonderful natural attractions of Jamaica and the locals obtain a consistent source of income. \n\nJamaica therefore will not be able to supports its own economy without it. It must be fully considered that unless the environment is looked after properly, the industry altogether will soon be reduced to nothing. \n\nWe believe that Jamaica has recognised this and is taking the appropriate action to ensuring the future is bright.

Its first line, the Green Line, was the first subway in the Western Hemisphere. At first, it connected only the Boston Public Garden to Park Street Station - about a half-mile walk.\n\nToday, all together, the parts of the MBTA travel 1392 miles each way, every day.\n\nThe MBTA uses many different forms of public transportation to connect most of the parts of Massachusetts. As of the MBTA's last official report in 2014, there are 295 different MBTA stations in Massachusetts.\n\nThe Commuter Rail covers more of Massachusetts than any other part of the MBTA. The Commuter Rail is a fast train, similar to an Amtrak commuter train. Of all the MBTA's services, the Commuter Rail runs the farthest from Boston. Because of this, it is also the most expensive.\n\nIn the MBTA's color-coding system, Commuter Rail Trains are purple.\n\nAs of 2014, there were a total of 138 Commuter Rail stations in Massachusetts.\n\nAll Commuter Rail trains start or finish their journeys at one of two stations in Boston: South Station or North Station.\n\nCommuter Rail trains run to South Station from towns like:\n\nWhen the New England Patriots are playing at home, the MBTA runs special Commuter Rail trains to Gillette Stadium from both South Station and T.F. Green Airport.\n\nCloser to Boston, Commuter Rail trains stop at a few different Boston neighborhoods on their way to South Station, like Back Bay, Jamaica Plain, Hyde Park, and Dorchester. \n\nTravelers can change to the MBTA's Red Line subway at South Station.\n\nCommuter Rail trains run to North Station from towns like:\n\nCloser to Boston, Commuter Rail trains run through towns near Boston, like Cambridge, Chelsea, Medford, Melrose, and Belmont.\n\nTravelers can change to the MBTA's Green or Orange Lines at North Station.\n\nThe subway runs mostly in Boston and in the towns next to it. There are five different subway lines, which are color-coded. Each line runs to a different part of the city. There are a total of 66 different subway routes in the Boston area. The lines cross each other at different points throughout the city so people can switch lines when they need to. A person does not have to pay to switch from one underground subway to another.\n\nEach train runs in one of two directions: Inbound or Outbound. If a train is traveling toward Downtown Crossing, it is an Inbound train. If a train is traveling away from Downtown Crossing, it is an Outbound train.\n\nThe Orange Line began running in 1901. At that time, it was the first public transit in Boston that was elevated (on train tracks above the streets, instead of on the streets or underground).\n\nThe Orange Line runs from Malden to Jamaica Plain. It has 19 stops, including stops at Bunker Hill Community College, Tufts Medical Center, Boston's Chinatown, and Haymarket (a famous outdoor food market).\n\nThe Orange Line intersects with every other line on the MBTA. Travelers can change to any color subway or trolley car from the Orange Line.\n\nThe Red Line was the last of the four subway lines to be built.\n\nToday, the Red Line runs from Cambridge to inner-city Boston. Important stops include Harvard Square Station; Kendall/MIT Station; Charles/Massachusetts General Hospital; and JFK/UMASS (the stop for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and the University of Massachusetts Boston. The Red Line intersects with the Commuter Rail, and with every other subway except the Blue Line.\n\nThe Red Line is the most used subway line on the MBTA. On average, about 74,450,000 people make trips on the Red Line every year.\n\nThe Blue Line was built in 1904 as the world's widest underwater streetcar tunnel. (The Blue Line travels under the Charles River). By 1924, the Blue Line had been made into a subway.\n\nToday, the Blue Line runs from Revere and East Boston to a small part of downtown Boston. It stops at Wonderland, which used to be a greyhound racing track; Suffolk Downs, which still is a horse racing track; Revere Beach; Logan Airport; Government Center, where Boston City Hall is located; and the New England Aquarium. Free shuttle buses take travelers from the Airport MBTA Station to the terminals in the airport.\n\nThe Blue Line is used less than any other MBTA subway line. About 17,880,000 people make trips on the Blue Line every year - about 76% less than the number of people who use the Red Line each year.\n\nPart of the green line is a street trolley. It runs along train tracks in the middle of Boston's streets. However, some of the Green Line is a subway (underground). This part of the Green Line goes from Cambridge to downtown Boston. The Green Line then splits into five different street trolleys that travel to different neighborhoods around Boston.\n\nLongwood Station on the D line, and the Longwood Medical Area Station on the E line, are within walking distance of multiple world-class hospitals, including Brigham and Women's Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Joslin Clinic for Diabetes, and Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nThe Green Line is the second most popular subway line on the MBTA. The Red Line is used a little more often.\n\nThere are four different street trolleys. These Green Line trolleys are called the \"B,\" \"C,\" \"D,\" and \"E\" trains. There are many trolley stops on the MBTA - 61 in total.\n\nEach train but the \"E\" train splits off from the underground subway at Kenmore Station. This is the station closest to Fenway Park, where the Boston Red Sox play.\n\n\nThe E train splits off from the underground subway at Copley Station. Its stops include the Prudential Tower, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Northeastern University, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Its last stop is at the VA Medical Center in Jamaica Plain. It is the only part of the MBTA that runs on tracks in the middle of the street.\n\nThe MBTA has 4 rapid transit bus lines with a total of 30 stops. These are color-coded silver:\n\n\nThe MBTA also includes commuter boat lines:\n\n\nThe MBTA operates 174 different buses. Together, these buses travel a total of 745 miles, one way, each day.\n\nThe two most commonly used buses on the MBTA both average about 14,000 riders every day:\n\nThis table gives a summary of the different parts of the MBTA:\n\nSome travelers have brought up concerns about safety on the MBTA. In a 2011 article, \"Boston Magazine's\" Jason Schwartz described serious concerns about safety issues on the MBTA - like train fires, and crucial safety issues which he said the MBTA had not addressed. He wrote: \"The system is broke, broken, and about to get a whole lot worse. No one on Beacon Hill [in the Massachusetts government] wants to address any of this ... History shows that it takes a tragedy - deaths - to fix something as basic as infrastructure. Hopefully Massachusetts won't wait for that.\"\n\nIn 2014, Robert Murch, a \"world-renowned Ouija board\" expert, joked that he is more afraid of taking the Red Line than he is of ghosts.\n\nThe MBTA has put many programs into place to help prevent crime and terrorism on the MBTA. The latest report published by the MBTA Transit Police compared crime rates in 2014 and 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, there was about a 7% increase in crimes on the MBTA. In 2014, there were 946 reported crimes on the MBTA. In 2015, there were 1009. Since over 380,900,000 people ride the MBTA each year, this means that about 0.0003% of travelers were victims of a crime while riding the MBTA in 2015. Most of these crimes were larceny, robbery, or assault.\n\nSome Boston residents have criticized the slowness of the trains, especially the Green Line trolleys. Kyle Scott Clauss, the author of \"The Curmudgeon's Guide to the MBTA,\" writes: \"The C branch [of the Green Line] essentially functions as a sort of moving sidewalk leading to and from the Trader Joe's in Coolidge Corner. It was where Kenyan runner Rita Jeptoo memorably cruised past a Green Line trolley on her way to a first-place finish in the 2014 Boston Marathon.\"\n\nThe MBTA experienced a major crisis in winter of 2015. This was the snowiest winter in Boston's history, with six weeks of blizzards and heavy snowstorms. In February alone, 64.8 inches of snow fell in Boston. The MBTA's train tracks were so frozen and covered with snow that the trains could not drive.

The ius gentium was therefore a Roman legal codification of the widely accepted international law of the time, and was based on the highly developed commercial law of the Greek city-states and of other maritime powers.[4] The rights afforded by the ius gentium were considered to be held by all persons; it is thus a concept of human rights rather than rights attached to citizenship.\nIus conubii: The right to have a lawful marriage with a Roman citizen according to Roman principles,[5] to have the legal rights of the paterfamilias over the family, and for the children of any such marriage to be counted as Roman citizens.\nIus migrationis: The right to preserve one's level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status.

Every time he goes out, no matter where he goes, he always habitually go right first. He never meets her. But the city is like a maze, it lets people see the same scene, go the same route, to the same destination; their habits make people's lives not change. Habit doesn't only make people have a sense of security but an inexplicable loneliness, and their habits will make them miss something. \n\nShe was used to turning left and he was used to turning right, but they never had a meeting with each other in the pictured fiction story, “Turn Left, Turn Right.” It was the first long fiction story written by Jimmy Liao, talking about the feelings between a man and a woman.

There are many bright ideas in this pictured fiction story including the lines and color, with much attention to detail, and good order changes. This book is not only one of his best fiction stories but also one of the greatest works of art.

He could not help but think specially pleasing thoughts on that day. All of a sudden, he got money from someone he never knew who was living nearby. He started imagining what would come about to this leading man and woman character 1 if they never knew they were neighbors but actually slept right next to each other only separated by only one thin wall. What if, the leading man and woman characters ran into each other not frequently, and they never talked to each other about where they lived? They may never see each other again if they did not have knowledge that they were people living next to each other. \n\n\nThis book became a movie in 2003. Warner Brothers Studios produced it.

It was located in Poland, which was controlled by Germany at that time. The camp was in a forest northeast of Warsaw.\n\nThe goal of death camps like Treblinka was to kill millions of people as quickly as possible. Treblinka was open from July 23, 1942, to October 19, 1943, during Operation Reinhard, the deadliest part of The Holocaust. At Treblinka, the Nazis killed at least 700,000 and 900,000 Jewish people, and at least 2,000 Roma people. The Nazis killed more Jews at Treblinka than at any death camp other than Auschwitz.\n\nNazi officials opened Treblinka in November 1941 as a forced labor camp. The Nazis sent two groups of people to Treblinka to work as slaves:\n\nHowever, they kept the Jews and Poles in separate parts of the camp.\n\nMost of the prisoners at Treblinka worked in a gravel pit; in an irrigation area; or in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the camp's cremation ovens. \n\nBetween 1941 and 1944, more than 20,000 people were prisoners at Treblinka I. More than half of them died from hunger, disease, mistreatment, and summary executions (executions without a trial).\n\nIn July 1942, the Nazis finished building Treblinka II, a death camp, about a mile from the labor camp (Treblinka I). At this time in history, the Nazis were already killing people at two other death camps: Belzec and Sobibor.\n\nThe Nazis committed genocide at Treblinka until November 1943. They murdered up to 925,000 Jewish people at the camp. They killed many of them with carbon monoxide in gas chambers.\n\nMost Jewish men who were sent to Treblinka were killed right away. However, a few were chosen to be its slave-labor units, called \"Sonderkommando.\" When the Nazis murdered people in the gas chambers, they forced the \"Sonderkommando\" to bury the victims' bodies in mass graves. These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres, along with the bodies of new victims. \n\nIn early August 1943, the \"Sonderkommando\" revolted. Several Nazi guards were killed and about 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent chase. Because of this, in October 1943, the Nazis stopped killing prisoners in Treblinka's gas chambers.\n\nIn late July 1944, Soviet troops were getting close to Treblinka. There were between 300 and 700 Jewish prisoners left at the camp. The Nazi guards shot them all. The Nazis then quickly destroyed the camp. Before running away, they built a farmhouse for a watchman and sloughed over the ground to try to hide the evidence of their genocide. Then they ran away from the camp.\n\nDuring the last week of July 1944, Soviet troops arrived at Treblinka.\n\n", "id": "586408", "title": "Treblinka extermination camp"}

Since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, infrastructure development has progressed rapidly; today there is a variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, India's relatively low GDP per capita has meant that access to transport has not been uniform. Also railways provide an extremely important way of getting around in India, transporting 18 million citizens every 24-hour experience.\n\nPublic transport remains the primary mode of transport for most of the livelihood in India, and India's public transport systems are among the most heavily used in the world.[1] India's rail network is the 4th longest and the most heavily used system in the world,[1] transporting 8,225 million passengers and over 970 million tonnes of freight annually, as of 2015.[2]\n\nMotor vehicle population in India is low by international standards, with only 24.85 million cars on the nation's roads as of 2013.[3] In total, about 21 per cent households have two wheelers whereas only 4.7 per cent of households in India have cars/jeeps/vans as per 2011 Census.[4][5] Despite this, the number of deaths caused by traffic is amongst the highest in the world and is still increasing.[6][7] The automobile industry in India is currently rapidly growing with an annual production of over 4.6 million vehicles,[8] with an annual growth rate of 10.5%[4] and vehicle volume is expected to rise greatly in the future.[9]\n\nIn 2015-16, Government of India, declared 106 National Waterways (NW) under Inland Waterways Authority of India to reduce the cost of transportation and lower the carbon footprint by moving the traffic from surface roads and railroads to waterways.[10]\n\nDespite ongoing improvements in the sector, several aspects of transportation are still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure and lack of investment in less economically active parts of the country. The demand for transport infrastructure and services has been rising by around 10% a year[1] with the current infrastructure being unable to meet these growing demands. According to Goldman Sachs, India will need to spend US$1.7 trillion on infrastructure projects over the next decade to boost economic growth, of which will help in India to progress\n\nTraditional means Edit\n\nWalking Edit\nIn ancient times, even with decent road system, there was no means for transportation and people are covering a long distances on foot or bullock carts. For instance, Adi Sankaracharya travelled all over India from Kalady near Kochi.[11] Walking still constitutes an important mode of transport in urban areas.[12] In the city of Mumbai, to further improve the transit conditions for pedestrians, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, has commenced the construction of more than 50 skywalks,[13][14] as part of the Mumbai Skywalk project, which is very helpful as walk enthusiasts take part in it and there is absolutely no traffic over there.\n\nPalanquin Edit\n\nDoli service in Sabarimala pilgrimage.\nPalanquins, also known as palkis or pallakiis, were one of the luxurious methods used by the rich and noblemen for travelling. This was primarily used in the past to carry a deity or idol of a God, and many temples have sculptures of God being carried in a palki. Later on, it was primarily used by European noblemen and ladies from the upper classes of society prior to the advent of the railways in India.[15] Modern use of the palanquin is limited to Indian weddings and Pilgrimage.[16][17]\n\nHand-pulled rickshaw Edit\n\nA human-pulled rickshaw in Kolkata\nHand-pulled rickshaw is still available in the city of Kolkata wherein a person pulls the rickshaw by hand. The Government of West Bengal proposed a ban on these rickshaws in 2005 describing them as \"inhuman\".[18] Though a bill aiming to address this issue, termed as 'Calcutta Hackney Carriage Bill', was passed by the West Bengal Assembly in 2006, it has not been implemented yet.[19] The Government of West Bengal is working on an amendment of this bill to avoid the loopholes that got exposed when the Hand-pulled Rickshaw Owner's Association filed a petition against the bill.[19]\n\nAnimal-powered transport Edit\nBullock cart and horse carriage Edit\n\nBullock Cart in Ahmedabad\nBullock carts have been traditionally used for transport, especially in rural India. The arrival of the British saw drastic improvements in the horse carriages which were used for transport since early days. Today, they are used in smaller towns and are referred as Tonga or buggies. Victorias of Mumbai are still used for tourist purposes, but horse carriages are now rarely found in the metro cities of India.[20] In recent years large cities have banned the movement of bullock carts and other slow moving vehicles on the main roads.[21][22][23]\n\nBicycles Edit\nBicycles, or cycles have ownership rates ranging from around 30% to 70% at the state level.[5] Along with walking, cycling accounts for 50 to 75% of the commuter trips for those in the informal sector in urban areas.[12]\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest that bicycle riding is fast becoming popular in the metro cities of India. Today, government development authorities all over India encourage the setup and use of separate bicycle lanes alongside the roads to combat pollution and ease traffic congestion.[24]\n\nCycle rickshaw Edit\nCycle rickshaws were introduced in India in the 1940s.[25] They are bigger than a tricycle where two people sit on an elevated seat at the back and a person pedals from the front. In the late 2000s, they were banned in several cities for causing traffic congestion.[26][27][28] Cycle rickshaws have been a feature of Delhi streets since Indian independence in 1947, providing the cheapest way around the capital. The Delhi Police recently submitted an affidavit against playing of cycle rickshaws to ease traffic congestion in the city but it was dismissed by the Delhi High Court.[29] In addition, environmentalists have supported the retention of cycle rickshaws as a non-polluting and inexpensive mode of transport.[30]\n\nPublic road transport Edit\n\nA congested road showing buses, taxis, autorikshaws and other modes of road transport\nA congested road in Kolkata showing buses, taxis, autorickshaws and other modes of road transport.\nPublic transport is the predominant mode of motorised local travel in cities.[12] This is predominantly by road, since commuter rail services are available only in the seven metropolitan cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad and Pune, while dedicated city bus services are known to operate in at least 25 cities with a population of over one million.[31] Intermediate public transport modes like tempos and cycle rickshaws assume importance in medium size cities.[12] However, the share of buses is negligible in most Indian cities as compared to personalised vehicles, and two-wheelers and cars account for more than 80 percent of the vehicle population in most large cities.[31]\n\nGenerally, traffic in most of the cities in India moves slowly, where traffic jams and accidents are very common, but in some cities like Chandigarh, wide roads and less vehicles contribute to lesser traffic.[32][33] India has very poor records on road safely—around 90,000 people die from road accidents every year.[34] At least 13 people die every hour in road accidents in the country,also in the year 2007 road accidents claimed more than 130,000 lives, overtaking China.[35][36] A Reader's Digest study of traffic congestion in Asian cities ranked several Indian cities within the Top Ten for worst traffic.[33]\n\nBus Edit\n\nMumbai's B.E.S.T. is India's oldest operating transport body\nBuses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities,[37] and serve as a cheap and convenient mode of transport for all classes of society. Services are mostly run by state government owned transport corporations.[31] However, after the economic liberalisation, all those government state transport corporations have introduced various facilities like low-floor buses for the disabled and air-conditioned buses to attract private car owners to help decongest roads.[38][39] Mumbai introduced air conditioned buses in 1998.[40] Bangalore was the first city in India to introduce Volvo B7RLE intra-city buses in India in January 2005 .[41][42][43] Bengaluru is the first Indian city to have an air-conditioned bus stop, located near Cubbon Park. It was built by airtel.[44] The city of Chennai houses one of Asia's largest bus terminus, the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus.[45]\n\nBus Rapid Transit System Edit\nBus Rapid Transit Systems (BRTS), although quite recent, exist in several cities including Indore, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Rajkot, Surat, Bhopal, and Pune.[46]\n\nTaxi Edit\nMain article: Taxis in India\n\nAmbassador taxis in Kolkata\nMost of the traditional taxicabs in India are either Premier Padmini or Hindustan Ambassador cars.[47] Depending on the city/state, taxis can either be hailed or hired from taxi-stands. In cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, taxis need to be hired over phone,[48] whereas in cities like Kolkata and Mumbai, taxis can be hailed on the street. According to government of India regulations, all taxis are required to have a fare-meter installed.[49] There are additional surcharges for luggage, late-night rides and toll taxes are to be paid by the passenger. Since 2006, radio taxis have become increasingly popular with the public due to reasons of safety and convenience.[50] In cities and localities where taxis are expensive or do not ply as per the government or municipal regulated fares, people use share taxis. These are normal taxis which carry one or more passengers travelling to destinations either en route to the final destination, or near the final destination.[citation needed] The passengers are charged according to the number of people with different destinations. A similar system exists for autorickshaws, known as share autos.[citation needed] The city of Mumbai will soon be the first city in India, to have an \"in-taxi\" magazine, titled MumBaee, which will be issued to taxis which are part of the Mumbai Taximen's Union. The magazine debuted on 13 July 2009.[51] In Kolkata there are many no refusal taxis available with white and blue in colour.[52]\n\nAuto Rickshaw Edit\nMain article: Autorickshaw\n\nAn Autorikshaw in Mango Orange village, Nilgiris.\nAn auto rickshaw is a three-wheeler vehicle for hire that does not have doors and is generally characterised by a small cabin for the driver in the front and a seat for passengers in the rear.[53] Generally it is painted in yellow, green or black color and has a black, yellow or green canopy on the top, but designs vary considerably from place to place. The color of the autorickshaw is also determined by the fuel that it is powered by, for example Agartala, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi have green or black autos indicating the use of compressed natural gas, whereas the autos of Kolkata, Bengaluru have green autos indicating the use of LPG.[citation needed]\n\nIn Mumbai and other metropolitan cities, 'autos' or 'rickshaws' as they are popularly known have regulated metered fares. A recent law prohibits auto rickshaw drivers from charging more than the specified fare, or charging night-fare before midnight, and also prohibits the driver from refusing to go to a particular location. Mumbai and Kolkata are also the only two cities which prohibit auto rickshaws from entering a certain part of the city, in these cases being South Mumbai and certain parts of Downtown Kolkata.[54] However, in cities like Chennai, it is common to see autorickshaw drivers demand more than the specified fare and refuse to use fare meter[55]\n\nAirports and railway stations at many cities such as Howrah, Chennai and Bengaluru provide a facility of prepaid auto booths, where the passenger pays a fixed fare as set by the authorities for various locations.[56]\n\nE Rickshaw Edit\nMain article: Electric rickshaw\nA new popular means of transport, rapidly grew in number in India, due to low running and initial cost, other economic and environment benefits, these vehicles are becoming popular in India. E Rickshaws are made in fiberglass or metal body, powered by a BLDC Electric Motor with max power 2000W and speed 25 km/h.\n\nUrban rail transport Edit\n\nSuburban railway Edit\nMain article: Suburban rail in India\n\nWhite and purple coloured MRVC Siemens rakes on the Western Line in Mumbai\n\nA MRTS station in the city of Chennai\n\nDelhi Metro, operational since 2002\n\nIndia's oldest metro is the Kolkata Metro\n\nNamma Metro in Bengaluru is India's second largest metro system\nThe present suburban railway services in India are limited and are operational only in Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad and Bengaluru.[31] The Mumbai Suburban Railway is the first rail system in India which began services in Mumbai in 1867, transports 6.3 million passengers daily and has the highest passenger density in the world.[57] The first rapid transit system in India, the Kolkata Suburban Railway, was established in Kolkata in 1854.[58] Its first service ran between Howrah and Hooghly covering a distance of 38.6 km (24 mi).\n\nUrban mass rapid transit Edit\nMain article: Rapid transit in India\nThe first modern rapid transit in India is the Kolkata Metro and started its operations in 1984, this is also the 17th Zone of the Indian Railways.[59] The Delhi Metro in New Delhi is India's second conventional metro and began operations in 2002. The Namma Metro in Bangalore is India's third operational rapid transit and began operations in 2011. Currently, rapid transit systems have been deployed in these cities and more are under construction or in planning in several major cities of India like Chennai which will be opened shortly.\n\nCities with metro systems:\nKolkata Metro\nChennai Mass Rapid Transit System\nDelhi Metro\nBengaluru Metro\nMumbai Metro\nRapid Metro Rail Gurgaon\nJaipur Metro\nChennai Metro\nMetro systems under construction\nHyderabad Metro\nIndore Metro\nNavi Mumbai Metro\nKochi Metro\nLucknow Metro (Started on 26 September 2014)\nMetro-Link Express for Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad\nSurat Metro\nMonorail Edit\nMonorail in India is generally considered as feeder system for the Metro train.

The Kolkata tram is currently the only tram system in the country and provides an emission-free means of transport in Kolkata while the other tram systems in India were phased out. The nationalised Calcutta Tramways Company is in the process of upgrading the existing tramway network at a cost of ₹240 million (US$3.7 million).[61] Presently the limited tram system in India is extremely slow and technologically backward, new light rail projects are being proposed rather than traditional tram projects which have one reason or another not been very successful in the country.[citation needed] However, there are some proposals to reintroduce trams as a new transport avatar in some new Indian cities.[62] There are also plans to introduce trams in medium-sized cities.[63]\n\nOther local transport Edit\n\nTwo Wheeler Edit\nMotorised two-wheel vehicles like scooters, motorcycles and mopeds are very popular mode of transport due to their fuel efficiency and ease of use in congested roads or streets. The number of two-wheelers sold is several times that of cars. There were 47.5 million powered two-wheelers in India in 2003 compared with just 8.6 million cars.[64] Yamaha, Hero MotoCorp(formerly Hero Honda), Honda, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto, DC motorworks and Mahindra 2 Wheelers are the largest two-wheeler companies in terms of market-share.[65] Royal Enfield, an iconic brand name in the country, manufactures different variants of the British Bullet motorcycle which is a classic motorcycle that is still in production.[66]\n\nManufacture of scooters in India started when Automobile Products of India (API), set up at Mumbai and incorporated in 1949, began assembling Innocenti-built Lambretta scooters in India post independence.[citation needed] They eventually acquired licence for the Li150 series model, of which they began full-fledged production from the early sixties onwards.[citation needed] In 1972, Scooters India Ltd (SIL), a state-run enterprise based in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, bought the entire manufacturing rights of the last Innocenti Lambretta model. API has infrastructural facilities at Mumbai, Aurangabad, and Chennai but has been non-operational since 2002. SIL stopped producing scooters in 1998.[citation needed]\n\nMotorcycles and scooters can be rented in many cities, Wicked Ride, Metro bikes and many other companies are working with state governments to solve last mile connectivity problems with mass transit solutions.[67] Wearing protective headgear is mandatory for both the rider and the pillion-rider in most cities.[68]\n\nAutomobile Edit\nPrivate vehicles account for 30% of the total transport demand in urban areas of India. An average of 963 new private vehicles are registered every day in Delhi alone.[69] The number of automobiles produced in India rose from 6.3 million (6.3 million) in 2002–03 to 11 million (11.2 million) in 2008–09.[70] However, India still has a very low rate of car ownership. When comparing car ownership between BRIC developing countries, it is on a par with China,[64] and exceeded by Brazil and Russia.[71]\n\nCompact cars, especially hatchbacks predominate due to affordability, fuel efficiency, congestion, and lack of parking space in most cities. Chennai is known as the \"Detroit of India\" for its automobile industry.[72] Maruti, Hyundai and Tata Motors are the most popular brands in the order of their market share. The Ambassador once had a monopoly but is now an icon of pre-liberalisation India, and is still used by taxi companies. Maruti 800 launched in 1984 created the first revolution in the Indian auto sector because of its low pricing. It had the highest market share until 2004, when it was overtaken by other low-cost models from Maruti such as the Alto and the Wagon R, the Indica from Tata Motors and the Santro from Hyundai. Over the 20-year period since its introduction, about 2.4 million units of the Maruti 800 have been sold.[73] However, with the launch of the Tata Nano, the least expensive production car in the world, Maruti 800 lost its popularity.[74]\n\nIndia is also known for a variety of indigenous vehicles made in villages out of simple motors and vehicle spare-parts. A few of these innovations are the Jugaad, Maruta, Chhakda, peter rehda and the Fame.[75]\n\nIn the city of Bengaluru, Radio One and the Bangalore Traffic Police, launched a carpooling drive which has involved celebrities such as Robin Uthappa, and Rahul Dravid encouraging the public to carpool.[76][77][78] The initiative got a good response, and by the end of May 2009, 10,000 people are said to have carpooled in the city.[79]\n\nUtility vehicles Edit\nThe first utility vehicle in India was manufactured by Mahindra and Mahindra. It was a copy of the original Jeep and was manufactured under licence.[80] The vehicle was an instant hit and made Mahindra one of the top companies in India. The Indian Army and police extensively use Mahindra vehicles along with Maruti Gypsys for transporting personnel and equipment.\n\nTata Motors, the automobile manufacturing arm of the Tata Group, launched its first utility vehicle, the Tata Sumo, in 1994.[81][82] The Sumo, owing to its then-modern design, captured a 31% share of the market within two years.[83] The Tempo Trax from Force Motors till recently was ruling the rural areas. Sports utility vehicles now form a sizeable part of the passenger vehicle market.[84] Models from Tata, Honda, Hyundai, Ford, Chevrolet and other brands are available.[85]\n\nLong distance transport Edit\n\nRailway Edit\n[86]\nDarjeeling Himalayan Railway in West Bengal is a World Heritage Site,[87] and one of the two steam engine operated railway line in India, other being Nilgiri Mountain Railway.\nMain articles: Rail transport in India and Indian Railways\nRail services in India, first introduced in 1853, are provided by the state-run Indian Railways under the supervision of the Ministry of Railways. Indian Railways provides an important mode of transport in India, transporting over 18 million passengers and more than 2 million tonnes of freight daily across one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world.[88] The proposal to construct to build the highest railway track in the world from Manali to Leh overtaking current record of Beijing-Lhasa Railway line has not been taken up for implementation. By 1947, the year of India's independence, there were forty-two rail systems. In 1951 the systems were nationalised as one unit, becoming one of the largest networks in the world. Indian Railways is divided into seventeen zones including the Kolkata Metro Railway.[89] The city of Kolkata is the Headquarters of three Railway Zones in India namely Eastern Railway zone, South Eastern Railway Zone and the Kolkata Metro.The Indian Railways are further sub-divided into sixty seven divisions, each having a divisional headquarters.[90][91]\nThiruvananthapuram Rajadhani\n\nSeen here is the Secunderabad Yeshwanthpur Garib-Rath Express. Garib-Rath's are low cost A/c trains\nThe rail network traverses through the length and breadth of the country, covering more than 7,000 stations over a total route length of more than 65,000 km (40,000 mi) and track length of about 115,000 km (71,000 mi).[88] About 22,224 km (13,809 mi) or 34% of the route-kilometre was electrified as on 31 March 2012.[92] Indian Railways is the world's largest commercial or utility employer, with more than 1.4 million employees.[93][94] As to rolling stock, IR owns over 200,000 (freight) wagons, 50,000 coaches and 8,000 locomotives.[93] It also owns locomotive and coach production facilities. It operates both long distance and suburban rail systems on a network of broad gauge.\nSouthern Railway headquarter at Chennai\nThe Indian Railways runs a number of special types of services which are given higher priority. The Rajdhani trains introduced in 1969 provides connectivity between the national capital, Delhi and capitals of the states. On the other hand, Shatabdi Express provides connectivity between centres of tourism, pilgrimage or business. The Shatabdi Express trains run over short to medium distances and do not have sleepers while the Rajdhani Expresses run over longer distances and have only sleeping accommodation. Both series of trains have a maximum permissible speed of 110 to 140 km/h (81 to 87 mph) but average speed of less than 100 km/h.[citation needed] The 12001 Bhopal Shatabdi express, however, runs at a peak speed of 150 km/h on small stretches which makes it the fastest train in India. The other specialised services operated by the Railways are the Duronto Express (without any commercial stop between the origin and the destination but with a few technical stops for crew change and food intake) and Garib Raths that provide cheap no-frill airconditioned rail travel. Besides, The Indian Railways also operates a number of luxury trains which cater to various tourist circuits. For instance, the Palace on Wheels serves the Rajasthan circuit and The Golden Chariot serves the Karnataka and Goa circuits.[citation needed] There are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites on IR – the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus[95] and the Mountain railways of India. The latter is not a contiguous railway line but comprises the following three separate historic railway lines located in different parts of India:[96]\n\nThe Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a 610 mm (2 ft) narrow gauge railway in Lesser Himalayas in West Bengal.\nThe Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge railway in the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil Nadu\nThe Kalka-Shimla Railway, a 762 mm (2 ft 6 in) narrow gauge railway in the Shivalik mountains in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nEast Coast Railway Headquarters, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India\nThe Indian Railways has also initiated a number of highly ambitious projects to provide connectivity to the remote and inaccessible areas of the country.[citation needed] The 738 km long Konkan Railway with around 2000 bridges and 92 tunnels is one such highly difficult project through fragile mountainous terrain of the Konkan region Salient features of Konkan railway to connect two important port cities of Mangaluru and Mumbai by a short route and was constructed in 1991-1998. Another such highly ambitious project is the Jammu–Baramulla line, the Kashmir valley part of which was completed in 2009.[97]\n\nProposals have been made to construct high-speed railway lines in India but no concrete action has been taken. In 1999, the Konkan Railway Corporation introduced the Roll on Roll off (RORO) service, a unique road-rail synergy system, on the section between Kolad in Maharashtra and Verna in Goa,[98] which was extended up to Surathkal in Karnataka in 2004.[99][100] The RORO service, the first of its kind in India, allowed trucks to be transported on flatbed trailers. It was highly popular,[101] carrying about 110,000 trucks and bringing in about ₹ 740 million worth of earnings to the corporation till 2007.[102]\nKrantivira Sangolli Rayanna railway station, Bengaluru entrance\n\nNew Delhi railway station - Platform 16 entrance\n\nVijayawada Jn. railway station - Platform 1 entrance\nAs the railway tracks from Kandla, Pipavav, Mundra and other ports in Saurashtra to Ahmedabad and Palanpur and then to Rewari via Ringas are not electrified, freight trains (goods trains) with containers double-stacked ply on this route to Rewari junction and then take the containers further north from Rewari. Infringements like low road overbridges and foot overbridges that fouled with double-stacked containers were either dismantled or raised in years 2004-06 for running these freight trains. In India freight (goods) trains can carry standard containers double-stacked on flat-bed wagons with normal axle load of about 22 tonnes and do not require special low-bed wagons unlike in other countries that have (relatively narrow) 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1⁄2 in) standard gauge. They carry almost 4000 tonnes per rake which is almost twice the load a normal goods train can haul. Some double-stacked container freight trains on this route through Rewari station also carry \"high cube\" containers that are 2896 mm (9 ft 6-inch) high (higher than standard containers that are generally 8 ft or 2.438 mm high) on special low-well wagons owned by private clients. Some private logistics operators have built container storage yards north of Rewari near Garhi Harsaru for this purpose.\n\nInternational Edit\n\nSamjhauta Express between India and Pakistan\nRail links between India and neighbouring countries are not well-developed. Two trains operate to Pakistan—the Samjhauta Express between Delhi and Lahore, and the Thar Express between Jodhpur and Karachi. Bangladesh is connected by a biweekly train, the Maitree Express that runs from Kolkata to Dhaka. Nominal rail links to Nepal exist—passenger services between Jaynagar and Bijalpura, and freight services between Raxaul and Birganj.[103]\n\nIndian and Bangladeshi governments will start work late by December or early by January 2015 on a new rail link to ease surface transport.[104] India will build a 15-km railway tracks linking Tripura's capital Agartala with Bangladesh's southeastern city of Akhaura, an important railway junction connected to Chittagong port, resource-rich Sylhet and Dhaka.[105] An agreement to implement the railway project was signed between India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina during her visit to India in January 2010.[106] Total cost of the proposed project is estimated at Rs.252 crore. The Indian Railway Construction Company (IRCON) would lay the new railway tracks on both sides of the border. Of the 15 km rail line, five km of tracks fall in the Indian territory.[107][108] The NFR is now laying tracks to connect Tripura's southern most border town Sabroom, 135 km south of here. From Sabroom, the Chittagong international sea port is just 72 km.[109]\n\nNo rail link exists with Myanmar but a railway line is to be built through from Jiribam (in Manipur) to Tamu through Imphal and Moreh.[110] The construction of this missing link, as per the feasibility study conducted by the Ministry of External Affairs through RITES Ltd, is estimated to cost ₹29.41 billion (US$460 million).[111] An 18 km railway link with Bhutan is being constructed from Hashimara in West Bengal to Toribari in Bhutan. No rail link exists with either China or Sri Lanka.[112] A railway line is being built from Siliguri to Rangpo in Sikkim but there are no plans to extend it further north towards China.\n\nRoadways Edit\nMain article: Indian road network\n\nOuter Ring Road (Nehru ORR) at Narsinghi, Hyderabad\nIndia has a network of National Highways connecting all the major cities and state capitals, forming the economic backbone of the country. As of 2013, India has a total of 70,934 km (44,076 mi) of National Highways, of which 1,208 km (751 mi) are classified as expressways.[113] Under National Highways Development Project (NHDP), work is under progress to equip some of the important national highways with four lanes; also there is a plan to convert some stretches of these roads to six lanes.[114] However congestion and bureaucratic delays en route ensure that trucking goods from Gurgaon to the port in Mumbai can take up to 10 days.[115]\n\nAs per the National Highways Authority of India, about 65% of freight and 80% passenger traffic is carried by the roads. The National Highways carry about 40% of total road traffic, though only about 2% of the road network is covered by these roads.[113] Average growth of the number of vehicles has been around 10.16% per annum over recent years.[113] Highways have facilitated development along the route and many towns have sprung up along major highways. Road transport Benchmark Freight Index (BFI) initiative taken in India recently by ITRANS.[citation needed]\nDurgapur Expressway in the Indian state of West Bengal, part of NH 2\n\nBandar road in Vijayawada\nAll national highways are metalled, but very few are constructed of concrete, the most notable being the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. In recent years construction has commenced on a nationwide system of multi-lane highways, including the Golden Quadrilateral and North-South and East-West Corridors which link the largest cities in India. In 2000, around 40% of villages in India lacked access to all-weather roads and remained isolated during the monsoon season.[1][116]\n\nTo improve rural connectivity, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime Minister's Rural Road Program), a project funded by the Central Government with the help of World Bank, was launched in 2000 to build all-weather roads to connect all habitations with a population of 500 or above (250 or above for hilly areas).[116][117]\nA road in Chandigarh.\nAs per 2013 estimates, the total road length in India is 4,689,842 km (2,914,133 mi);[118] making the Indian road network the second largest road network in the world after the United States. At 0.66 km of highway per square kilometre of land the density of India's highway network is higher than that of the United States (0.65) and far higher than that of China's (0.16) or Brazil's (0.20).[1]\n\nType of Road Length\nExpressways 1,208 km (751 mi) as of 2011\nNational Highways 79,116 km (49,160 mi)\nState Highways 155,716 km (96,757 mi)\nDistrict, Rural and Other Roads 4,455,010 km (2,768,210 mi)\nTotal Length 4,689,842 km (2,914,133 mi) (Approx)\nBuses are an important means of public transport in India, particularly in the countryside and remote areas where the rail network cannot be accessed and airline operations are few or non-existent. Due to this social significance, bus transport is predominantly owned and operated by public agencies, and most state governments operate bus services through a State Road Transport Corporation. KSRTC, MSRTC, APSRTC, KeSRT (Kerala state road transport corporation).[119] These corporations, introduced in the 1960s and 1970s, have proven extremely useful in connecting villages and towns across the country.[31] All Type Of Transport In India For Cogo Is Provided By ACC India Project Cargo Corporation i.e. transportinindia.in .[120][120]\n\nAviation Edit\n\nMain article: Aviation in India\n\nAir India, the flag carrier of India\nDirectorate General of Civil Aviation is the national regulatory body for the aviation industry. It is controlled by the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The ministry also controls aviation related autonomous organisations like the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi and Public Sector Undertakings including Air India, Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.[121]\n\nAir India is India's national flag carrier after merging with Indian (airline) in 2011[122] and plays a major role in connecting India with the rest of the world.[123] IndiGo, Jet Airways, Air India, Spicejet and GoAir are the major carriers in order of their market share.[124] These airlines connect more than 80 cities across India and also operate overseas routes after the liberalisation of Indian aviation. Several other foreign airlines connect Indian cities with other major cities across the globe. However, a large section of country's air transport potential remains untapped, even though the Mumbai-Delhi air corridor was ranked 10th by Amadeus in 2012 among the world's busiest routes.[125][126]\nEmirates Plane land on Kempegowda International Airport\nHistory Edit\nCivil Aviation in India traces its beginnings back to the year 1911, when the first commercial civil aviation flight took off from Allahabad for Naini on 18 February. Henri Pequet, a French aviator, carried 6,500 mails on a Humber biplane.[127] On October 15, 1932, J.R.D. Tata flew a consignment of mail from Karachi to Juhu Airport. His airline later became Air India.[128]\n\nIn March 1953, the Indian Parliament passed the Air Corporations Act. India's airline industry was nationalised and the eight domestic airlines operating independently at that time, Deccan Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Kalinga Airlines, Indian National Airways, Air India and Air Services of India were merged into two government owned entities. Indian Airlines focussed on domestic routes and Air India International on international services.[127] The International Airports Authority of India (IAAI) was constituted in 1972 while the National Airports Authority was constituted in 1986. The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security was established in 1987 following the tragic crash of Air India Flight 182. Pushpaka Aviation operated scheduled international passenger flights from Bombay to Sharjah, as an associate carrier of Air India from 1979 to 1983.\n\nEast-West Airlines was the first national level private airline to operate in the country after the government de-regularised the civil aviation sector in 1991. The government allowed private airlines to operate charter and non-scheduled services under the ‘Air Taxi’ Scheme until 1994, when the Air Corporation Act was repealed and private airlines could now operate scheduled services. Private airlines like Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Modiluft, Damania Airways and NEPC Airlines among others commenced domestic operations during this period.[127]\n\nAir India placed orders for more than 68 jets from Boeing for US$7.5 billion in 2006 while Indian placed orders for 43 jets from Airbus for US$2.5 billion in 2005.[129][130] Jet Airways invested millions of dollars to increase its fleet,[131] but was later put on hold due to the recent economic slowdown.[132] IndiGo announced orders for 100 Airbus A320s worth US$6 billion during the Paris Air Show, the highest by any Asian domestic carrier.[133] Kingfisher Airlines became the first Indian air carrier on 15 June 2005 to order Airbus A380 aircraft worth US$3 billion.[134][135]\n\nMore than half a dozen low-cost carriers entered the Indian market in 2004–05. Major new entrants included Air Deccan, Air Sahara, Kingfisher Airlines, SpiceJet, GoAir, Paramount Airways and IndiGo. But Indian aviation industry struggled due to economic slowdown, rising fuel and operation costs. This led to consolidation, buy outs and discontinuations in the Indian airline industry. In 2007, Air Sahara and Air Deccan were acquired by Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines respectively. Paramount Airways ceased operations in 2010 and Kingfisher shut down in 2012. Etihad Airways agreed to acquire 24% stake in Jet in 2013. AirAsia India, a low cost carrier operating as a joint venture between Air Asia and Tata Sons launched in 2014. As of 2013–14, only IndiGo and GoAir were generating profits.[136]\n\nAirports Edit\nThe Departures section of Mumbai Airport.\nMain article: List of airports in India\nThe Departures section in the new terminal of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport.\nWhile there are 346[137] civilian airfields in India - 253 with paved runways and 93 with unpaved runways, only 132 were classified as \"airports\" as of November 2014.[138] Of these, Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi is the busiest in the country.[139][140][141] The operations of the major airports in India have been privatised over the past 5 years and this has resulted in better equipped and cleaner airports. The terminals have either been refurbished or expanded.\n\nIndia also has 33 \"ghost airports,\" which were built in an effort to make air travel more accessible for those in remote regions but are now non-operational due to a lack of demand. The Jaisalmer Airport in Rajasthan, for example, was completed in 2013 and was expected to host 300,000 passengers a year but has yet to see any commercial flights take off. Despite the number of non-operational airports, India is currently planning on constructing another 200 \"low-cost\" airports over the next 20 years.[142]\n\nLength of runways Airports\nwith paved\nrunways[137] Airports\nwith unpaved\nrunways[137]\n3,047 m (10,000 ft) or more 21 1\n2,438 to 3,047 m (8,000 to 10,000 ft) 59 3\n1,524 to 2,438 m (5,000 to 8,000 ft) 76 6\n914 to 1,524 m (3,000 to 5,000 ft) 82 38\nUnder 914 m (3,000 ft) 14 45\nTotal 253 93\nHeliports Edit\nAerospatiale SA 365N Dauphin 2, Pawan Hans Helicopter\nAs of 2013, there are 45 heliports in India.[137] India also has the world's highest helipad at the Siachen Glacier at a height of 6400 m (21,000 ft) above mean sea level.[143]\nEstablished in 1977, Heliport Systems, Inc. plans, designs, and constructs heliports for hospitals, businesses, and the marine industry worldwide.

In India about 95% of the foreign trade by quantity and 70% by value takes place through the ports.[147] Mumbai Port & JNPT(Navi Mumbai) handles 70% of maritime trade in India.[148] There are twelve major ports: Navi Mumbai, Mumbai, Kochi, Kolkata (including Haldia), Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Ennore, Chennai, Tuticorin, New Mangaluru, Mormugao and Kandla.[149] Other than these, there are 187 minor and intermediate ports, 43 of which handle cargo.[149]\nInternational Container Transhipment Terminal at Kochi Port, the only transshipment facility in India. This port lies closest to international shipping routes among all Indian ports.\nMaritime transportation in India is managed by the Shipping Corporation of India, a government-owned company that also manages offshore and other marine transport infrastructure in the country. It owns and operates about 35% of Indian tonnage and operates in practically all areas of shipping business servicing both national and international trades.The only state which carries three ports in India is Tamil Nadu, they are Ennore, Chennai and Tuticorin.[150]\nVisakhapatnam seaport is one of the busiest ports on the East Coast of India\nIt has a fleet of 79 ships of 2750,000 GT (4.8 million DWT) and also manages 53 research, survey and support vessels of 120,000 GT (060,000 DWT) on behalf of various government departments and other organisations.[151] Personnel are trained at the Maritime Training Institute in Mumbai, a branch of the World Maritime University, which was set up in 1987.[152] The Corporation also operates in Malta and Iran through joint ventures.[151]\n\nThe distinction between major and minor ports is not based on the amount of cargo handled. The major ports are managed by port trusts which are regulated by the central government.[153] They come under the purview of the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963.[citation needed] The minor ports are regulated by the respective state governments and many of these ports are private ports or captive ports.[citation needed] The total amount of traffic handled at the major ports in 2005-2006 was 382.33 Mt.[149]\n\nWaterways Edit\nMotor Vessel in Hooghly river in West Bengal\nMain article: Inland Waterways Authority of India\nIndia has an extensive network of inland waterways in the form of rivers, canals, backwaters and creeks. The total navigable length is 14,500 kilometres (9,000 mi), out of which about 5,200 km (3,231 mi) of river and 485 km (301 mi) of canals can be used by mechanised crafts.[154] Freight transport by waterways is highly underutilised in India compared to other large countries. The total cargo moved by inland waterways is just 0.15% of the total inland traffic in India, compared to the corresponding figures of 20% for Germany and 32% for Bangladesh.[155]\n\nCargo that is transported in an organised manner is confined to a few waterways in Goa, West Bengal, Assam and Kerala.[citation needed] The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is the statutory authority in charge of the waterways in India. It does the function of building the necessary infrastructure in these waterways, surveying the economic feasibility of new projects and also administration and regulation.[citation needed] The following waterways have been declared as National Waterways:\nBoats sailing on National Waterway 2 at Guwahati\nNational Waterway 1: Allahabad–Haldia stretch of the Ganga - Bhagirathi - Hooghly river system with a total length of 1,620 kilometres (1,010 mi) in October 1986.[156]\nNational Waterway 2: Saidiya–Dhubri stretch of the Brahmaputra river system with a total length of 891 kilometres (554 mi) in 1988.[156]\nNational Waterway 3: Kollam–Kottapuram stretch of the West Coast Canal along with Champakara and Udyogmandal canals, with a total length of 205 kilometres (127 mi) in 1993.[156]\nNational Waterway 4: Bhadrachalam–Rajahmundry and Wazirabad–Vijaywada stretch of the Krishna–Godavari river system along with the Kakinada–Pondicherry canal network, with a total length of 1,095 km (680 mi) in 2007.[157][158]\nNational Waterway 5: Mangalgadi–Paradeep and Talcher–Dhamara stretch of the Mahanadi–Brahmani river system along with the East Coast Canal, with a total length of 623 km (387 mi) in 2007.[157][158]\nPipelines\n\nLength of pipelines for crude oil is 20,000 km (12,427 mi).\nLength of Petroleum products pipeline is 15,000 kilometres (9,300 mi).\nEnvironmental issues and impact Edit\n\n[5] see for more information\n\nThe National capital New Delhi has one of the largest CNG based transport systems as a part of the drive to bring down pollution. In spite of these efforts it remains the largest contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions in the city.[159] The CNG Bus manufacturers in India are Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, Swaraj Mazda and Hindustan Motors.[160]\n\nIn 1998, the Supreme Court of India published a Directive that specified the date of April 2001 as deadline to replace or convert all buses, three-wheelers and taxis in Delhi to compressed natural gas.[161]\n\nThe Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation was the first State Transport Undertaking in India to utilise bio-fuels and ethanol-blended fuels.[162] KSRTC took an initiative to do research in alternative fuel forms by experimenting with various alternatives— blending diesel with biofuels such as honge, palm, sunflower, groundnut, coconut and sesame.[163] In 2009, the corporation decided to promote the use of biofuel buses.[164]", "id": "586568", "title": "Transport in India"}

The short 'a' and short 'o' of American English are absent in Indian languages and their use can often result in mispronunciation of Indian names.\n\nFurthermore, the letters used in English for the retroflex consonants (t and d) are also used to sound dentals (as in 'math' and 'the'), especially when they occur in the beginning of a word. As an example, the India name 'Dev' would not have its first consonant pronounced as in the American name 'Dave'. Similarly the name 'Tarun' would not have its first consonant sounded as in 'Tom'.\n\nThe letter 'h' is used to aspirate certain consonants. So, in the names 'Khare', 'Ghanshyam', 'Kaccha', 'Jhumki', 'Vitthal', 'Ranchodh', 'Thimmayya', 'Uddhav', 'Phaneesh', and 'Bhanu', the sounds 'ka', 'ga', 'cha', 'ja', 'ta' (retroflex), 'da' (retroflex), 'ta' (dental), 'da' (dental), 'pa', and 'ba' are sounded with an strong outward breath.", "id": "586573", "title": "Indian name"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=586817", "text": "Heat death of the universe\n\nThe idea of the heat death of the universe, proposed in 1851 by William Thomson, stems from the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat tends to pass from hotter to colder bodies and eventually becomes uniformly distributed. As an elementary particle of matter (such as a proton) self‑gravitationally shrinks, its heat becomes intensified (\"augmented\") to a higher temperature and then radiated away into the ambient vacuum:\n\nAlthough mechanical energy is indestructible, there is a universal tendency to its dissipation, which produces throughout the system a gradual augmentation and diffusion of heat, cessation of motion and exhaustion of the potential energy of the material Universe.\nInitially, the universe has the maximal (\"i.e.\", zero) potential energy, and the minimal (\"i.e.\", zero) actual energy. Such a universe is in a state of heat death and exists as a uniform blanket of zero-temperature heat. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat tends to pass from hotter to colder bodies. So, when a portion of the zero‑temperature heat self‑gravitationally shrinks to a nonzero temperature, a half of the resultant nonzero‑temperature heat becomes radiated into the colder ambient vacuum, at which moment the particle of nonzero‑temperature heat undergoes self‑gravitational shrinkage to a still higher temperature. Thus the temperature difference between the self‑gravitationally shrinking particle and the ambient vacuum increases, which increases the rate of heat loss and thereby accelerates the particle's self‑gravitational shrinkage:\n\nAll change is relative. The universe is expanding relatively to our common material standards; our material standards are shrinking relatively to the size of the universe. The theory of the \"expanding universe\" might also be called the theory of the \"shrinking atom\". ...\nLet us then take the whole universe as our standard of constancy, and adopt the view of a cosmic being whose body is composed of intergalactic spaces and swells as they swell. Or rather we must now say it keeps the same size, for he will not admit that it is he who has changed. Watching us for a few thousand million years, he sees us shrinking; atoms, animals, planets, even the galaxies, all shrink alike; only the intergalactic spaces remain the same. The earth spirals round the sun in an ever‑decreasing orbit. It would be absurd to treat its changing revolution as a constant unit of time. The cosmic being will naturally relate his units of length and time so that the velocity of light remains constant. Our years will then decrease in geometrical progression in the cosmic scale of time. On that scale man's life is becoming briefer; his threescore years and ten are an ever‑decreasing allowance. Owing to the property of geometrical progressions an infinite number of our years will add up to a finite cosmic time; so that what we should call the end of eternity is an ordinary finite date in the cosmic calendar. But on that date the universe has expanded to infinity in our reckoning, and we have shrunk to nothing in the reckoning of the cosmic being.\nWe walk the stage of life, performers of a drama for the benefit of the cosmic spectator. As the scenes proceed he notices that the actors are growing smaller and the action quicker. When the last act opens the curtain rises on midget actors rushing through their parts at frantic speed. Smaller and smaller. Faster and faster. One last microscopic blurr of intense agitation. And then nothing.\n\nWhen the above-described exponentially accelerating shrinkage and radiative \"evaporation\" of positive‑actual‑energy protons into the negative‑potential‑energy ambient vacuum comes to an end, the universe again has the maximal (\"i.e.\", zero) potential energy, and the minimal (\"i.e.\", zero) actual energy. Such a universe is in a state of heat death and exists as a uniform blanket of zero-temperature heat. The 13.8‑billion‑year‑long gravitational life cycle then begins anew. And so \"ad infinitum\".\nFor stable equilibrium the gravitational potential energy of the system must be a minimum. In the case of multiple protons, the gravitational potential energy is proportional to the radius of a single proton and to the spatial separation of protons. Thus, the continuum's protons attain the minimal potential energy by shrinking and accelerating towards the continuum's central proton:\n\nAs the peripheral protons move towards the continuum's central proton, whose accelerating influence intensifies in accordance with the inverse‑square law, they radiate away their rest mass, so that their resistance to acceleration decreases. Having radiated away a half of their initial rest mass, the peripheral protons instantaneously tunnel into the continuum's central proton.\n\nAt first, the prevailing opinion was that the heat death of the universe was in the distant future, because stars initially had high temperatures and cooled progressively with time, so that the rate of heat loss exponentially decreased. This insouciant view was overturned by Jonathan Homer Lane, who in 1870 discovered that the temperature of a self‑gravitating perfect-gas sphere is inversely proportional to its radius: \"rT\"(\"r\") = \"constant\". This equation is known as Lane's law. For example, when the sphere's radius (\"r\") decreases tenfold, the sphere's temperature (\"T\") increases tenfold:\n\nLane reached the apparently paradoxical result that a star by losing heat and contracting actually grew hotter. A star shrinking under gravitation to half its linear size and remaining built on the same model, or \"homologous\" (i.e., the densities at two corresponding points at any two stages remaining the same fraction of the mean density) would be eight times as dense, and the internal pressures would be sixteen times as great as the overlying material is attracted four times as strongly and its weight is held up on only a quarter of the area. From the formula connecting temperature with pressure and density, given earlier in the chapter, it will be seen that the temperature in this example would be twice as great. By such reasoning, Lane concluded that as stars get smaller they grow hotter to withstand gravitation and resist collapse.\n\nThe Stefan–Boltzmann law (1879) dictates that the rate at which a unit surface area of the self‑gravitationally condensing sphere radiates away heat is proportional to the fourth power of the sphere's temperature. So, even after taking into account that the sphere's surface area decreases a hundredfold (as the square of the radius), Lane's law implies that, when the self‑gravitating sphere's radius shrinks tenfold, the sphere's total radiative heat loss per unit time increases a hundredfold.\n\nIn addition, the gravitational potential energy of a self‑gravitationally collapsing uniform sphere is proportional to its radius \"R\":\nThat is why the tenfold decrease in the radius implies that the amount of generated collapse‑impeding actual energy decreases tenfold. Therefore, when the self‑gravitating sphere's radius shrinks tenfold, the speed of the sphere's collapse increases a thousandfold.\n\nIn 1983, numerical calculations on large computers predicted that as the temperature is raised the colour‑repelling physical vacuum should flip into the simple vacuum, of which protons consist, at a temperature of 2 × 10 K. From the Stefan–Boltzmann law it follows that a body as hot as the proton must be radiating away its energy at a frantic pace and shrink accordingly. To an observer consisting of such rapidly shrinking protons, intergalactic spaces must appear to be expanding with an exponential acceleration. In 1998, Adam Riess and his team discovered that the apparent expansion of intergalactic spaces is accelerating. On 5 April 2016, Adam Riess \"et al.\" announced that the rate of the acceleration is itself increasing—over the three years since 21 March 2013, when the Planck space observatory published the local Hubble constant value, the apparent expansion of intergalactic spaces had accelerated by nine per cent more than expected. The proton's heat death is coming apace and hastening.\n\nIn 1974, Stephen Hawking applied the above‑described principle of heat death to black holes and found that they, too, radiate away their energy (Hawking radiation) and consequently shrink in size; the smaller a black hole becomes, the faster it radiates away its remaining energy.\n\n", "id": "586817", "title": "Heat death of the universe"}

The Taliban started to attack the forces of ISAF and NATO, in Afghanistan, and committed terrorist attacks. Al-Quaeda is lnked to these attacks. With this, the conflict in the region spread to Pakistan. The related conflict in Pakistan is known as War in North-West Pakistan today. Iin the conflict, the Taliban fight against the Afghan government and its allies. \n\nBecause Afghanistan has seen a number of conflicts and wars in recent decades, its economy has changed, and many people depend on growing cash crops, such as poppy seeds which are used to produce illegal drugs such as Opium, or Heroin. Many people do not think the problems are caused by the Taliban. Resolving the problem will therefore probably more effort than winning against the Taliban. It will also mean that there need to be changes in the economy, and the way in which the country is run. \n\nCurrently, Afghanistan is one of the biggest producers of Opium. While opium also has its uses as a regular drug, it is mainly used as an illegal drug. In 2001, Afghanistan produced only 11% of the world's opium, today it produces over ninety percent. In 2007, 93% of the \"non-pharmaceutical-grade\" opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan. This amounts to an export value of about $4 billion; opium farmers earn about a quarter of this amount, the rest goes to district officials, insurgents, warlords, and drug traffickers. The drug trade accounts for half of Afghanistan's GDP. \nEstimates made in 2006 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimate that 52% of the nation's GDP, or $2.7 billion annually, is generated by the drug trade. \n\nAreas where the security situation is worse produce more Opium; areas that are more stable seem to produce less. Many farmers in rural areas depend on selling poppy seeds. Opium is more profitable than wheat and destroying opium fields could possibly lead to discontent or unrest among the affected population. Some 3.3 million Afghans are involved in producing opium. For this reason, some people say that eradicating poppy crops is not a viable option. Some poppy eradication programs have, however, proven effective, especially in the north of Afghanistan. The opium poppy eradication program of Balkh Governor Ustad Atta Mohammad Noor between 2005 and 2007 successfully reduced poppy cultivation in Balkh Province from 7,200 hectares in 2005 to zero by 2007.\n\nThe Afghanistan Opium Risk Assessment 2013, issued by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, suggests that the Taliban has since 2008 been supporting farmers growing poppy, as a source of income for the insurgency.\n\nThere have been wars and conflicts in Afghanistan for over thirty years. As a result, the country is among the poorest, and least developed countries in the world. It is also one of the most corrupt. Thirty-five percent of the poulation are unemployed, and more than half of the people live below the poverty line.\n\nWestern aid group Oxfam published an opinion poll they conducted in Afghanistan, in 2010. According to this poll, 83 percent of the Afghan population does not consider the Taliban militants. Poverty, unemployment and government corruption are seen as the main causes of war in their country. When the U.S.-backed Afghan forces ousted the Taliban in late 2001, the level of violence increased. Nearly half of those surveyed said corruption and bad government were the main reasons for the ongoing war. Twelve percent said the Taliban insurgency was to blame.After the Taliban, the reason most people gave for the continued fighting was foreign interference, with twenty-five percent of respondents saying other countries were to blame.\n\nSince the start of 2006 Afghanistan has been facing a wave of attacks by improvised explosives and suicide bombers, particularly after NATO took command of the fight against insurgents in spring 2006.\n\nAfghan President Hamid Karzai publicly condemned the methods used by the western powers. In June 2006 he said:\n\nInsurgents were also criticized for their conduct. According to Human Rights Watch, bombing and other attacks on Afghan civilians by the Taliban (and to a lesser extent Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin), are reported to have \"sharply escalated in 2006\" with \"at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at civilians or civilian objects.\" 131 of insurgent attacks were suicide attacks which killed 212 civilians (732 wounded), 46 Afghan army and police members (101 wounded), and 12 foreign soldiers (63 wounded).\n\nThe United Nations estimated that for the first half of 2011, the civilian deaths rose by 15% and reached 1462, which is the worst death toll since the beginning of the war and despite the surge of foreign troops.\n", "id": "586827", "title": "Taliban insurgency"}

Close satelliteslike the ISS move very quickly to orbit the Earth, so they are slowed down. Because the ISS is in low Earth orbit (LEO), time dilation due to gravity is not as strong as time dilation due to its speed, so a clock on it is slowed down more than it is sped up. An object in Geostationary orbit moves less quickly and is farther away from Earth, so gravitational time dilation is stronger, and clocks move more quickly than in LEO. This means that engineers need to pick different clocks for different orbits.

After college she met Albert Miller, also a physician, and they got married in 1856 but she kept her last name as Walker.  After marriage, together they started a medical practice, but not many people wanted to go to a woman doctor as they did not trust she could do as good of a job as a man physician. The practice struggled and so did the young couples marriage. Thirteen years later Mary Walker and Albert Miller divorced and their practice sadly failed. Although her marriage failed, she came back more confident than ever as the Civil War began.\n\nAt the break of the Civil War and with high confidence, Walker tried to enlist in the Union Army. She was denied because of her gender but did not take no for an answer. Trying again, she enlisted as a surgeon in the war and was transferred to the 52nd Ohio Infantry. Later she was appointed assistant surgeon. This was a very big accomplishment for a woman at this time.  During one of her trips to the Confederacy to tend to the sick and wounded, she was captured. During 1864 Walker was imprisoned for four months in Richmond, Virginia. After four months Walker, along with other surgeons in the Union, were released in a trade for 17 Confederate doctors. Even after her capture, Walker still continued to cross the line between the Confederates and Union to tend to the sick and wounded even after her experience of being imprisoned with the Confederates. Until the war ended, Walker remained with the 52nd Ohio Infantry, tending to the sick and wounded. Mary Edward Walker’s persistence and determination paid off as she served the sick and wounded on the battlefield, refusing to be pulled down because of her gender. \n\nOnce the war had ended, Walker went back home to Oswego, New York. She was honored for her work. On November 11, 1865, she received the Congressional Medal of Honor. She was the first and only woman to ever receive this honor.  Soon after she got her medal, it was revoked by Congress because she was not involved in combat.  Walker did not let this get her down. Every single day, until she died, she wore her medal and refused to give it back. Since she almost never wore women’s clothing, she was arrested several times for wearing men’s but never was put in jail. Walker believed that the Constitution gave women a right to vote and wear what they wanted. She died on February 21, 1919, three months before the 19th amendment was passed giving women the right to vote. After her death, she was remembered for her intelligence, bravery, and determination.\n\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter restored Mary Edwards Walker’s medal. She was smart, kind, and helped change the face of women’s rights to get it to the place it is today. At the time she was doing something that people believed was impossible; a woman becoming a doctor who served on a battlefield. She was different, and proved that it’s ok to take risks and to be bold in your beliefs. \n", "id": "587137", "title": "Mary Edwards Walker"}

The most notable rainforests are in the tropics or subtropics. The biggest tropical rainforest is the Amazon rainforest, which is mostly in Brazil. Forests like this have extraordinary biodiversity. Biologists say over half of all plant and animal species live in the rainforest. Also more than 1/4 of all medicines come from here. Even though they only cover 6% of the Earth's land area they are still an important source of oxygen.[1]\n\nThe rainforest gets an average of 50 to 250 inches (1.2-6.3m) of rain through the year. It is warm year round rarely getting above 33°C (93°F) or getting below 20°C (68°F). It has an average humidity of 77 to 88%. Tropical rainforests occur in three major geographical areas around the world.[2]\n\nParts of South and Central America – the Amazon River basin, and Costa Rica.\nAfrica – Congo River basin, with a small area in West Africa; also eastern Madagascar.\nSouth Asia and Australasia – west coast of India, Assam, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Queensland, Australia.\nA less-used term is temperate rainforest. For temperate rain forests of North America,[3] annual precipitation is over 140 cm (55 in), and the mean annual temperature is between 4 and 12 °C (39 and 54 °F). However, definitions in other countries differ considerably. For example, Australian definitions are ecological-structural rather than climatic:\n\nClosed canopy of trees which excludes at least 70% of the sky.\nForest is composed mainly of tree species which do not require fire for regeneration, but with seedlings able to regenerate under shade and in natural openings.[4]\nThis definition would not suit the forests of western North America, and so the term \"temperate rainforest\" is not so widely agreed. The weather in a rainforest would be humid , which is wet but warm like a greenhouse. The bottom most layer receives 2% of the sunlight. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. The understory layer lies between the canopy and forest floor. It is a home to a number of birds , snakes and lizards as well as predators such as jaguars and leopards. The leaves are much bigger at this level and insect life is abundant.Nobody Knowes How Many Rainforests there are", "id": "587536", "title": "Rainforestanimals"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=587973", "text": "Grenfell Tower fire\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire started shortly before 1am BST on 14 June 2017 in a tall building or tower block, Grenfell Tower, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, West London, England. Grenfell Tower was built in 1974, and was used for housing people. The flats in the building were subsidized: meaning the government paid part or all of the of the people who lived there. In the early hours of 14 June, 2017, a fire broke out in the building, which caused massive damage to nearly all of the building. The fire broke out around the 5th floor of the 23 floor building. It was signalled to police at 0:54 local time. The fire brigade took 6 minutes to get to the tower. In total, 40 fire engines, and more than 200 firefighters were trying to put out the fire. On the 14th of June, at the end of the day, the number of people injured (and taken to hospitals) was about eighty, about 20 were in a critical condition. At least thirty people died in the fire. There could have been up to 600 people in the 120 one- and two-bedroom flats of the block at the time of the fire. The number of people that were in the building when the fire broke out is unknown; police have estimated around 200.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet known, but police have ruled out a terrorist attack. The fire spread very rapidly. Many people believe this was due to the outside of the building, which had been changed recently. This cladding seemed to contain highly flammable material. Many residents complained about poor fire safety and other problems with the building, which was managed on behalf of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The residents' organisation, Grenfell Action Group, had repeatedly warned of major fire safety problems since 2013, and also noted past fires and fire-related incidents in similar blocks managed by the same company, which they felt were related to poor fire safeguards and management company fire policies. One of these policies told residents to stay in their flats in case of fire. The group warned in November 2016 that only a \"catastrophic\" fire would finally force the block's management to treat fire precautions and maintenance of fire-related systems to a proper standard.\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were \"questions that have to be answered\" about the fire-safety conditions at the Grenfell Tower. Khan criticised the safety instructions telling people to stay in their flats in particular:\n\"We can't have people's lives being put at risk because of bad advice or lack of maintenance.\" The advice of staying in the flat assumes that firefighters can contain the fire inside the building, which is impossible if it is spreading rapidly via its outside. The advice may have proved fatal to many people. \n\nA team of 250 firefighters from forty fire engines attempted to control the fire and rescue people. The first emergency services arrived six minutes after the alarm, but the fire's very high temperature slowed rescue attempts. At 04:14, officials from the Metropolitan Police addressed the large crowd of onlookers and urgently told them to contact anyone they knew who was trapped in the building—if they are able to reach them via phone or social media—to tell them they must try to self-evacuate and not wait for the fire brigade. Firefighters entered the building to try to rescue people but reported they were hindered by the extreme heat.According to witnesses, there were people trapped inside, waving from windows for help, some holding children. There were two witness accounts of parents dropping their children down to people below, including a baby who was caught after being thrown from the ninth or tenth floor, and a small boy thrown from the fifth or sixth floor. There were also eyewitness reports that some people were jumping out. At least one person used knotted blankets to make a rope and escape from the burning building. Frequent explosions that were reported to be from gas lines in the building were heard.\nMany residents of the tower were Muslims. Because of Ramadan, many were awake at the late hour. Many were able to alert residents and help them escape during the early stages of the fire, which saved many lives. For this, they were hailed as heroes.\n\nAfter three hours, the original crew of firefighters were replaced. By sunrise, the firefighters were still battling the fire and trying to spray areas where people were seen trapped. The watching crowd were pushed back from the building because of falling debris. At 05:00, the building was still burning and severely damaged.The fire continued to burn on the tower's upper floors into the afternoon of 14 June. Firefighters were expecting to continue tackling the blaze for at least a further 24 hours. Although fears were expressed that the building could collapse, structural engineers determined that it was not in danger and that rescue teams could enter it to search for survivors, casualties and bodies.\n\nThe cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Several media outlets reported that it may have been caused by a faulty kitchen appliance. A fourth-floor resident told the media that it was his neighbour's fridge that caught fire around 1:00 am, and that they immediately began knocking on doors to alert people. He said that within half an hour the building was entirely engulfed in flames.\n\nWhilst there was much criticism of the lack of fire sprinkler systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the \"Architects' Journal\", wrote in a comment on 14 June, before the cause was known (\"we should avoid speculating\"), that if a leaking gas riser or the cladding were at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He said he had seen extracts of a fire risk assessment and talk of flammable material stored in the common walkways, suggesting poor overall management.\n\nThe inhabitants of the building organised the Grenfell Action Group, years ago. They regularly pointed out problems with the building. In 2013, they published part of a report, where they showed that the protection against fire was insufficient in the building. Regulations require that these materials are checked regularly. According to the 2013 report of action group, there had been no such checks in the three years before the report. \n\nWhen a building is on fire, people need to be able to get out quickly. Usually, there are specially signalled escape lanes for this. The action group pointed out that the escape lanes were not free, and people often parked their cars in such a way that the police was unable to get close to the building\n\nThere had been various repairs and renovations in the building, from 2014 to 2016. The company who was responsible for these works said that they were shocked, at what had happened, and that at the time the works had been done, regulations had been met. \n\nWhen the building was renovated, the materials used for the outside of the building were changed. Fire safety experts have speculated that this new material was a possible cause of the rapid spread of the fire. They said it essentially worked like a chimney in spreading the fire. The material could be seen burning and melting, causing additional speculation that it was not fire resistant. One resident said, \"The whole one side of the building was on fire. The cladding went up like a matchstick.\"\n\nRecords show that a contractor installed \"over-cladding with ACM cassette rain screen\" during the recent refurbishment at Grenfell Tower. The term ACM stands for aluminium composite material. With this kind of material, the choice of insulation core material determines how easily it can be burned. Several tower building fires have involved the same external materials, including the 2009 Lakanal House fire in Camberwell, London, the 2009 Beijing Television Cultural Center fire and the 2015 fire at The Marina Torch, Dubai. Sam Webb, the architect who investigated the Lakanal fire and who sits on the All Party Parliamentary Fire Safety & Rescue Group, said \"This tragedy was entirely predictable, sadly.\"\n\nThe product used was Reynobond, which is available with different types of core material—polyethylene, as reportedly used in Grenfell Tower (Reynobond PE), or a more fire-resistant material (Reynobond FR). The Reynobond cladding reportedly cost £24 per square metre for the fireproof versions, and £22 for the flammable version. According to the BBC, the more fire-resistant version (Reynobond FR) is a very new product, and it is unclear whether it was available at the time the building was being clad\n\nAccording to the US-based manufacturer of Reynobond, the polyethylene version of the material is banned in the United States for use in buildings exceeding in height, because of the risk of spreading fire and smoke. The refurbishment also used an insulation foam product named Celotex RS5000, installed behind the cladding.\nAccording to its datasheet, the polyisocyanurate product—charred pieces of which littered the area around Grenfell Tower after the fire—\"will burn if exposed to a fire of sufficient heat and intensity\".\nThe cladding at Grenfell seems to have been used to decorate other appartment blocks People are concerned that the affected buildings may face the same problems.\nSome residents had reported concern that the new cladding on the building was fixed onto it with wooden battens. There is widespread concern amongst residents and fire safety experts about the increasing use of timber, even in high-rise buildings, following a change to building regulations. It was reported that one reason for the new cladding was to improve the view for people living in the surrounding area.\n\nSome residents said no fire alarms went off when the fire started. Residents said they were alerted to the fire only by people screaming for help or knocks on the door and not by a fire alarm. Others reported that they survived by ignoring the council's \"stay put\" policy, its directive instructing residents to remain in their flat in case of fire.\n\nThe London-wide Radical Housing Network, a citizens' action \"group of groups... fighting for housing justice across London\" of which the Grenfell Action Group is a member, said that the fire was \"a horrific, preventable tragedy\" that was the result of a \"combination of government cuts, local authority mismanagement, and sheer contempt for council tenants and the homes they live in\".\n\nPeople in the immediate area and from across London rallied to assist victims of the fire. Donations of food, water, toys, and clothes were made. Saint Clement Church on Treadgold Street and St James' Church, Norlands, in the Deanery of Kensington, provided shelter for people evacuated from their homes, as did nearby mosques and temples.\n\nNearby Queens Park Rangers Football Club have offered their Loftus Road venue as a relief centre and are accepting donations of food, drink and clothing from the local community, and other nearby football clubs Brentford and Fulham have offered their stadiums as relief centres.\n", "id": "587973", "title": "Grenfell Tower fire"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588179", "text": "Polyisocyanurate\n\nPolyisocyanurate, also referred to as PIR, polyiso, or ISO, is a thermoset plastic typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation. Its chemistry is similar to polyurethane (PUR) except that the proportion of methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is higher and a polyester-derived polyol is used in the reaction instead of a polyether polyol. Catalysts and additives used in PIR formulations also differ from those used in PUR.\n\nPIR is typically produced as a foam and used as rigid thermal insulation. Its thermal conductivity has a typical value of 0.16 BTU*in/hr*ft*°F (0.023 W/(m·K)) depending on the perimeter:area ratio. PIR foam panels laminated with pure embossed aluminium foil are used for fabrication of pre-insulated duct that is used for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Prefabricated PIR sandwich panels are manufactured with corrosion-protected, corrugated steel facings bonded to a core of PIR foam and used extensively as roofing insulation and vertical walls (e.g. for warehousing, factories, office buildings etc.). Other typical uses for PIR foams include industrial and commercial pipe insulation, and carving/machining media (competing with expanded polystyrene and rigid polyurethane foams).\n\nEffectiveness of the insulation of a building envelope can be compromised by gaps resulting from shrinkage of individual panels. Manufacturing criteria require that shrinkage be limited to less than 1% (previously 2%). Even when shrinkage is limited to substantially less than this limit, the resulting gaps around the perimeter of each panel can reduce insulation effectiveness, especially if the panels are assumed to provide a vapor/infiltration barrier. Multiple layers with staggered joints, ship lapped or tongue & groove joints greatly reduce these problems.\n\nPIR insulation can be a mechanical irritant to skin, eyes, and upper respiratory system during fabrication (such as dust). No statistically significant increased risks of respiratory diseases have been found in studies\n\nPIR is at times stated to be fire retardant, or contain fire retardants, however these describe the results of \"small scale tests\" and \"do not reflect [all] hazards under real fire conditions\"; the extent of hazards from fire include not just resistance to fire but the scope for toxic byproducts from different fire scenarios. A 2011 study of fire toxicity of insulating materials at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Fire and Hazard Science studied PIR and other commonly used materials under more realistic and wide-ranging conditions representative of a wider range of fire hazard, observing that most fire deaths resulted from toxic product inhalation. The study evaluated the degree to which toxic products were released, looking at toxicity, time-release profiles, and lethality of doses released, in a range of flaming, non-flaming, and poorly ventilated fires, and concluded that PIR generally released a considerably higher level of toxic products than the other insulating materials studied (PIR > PUR > EPS > PHF; glass and stone wools also studied). In particular, hydrogen cyanide is recognised as a significant contributor to the fire toxicity of PIR (and PUR) foams.\n\nDespite this PIR insulation is generally regarded as being more fire resistant than PUR insulation.\n\n100mm PIR insulation board (cited as the RS5000 product of Celotex, a Saint-Gobain company) was proposed as the columnar and horizontal external insulation to be used in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, London; subsequently \"Ipswich firm Celotex confirmed it provided insulation materials for the refurbishment.\" On 14 June 2017 the block of flats, within 15 minutes, was enveloped in flames from the fourth floor to the top 24th floor. The causes of the rapid spread of fire up the outside of the building have yet to be established. It should be noted that flames can occupy the cavity between the insulation material and the cladding, and be drawn upwards by convection, elongating to create secondary fires, and do so \"regardless of the materials used to line the cavities\".\n\n", "id": "588179", "title": "Polyisocyanurate"}
