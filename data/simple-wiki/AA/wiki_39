Many years after Mussorgsky’s death a French composer named Maurice Ravel made an arrangement of the piece for orchestra. This arrangement has also become very famous and this is how people usually hear the music today.\n\n\"Pictures at an Exhibition\" is a musical description of an exhibition of pictures by the painter Viktor Hartmann. Hartmann was only 39 when he died in 1873. He and Mussorgsky had been good friends. They both tried to give their works a very Russian character: Hartmann through his pictures and Mussorgsky through his music. In 1874 an exhibition of Hartmann’s pictures was organised in the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg. Mussorgsky went to the exhibition and was inspired to compose his piano piece. \n\n\"Pictures at an Exhibition\" describes someone walking round the exhibition and looking at the pictures. The ten pictures he describes in music were drawings and watercolours. Mussorgsky starts his piece with a tune which describes the person walking round the exhibition. It is usually known as the “promenade” theme (a promenade is a walk). At first Mussorgsky puts the promenade theme between each picture, but he does not do that all the way through the piece. Some of the later pictures have bits of the promenade theme in the music.\n\nMussorgsky composed the piece very quickly. It was not published until 1886, five years after the composer’s death. The composer’s great friend Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov published it, but he made some changes to what Mussorgsky had written.

The term 'Art Rock' or 'Kunst Rock' was coined and defined, by the great black philosopher Doctor William Fearon, and is very much related to the 'Kunst Muzik' of the 1970s led by UK/US bands such as the Ramones, Talking Heads and Television and the Detroit/German led Techno movement. Dr Fearon coined the term and its German equivalent in recognition of the impact that Futurism had on late twentieth century music. Far from being an album based music format Art Rock is recognisable at live venues in the modern age, with the developments in light and video technology meaning that Art and Rock can be seamelessly fused. It is an album-based form that is able to have longer, more complex music and lets the musicians spend more time trying different ways to play their instruments. Art rock is not created for mass consumption, meaning it is not made to be liked by most people. It is often long and has a lot of themes like classical music, but usually has more keyboards than guitars. Also, it is not really music to dance to, but music to just listen to, and it often tells a story or has a philosophical theme to the lyrics.\"\n\nThe idea of \"art rock\" has sometimes been used when talking about the \"progressive rock\" bands which became popular in the 1970s. Allmusic says that progressive rock and art rock are almost the same; both used to describe rock music that is more artistic. Progressive rock eventually stuck as a label for a specific genre of rock music, while art rock was used to described bands that were harder to label. \n\nPrinceton University's Wordnet dictionary states that \"progressive rock, art rock\" are \"a style of rock music that [came out] in the 1970s; associated with attempts to [mix] rock with jazz and other forms.\" It also says that it is meant \"for listening and not dancing\". \n\nExamples include Queen, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, The Beatles, Genesis and Yes.\n", "id": "120999", "title": "Art rock"}

However, progressive metal did not evolve into a genre of its own until the mid-1980s.

The largest city in the state is Memphis, followed by Nashville, the capital of Tennessee. Knoxville is the county seat of Knox County. In 2010, it had a population of 178,874.\n\nThe city has been often called \"The Streaking Capital of the World\" and \"The Underwear Capital of the World\".\n\nKnoxville was founded in 1786 and is the second oldest of Tennessee's four major cities, after Nashville which was founded in 1779. After Tennessee's admission into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the state's first capital. In 1819, the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville becoming the current capital. The city was named in honor of the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.\n\nKnoxville's economy is largely fueled by the regional location of the main campus of the University of Tennessee, the and other Department of Energy facilities in nearby , the National Transportation Research Center, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nKnoxville's textile and manufacturing industries were hurt by foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s. After the building of the Interstate Highway system in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth—began to decline. Suburban shopping malls in the 1970s took retail revenues away from Knoxville's Downtown area. So, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by trying to annex neighboring communities in Knox County. People fought these annexation attempts. Several efforts to combine all of the Knoxville and Knox County governments failed. But the city and county school boards merged on 1 July 1987.\n\nKnoxville tried to improve its downtown. The 1982 World's Fair—the most successful of these projects—became one of the most popular world's fairs in U.S. history with 11 million visitors. The fair's energy theme was selected due to Knoxville being the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the city's proximity to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Sunsphere, a steel truss structure topped with a gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of Knoxville's most prominent buildings, along with the adjacent amphitheater which underwent a renovation that was completed in 2008.\n\nEver since, Knoxville's downtown has been developing, with the opening of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention Center, redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a regional history museum, a Regal Cinemas theater, several restaurants and bars, and many new and redeveloped condominiums. Since 2000 Knoxville has successfully brought business back to the downtown area. The arts in particular have begun to flourish, there are multiple venues for outdoor concerts.

It is the second-oldest university in all English-speaking countries. It is one of the world's leading places of learning.\nThe University started as a group of scholars in the city of Cambridge. This may have started in 1209, when scholars left Oxford after a fight with local people. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge are often called \"Oxbridge\". This is not a different university. It is a way of saying Oxford and Cambridge together. Cambridge University and Oxford University are both very important to the history of England.\n\nCambridge is usually ranked in the world's top five universities. UK rankings and tests on the quality of its research also rate it very highly. Cambridge has more than 18,000 students and a large number of sport clubs and societies.\n\nMany important people studied at the University of Cambridge, including scientists, poets, artists, politicians and members of the British Royal Family. 89 students from Cambridge later won a Nobel Prize.\n\nThe official creation of the University was in 1231, when King Henry III of England gave to the people there the right to teach students and lower taxes. A letter from Pope Gregory IX in 1233 also gave the right to everyone who got a degree from Cambridge to teach in any place in the Christian world.\n\nIn 1290 Pope Nicholas IV called Cambridge a \"studium generale\" (name for a university in Medieval times). From that point many researchers and teachers from other European universities started to come to Cambridge to work or give lessons.\n\nColleges started as places for students and teachers to live. They were called hostels at first. The students paid money to build and run these hostels. All colleges were formed after the beginning of the University. Over the years, colleges bought all of these hostels back. However, some old names still resist today, such as Garret Hostel Lane which was named after Garret Hostel.\n\nPeterhouse was the first official college to be created in 1284. Many followed over the centuries and today there are 31. The last one, Robinson, was built in the 1970s. Many of these have a chapel because the members should have prayed for the soul of the founders (the people who created the college).\n\nThe University was one of the most important places where the Protestant Reformation began. In fact, people started talking about Lutheranism here very early. Thomas Cranmer, who became a central figure for reform, studied at Cambridge.\n\nA century later, some people in Cambridge started to think that the Church of England was too much like the Catholic church. They started the Puritan movement. This produced more than 20,000 people who left for New England around 1620 in search for a place with better religious beliefs. Oliver Cromwell, a very important member of this movement, was a student at Sidney Sussex during this time.\n\nCambridge has been strong in applied mathematics since Isaac Newton was a student here in the 17th century. Every student had to study maths in order to obtain a degree. The degree was awarded as a \"Bachelor of Arts\" which mixed both arts and science subjects. Several important early physicists studied at Cambridge. They include James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Lord Rayleigh. Pure mathematics was slower to catch up, but Cambridge is still famous for it thanks to people like G.H. Hardy.\n\nSix maths graduates from Cambridge won a Fields Medal and one who got an Abel Prize. These are the world's highest awards for mathematicians. Four other researchers at Cambridge also won Fields Medals.\n\nPeople at the University of Cambridge have made many important scientific discoveries over the time. These are some of the best known ones:\n\nFor many years only men were allowed to study at Cambridge. In 1869 Girton, the first college for women, was built. Women could take exams from 1882, but only in 1948 did they start to be considered full members of the university. For a certain time they even received \"ad eundem\" degrees (degrees from a University you have not studied at, but you deserve) from the University of Dublin.\n\nOver the years, more women-only colleges were built, until in 1972 Churchill was the first one to become mixed. Many others followed, and in 1988 Magdalene was the last men-only college to open to women. However, there are still some colleges for women only. Cambridge is the only university that still has this characteristic. All other universities in the UK, including Oxford, now have only mixed colleges.\n\nSince it is very old, the University has many legends and traditions. These are often passed on by older students to the younger ones. Tour guides also tell these stories to tourists.\n\nThe wooden spoon tradition was to give this type of spoon to the student who was the worst in the year for mathematics but still passed the exams. This was because the students used to be ranked in order of their result. After 1909 this was changed and so the wooden spoon cannot be given anymore. However, still today in many sport competitions a wooden spoon is given to the last person in the rankings.\n\nMany legends exist about places in Cambridge. For example, there is a story about the \"Mathematical Bridge\" in Queen's College. Newton built it without using any bolts or screws. Some people then took it down to see how it was made. When they tried to put it up again they could not do it, so they had to insert many bolts.\n\nAnother tradition is that the King's College choir sings the Nine Lessons and Carols church service. This is recorded by the BBC and sent around the world since 1928 by radio. From 1954 it can also be seen on television. Many people watch it on Christmas Eve in Great Britain.\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a \"collegiate\" university. This means it is divided into the colleges, and every student and teacher joins one college only. Every one of these colleges has its own property and money. They all have many Fellows who can teach all the subjects between them. Then there are Departments and Faculties, which are buildings where only one subject is studied. There are also Schools that bring different Departments and Faculties together. The overall head of the University is called the Vice-Chancellor. They are head of the Senate and Regent House which make decisions for the whole University.\nThere are 31 colleges in Cambridge:\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only for women\n\n†Only for PhD studends\n\n‡Only for students older than 21 years\n\nThere are also 3 smaller affiliated colleges: Westcott House, Westminster College and Ridley Hall. These are not real colleges, but students there can follow the University of Cambridge's lessons. They are only for theology, the study of religion. These three colleges together form the \"Cambridge Theological Federation\".\n\nThe teaching is done through lectures and practical classes (where students do experiments in science subjects) organized by the Department. The colleges also organize supervisions. These are small lessons in groups of 2 or 3: the students do some homework and then talk about it with a teacher. This is often considered to be one of the best things about studying at Cambridge. The teaching is very personal and students have the chance to ask lots of questions and really understand the subject.\n\nThere are more than 150 different faculties and departments in Cambridge. These are then grouped into \"Schools\". These have a supervisory body, a group of people who check that the departments are doing ok. There are six Schools:\n\nThe year is divided into three parts. The first one is Michaelmas Term, which is from October to December and takes its name from St Michael's day and Christmas. The second one is Lent Term, and goes from January to March. The last one is Easter Term, from April to June. Within these times, there is a period of 8 weeks called \"Full Term\". Most lessons and exams happen in Full Term. All students need to live in college for this period. There is a University rule which says that students can get their degree only if they have stayed for at least 9 terms (3 years) at a distance of less than 10 miles from the main Church in Cambridge.\n\nThe head of the University is the Chancellor. As of 2013, he is David Sainsbury. He was elected in 2011 after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh said he did not want to do it anymore. Prince Philip had been Chancellor for 25 years. The position of Chancellor is mainly ceremonial. That means that the Chancellor does not take part in many decisions. He is just there because an overall head of the University is needed.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor instead is the one that makes most decisions. For example, he/she approves and signs new rules. The role is given to a person for at least five years. The current Vice-Chancellor is Leszek Borysiewicz.\n\nThe Senate House is a building in Cambridge. The degree ceremony takes place there. Any Cambridge student who has an MA degree is a member of the Senate. It is also the place where the important people in the University meet to take decisions. These important people are different Officers and Fellows of the colleges. They are also called the \"Regent House\". This is not another building, it is just a way of calling these people. They can make and change rules when they meet. News and information are printed and given out in the \"Cambridge University Reporter\". This is the official newspaper of the university.\n\nThe university had £4.3 billion in endowments in 2011. This money was given over lots of time by many people. This is the biggest amount of money for universities in Europe. Every college controls its money on its own. They are all considered charitable organizations. The British Government also gives money in research grants: these are for postgraduate students and their teachers. There is also some income produced by the Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn 2000, Cambridge received a very large donation of US$210 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This was to set up a scholarship so that US and other international students could study in Cambridge more easily. Bill Gates was also made a Knight by the Queen because of his generosity. Between 2005 and 2012, a campaign was made to get £1 billion from old students. This was at the same time of the University's 800th anniversary. The campaign got to the target early in 2010.\n\nThe University is spread around the town of Cambridge. The older colleges are on the river Cam. The departments and faculties are spread in different places, usually grouped in sites. There are nine main sites:\n\n\nAddenbrooke's Hospital is where the medicine students go to learn how to cure patients. The \"Judge Business School\" is another important building: this is where courses about business and finance are taught. Since the different sites are quite close to each other, many students like to use the bicycle to move around. A fifth of the journeys in the town is made by bike. Students are also not allowed to drive a car while they are in Cambridge.\n\nLocal people from Cambridge don't always like the students. \"Town and Gown\" is a phrase to talk about this relationship. \"Town\" means the Cambridge locals while \"Gown\" means the students and teachers, from the type of dress they wear. Since the University began, there have been some fights between the two groups. In 1381, many things were stolen from the university and the colleges. The Chancellor was then given extra power to control order in the town. When the plague arrived in Cambridge in 1630, many colleges closed up. They did not want to help the locals who had the disease.\n\nHowever, more recently there have been fewer fights. The University also means more jobs and money for the population. There are many small industries that were created in Cambridge because the University was near. This effect is called \"The Cambridge Phenomenon\". Between 1960-2010 there have been 1,500 new companies and 40,000 new jobs in Cambridge just thanks to the University.\n\nThe University has 114 libraries. The main one is called \"Cambridge University Library\". It is a legal deposit, which means every book that is printed in the United Kingdom goes in this library. Many departments have their own library as well. They usually have special books for their subjects only. All colleges have a library. This is mainly for the undergraduates, so that they can read basic books about their subjects. Some colleges also have very precious books and manuscripts. For example, the Parker Library (Corpus Christi College) has special books from Medieval times.\n\nThe university also has 8 museums and a botanical garden:\n\nOne of the main aims of the University of Cambridge is to do scientific research. All the departments are always studying and discovering new things. Many important people have done research in Cambridge. This is because the university has a lot of money and resources like laboratories and books. It had £283.7 M in 2011 to spend on research; this was mainly given by the UK Government and the European Commission.\nStudents need to pass some tests and interviews to be allowed in Cambridge. For undergraduates, the application is done through UCAS. This is as with any other university in the UK. Students need to be very good to enter Cambridge. If they study A-levels, they are asked to get at least A*AA. Because many good students apply, the interview is very important to choose the best ones. These are done by Fellows. Usually about 25% of the applicants get a place. However, the number changes depending on the subjects. Some of them, like medicine and economics are very hard to get into. Students need to choose a college before doing the application. They may later have to change it if the college thinks they are good but does not have enough places for them.\n\nFor postgraduates the application is different. They need to ask professors (teachers) in the departments they want to work in. After an interview, they can be given a place. They then have to get some funding (money to do the project). This can be given from a government or another institution.\n\nSome people think that admission at Cambridge is not very fair. This is because it is easier to get in if you go to a private school instead of a state school. In 2007-2008, only 57% of students who got a place were coming from state school. However, about 93% of British children go to them. If a student goes to a private school, he/she is also more likely to get a place after the interview. In 2011, only 25% of students that applied from state school got a place, while the percentage was 33% for private school students. The University is trying to make things better by making the admission process easier and giving scholarships for the poorer students. Another problem is that year after year there are also fewer people from state schools applying.\n\nCambridge does very well when the quality of research is tested. In 2001, it was ranked first in the British Government Assessment Exercise. Cambridge also gives out more PhDs in a year than any other UK university.\n\nThe following table has Cambridge results over the years in various College and university rankings.\n\nThe colleges also have a ranking between them. This is called the \"Tompkins Table\". It is published every year by The Independent newspaper. Trinity College and Emmanuel College usually do very well in it.\n\nThe University also runs many public examinations. This can be for people who want to take language tests in English for example. Some of the A-level and GCSEs exams are also written and organized here.\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of\n\nIt is also considered part of the \"Golden Triangle\", a geographical concentration of UK university research.\n\nThe \"Cambridge University Students' Union\" (CUSU) represents all the students within the University. All new students become members when they arrive in Cambridge. It was started in 1964 as the \"Students' Representative Council\" (SRC). There are six important positions in the Union which are taken by students who take a year off work. These people have meetings with the Vice-Chancellor and other university officers to talk about new rules or how to change them.\n\nInside the colleges, there are also group of students who represent all of the others. These are called JCR (Junior Common Room) for undergraduates and MCR (Middle Common Room) for postgraduates. They organize things like \"Fresher's Week\", the first week in October when new first-year students arrive. They also make sure every student is happy about his life in Cambridge.\nSport has always been very important in Cambridge. Many students try rowing because the Cam river is a good one to play this sport. There are many boat races between the different colleges. These are called \"bumps\": because the river is too small, boats start one behind the other. To win, a boat needs to hit (or \"bump\") the one ahead. Every year in London there is also the famous Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. Many other sports are played between colleges and universities.\n\nPlaces to do sports, like gyms and fields, are run by the single colleges. A new University-wide sports complex is being built.\n\nCambridge is also full of societies: these are small groups of people that meet together to do something that they like. These can be speaking a language, playing chess, acting in theatres, playing a musical instrument. In 2010, there were 751 societies. There can also be smaller clubs in the colleges.\n\nThere are three student newspapers, that tell things that happen around the university. \"Varsity\", created in 1947, is the oldest one. \"The Cambridge Student\" and \"The Tab\" are newer ones; \"The Tab\" has funny articles and is less serious. There is also a radio station called \"Cam FM\". This is run with help from Anglia Ruskin University, which is another university in Cambridge.\n\n\"Formal Halls\" are special dinners where students and Fellows eat together. Everyone wears a suit and there is good food. There is a prayer in Latin at the beginning and at the end. These dinners are a tradition and the idea is that people in the college should get to know each other at them. After the exams, there is \"May Week\" when students make parties. A \"May Ball\" happens in every college: it lasts all night and there is lots of music and food.\n\nMany people who later became very famous in their subject studied at Cambridge. 89 people linked with Cambridge have won a Nobel Prize. This includes 29 prizes in physics, 26 in medicine, 21 in chemistry and 9 in economics. People from Cambridge have also done great things in the arts and sports.\n\nCambridge has a very strong tradition in this field. Students include Isaac Newton, who made lots of experiments in Trinity College. Francis Bacon developed the Scientific method which is the starting point of today's science. G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan did a lot in pure mathematics. James Clerk Maxwell found out more about electromagnetism. In biology, Charles Darwin made his theory about natural selection while Francis Crick and James D. Watson discovered the structure of DNA. Also David Attenborough, who is now a television presenter, was a science student at Cambridge.\n\nIn nuclear physics, the discoveries of Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, J. J. Thomson and James Chadwick made people really understand what is inside an atom: electrons, protons and neutrons. J. Robert Oppenheimer studied here and later went on to develop the atomic bomb. In astronomy, Paul Dirac, Stephen Hawking, John Herschel and Georges Lemaître found out many things about the universe, from the Big Bang to black holes.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus was really important for starting studies about Greek and Latin at the University. In economics, John Maynard Keynes, Thomas Robert Malthus and Milton Friedman all started their theories in Cambridge. Known philosophers are Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Santayana, Karl Popper and Muhammad Iqbal. Many Archbishops of Canterbury also studied at Cambridge, like Rowan Williams. William Wilberforce helped to stop the slave trade. Thomas Cranmer was an Archbishop who was then killed because of his ideas.\n\nIn music, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Charles Villiers Stanford, William Sterndale Bennett, Orlando Gibbons and more recently John Rutter all started their education at Cambridge. Some members of the band Radiohead were also here. In the arts, Quentin Blake was an undergraduate here.\n\nStudents in this field include Christopher Marlowe, writer of many tragedies; Samuel Pepys, after who the library in Magdalene College is called; William Makepeace Thackeray, famous for his satire; E. M. Forster, a more contemporary author and C. S. Lewis, fantasy writer. Virginia Woolf did not study here but based her books around the colleges. Poets include Edmund Spenser, John Donne, John Milton, John Dryden, Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge who started the Romantic movement.\n\nKnown actors and directors are Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Michael Redgrave, James Mason, Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Tilda Swinton, Thandie Newton, Rachel Weisz, Sacha Baron Cohen, Tom Hiddleston all studied at the university.\n\nMore than 50 people who won medals at the Olympic Games had studied in Cambridge, as George Mallory did, who might have been the first to reach the top of mount Everest.\n\nFinally, Cambridge is also strong in politics because it educated:\n\n\nDue to its long history, the University has been named in many books and works by different authors.\n\n\n\n", "id": "121093", "title": "University of Cambridge"}

It was produced by DisneyToon Studios. It is a followup to the 1981 Disney animated movie \"The Fox and the Hound\". The movie was directed by Jim Kammerud and released on December 12, 2006. The story of the movie takes place during the childhood of Tod and Copper, in which Copper is tempted to join a band of singing stray dogs. The movie features the voices of Reba McEntire and Patrick Swayze. The movie had an official soundtrack album released on November 21, 2006.\n\nThe movie opens with Tod and Copper chasing a cricket together. They see a line of trucks bringing the county fair to town, and Copper is mesmerized by the sound of dogs singing together in an old school bus with \"The Singin' Strays\" painted on the side. The pair are eager to go see the fair, but when Copper's clumsy tracking skills disappoint his master Amos Slade yet again, the pup is tied up in the yard while Slade and Chief go to the fair without him. Tod arrives and pulls Copper's collar off, and the pair head to the fair.\n\nTod and Copper get to meet The Singin' Strays. The band has five members: Dixie, Cash, Granny Rose, and twin brothers Waylon and Floyd. It is important that they perform well because a talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry will be at the fair. Cash and Dixie get into an argument, and Dixie walks off before their performance, forcing them to go on stage without her. During the show, Copper sings along, and Cash invites the pup up on stage to sing with them. The musical number is a success. Cash invites Copper to join the band, which he does after Tod lies that Copper is a stray. Copper spends the entire day with Cash, forgetting his promise to watch fireworks with Tod.\n\nDixie finds Tod and sympathizes with his feelings of abandonment. During their conversation, Tod lets it slip that Copper is not a stray. Dixie then hatches a plan to get Copper kicked out of the band. Tod sneaks into Chief's barrel, luring him and Slade to the fair in a wild chase. The chase leads to widespread mayhem in the fair, and the Singin' Strays' performance is sabotaged right in front of the talent scout Mr. Bickerstaff. Copper is fired from the band and returns home with Slade. Granny Rose and the rest of the members of Cash's band feel quite sorry for Copper about this and therefore the band breaks up. Tod tries to apologize to Copper, but Copper is angry at the fox for ruining everything. Tod is brought home by his owner, Widow Tweed. Along the way, Tweed narrowly misses being hit by the talent scout's car, and Bickerstaff's hat flies off and lands on Tod.\n\nThe following day, Tod and Copper admit their mistakes and are friends again. Hoping to make up for his doings, Tod gives Bickerstaff's hat to Copper, who uses it to track down the talent scout at a local diner. Tod tricks Cash and Dixie into thinking the other is in trouble, and the entire band end up meeting up at the diner. Copper convinces the band the importance of harmony, and The Singin' Strays howl a reprise of their song \"We're in Harmony\", attracting the attention of the talent scout and reuniting the band. Impressed with the band, he arranges for the dogs to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. The movie ends with Copper choosing to leave the band and play with Tod again.\n\n\nKevin Carr of 7M Pictures gave the movie two stars out of five, saying \"“The Fox and the Hound 2” is never going to live down as a classic, but it isn’t terrible. It falls somewhere in the middle of the Disney DVD sequel spectrum.\"\n\nJohn J.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121208", "text": "Direct-to-video\n\nA movie that is released direct-to-video (also known as made-for-video, straight-to-video, more recently, straight-to-DVD) is one which has been released to the public on home video formats (historically VHS) before or without being released in movie theaters or broadcast on television. The term is also at times used as an insulting term for sequels of movies that are not expected to have financial success.\n\nDirect-to-video releases can occur for several reasons. Often a production studio will develop a TV show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons: poor quality, lack of support from a TV network, controversial nature, or a simple lack of general public interest. Studios, limited in the annual number of movies they grant cinematic releases to, may choose to pull the completed movie from the theaters, or never exhibit it in theaters at all. Studios then recover some of their losses through video sales and rentals.\n\nIn the case of a TV show, low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show, possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes. If the show has a considerable fanbase, the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recover losses. \"\" and \"Firefly\" are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on DVD. Occasionally outstanding DVD sales may revive a canceled show, as in the case of \"Family Guy\".Originally canceled in 2004,the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales.\n\nDirect-to-video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases. Some studio movies released direct-to-video are movies which have been completed but were never released. This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a movie's commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release, or because its \"release window\" has closed. A release window refers to a timely trend or personality, and missing that window of opportunity means a movie, possibly rushed into production, failed to release before the trend faded. In movie industry slang such movies are referred to as having been \"vaulted.\"\n\nThere is a positive side to direct-to-video releases. They have become something of a lifeline for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.\n\nDirect-to-video releases can be done for movies which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content, or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company. Almost all pornographic movies are released direct-to-video.\n\nAnimated sequels and movie-length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion. The Walt Disney Company began making sequels of most of its animated movies for video release beginning with \"The Return of Jafar\" (the sequel to \"Aladdin\") in 1994. Universal Studios also began their long line of \"The Land Before Time\" sequels that same year. In 2005, Fox released \"\" for DVD and Universal Media Disc.\n\nOnce in a while, a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct-to-video movie and release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another movie with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision. \"Doug's 1st Movie\" is an example of this, quickly changed from a DTV to a theatrical release due to the surprise success of \"The Rugrats Movie\".\n\nTelevision spin-offs are animated or live action television series or made for TV movies which contain either characters or theme elements from an older series or movie (Clerks: The Animated Series, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures). While the most common examples of a television spin off are animated series there are also live action examples (Robocop: Prime Directive)\n\nSome \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" DVD volumes contain episodes not yet aired in the United States. Certain special episodes of Pokémon were released directly on video such as Pikachu’s Winter Vacation. Some Disney Channel shows, such as \"That's So Raven\", \"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\", \"Phil of the Future\", and \"\" have also had direct-to-video episodes.\n\nAs the DVD format supplants the videocassette, companies have increasingly released movies in DVD format rather than VHS, causing the term \"direct-to-DVD\" to replace \"direct-to-video\" in some instances. However, the word \"video\" does not necessarily refer to VHS cassettes. The new term used is DVDP (\"DVD Premiere\"). Such movies can cost as much as $20 million (about a third of the average cost of a Hollywood release) and feature actors like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal. Salaries for such actors range from $2 to $4 million (Van Damme) to $4.5 to $10 million (Seagal). According to \"Variety\", \"\" sold a million copies in one week, despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy.\n\nIn recent years, DVD Premieres have become a substantial source of revenue for movie studios. DVDPs have collectively grossed over $3 billion over the last few years, and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own movies. Studios realized that DVDP movies can be shot on a smaller budget, thus allowing studios larger profits with the combined revenues of home video sales and rentals, in addition to licensing movies for television and for distribution abroad (where some DVDP movies do see theatrical releases).\n\nDistributing DVDPs is not a practice reserved solely for larger Hollywood studios. Several companies, such as The Asylum, MTI Home Video, and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusively. The budgets for movies distributed by these companies are even smaller than those of ones distributed by a larger studio, but these companies are still able to profit off their sales.\n\nIn Japan, the direct-to-video movement carries different connotations, being a niche product rather than a fallback medium. Despite having lower budgets than features intended for theater release, Japanese direct-to-video productions are rarely marred by the poor storyline and lower quality production often associated with the DTV market in the US. So-called V-Cinema has more respect from the public, and affection from movie directors for the greater creative freedoms the medium allows. DTV releases are subject to fewer restrictions.\n\nIn the case of anime, this is called Original Video Animation (OVA or OAV), and their production values usually fall between those of television series and movies. They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season, and were particularly common in the early 1990s. Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series, like \"Tenchi Muyo!\", \"One Piece\", and \"El Hazard\".\n\nWith the advent of the 13 episode season format, OVAs are less common now. The majority of OVAs released in today's market are usually continuations or reworkings of recently completed TV series. For instance, the DVD release of a TV series might include a bonus episode that was never broadcast as a sales hook.\n\n\n", "id": "121208", "title": "Direct-to-video"}

Unlike many of the Disney direct-to-video sequels that just retell the original movie's story, \"101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure\" takes characters from the original movie in some new directions.\n\nThe family of Roger, Anita, and the dalmatians plan to move to Dalmatian Plantation, a home in the country with plenty of room for the 101 pups and far from the clutches of Cruella de Vil, located at Cherry Tree Farm, Little Devon. One of the dalmatians, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and wants to be a one-of-a-kind wonder dog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However, the family move will cause a problem for Patch's opportunity. However, he is accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero and find out if he one of a kind, or just one of 101.\n\nMeanwhile, Thunderbolt's \"trusty\" sidekick, Lil' Lightning, tells Thunderbolt the producers want to replace him with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A relible reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella - she's back and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, an artist named Lars can calm her down, but he cannot make the perfect spot painting, so she locks him up and returns to her old ways. Lil 'lightning tells Thunderbolt and Patch that Thunderbolt was not going to be replaced but it is just a trick to make him quit once and for all and make Lightning the star. Patch becomes heartbroken when he finds out that his favorite wonderdog just a TV actor.\n\n\n", "id": "121219", "title": "101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure"}

It was the center of the Trojan War, as told in eight long epic poems, six from the Epic Cycle, and two written by Homer, the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\".\n\nToday it is the name of an archaeological site, the location of Homeric Troy, in Hisarlik in Anatolia, close to the seacoast in what is now Çanakkale province in northwest Turkey, southwest of the Dardanelles.\n\nUNESCO has listed the archaeological site of Troy as a World Heritage Site.\n\nTroy as seen in Homer's account is probably true in part. However, it is wrong to think his account is historically exact. With that warning, this is a summary of events leading up to the Trojan war, mostly derived from the Iliad. \n\nTroy was a powerful kingdom in the Mediterranean sea, and thrived under the long rule of King Priam. His many sons, including the valiant, strong, unbeatable Hector, and Paris, a creative character who was not a strong fighter but a passionate man, are the best known in the Troy myth. \n\nIn Greece lay a Kingdom called Mycene, owned by Mycenaean or Mykene people, ruled by King Agamemnon. He started a campaign to pressure the Greece cities or kingdoms and to join him and attack Troy, to capture its many riches. The King of Ithaca, Odysseus (or \"Ulysses\", as he was also known), along with King Idomenous of Crete, with up to 22 more Kingdoms and Kings, spent ten years attacking Troy. Eventually, Troy fell after a coup that Odysseus had thought up, using a wooden trojan horse to hide soldiers within in order to get soldiers behind the Trojan line of defence.\n\nBefore the fall of Troy, during the dawn of the War, King Priam sought to create an alliance with the strong Kingdom of Sparta in Northern Greece, to defend Troy when the war had begun. King Aeneas, or Helikaon as he was said to be known, King of Dardanos, was a good friend of Hektor and King Priam, and sided with the Trojans in the war. Unfortunately, on the journey back, after Hektor and Paris had forged an alliance in Sparta, Paris took the wife of the King of Sparta, Princess Helen, without his consent, as they had fallen in love. This ended the alliance,and Sparta eventually joined the fighting cause of King Agammenon.\n\n", "id": "121250", "title": "Troy"}

It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion.\n\nLet's think of two electric charges existing in an empty space. If the two charges are opposite, (+) and (-) charges for example, they will attract each other. And if two charges are both the same, both (+) or both (-) for example, they will push each other. This is similar to how magnets act, as N and S attract each other, and as N and N, S and S push each other.\n\nThis is because electric charges make an electric field. If two fields exist in the same space at the same time, then the two fields exert (~ put) force on each other. The force they make on each other is called Coulomb's force or electrostatic force. Coulomb's law explains how big the force will be.\n\nCoulomb's law explains the scale between two electric charges.\nThe scale of electrostatic force follows the function below.\nCoulomb's law explains that the force scale F is relative to ratio of formula_2,formula_3.\n\nformula_4 and formula_5 are the scales of each electric charge. formula_6 is the distance between the two electric charges. And formula_7 has a certain value. It does not change relative to formula_4, formula_5 or formula_6. While formula_11 remains constant, when multiples of formula_4 and formula_5 become bigger, the electrostatic force will also get bigger. When the distance formula_6 become bigger, the electrostatic force will become smaller to ratio of formula_3.\nThe exact size of formula_7 is\nformula_17\nformula_18N m C (or m F). This constant is called Coulomb's Force Constant or Electrostatic Force Constant.\n\nThe relation between the force of pushing or pulling (F) and the distance between the particles (formula_6) follows the Inverse-square Law. Inverse-square law means that when the distance formula_6 grows bigger, the force gets weaker by the ratio formula_3. Gravitation, Electromagnetic radiation, and sound loudness also follows this law.\n\n\n", "id": "121286", "title": "Coulomb's law"}

Most of the planet Earth is covered by water. The bottom of the ocean is called the sea-bed. Most of the sea-bed is between below the surface of the ocean. Just like the Earth's dry land, the sea-bed also has mountains, valleys and flat plains, although they are covered with water. The deepest part of all the world's oceans is a place called the Challenger Deep, which is in the Mariana Trench. It is under the sea.\n\nAlthough a number of human activities happen underwater, such as scuba diving for work or recreation, or even warfare with submarines, most of the oceans, especially the deepest parts, have not been explored yet.\n", "id": "121334", "title": "Underwater"}

The breed also enjoys great popularity among ranchers in the desert American Southwest of the United States, as well as in the centre and east of Argentina and in Uruguay. Herefords made up the largest percentage of registered cows among herders in New Zealand. This is a testament to the hardiness of the breed; while originating in cool, moist Britain, they have thrived in much harsher climates. The breed has adapted to a wide range of climates on nearly every continent.\n\nHornless variants with the polled gene are known as the Polled Herefords. Breeding horned and hornless together functions as a genetic dehorner. This is often used as an alternative to a dehorning process, which causes stress and often weight loss.\n", "id": "121335", "title": "Hereford (cattle)"}

Its infantry for much of its history, was the Roman legion. Rome also had a navy. The size of the army in the late Roman Empire was about 128,000 179,200 men. It was very well organized. The main Roman soldiers in the Empire were the legionaries. The legions were separated into centuries, made up of 80 soldiers and 20 other men who remained in the camp to cook and do other chores. \n\nOther soldiers in the army were called the auxilia. Auxilia were non-citizens who mainly came from the Roman provinces. They were paid less than legionaries and did not usually wear armor but at the end of their service, which was a minimum of 25 years, they were given Roman citizenship.\n\nThe army had cavalry units called Equites. Their men were rich enough to have horses and more expensive weapons. Being few, they were less important in battle than the infantry.\n\nThe soldiers of the Roman army wore helmets and body protection. In the early to mid-Republican era, legionaries usually bought their own equipment. \"Hastati\", the first line of soldiers, usually had breastplates, called a \"cuirass\", and some wore \"lorica hamata\", or chainmail. The richer principes, the second line of soldiers, could afford \"lorica hamata\" but they were sometimes seen wearing the cheaper \"cuirasses\". Both hastati and principes were each armed with a \"gladius\" - a short, 60 centimeter (two foot) sword - and each had two \"pila\" - short spears. \n\nThe third line of soldiers, the Triarii, had a \"hasta\", a two meter long spear. They were also armed with the \"gladius\" and had an early form of the \"lorica segmenta\" or iron band armor. All legionaries had a large rectangular shield, the \"scutum\", which had rounded corners.\nBy the late Republican period, all legionaries carried a \"gladius\", two \"pila\", a new, larger \"scutum\", and wore chainmail.\" Lorica segmentata\" was only commonly worn between the 2nd and 3rd century.\n\nLarger weapons such as the ballista (large crossbow) and the Onager (catapult) were used in larger battles.\n\nThe main thing a member of the Roman Army needed was athletic ability. Soldiers were expected to march about 36 km (24 miles) in five hours. They also had to be fit to be able to fight well and cope with any injuries.\n\nNew soldiers would do two sessions of military drill and give their oath of loyalty to their Commander and Emperor. Every day the whole of the legion would practice running, jumping, sword fighting and javelin throwing.\n", "id": "121338", "title": "Roman army"}

Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations.\n\nThe definition of the limit is as follows:\n\nThe notation for the limit above is read as \"The limit of formula_1 as formula_3 approaches formula_4 is formula_2.\" Imagine we have a function such as formula_10. When formula_11, formula_1 is undefined, because formula_13. Therefore, on the Cartesian coordinate system, the function formula_10 would have a vertical asymptote at formula_11. In limit notation, this would be written as:\n\nFor the function formula_10, we can get as close to formula_18 in the formula_3-values as we want, so long as we \"don't\" make formula_3 equal to formula_18. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_19, but without reaching it. The Left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the Right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function formula_10, since the limit for formula_3 is 0, if formula_30, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.\n", "id": "121379", "title": "Limit of a function"}

Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales, the first European colony in Australia, which is now the city of Sydney.\n\nArthur (Kriddler) Phillip was born in Fulham, London, in 1738. His father was a German-born language teacher, Jacob Phillip. His mother, Elizabeth Breach, was English, and the widow of a navy captain. Phillip went to a school for poor boys at the Greenwich Hospital. At the age of 13 he joined the merchant navy. Phillip joined the Royal Navy at 15. He saw action during the Seven Years' War in the Mediterranean at the Battle of Minorca in 1756. In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant. When the war ended in 1763 he was put on half pay. He married and became a farmer in Lyndhurst, Hampshire. He separated from his wife about six years later.\n\nIn 1774 Phillip joined the Portuguese Navy as a captain. He served in the Spanish-Portuguese War, 1776–1777. Phillip took a group of convict ships from Portugal to Brazil. This trip was a success because not many people died. This may have been one of the reasons Phillip was asked to lead the expedition to Australia. In 1778 England was at war again, and Phillip was recalled to active service. In 1779 he was given his first command, the ship \"Basilisk\". He was promoted to captain in 1781, and given command of the \"Ariadne\". In 1782 he was captain of the \"Europe\" with his friend Philip Gidley King as his lieutenant. They sailed to India. In 1784 he was back on half pay in England. He spent time in southern France and in 1786 was doing survey work for the Royal Navy.\n\nIn October 1786, Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales. The British government wanted to start a penal colony (prison) on the east coast of Australia. Phillip knew about farming, and had taken prisoners to Brazil for the Portuguese. This made him a good choice to be leader. Phillip had a very hard time getting the ships ready for the eight month sea voyage to Australia. He had to take everything that the new colony might need. Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There wasn't much money to buy things. He wanted people who knew about farming, building and making things, but this was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (prisoners) were thieves from the city area of London. Phillip also took a group of marines (soldiers) and small group of officers who were to help him run the new colony.\n\nThe First Fleet, of 11 ships, sailed on 13 May 1787. The first ship, HMS \"Supply\", reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, picked by Sir Joseph Banks, was not suitable. It had poor soil, no safe place to leave the ships, and no drinking water. Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson. On 26 January 1788 (this day is now called Australia Day) the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove. It was a successful trip, as only 40 convicts had died. Phillip named Sydney after Lord Sydney.\n\nThe first years of the settlement were very hard. They only had the supplies they brought with them. They had to start growing their own food, but the soil around Sydney was poor. They didn't know about the climate, how much rain or when it would fall for example. Very few of the convicts knew anything about farming or growing food. They did not have enough farming tools. The convicts did not want to be farm workers. The colony was in danger of starvation for long time. The soldiers, who didn't like being given orders in many cases, did not think it was their job to make the convicts work. Phillip had to put some convicts in charge (overseers) to get the other convicts working. This was the start of the process of making some convicts free which led to the reforms of Lachlan Macquarie after 1811. As Governor of the new settlement, Phillip had complete power over the eastern half of Australia.\n\nPhillip had respect from the Aboriginal people because he was missing a front tooth. This tooth was the same tooth that they knocked out as part of their initiation ceremonies.\n\nPhillip soon had problems with the soldiers in the penal colony. Life in Sydney was difficult, without proper houses and not enough food. The officer in charge of the soldiers, Major Robert Ross, wanted to give up the settlement and go back to England. Ross complained about Phillip and wrote letters to the government in England about him. The soldiers thought they should be given land and other benefits. They thought they should be given more food than the convicts, but Phillip believed everyone should have an equal share. Ross and the soldiers believed that they were in Australia to protect the settlement from being attacked by other countries. They did not think that their work included guarding the convicts. Ross who was a soldier, did not think he should have to take orders from Phillip, who was a navy man. In March 1790, Phillip finally sent Ross to be in charge of the colony on Norfolk Island. The British government continued to send out convicts, there were over 4000 in Sydney by 1792. Food still needed to be brought in as the colony could not yet grow enough. Phillip began giving small grants of land to ex-convicts to start farms around Parramatta, New South Wales.\n\nOn 11 December 1792 Phillip left to go back to England. He needed medical treatment for a pain in his side. The pain was kidney pain from eating so much salted food. He planned to return to Australia, but on medical advice he resigned as Governor and stayed in England. He married Isabella Whitehead in 1794. He eventually got better and in 1796 returned to the navy as a captain. He was in charge of the \"Alexander\", and later the 74 gun battleship, \"Swiftshore\". In January 1799 he was made a Rear Admiral of the Blue, and put in charge of the Sea Fencibles. Their job was to defend England against Napoleon. He retired from active service in 1805. He had a number of strokes which left him partly paralysed. He died at Bath, on 31 August 1814, after falling from a third floor window. He was buried at the church of St.Nicholas, Bathampton.\n\nIn 2007 Geoffrey Robertson QC found that Phillip's remains are no longer in the church. It is not known where they are. It is believed they were lost while the church was being repaired in the 1970s. Robertson believes that it is an insult to Phillip that he wasn't buried in one of England's cathedrals. He wants the remains of Phillip found and brought back to Australia.\n\n", "id": "121384", "title": "Arthur Phillip"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121399", "text": "Halting problem\n\nThe Halting problem is a problem in computer science. The problem is looking at a computer program and finding out if the program is going to run forever or not. We say that a program \"solves the halting problem\" if it can look at any other program and tell if that other program will run forever or not.\n\nFor example, a program like this:\n\nwill loop forever, but the program\n\nstops very quickly.\n\nIs there a program that solves the halting problem? It turns out there is not. We prove this fact by showing that if there is a program that solves the halting problem then something impossible happens. So for the moment we will act like there really is a program that solves the halting problem. Here, P is a function which will evaluate function F (called with argument I) and return true if it runs forever and false otherwise.\n\nP can look at any program and find out if it will run forever or not. We use P to make a new program that we will call Q. What Q does is look at another program and then answer the following question: \"If we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, will it run forever?\". We can make Q because we have P. All we need to do is to tell Q to create a new program that is the old program looking at itself, and then use P to find out if the new program runs forever or not.\n\nNow we make another program R. R looks at another program and asks Q for its answer on that program. If Q answers \"yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever\", then R stops. If Q answers \"no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, it will not run forever\", then R enters an infinite loop and runs forever.\n\nNow we look at what happens if we make R look at a copy of itself. Two things can happen: it will either stop or run forever. \n\nIf running R and making it look at a copy of itself does not run forever, then Q answered \"yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever\". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: \"yes, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever\". So: If R running on a copy of itself does not run forever, then it does run forever. This is impossible.\n\nIf running R and making it look at a copy of itself runs forever, then Q answered \"no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever\". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: \"no, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever\". So: If R running on a copy of itself runs forever, then it does not run forever. This is also impossible.\n\nNo matter what happens, we get an impossible situation. We did something wrong, and we need to find out what it was. Most of the things we did were not wrong. We can not say \"making a program look at a copy of itself is wrong\", or \"looking at what another program said and then going into a loop if it said one thing, and stopping if it said another thing\" is wrong. It does not make sense to say that we are not allowed to do those things. The only thing that we did that looks like it could be wrong is that we pretended that a program like P exists in the first place. And since this is the only thing that could be wrong, and something must be wrong, this is it. This is the proof that a program like P does not exist. There is no program that solves the halting problem.\n\nThis proof was found by Alan Turing in 1936.\n\n This is the paper where Turing defines Turing machines, formulates the halting problem, and shows that it (as well as the Entscheidungsproblem) is unsolvable.\n", "id": "121399", "title": "Halting problem"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121420", "text": "Scottish Fold\n\nThe Scottish Fold (sometimes called Coupari by Canadian breeders) is a breed of cat. Its distinctive ear fold is caused by a particular gene.\n\nFirst known as Flops, for their \"floppy\" ears, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Scottish Folds with long hair are known by a number of names. For example, it is called the Highland Fold by the ACFA, AACE, and UFO; the Scottish Fold Longhair by the TICA, NCFA, ACA, CCA, and CFA; and the Longhair Fold by the CFF.\n\nThe very first Scottish Fold was a long-haired barn cat with white fur, called Susie. She was found in 1961 at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in the middle, making her look like an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with the distinctive folded ears. One was owned by William Ross, a nearby farmer and cat-lover. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of Pat Turner. The breeding program ended up with 76 kittens in the first three years, 42 with folded ears. They suspected that the ear mutation was from a dominant allele. This means that if one parent has straight ears, and one parent has folded ears, half of the kittens will be Folds.\n\nSusie's only fertile offspring was a female Fold named Snooks, also white like her mother. A second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats are related to Susie and Snooks. This kind of ancestry is very rare, even among pedigreed animals.\n\nThe breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe because people thought that they would be overly prone to ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness, but the Folds were sold in America. The breed kept on growing using crosses with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Despite the initial concerns, the Fold breed has not had the expected mite and infection problems. However, wax can build up faster than in the ears of other cats.\n\nFolds are very popular pets because of their unique look, and their reputation as particularly loving companions. Fold kittens are usually much more expensive to buy than kittens of more common breeds.\n\nAll Folds are born with straight, unfolded ears. Cats that have the Fold gene will start to show the fold before 21 days. The first cats only had one fold in their ears. With careful breeding, breeders have changed the fold to a double or triple fold. This causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.\n\nFolds are a medium-sized breed of cat (9–13 lbs. for males and 6–9 lbs. for females). They have round bodies, round heads, and round faces. They have big round eyes. Their noses are short with a gentle curve. They have medium to short sized legs. Their heads are curved at the top. They have very short necks. The eyes have a big gap which gives the Scottish Fold a \"sweet expression\".\n\nScottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired. They may have nearly any coat colour or mix of colours (including white) except pointed colours. According to cat-fancy website Terrific-Cats.com:\nScottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are normally good-natured and calm. They can adjust to other animals within a household very well. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers. They are by nature quite loving. Folds receive high marks for playfulness, affection, and grooming. They are often clever, loyal, quiet, and do well in changing home situations.\n\nFolds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds normally have soft voices. They can give a mix of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds.\n\nScottish Folds usually live for around 15 years.\nScottish folds can easily get polycystic kidney disease (PKD), osteochondritis, and cardiomyopathy.\n\nBecause the ears fold nearly a month after birth, Fold kittens cannot be judged immediately as to their type or value, as the animal website PetFinder.com says:\nOne special medical problem comes in the Scottish Fold if both parents have folded ears. In such a case, their kittens will be very likely (1:4 ratio, or usually at least one per litter) to have a painful joint disease that can fuse the tail, ankles and/or knees. Scientists think the disease is caused by the dominant (folded-ear) gene. It is more likely to affect Folds with the gene twice, than mixed single with one recessive (unfolded-ear) gene. This disease can also affect Scottish Folds with one copy of the gene, but usually not as often or as badly. For this reason the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline. This is the reasoning behind the widely-held belief that the only ethical manner of breeding Folds is Fold/nonfold and not Fold/Fold (in the same way Munchkins are bred).\n\nThe Scottish Fold is one of the main focuses in the short novel \"The Cat Who Went to Paris\" by Peter Gethers. The book and its two sequels, \"A Cat Abroad\" and \"The Cat Who'll Live Forever: The Final Adventures of Norton, the Perfect Cat, and His Imperfect Human\", talk about the life of Gethers and his Fold, Norton. It starts with their first meeting and ends with Norton's death and Gether's life after the loss.\n\nCat guides about the Scottish Fold breed can be found. For example \"Scottish Fold Cats: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual\" (ISBN 0812049993), \"Guide to Owning a Scottish Fold Cat\" (ISBN 079382172X), and \"Scottish Fold Cats (Cats Set III)\" (ISBN 1577658671).\n", "id": "121420", "title": "Scottish Fold"}

The developers stated, \"What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within.\" The game includes an optional feature called \"Story Progression\", which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to continue on their own as if the player were controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, and build or buy their dream house while the player is not playing. The Sims 2 used a reward system called Wants and Fears. This is replaced with a new system called Wishes in The Sims 3. Completing a Sim's wish helps the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score and mood. Some wishes, such as \"Go to the Park\", may add little points to their lifetime happiness while \"Have A Baby Boy\" may add thousands of points. In The Sims 2, Wants and Fears also contributed to a Sim's \"Aspiration\" meter, the same to current self-esteem. In The Sims 3, Aspiration is removed entirely, replaced with \"Moodlets\", which contribute good or bad values to the original Motivation meter. Moodlets can be inspired by physical events, such as having a good meal or comfort from sitting in a good chair, as well as emotional events like a first kiss or a break-up. Most moodlets last for a set amount of time, but some bad Moodlets can be cured (such as the one caused by a need to use the bathroom) and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings and traits.\n", "id": "121432", "title": "The Sims 3"}

These sponsors pay money, which makes it possible to hold the event. In return for this, they get publicity and media coverage. Ambush marketing is a name given to marketing campaigns that are also done around the event, but where no money is paid for the event.\nThere are many very important events where one company will pay money to become the \"exclusive sponsor\" of the event (or in a category of the event). This creates a problem for other brands or companies. These other brands then find ways to promote themselves in connection with the same event. They do not pay the sponsorship fee. Even if they wanted to, they could not, because one brand is the exclusive sponsor. They also do not break any laws.\n\n\nFor the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand is planning to make laws to combat ambush marketing, according to former Sports Minister Trevor Mallard.\n\n", "id": "121442", "title": "Ambush marketing"}

At the height of its power, the Achaemenid Empire had about 7.5 million square kilometers and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.\n\nThe empire was forged by Cyrus the Great.

The empire was the foe of the Greek city-states in the Greco-Persian Wars. It freed the Israelites from their Babylonian captivity, and instituted Aramaic as the empire's official language. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day.\n\nThe empire began as a tributary state of the Medes but ended up conquering and enlarging the Median empire to include Egypt and Asia Minor.

It was released on July 18, 2008 in the United States. It stars Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart. It was directed by Christopher Nolan. It is the sequel to the 2005 movie \"Batman Begins\". \"The Dark Knight\" broke many records on its release. It was the second movie in \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\". The third movie is \"The Dark Knight Rises\".\n\nThe movie begins with the Joker and his gang of clowns robbing a mob bank. The other clowns shoot each other so that there are fewer people so they can get more money per person. The manager of the bank takes out his shotgun and shoots one of them. The Joker takes off his mask and kills the last clown, leaving all the money for himself. He then drives away in a school bus.\n\nThe crime mob in the city is very mad at the Joker for robbing the bank. The Joker comes to them and says he wants to kill Batman. Meanwhile, Gotham city's District Attorney Harvey Dent tries to shut the mob down by tracking down the money. A businessman named Lau finds out about this and takes the money out beforehand and goes to Hong Kong so that he cannot be caught. Batman, whose real name is Bruce Wayne, flies down there himself, kidnaps him, and takes him back to Gotham City.\n\nThe Joker says he wants Batman to take his mask off and show the world who he is, and that if he does not, people will die. Commissioner Loeb dies from drinking acid in his drink and the judge that was at the mob trials is killed. The Joker then hires some men to kidnap police officers and take their uniforms. At Loeb's funeral, Joker's men attempt to shoot the mayor. Police officer James Gordon tackles the mayor and is shot and apparently killed.\n\nDent then calls a press conference to ask the people there if he should reveal Batman. After they say yes, Dent says that he is Batman and has the police arrest him. They put him on a truck to send him to jail. The Joker and his men drive a truck that badly damages the truck Dent is riding in. The real Batman comes in and attempts to save Dent but wrecks his motorcycle-like Batpod when the Joker stands there, since Batman has a rule that he will not kill anyone. Gordon, who is revealed to have faked his death, arrests the Joker.\n\nIn jail, Batman questions the Joker. The Joker eventually reveals that his men captured Rachel Dawes, Batman's old childhood friend and Dent's girlfriend, and Dent. He has put them in warehouses far away so that Batman cannot save both of them himself. They are near bombs that will go off and kill them. The Joker tells Batman where each person is. Batman goes to save Dawes while Gordon and his men go to rescue Dent. However, when Batman gets to Rachel's location, he only sees Dent, because the Joker switched the addresses. Batman gets Dent out, but the bomb goes off and Dent scars half of his face. Gordon is too late to save Dawes.\n\nThe Joker gets out of jail. He gets his phone call and dials a cell phone that is wired to a bomb, which blows up the police station. Afterwards, he visits the hopsital where Dent is staying. Dent is driven crazy because of Dawes' death. The Joker frees Dent and tells him to take revenge. Dent goes around flipping coins and decides whether he will kill them or keep them alive. He starts going after the various police people who leaked information to the Joker to make it possible for him to kidnap and kill Dawes.\n\nThe Joker then announces that the city is his. The people in charge load up two ferries with people to get them out of the city. The Joker has wired both boats with explosives and has given each boat the detonator to the other one, saying that he will blow up both boats at midnight if one boat does not blow up the other.\n\nBatman finds the Joker in an abandoned building. He uses a sonar system (created by Lucius Fox) to defeat the Joker's men and stops him from destroying both ferries. He then leaves the Joker hanging. The Joker is very impressed, stating that Batman cannot be corrupted into breaking his own rule. A SWAT team then captures the Joker.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Batman finds that Dent has kidnapped Gordon's family. When Batman arrives, Dent flips his coin to decide their fates. Before he can see the result of his next coin flip, Batman tackles Dent off the edge of the building, letting the vigilante plummet to his death. With Dent dead, Gordon says that if word gets out that Dent killed all these people, all the work he did will have been lost. Batman offers to take the blame for all the murders. Gordon, who is originally against it, agrees. He destroys the Bat-Signal and orders the police to hunt Batman down. Batman takes off into the night while Gordon’s son does not understand the reasoning for why Batman must be hunted. But Gordon explains \"because he can take it. Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian; a watchful protector; a Dark Knight.\"\n\n\nThe movie was filmed in Chicago and in Hong Kong. Some scenes were shot in London. During the filming in Chicago, Nolan decided to blow-up abandoned Brach's candy factory (which was Gotham Hospital in the movie).\n\n\n", "id": "121461", "title": "The Dark Knight (movie)"}

They were the daughters of Phorkys and Keto. The serpents in their hair were special: Everyone who looked at them was turned to stone. There were three Gorgons, named Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. Only Medusa was mortal. She was beheaded by Perseus. Medusa's head was brought to Athena. There are many motives showing Athena with an aegis, and a Gorgon's head on her chest. \n\nHomer only talks about one Gorgon. Hesiod names all three, Stheno, the powerful one, Euryale,who could jump far, and trouble-ridden Medusa, the queen. According to Hesiod, they lived at the edge of the known world, in the Atlas Mountains. At a later time, Libya is also named as their home.\n\nWith Hellenism came the myth that the Gorgo was a sister of Alexander the Great. In this myth, she is a neck, a water spirit. The sailors of each passing boat are asked whether he is still alive. If they answer no, she takes the boat and the sailors into the water. The answer that saves the lives of the seamen is \"Yes, and he reigns as a king\" (Greek: Ζεί και βασιλέβει). \n\nThe heads of the Gorgons are often found on shields, capes and amulets. These were believed to be magic. The magic that is used against bad spirits and bad look is known as apotropaic magic.\n", "id": "121463", "title": "Gorgon"}

It was made by Ape, Inc. and designed by Shigesato Itoi for the NES. It was going to be called \"EarthBound\" in the United States, and Nintendo of America completed the translation of the game, but they decided that role-playing video games weren't very worth releasing, and that it was too late in the NES' life to release.\n\n\"EarthBound\" (known as \"Mother 2\" in Japan) is the second title in the series. It's the most well-known because it was the only one released outside of Japan. It was made by Ape, Inc. for the Super NES. It stars a boy named Ness, a girl named Paula, a boy named Jeff, and a boy named Poo, who have to work together to defeat an evil alien called Giygas, who conquers the Earth 10 years in the future.\n\n\"Mother 3\" is the third and latest \"EarthBound\" game.

The subdivision of the country is then displayed by one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. In case the subdivision has more than 9 entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering.\n\nIn addition to the full three levels for the European Union countries, all countries have a NUTS code with a two-letter code for a continent and two numbers for the country, and for the USA, Canada and Australia the states, provinces, and territories are numbered separately.\n\nSome are not easily classified: for example, Gibraltar is listed as being outside the EU with the code EO21; while French Guiana is listed twice, once in France as FR930 and once in South America as AS13.\n\nNUTS, in some ways are similar to the ISO 3166-2 standard, as well as the FIPS standard of the United States.\n\nThere are three levels of NUTS. Some with two levels of local administrative units (LAUs) below.

He was also among the early names of heart surgery.\n\nDeBakey was born as Michel Dabaghi in Lake Charles, Louisiana on September 7, 1908. His parents were born in Lebanon, but moved to America before he was born.\n\nDeBakey was involved with medicine from a young age and went to Tulane University. He held many medicine-related positions during his lifetime.\n\nDuring World War II, DeBakey made wartime medicine much better than it used to be. He was for the idea of having doctors closer to the areas of battle in war, which worked very well and due to that, more badly hurt soldiers survived. Because of this, Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (also known as MASH units) were made, and they were used during the Korean War.\n\nIn addition to MASH units, DeBakey made many important aspects to surgery, one of which was the roller pump, which DeBakey made at age 23 while still at Tulane University. This would later on make open-heart surgery able to be done, as roller pumps can make blood flow during surgery.\n\nDeBakey worked with another important heart surgeon, Denton Cooley, but they had a disagreement related to the first artificial heart(a manmade heart) put in a human. They did not get along for a long time, but they went on good terms in 2007.\n\nDeBakey did something rare by still practicing medicine in old age. People that he operated on included world leaders, such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nIn 2005, a serious heart problem happened to DeBakey. Despite him having made the surgery for this problem, he, at first, did not want any surgery. As he got in worse condition, the surgical team had made the decision to perform surgery anyway. Once the surgery was done and he got in better health, DeBakey said that he was glad the surgery happened after all. \n\nOn July 11, 2008, DeBakey died of natural causes at age 99. His first wife, two of his sons, and a brother died before him, while his second wife, a daughter, two sons, and two sisters outlive him.\n\n", "id": "121597", "title": "Michael E. DeBakey"}

The series is a collection of turn-based strategy role-playing games. They used many characters going on a long journey to fight a common enemy.\n\nIn \"Fire Emblem\", the player moves units across a grid in turns. The player must deal with a challenge with each part in the story, for example, defeating all of the enemy units. A player may choose to fight, move, heal, or visit shops each turn. The battle system is made up of two units fighting each other with their selected weapon. Some weapons are better against others. For example, swords are better against axes. When units defeat others, they gain experience. This experience is used to \"level up\" the units and makes them stronger. A well known feature in \"Fire Emblem\" is that when a character is damaged very badly (loses all of their \"hit points\"), they can never be used in the game again.\n\nEach \"Fire Emblem\" game is mainly set on a fictional continent, or a really large area. Some continents are used in more than one game. Six continents have been used in \"Fire Emblem\" so far.\n\nThe first six games were made in Japan.

It got very good reviews and sold very well. The game's story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers.\n\n\"BioShock\" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like cruel political, economic, and religious power over land. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture, leading to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology thanks in part to the brilliant scientists that Ryan brought to the city. Scientists also made ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls (\"Little Sisters\"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine.\n\nAs time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor. He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface, such as religious material. These, along with his control of the plasmid industry, made him immensely powerful. He tried to overthrow Ryan, but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead. Ryan seized control of Fontaine's plasmid business. Within a few months, a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class. On New Year's Eve of 1959, Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture's main square. In order to solve ADAM shortages, the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead, recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it. \"Big Daddies\", enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits, were created by Dr. Suchong, the scientist behind many plasmids, to protect the Little Sisters in their work.\nA drawback of ADAM is that a user must take regular infusions or suffer mental and physical problems. As the war hurt production and supply, every ADAM user in the city went violently insane. By the time the player arrives, only a handful of non-mutated humans survive in hideouts.\n\nAt the start of the game, player-character Jack is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960, after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed. After surfacing, Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash, and swims to a nearby lighthouse on an island, where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to sink into the ocean and enter the city of Rapture. An Irishman named Atlas uses the service radio found in the bathysphere to help Jack in making his way to safety. Meanwhile, Ryan, believing Jack to be an agent of a surface nation, uses Rapture's automated systems and his pheromone-controlled Splicers to try to kill Jack. Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids, and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM. Overhearing Atlas' words, Dr. Tenenbaum intercepts Jack, and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead, giving him a plasmid that will displace the embedded sea slugs in each Sister. Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine and directs Jack towards it. Just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located, Ryan has it destroyed; an angry Atlas asks Jack to kill Ryan.\n\nEventually, after completing tasks like saving an artificial forest from dying and helping an insane artist build his sculpture, Jack confronts Ryan in his office, who is playing golf. Ryan reveals a truth that he has pieced together. He is Ryan's illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene, a dancer. When Jolene became pregnant with Jack, she, in desperate need of money, had her embryo surgically removed and sold it to the highest bidder. She had not realized it was Frank Fontaine who purchased the son, leading to her death by an angry Ryan. Ryan further reveals that, after purchasing Jack's embryo, Fontaine made him to obey orders when he is told \"Would you kindly...\" Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan's reach. When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate, Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package and to use its contents, a revolver, to hijack and crash the plane near the lighthouse, enabling him to return to Rapture as a tool of Fontaine. Because Jack was Ryan's son, he could freely use Rapture's bathysphere network, which had been locked out to everyone except those within Ryan's \"genetic ballpark\". Finally, Ryan has Jack kill him, wanting to die on his own terms. With Ryan's death, Jack realizes too late that Atlas has also been using the trigger phrase to control him. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, who faked his death to throw Ryan off his trail and take control of the city, leaving Jack at the mercy of the reactivated security systems. Dr. Tenenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system, where he falls and loses consciousness.\n\nWhen Jack awakens, Dr. Tenenbaum has already turned off the trigger phrase. When it becomes clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack, Fontaine points out the fact that Tenenbaum has survived both World War II as a Holocaust victim and the battle in Rapture, hinting that she has a secret agenda of her own. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack is able to track down Fontaine. Fontaine, having been cornered, injects himself with huge amounts of ADAM and becomes an monster. Jack battles Fontaine, eventually beating and allowing the Little Sisters to take the ADAM from Fontaine, killing him.\n\nThree endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, all narrated by Dr. Tenenbaum. If the player harvested \"no\" Little Sisters (thereby saving their lives), the ending shows five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care, including their graduating from college, getting married, and having children; it ends on a heart-warming tone, with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all five of the adult Little Sisters.\n\nIf the player harvested (and thereby killed) \"all\" or almost all of the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine, presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM. Tenenbaum narrates what occurred, angry Jack and his actions, voice thick with anger. Later in the second ending, a \"George Washington\"-class submarine carrying nuclear missiles comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers. The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it.\n\nIf the player killed more than one Little Sister, but not enough to obtain the previous ending, the ending is the same to the second one, but the tone of Tenenbaum's voice is a sad one, as opposed to angry and there are minor dialogue changes.\n", "id": "121614", "title": "BioShock"}

None of the solutions are practically acceptable; a person in this position has been traditionally described as being impaled on the horns of a dilemma, neither horn being comfortable.\n\nThe dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device, in the form \"you must accept either A, or B\"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion. Applied in this way, it may be a fallacy, a false dichotomy.\n\nIn formal logic, the definition of a dilemma differs markedly from everyday usage. Two options are still present, but choosing between them is immaterial because they both imply the same conclusion. Symbolically expressed thus:\n\nformula_1\n\nThis can be translated informally as \"one (or both) of A or B is known to be true, but they both imply C, so regardless of the truth values of A and B we can conclude C.\"\n\nHorned dilemmas can present more than two choices. The number of choices of Horned dilemmas can be used in their alternative names, such as two-pronged (two-horned) or dilemma proper, or three-pronged (three-horned) or trilemma, and so on.\n\nConstructive dilemmas--\n\nDestructive dilemmas--\n\nIn \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\" Robert Pirsig outlines possible responses to a dilemma. The classical responses are to either choose one of the two horns and refute the other or alternatively to refute both horns by showing that there are additional choices. Pirsig then mentions three illogical or rhetorical responses. One can \"throw sand in the bull's eyes\" by, for example, questioning the competence of the questioner. One can \"sing the bull to sleep\" by, for example, stating that the answer to the question is beyond one's own humble powers and asking the questioner for help.

It aired from January 16 1995 until November 22 1999. The series was created in 1995 by writer-producers Christian Willians under his production tag, \"Pacific Renaissance Pictures LTD\" with later co-executive producers being Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, John Schulian and R. J. Stewart, the series is a Spin-off from the TV movies series aired in 1994, \"Hercules and the Amazon Women\", \"Hercules and the Lost Kingdom\", \"Hercules and the Circle of Fire\", \"Hercules in the Underworld\", and \"Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur\", the last of which served mostly as a \"clip show\" of the previous movies as a lead up to the series, was very loosely based on the tales of the classical Greek culture hero Hercules. It ran for six seasons, producing action figures and other memorabilia as it became one of the highest rated syndicated shows in television history.\n\nThe series is set in a fantasy version of ancient Greece not precisely located in historical time. Although set in ancient Greece, the show also has a mixture of Oriental, Egyptian and Medieval elements in various episodes. The show stars Kevin Sorbo as Hercules and regularly features Michael Hurst as his sidekick Iolaus. Robert Trebor often rotates with Iolaus as Hercules' other sidekick, Salmoneus. \n\nTypical plot lines involve Hercules and Iolaus, or Salmoneus, saving rustic villagers from monsters, evil warlords or the often selfish whims of the gods. In the earlier episodes, as mentioned in the show's opening title, Hercules' main nemesis is his evil stepmother Hera, who seeks to destroy Hercules using various monsters, because he is a reminder of her husband Zeus' infidelity. As the series progressed, a wider range of enemies was used; notably, the malicious Ares, god of war, replaced Hera as the show's primary antagonist. Towards the end of the series Ares is himself replaced by the evil god, Dahak, who is the main villain in the show's fifth season and sets off a story arc that has Hercules traveling to Sumeria, Norseland and Éire. Although Zeus, Hercules' father, is frequently cited by Hercules as a neglectful father, Zeus' love for Hercules is well-documented in the show. Indeed, Hercules is often referred to as \"the favorite son of Zeus\". Zeus makes several appearances on the show, even saving his son's life and restoring his superhuman strength on one occasion when he needs it the most. Hercules, for his own part, is always there for Zeus when his father needs him, and in the end, Hercules reconciles with his father and buries whatever issues he has with the father he has come to understand and love.\n\nThe show had a successful spin-off, \"\", with which it shared recurring characters such as Ares, Autolycus, aforementioned Salmoneus, Aphrodite and Callisto. Both shows, although produced in New Zealand using mostly local actors who strove for American accents, were syndicated worldwide.\n\nHercules is the world's greatest hero. The son of Zeus, King of the Gods and the mortal woman Alcmene, Hercules uses his divine strength in the aid of all people. His father was never really there for him and Hercules looked on the centaur Ceridan, who was his master at the academy as a father figure. Despite this, there are many who wish him dead. Most notably, Hera, Queen of the Gods and the wife of Zeus, she despises Hercules because he is a testament to Zeus' infidelity and has tried to destroy Hercules and his loved ones at every opportunity. Despite the many tragedies that have befallen him, not least of which both of his wives being killed, Hercules continued to be a force of good in the world. Hercules is played by American actor Kevin Sorbo.\n\nIolaus has been Hercules' best friend for many years ever since they met at Cheiron's academy. A former thief, Iolaus has long since repented his unlawful ways and is now a permanent force for good. His happy-go-lucky attitude makes him a popular guy, especially among the ladies, but Iolaus has had more than his fair share of tragedy. Not only did he lose his wife Anya and their children to mysterious circumstances, but Iolaus himself has been killed three times. The first two times Hercules brought him back without too much hassle, but the third time was more complicated. In saving Nebula, Iolaus was killed by the treacherous Gilgamesh and Dahak took Iolaus' body as his own. Hercules teamed up with Zarathrusta to defeat Dahak and Iolaus was allowed to become a Servant of the Light in Heaven. Iolaus broke his pact with the angels however, in warning Hercules of Michael's plan to unleash the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse on the world. As punishment Iolaus was deprived of his status of Servant of the Light, but allowed to return to Earth to fight at Hercules' side. Iolaus is played by actors Michael Hurst and Dean O'Gorman.\n\n\n\n\n\"Anchor Bay Entertainment\" has released all 6 seasons of \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" as well as all TV-Movies on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The first two season box sets are not closed-captioned, even though the original release of episodes on TV was.\n\n", "id": "121704", "title": "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"}

The Grammy Awards were established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony each year by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\".\n\nThe definition of \"alternative\" has been debated. The award was first presented in 1991 to recognize non-mainstream rock albums \"heavily played on college radio stations\". According to the Academy, the award is presented to \"vocal or instrumental alternative music albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded music\". The Academy defines \"alternative\" as a \"non-traditional\" genre that exists \"outside of the mainstream music consciousness\". In 1991, and from 1994 to 1999, the award was known as Best Alternative Music Performance. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.\n\nAs of 2011, Radiohead and The White Stripes share the record for the most wins in this category, having won three times each. Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke, was also nominated for the 2007 award for his solo album. Beck and Coldplay have each received the award twice, the latter being the only group to win two years in a row. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United Kingdom five times, from Ireland twice, and from France once. Female musicians Tori Amos and Björk hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with five each.\n\n Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.\n\n\n\n", "id": "121711", "title": "Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album"}

It lasted only one season with 50 episodes, and starred Ryan Gosling, replacing Ian Bohen from the pilot movie as the title character. Ian Bohen was offered the part, but opted not to spend an entire year in New Zealand where the series would shoot principal photography.\n\nThe show features the efforts of Ares, the god of war, played by Kevin Smith, who attempts often to destroy his younger half-brother to win over Zeus' good graces. Among his group is his nephew Strife (Joel Tobeck), who is the rather weaker member of the team. Strife's partner is Discord, goddess of retribution (Meighan Desmond), who acts more level-headed and power hungry than her counterpart on more than one occasion.\n\nThe storyline follows Hercules (Ryan Gosling) as he attends Cheiron's Academy to train in the arts of the warrior under the wise headmaster Cheiron the Centaur (Nathaniel Lees). He makes friends with the future king of Corinth, the prince Jason (Chris Conrad) and a thieving former member of a bandit group Iolaus (Dean O'Gorman) who was sentenced to the training academy as an alternative to prison for his crimes. Hercules also meets the academy's first female cadet, Lilith (Jodie Rimmer). Other characters of interest include Kora, the Inn Keeper, who unknown to Hercules and his friends, is a devotee of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt. As the series develops, Kora is revealed to have special powers which allow her to do Artemis' bidding. There are hints of romance between Hercules and Kora, although their friendship keeps it all innocent. \n\nThe overall plot of the show is to fill in any of the gaps that may exist between the version of \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" and the episodes that transpire from his young adult life, although very loosely due to its continuity errors by neglecting the \"Young Hercules\" movie and the flashback episodes of the fourth season of \"Hercules\".\n\n", "id": "121729", "title": "Young Hercules"}

These two people met Jesus after his Resurrection. The two disciples walked together on the road. Jesus started walking together with them. But they never recognized Jesus. They started to tell him what happened in Jerusalem, when Jesus was crucified. Jesus continued walking with them until they got to a village called Emmaus. They started eating supper. The two disciples still did not recognize Jesus. But when Jesus blessed the food amnd broke the bread they recognized him. When they did recognize him, he vanished. \n\nThe event is described according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:13-16...28-31):\nThat very day two of them were going to a village (one hundred and) sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were speaking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him … As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, ‘Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is declining.’ So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him.\n\nAccording to a very ancient Christian tradition, Emmaus is today's Arab village of Amwas, which lies 160 stadia (30 km, 19 miles) to the West of Jerusalem. It can take 6 to 7 hours to come from Jerusalem to Emmaus on foot, if one walks across the mountains of Judea. The place was called Nicopolis during the 3d-7th centuries AD. During Byzantine times, two big Basilicas (churches) where built here with beautiful mosaics and a baptistry (a place for baptism).\nMany manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have a shorter distance between Jerusalem and Emmaus: 60 stadia (12 km, 7 miles). It is this distance which is found in modern printed Bibles. During the Crusader and Renaissance times many Christians, traveling to the Holy Land, were looking for Emmaus at the distance of 7 miles from Jerusalem. That's why several villages which lie 12 km away from Jerusalem were thought to be Emmaus.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121792", "text": "Greek numerals\n\nGreek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the Greek alphabet. They are also known by the names \"Milesian numerals\", \"Alexandrian numerals\", or \"alphabetic numerals\". In modern Greece, they are still in use for ordinal numbers, and in much of the same way that Roman numerals are in the West; for ordinary (cardinal) numbers, Arabic numerals are used.\n\nAt first, before it was used more, the Greek alphabet, Linear A and Linear B had used a different system with symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula: | = 1, – = 10, ◦ = 100, ¤ = 1000, ☼ = 10000.\n\nThe earliest alphabet-related system of numerals used with the Greek letters was a set of the acrophonic Attic numerals, operating much like Roman numerals (which derived from this scheme), with the following formula: Ι = 1, Π = 5, Δ = 10, ΠΔ = 50, Η = 100, ΠΗ = 500, Χ = 1000, ΠΧ = 5000, Μ = 10000 and ΠΜ = 50000.\n\nThe acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system, sometimes called the Ionic numeral system, from the 4th century BC. Each unit (1, 2, …, 9) was assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, …, 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, …, 900) a separate letter. This requires 27 letters, so the 24-letter Greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters: fau ϝ, (also used are stigma ϛ or, in modern Greek, στ) for 6, qoppa ϟ for 90, and sampi ϡ for 900. To distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the \"keraia\" (Greek \"—insect antenna\"), a symbol similar to an acute sign (Unicode U+0374).\n\nThis alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 241 is represented as σμαʹ (200 + 40 + 1).\n\nTo represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999 the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. A \"left keraia\" (Unicode U+0375, ‘Greek Lower Numeral Sign’) is put in front of thousands to distinguish them from the standard use. For example, 2008 is represented as ͵βηʹ (2000 + 8).\n\nIn modern Greek, uppercase letters are used more, as in Φίλιππος Βʹ = Philip II.\n\nThe Greeks also used the myriad to denote 10,000 (Μʹ) and the myriad myriad for one hundred million (ΜΜʹ).\n\n", "id": "121792", "title": "Greek numerals"}

This movie is loosely based on the labor of Hercules to get the Golden Girdle. Here instead of getting the Golden Girdle, he faces the Amazon women who are plaguing the men in their area. Hippolyte like in the Marvel comics and mythology falls in love with Hercules. But unlike in the myth, Hippolyte befriends Hercules.\n\nThree men are walking through the woods, they hear strange noises and catch glimpses of something moving in the undergrowth. Suddenly they are attacked by unseen creatures. Two men are killed, but one escapes and flees the woods.\n\nHercules strolls into a village after returning from one of his adventures, and is greeted by Iolaus. It is established that Iolaus is getting married and that Hercules is the best man. The two men set off for Alcmene's house. While walking through the woods, they reminisce that it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Iolaus tells Hercules about his bride-to-be, Ania. They stumble upon a little girl crying alone near an altar. She tells them that a monster killed her father while they were placing an offering to the goddess. Hercules tries to comfort the girl and asks if he can help, but the girl transforms into a monster. Hercules chops off its head, thinking it is now dead, Hercules and Iolaus begin walking away. They hear a noise and turn around to see that the monster is not dead, but has now grown two new heads in the place where the previous one was. The monster is a Hydra. Hercules tells Iolaus to grab the torch from the altar, Hercules cuts off the heads and burns the Hydra, preventing it from growing new heads, thus killing it. After the Hydra is destroyed a peacock feather remains in its place, Hercules tells Iolaus that Hera is responsible for the Hydra.\n\nHercules and Iolaus finally reach his mother's house, after a short chat with Alcmene, Iolaus invites them both for dinner, then leaves. Later on that evening while the four are enjoying dinner, Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate. It is Pithus, the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film. He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by the creatures and Hercules agrees to help. Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married, Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along. The three men set off for the village. When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are, Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest. Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beast and rescue the village's women. In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts, they manage to stave off the attack for a time, but Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women. After he chases after one he is fatally injured in the fight and Hercules is captured and taken to the City of Amazons.\n\nHercules is then seen being taken captive by the women. He has been stripped of his shirt and chained to a wooden sled assembled by the women that is attached to a horses saddle and being pulled along. The women have also cleave gagged his mouth with a black leather strap. He is surrounded by women on each side of him and led into a village full of women. He is starred at by many of the women. A few laugh and taunt him. You can hear one of the women saying \"keep him bound\" and another saying \"Men should be seen and not heard\" in reference to him being gagged. In vein Hercules muffles angry speech through the gag. Women continue to laugh at him. In the village, some women are being trained in combat and others are doing chores. When he arrives at the end of the village, the leader of the Amazon army (Lysia) helps to release him from the sled. She tells Hercules \"If you're looking for men, you won't find any. Not in the city of amazons. You're the only one and I don't think you'll last very long.\"\n\nHercules is taken by the women to the Queen, Hippolyta. She removes the gag from his mouth. She tells him that she knows he is here to defeat them and that Hercules has been beaten by women. Hercules tells her she is wrong. Using a magic candle, the Hippolyta turns Hercules into a baby telling him she will show him what he is really like. As Hercules reverts to infant form we are shown flashbacks to Hercules's youth and times when he has been told by people how to behave toward women. Later he returns to adult state, realising that Hippolyta is right and that his attitude toward women is wrong, he tells her that he can change. She says that he cannot change and that all men are the same. Hippolyta goes to consult with Hera, she tells Hippolyta to lead an attack on the village\n\nHercules escapes from the Amazons and warns the men of the village of the forthcoming attack. He prepares them for when the women arrive. The women ride into the village and order the men to remove their clothes, telling them they are here for only one thing. The men tell the women to sit and talk with them for a while. Pithus's wife enters her home, and her son Franco asks if she really is his mother. He tells her he often dreams about her but she has no face, she removes her mask and shows her face to Franco. Hercules stands up to Hippolyta, who says she's not afraid of Hercules. He kisses her, she tells him she's not afraid and kisses him back. The two make love. The following day the women are still with the men. The Amazons return to their city and both men and women reminisce about the night before. Hera tells Hippolyta that Hercules has tricked her and to attack the village again, this time killing all the men and boys. Hippolyta refuses but Hera possesses her. Hera, now in control of Hippolyta's action orders the women to attack the village.\n\nHercules stops Hippolyta and realises that she is possessed by Hera. She rides off and Hercules goes after her. As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta, telling her that she is stronger than Hera. Hercules best her and is about to deal the fatal blow, but cannot because it is Hippolyta's body and not really Hera. Hercules leaves and Hera follows him, goading him. He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her, saying he could not live his life without her. Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolyta's body over the edge of a waterfall, killing her.\n\nHercules returns to the City of Amazons, and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood. Zeus appears and tells him the candle does not work in the way Hercules wants it to. Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way. Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera, but Hercules persuades him anyway. Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner. Ania see Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village does not need the help of Hercules. He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out. Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring. Alcmene asks Hercules if there is a woman out there who will make him happy like Ania did for Iolaus, Hercules replies that he is sure there is.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "121830", "title": "Hercules and the Amazon Women"}

Hercules helps the refugees take back the city.\n\nThree men are running along the riverside. One of them stops to take a drink from the river. As he stoops down to quench his thirst a female figure composed of water rises out of the river and pulls him under, drowning him. The other two men run on. While running, one man is hit by a boulder and killed. The remaining man escapes. Elsewhere a young woman is collecting water, when the ground begins to shake. She flees back to the village to warn them that a giant is coming. The giant follows the woman to the village and rips the roof of the tavern. Hercules presents himself to the giant and the giant challenges Hercules to a fight. Hercules goes outside and he beats the giant. As the village celebrates the defeat the man from earlier in the film arrives in the village. He asks for Hercules' help. He explains to Hercules that his people have been driven from their city, the lost city of Troy.\n\nZeus appears and Hercules asks him if he will help him. He asks his father how to find Troy and he says that Hera made it vanish. To find it, Hercules must find the one true compass which will point the way to Troy. Hercules heads off to find the compass. He finds a tribe of men preparing to sacrifice a young virgin to their water god. Hercules saves her from being sacrificed, while unknowingly being watched by a mysterious robed figure. The woman tells Hercules that her name is Deianeira. Later in the evening as they camp for the night, Deianeira tells her a story that she is the daughter of a king. She sees the dark figure and asks who he is and why she is being followed, but the figure does not answer. Later Hercules and Deianeira arrive at the slave market looking for Queen Omphale, the last person to have possessed the compass. In order to get to see the queen, Hercules sells himself as a slave, and the queen buys him. After spending the night with the queen, Hercules gets the compass and he and Deianeira continue searching for Troy. Deianeira gets attacked by some men but the figure in the dark robe saves her and tells her to follow her destiny.\n\nHercules and Deianeira head on to Troy. They arrive at the ocean and the figure standing on the cliffs summons a sea serpent to do Hera's bidding. It swallows Hercules and Deianeira. Hercules kills the monster from inside and they are washed up on the shore. Deianeira sees Troy in the distance and tells Hercules that she now remembers and this is where she is from. Deianeira and Hercules get caught in a trap and taken to the king. The king is ill and he and his daughter are reunited. He tells her that the Cult of the Blue Priests have taken over the city and the people have taken refuge in the woods. He tells Deianeira to rule them well, and then dies.\n\nHercules tutors the people of Troy and prepares them to battle to take back Troy. Deianeira realises that the people can not beat the Cult of the Blue Priests and goes looking for the Blue Priest. The people notice that Deianeira is missing and Hercules and the people use an underground tunnel to get into the city. As the people fight the cult members Hercules goes looking for Deianeira. He finds her about to be sacrificed to Hera and saves her. The Blue Priest and Hercules fight and Hercules cuts off the priest's head. A huge storm approaches, and Zeus tells Hercules that Hera is coming for Deianeira. Hercules saves her and Hera takes Hercules instead.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121873", "text": "Savate\n\nSavate, also known as \"boxe française\" (French boxing) or French kickboxing, is a French martial art - a kind of \"boxe pieds-poings\" - which use the hands and the feet as weapons and includes elements of Western boxing, techniques of grappling and techniques of leg (only with the feet: neither knee, nor shin). The persons who perform savate are called \"savateurs\" or \"\"tireurs\"\" in case of the men, and \"savateuses\" in case of the women.\n\nSavate carry its name from the French word for \"oldest shoe\" (heavy shoes that were used to use during the combats) and is now a combination of the French techniques of fighting from beginning of the century XIX. In that age, savate was a kind of fighting which was common in Paris and in the North of France. In the South, especially in the port of Marseilles, the seamen had developed other style known as \"jeu marseillais\" (\"the game of Marseilles\"), that has obtained a new name \"chausson\" (\"slipper\", that was the shoes that the seamen used). Differently, in that age in England (the place of birth of boxing and the rules of Queensberry), people treated kicking as non-fair in sport or as something what only the cowards used more.\n\nThe two persons who has been recorded in the history of changing of street combat into modern savate are Michel Casseux (also known as \"le Pisseux\") (1794-1869), and Charles Lecour (1808-1894). Casseux opened in 1825 the first building in order to perform and to help in the development of a version of \"chausson\" and savate with rules (refusing to allow the strikes with the head, attacks with the fingers to the eyes, etc.). Anyhow, such sport still have been limited by its opinion of street combat. A student of Casseux, Charles Lecour had been exposed to the English art of boxing in the year 1830 and he had felt himself misfit, because he used his hands in order to hit the feet of the opponent and to drive them away in this way, instead of punching as in boxing. By that reason he trained himself in boxing during two years and in 1832 he combined boxing with \"chausson\" and savate in order to create such sport of \"savate boxe française\" as we know it today.\n\nProbably the more outstanding recognition as soon as to the esteem of savate came in 1924 when had been included as sport of exhibition in the Olympic Games of Paris. In spite of its roots, savate is a sport relatively safe in order to learn. According to USA Savate , savate is in the lower places of injuries when is compared with the soccer, football, hockey, gymnastics, basketball, baseball and speed skating.\n\nGioacchino Rossini, Lord Byron, Dumas, Richard Sylla, Michel Casseux, Joseph Charlemont, Gerard Gordeau, Ernesto Hoost, Cheick Kongo, Alain Ngalani, Charles Lecour, Christian M'Pumbu, Ludovic Millet, Fred Royers, Andrè Panza, Paolo Biotti, François Pennacchio, Pierre Vigny, Max Greco, Alexandre Walnier, Bertrand Soncourt, Amri Madani, Farid Khider, Christophe Landais, Enoch Effah, Arnaud de Pape, Johnny Catherine, Jacques Dobaria, Kader Kessaghli, Derenik Sargsyan, Fathi Mira, Jérôme Huon, Tony Ancelin, Ismaila Sarr, Djibrine Fall-Télémaque Cyrielle Girodias, Julie Burton, Slimane Sissoko, Julie Lazard, Mike et Sullivan Lambret, Richard et Romain Carbone.\n\nAt present, savate is performed in all the world by interested people: from Australia to United States and from Finlandia to the United Kingdom. Many lands, as is case of United States has national federations very interested for helping in the development of this sport.\n\nThe modern savate gives three levels of competition: \"assault\", \"precombat\" and \"combat\". In assault, the competitors need to be concentrated on the technique during they are trying make contact; refrees punish with penatlties the usage of excessive force. Precombat permits fighting without thoughtlessness in the force always and when the fighters wear protection as helmets and shin protectors. Combat, the level more intensified, is similar to the precombat but the usage objects of protection is prohibited (except in case of the genital protectors and the protectors of the teeth).\n\nMany martial arts have systems of judgment of level of the persons who perform them, as the colour of the belts in the karate. In the same way, savate uses different colours in the gloves in order to show the level of a fighter; although, on the contrary that disciplines as the judo or the capoeira, where the fighters obtain new belts in each promotion, every fighter can use the same pair of gloves in several promotions (for that the level is not corresponding directamente with the colour of the gloves that are used but with that is established in the licence). The beginners begin without colour and the different exams of promotion permit them to be promoted to blue, green, red, white and yellow in that order.

He is famous for the roles he sings in bel canto operas.\n\nJuan Diego Flórez was born in Lima, Peru on January 13, 1973. His father, Rubén Flórez, was a guitarist and singer of Peruvian popular music. His mother worked in a pub where music was performed live. When a musician was ill Juan would sing instead. It was good experience for him.\n\nHe entered the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in Lima at the age of 17. He was intending to have a career in popular music. His teacher Andrés Santa María found that he had a superb voice for classical music. He became a member of the Coro Nacional of Peru and sang as a soloist in Mozart's \"Coronation Mass\" and Rossini's \"Petite Messe Solennelle\".\n\nHe was given a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia where he studied from 1993 to 1996 and began singing in student opera productions. He sang roles in operas by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. During this period, he also studied with Marilyn Horne at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. In 1994 the Peruvian tenor, Ernesto Palacio invited him to Italy to work on a recording of Vicente Martín y Soler's opera \"Il Tutore Burlato\". Palacio became Flórez's teacher and helped him an enormous amount in his career.\n\nFlórez's first big breakthrough came in 1996, at the Rossini Festival in the Italian city of Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace. At the age of 23, he was asked to sing the leading tenor role in \"Matilde di Shabran\" when Bruce Ford became ill. He first sang at La Scala in the same year as the Chevalier danois in Gluck's \"Armide\". His Covent Garden debut followed in 1997 where he sang the role of Count Potoski in the world premiere of Donizetti's \"Elisabetta\". Debuts followed at the Vienna Staatsoper in 1999 as Count Almaviva in \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" and at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 2002, again as Count Almaviva. On February 20 2007, the opening night of Donizetti's \"La Fille du régiment\" at La Scala, Flórez broke the theater's 74-year-old tradition of not having any encores when he repeated the aria \"Ah! mes amis\" with its nine high C's after the audience gave him an enormous ovation.\n\nFlórez sing in concerts in Europe, North America, and South America. Amongst the many places in which he has given concerts and recitals are the Wigmore Hall in London, the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Palau de la Música in Barcelona, the Teatro Segura in Lima, and the Mozarteum in Salzburg. As a change from the usual music he sings, he sang \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" from the Broadway musical \"Carousel\" at the Berlin Live 8 concert in 2005.\n\nHe was signed by Decca in 2001 and since then made 5 CDs for them. Nearly all his operatic roles have been broadcast on radio or television.\n\nFlórez was married to German-born Julia Trappe in a private civil ceremony on April 23, 2007 in Vienna. They held a religious ceremony at the Basilica Cathedral in Lima on April 5, 2008. Some of Peru's most famous people went, including President Alan García and author Mario Vargas-Llosa.\n\nJuan Diego Flórez has won many awards and distinction, including Peru's highest honour: the \"Gran Cruz de la Orden del Sol del Perú\". He has even appeared on a Peruvian stamp.\n\n", "id": "121877", "title": "Juan Diego Flórez"}

The atomic mass of Cerium is 140.12. The Chemical symbol of Cerium is Ce and it is a member of the Lanthanide group.\n\nCerium is a grey, shiny or lustrous metal. At room temperature Cerium is a solid. It melts and becomes a liquid at 798C and boils and becomes a gas at 3424C. It burns in air to form a compound with one cerium atom and two oxygen atoms. 0.0046% of the Earth's crust is Cerium which means that it is quite common - more common than Tin and Lead and nearly as common as zinc\n\nCerium was first found in Sweden in 1803 by Berzelius and Hisinger and Klaproth in Germany. Because it is very reactive, it was not purified until 1875 in Washington DC. Cerium was named after the asteroid or minor planet Ceres which was first seen two years earlier in 1801.\n\nCerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes. Its most common use is as the 'flint' in a lighter, because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal. Cerium is sometimes used in alloys because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant. Cerium is also used in special glass, ceramics and self-cleaning ovens.\n\nCerium reacts in two ways to produce Cerous compounds or salts and Ceric compounds. Cerous salts have an oxidation number of 3 and ceric salts have an oxidation of 4.\n\nCerium has a large number of isotopes. Four of them are found in nature instead of having to be made, \nCerium-140 (88.5% of all Cerium) and Cerium-142 (11.1%) are the most common. The average of the weights of each isotope is what give Cerium its Atomic Mass of 140.12\n\n", "id": "121892", "title": "Cerium"}

It commemorates Russia's 1812 defense against Napoleon's advancing Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino, during the French invasion of Russia.\n\nThe Overture's first public performance occurred on August 20, 1882 (NS; the OS date was 8 August). The venue was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire and ringing chimes. \n\nThe 1812 Overture is written for an orchestra which uses following music instruments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSixteen cannon shots are written into the score of the Overture. The Overture begins with the plaintive Russian Orthodox \"Troparion of the Holy Cross\" (\"God Preserve Thy People\") played by eight cellos and four violas. The piece moves through a mixture of pastoral and militant themes. The Overture includes the Russian folk dance \"At the Gate, at my Gate.\" At the turning point of the invasion – the Battle of Borodino – the score calls for five Russian cannon shots. A descending string passage represents the following retreat of the French forces, followed by victory bells and a triumphant repetition of \"God Preserve Thy People\" as Moscow burns to deny winter quarters to the French. A musical chase scene appears. Out of it, the anthem \"God Save the Tsar!\" appears.

When a far off village is in danger from an unseen monster, Hercules is goes to help save the village from the monster. The origin of the monster is a combination of the Greek myth and the myths of Tantalus and Lycaon.\n\nIn a forest, two men are looking for treasure. They follow their map and find a cave covered with bushes. The two men enter the cave. In the cave, they find a large wooden door. As they try to get through the door, a monster breaks through the door. It chases after them. One man is captured. The other runs as the monster tells him to bring Hercules. At this time, Hercules is working on his farm. He sees his sons fighting and tells them that they should not fight. They says that Hercules fights. Hercules tells them that he only fights when he has to and only to stop other people from being harmed.

Iolaus tells Hercules that he met a man who taught him to fight better. When Hercules attacks Iolaus, the smaller man does well at first. After a short while Hercules still wins. Deianeira tells Iolaus that since Hercules gave up his adventures he has become sad. A man comes at the stable looking for Hercules. He tells him that he must help his village and that a monster has taken his brother. Hercules says he cannot go. The man says he has to because he is Hercules. Later that evening Deianeria asks him why he refused to help. He tells her that he said that he would stay and raise the children with her. She tells him that he should not try to stop being Hercules, not for her or the children. She tells him to go. The next day, he and Iolaus set off for Alturia. As they travel to Alturia, a young couple are looking for somewhere quiet. They find the cave and enter. While they are in the cave, the Minotaur comes and attacks them.\n\nWhen Hercules and Iolaus get to Alturia, they ask a woman where the monster is. She tells Hercules that there is not any monster. Underneath the village, the Minotaur says that Hercules will pay. Zeus appears and tells the Minotaur that he still has not learned his lesson, he replies that he has been feeding on hate. Minotaur taunts Zeus because he was unable to kill the Minotaur. Hercules and Iolaus are in a tavern. They get into a fight with some men because they do not believe that he is really Hercules. Outside the tavern, two men are killed and Hercules goes to see what happened. He is found by the villagers. They think he killed the men and chase him and Iolaus. The man who had asked for Hercules's help comes and takes Hercules to the cave where his brother was captured. Zeus appears and tells Hercules what the monster is and why he wants Hercules. He asks Hercules to kill the Minotaur. In the centre of the cave, the Minotaur challenges Hercules. They begin fighting. As Hercules is about to kill the Minotaur, the creature tells him that he is really Hercules' brother. Hercules cannot kill him. The Minotaur then attacks Hercules and Hercules has to kill him. As the Minotaur dies, he changes to his human form and Zeus tells him that it did not have to end that way. Hercules helps Iolaus and the other people being held by the Minotaur.

In 1979 the large housing estate of Marzahn was separated from Lichtenberg to become an East Berlin borough in its own right and in 1986 the new Hellersdorf district (including Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf) was split from it. Berlin's 2001 administrative reform led to the former boroughs of Marzahn and Hellersdorf fusing into a single new borough.\n\nIn the north the locality includes the neighbourhoods of \"Bürknersfelde\" and \"Ahrensfelde\", an overbuilt strip of land which once belonged to the Brandenburg municipality of Ahrensfelde and was incorporated into Berlin in 1990.\n\nThe historic village of Marzahn was first mentioned as \"Morczane\" in a 1300 deed by Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, when he granted the estates to the Friedland Cistercian abbey (in today's Neuhardenberg). After the Thirty Years' War it fell to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg.\n\nMarzahn was the site of a labour camp (today a water treatment plant), where Roma were interned from July 16, 1936 on, two weeks prior to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, away from visitor's eyes. As a part of the Nazi \"Porajmos\" extermination policy, up to 2000 inmates remained there until in 1943 they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were gassed.

As they finish, a giant sea serpent comes from the sea and Hercules is trying to kill it. He finally throws a giant rock in its mouth but it jumps on the shore and lands on top of Hercules. It cant live on land so it dies and Hercules climbs out of its nosteral. The villagers thank Herc and Iolaus climbs out of a restchair and joins Hercules, who gets a big fish as a gift from the villagers. Herc and Iolaus head to Thebes to see Alcmene but Iolaus is a little upset because Herc gets all the credit. However the two defeat several highway men and alls okay. Saytars are in a bar and stole gold from helples people thus Xena and Gabrielle show up to beat them up and take the money back. Ares shows up after Gabrielle throws wine at a saytar and be ats him up with her fighting stick. He tells Xena to stop Herc from going to Thebes because there's a trap set for him there. Xena wants Herc to go since there's trouble and he needs to help. She is mad because Ares never gives up and wants her. She and Gabrielle argue about his intentions a little but are not enemys or nothings. Theres No rift between them in this movie. \n\nHercules is acting like a horse and pulling an old style plough at his mom's house. Iolaus is tired but they see Zeus come from the heavens in his chariot winged horses like Pegasus driving the chariot down. He takes Alcmene to Mt Olympus and Hercules's pissed. Iolaus thinks Alcmene went on her own since she put up no fight but Herc disagrees and pushes Iolaus against a wall in his anger. Hercules says sorry and the two head to rescue Alcmene. Zeus talks to Ares and wonders why he did not stop Hercules. He says he tried to get a mortal named Xena to do it and Zeus is mad because Ares keeps wanting Xena. Hera shows up, Hera is an old woman with a bad attitude face and nasty voice and attitude, and yells at Zeus about bringing Alcmene here. She leaves and somehow steals the cronus stone in the moment, the stone that keeps the titans in the underworld lava pits. Hera summons the titans out while Zeus checks on Alcmene, whos been shrunk and placed in a small Arabian doll house castle for safety from Hera. Aphrodite surfs down a mountain and makes Iolaus very happy and hugs her bro Hercules. She tells Herc that Heras mad and not to go to Mt Olympus for his own good but he decides to go and Iolaus stays behind to entertain the goddess of love but she leaves when an earthquake starts. But its a small boy who falls into the lava pits. Hercules holds the colliding ends together and Iolaus pulls up the boy making both heroes. The mother takes her son as Xena and Gabrielle, in a nearby town, battle 3 thugs who they beat easily and Xena must stop a rolling giant rock from destroying the fat thug. As she is successful, they show Hercules meeting the titan Porphyion. The leader titan says Herc can go free because he is not defending the gods. Zeus calls Artemis, Aphrodite, and Ares together to fight The Titans and they hope Hercules helps them. Xena and Gabrielle are helping wounded people and Artemis decides to get Xenas help and turns Gabrielle into a giant bird. Xena flys on Gabrielle to The Gods home while Herc climbs up. Artemis says she turned Gabrielle to get Xenas help and Xena said that all she had to do was ask for help from Xena. The titans come and fight. There four big titans-Poprhyrion, Tethys, Crius, and Mnemosyne. Hercules shows up and says hi to Xena but rescues Alcmene and leaves everyone to fight the titans. Hera turns the gods into animal after. Iolaus and Xena escape via bird Gabrielle to Alcmenes house. Everyone's upset because Herc did nothing to help Alcmene. The gods are all small animals until Zeus can get the stone back. Ares is a goat, Aphrodite is a cow, Artemis is a rabbit, and Zeus is a mouse. Herc finds out that Alcmene was sick and Zeus offered to make up for hardtimes by giving her immortality and taking her to live with him on Mt Olympus. Hercules is still mad at Zeus \n\nThe titans sing a stupid song and its back to earth where Xena sings something and both her and Hercules makeup and agree to help the gods get there home and stone back. The Titans get the stone from Hera and turn her into a small doll and place her in the dollhouse. Alcmene by the way has been turned back intoa normal person. The heroes ride Gabrielle to the mountain and fight the Titans. Herc gets the stone and tears it apart and thus the underworld caverns open and the lava pits are displayed. Hercules and Xena flip the fat titan Crius into the lave and Iolaus gets the water and fire females titans to collide and dissolve into the fiery pits. Gabrielle scoops up Porphy-rion who grabbed Hercules. Hercules managed to reach Gabrielles back where Xena and Iolaus are sitting and Gabrielle the bird drops the titan into the cavern, catches a falling Hercules, and drops him off on the gods mountain in time to close the stone which locks the titans in there prison of lava. Zeus and Alcmene go back to Olympus and Zeus welcomes Hercules to visit. Herc than heads of with Iolaus, Gabrielle, and Xena to Corinth to return a bag of gold and seek another adventure.\n\nThe songs \"Across the Sea of Time\", \"Titans Song\", and \"Xena's Song\" were written by Michele Brourman and Amanda McBroom.\n\n", "id": "121949", "title": "Hercules and Xena - The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=122033", "text": "L'incoronazione di Poppea\n\nL'incoronazione di Poppea () is an opera in three acts by Claudio Monteverdi. The libretto is by Giovanni Francesco Busenello. The first performance was in the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice in 1643. It was the last opera that Monteverdi composed.\n\nMost operas in the early 17th century were about mythological stories or stories from the Christian religion. This story, however, is about something that happened in the history of ancient Rome. It is about the evil emperor Nero and how he married Poppea. The gods still play a part in the opera, especially Cupid.\n\nAlthough the opera is called \"The Coronation of Poppea\" we do not actually see any coronation ceremony.\n\nMonteverdi was an experienced composer when he wrote this and the opera has some of his best music. The orchestra is only a small group of instruments: strings, recorders, cornetts (an old kind of trumpet), percussion, harp, lutes and gambas. The music does not divide sharply between recitative (narrating music) and aria (set songs), but flows gently from one type to the other.\n\nWhen listening to this opera it is important to remember that in the 17th century men often sang women’s parts and women sang men’s parts. A part such as Nero would have been sung by a castrato. Nowadays it can either be sung by a countertenor (a man) or a mezzo-soprano (a woman). There are scenes in this opera where the actors disguise themselves as the opposite sex. In the 17th century opera audiences did not find anything unusual about a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be a man or the other way round.\n\nThe duet between Nero and Poppea at the end of the opera may have been written by another composer. \n\nThe goddesses Fortune and Virtue are having an argument. They are being nasty to one another, each one is saying that she is better and more powerful than the other. Cupid (the god of love) comes in and says that he is even greater than they are, and that he rules both of them. Fortune and Virtue do not dare to disagree with him.\n\nOtho, who is Poppea’s lover, returns to his house and finds that the emperor Nero is in his house spending the night with Poppea. Nero’s guards have surrounded the house. Nero tells Poppea he has to go now, but that he loves her and will come back very soon. When he is gone, Arnalta, Poppea’s nurse, warns her that her affair with Nero will bring trouble. Octavia, Nero’s wife, is very sad that her husband is having an affair with someone else and hopes that the gods will punish him. Her nurse comforts her, saying that she ought to find herself a new lover to make Nero cross, but Octavia has too much honour to do such a thing. The philosopher Seneca tells her that she should just accept her fate. The page boy tells the philosopher he is stupid.\n\nNero tells Seneca that he is going to get rid of his wife and marry Poppea. Seneca warns Nero that the people will not like this, but Nero does not care. He is emperor and can do what he likes. Nero tells Poppea that he loves her so much that he wants to make her empress. Poppea says to Nero that Seneca believes that Nero is only powerful because he (Seneca) can guide him. Nero immediately believes her and says Seneca should be killed. Otho has been watching this scene. He goes to Poppea and tries to get her love back, but Poppea says she belongs to Nero now. Otho realizes that Poppea just wants power, and he knows that Nero will order him to be killed when he finds out that he used to be Poppea’s lover, so he decides he will have to kill Poppea.\n\nOtho goes to Drusilla who is in love with him. He tells her that he loves her, but he quietly says that Poppea is still in his heart.\n\nThe god Mercury warns Seneca that he is going to die. Seneca is quite happy with the news, because it will mean that he will live with the gods in heaven. Liberto, a messenger (his name means “a freed slave”), comes to tell Seneca that Nero is going to have him killed. He is surprised when Seneca already knows. There is a short scene in which the Page with the Lady-in-Waiting. Nero, with his friend Lucan, sings in praise of Poppea.\n\nOctavia tells Otho to disguise himself in woman’s clothes and to go and kill Poppea. She says that he will tell Nero bad things about him if he doesn’t. There is a comic scene between the Page and the Nurse. Drusilla lets Otho borrow her clothes to disguise himself. Poppea is in her garden being lulled to sleep by Arnalta. Cupid sings a song, promising to protect her. When Otho, disguised as Drusilla, comes to kill her, Cupid stops him. \n\nDrusilla is happy because her rival is going to die. The guards immediately arrest her thinking that she tried to kill Poppea (it was actually Otho in disguise). Drusilla realizes she was stupid to lend Otho her clothes. She tells Nero that she is guilty. Otho then speaks and tells Nero what happened. Nero punishes him by telling him to leave Rome and go and live in a faraway wilderness. Nero also sends Octavia away from Rome. He says she must be put in a boat and left to the mercy of the winds. Octavia sings a farewell song to Rome. Arnalta sings a comic song about how important he now is as the empress’s nurse. The opera finishes with a beautiful love duet for Nero and Poppea.\n\nGroves Dictionary of Music Online\n", "id": "122033", "title": "L'incoronazione di Poppea"}

In 1900-1901 this site became one of the first 'concentration camps' for Boer Prisoners of War (POWs) from the Anglo-Boer War, where some 400 such prisoners were held until 1903. In 1904-1905, a part of this camp became the British Indian Armys Mountaineering and PE Camp, whereas the rest was made into the zonal headquarters of the Royal Indian Army Supply Corps(RIASC).

For example 0+1=1 and 3+5=8. This sequence can go on forever. \n\nFibonacci numbers are related to the \"golden ratio\", which shows up in many places in buildings and in nature.

Penny is a single mother who has three children to support. Julia loves her boyfriend but can not decide whether to live with him or not, since the boyfriend recently bought a farm for them to live on. All four of them get on a bus. The bus driver, Hal, crashes the bus and all of them are killed.\n\nAll four of them are \"tied\" to a birth of a baby boy named Thomas in a car that was driving near the bus. They must stay within a certain distance of him and cannot leave him. As Thomas grows up, his parents and teachers are very worried that he is talking to \"imaginary people,\" since only Thomas can see the four people. Harrison, Milo, Penny, and Julia soon decide to disappear and not be a part of Thomas' life anymore.\n\nYears later, Thomas has grown into a man that handles bankrupt companies. The four of them are still attached and have no choice but to follow him wherever he goes. Soon, Hal comes down and tells them they all need to go up to heaven. However, all four of them have not yet tied up all the loose ends in their lives. They learn that Thomas is supposed to help them resolve everything on Earth before they leave. They make themselves visible to Thomas and tell him he needs to help, but refuses at first. He agrees to do whatever they want after they take over his body – their new power as ghosts – and make him do crazy things at a board meeting.\n\nMilo is the first one to finish up his life.

The adoption records are sealed and only the adopted children themselves can ask for a court order.\n\nInstead, Thomas decides to fulfill Harrison's last wish, which is to sing. Thomas breaks into a concert hosted by Billie King and sings the national anthem through Harrison. Afterwards, he is arrested by the police and pays money so he can get out of jail. Hal comes to pick Harrison up. Earlier in the movie, Thomas had told his girlfriend Anne that he could not come to the concert. After the concert is over, Anne and Thomas fight about it. \n\nThomas is mad and backs up very fast and hits a police officer's car, which turns out to be the same one that had arrested him earlier. The officer is very angry at first. He starts to sing a song to comfort his son. Penny recognizes the song as the one she used to sing to her son and realizes that the police officer is her son. Through Thomas, she hugs him and then happily goes to heaven.\n\nFinally, Julia wants to know what happened to her boyfriend. She writes a note that says that she loves him. They go to the farm that he had bought. However, when they get there, they find that the boyfriend died a few years ago. Julia is upset. Hal comes to pick Julia up, but Thomas asks him to stall for time. Julia finally believes her purpose is to Thomas to never let happen what happened to her – to lose a partner. She tells him to tell Anne that he loves her. She then goes up to heaven.\n", "id": "122228", "title": "Heart and Souls"}

Neodymium is a metal that forms a coating of oxide around itself when it is placed in air. It is usually used as neodymium magnets for hard disk drives.\n\nThough neodymium is called a rare earth metal, it is quite common, as common as nickel, cobalt or copper. Like every metal, neodymium is very shiny. It is a solid that melts at 1,024 degrees Celsius, or 1,875 degrees Fahrenheit. Neodymium is in a group of other elements called lanthanides, which are like each other in how they behave. When neodymium is dropped into water, it slowly changes into neodymium hydroxide, if the water or the neodymium itself is hot enough, the change is much faster, and the neodymium may explode. In the air, if the neodymium is hot enough, it can catch fire. Like every other metal, neodymium usually wants to get rid of its electrons, so the compounds it forms are usually with elements that want electrons, as oxygen does.\n\nThe neodymium magnets used to make hard disk drives do not weaken over time: they are permanent magnets. They can also be used in microphones or speakers. Electric guitars may use these magnets inside their pickups.\n", "id": "122282", "title": "Neodymium"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=122285", "text": "List of WWE pay-per-view events\n\nThis is a chronological list of pay-per-views promoted by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Each month, WWE holds one or two annual pay-per-view events. One event is usually three hours long and features six to twelve matches. Pay-per-view events are a big part of how the WWE earns money. \n\nIn the table below, NXT TakeOver: Toronto and NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn are marked with asterixes. This is because this will be the third event in the NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn series which is a branch of the NXT TakeOver series. The table also includes WWE Network events. \n\nMany people believe wrongly that the first WWE, then known as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), pay-per-view was November 1985's The Wrestling Classic. This was a tournament held at the Rosemont Horizon near Chicago. The first WrestleMania event, in March of the same year, was on pay-per-view in some areas. The first two WrestleManias earned much money. After WrestleMania III became one of the best events in wrestling history, the WWF then decided to have more pay-per-views.\n\nThe first Survivor Series event took place on November 29 1987. It was shown at the same time as NWA's Starrcade which was thought to be the biggest yearly event for NWA. The WWF informed cable companies that if they were showing Starrcade, they would not be allowed to show future WWF events. Most companies showed Survivor Series. Because of this, Starrcade did not make much money that year. This is thought to be the start of many problems for Jim Crockett Promotions.\n\nThe first Royal Rumble in January 1988 was shown on the USA Network. It had the highest rating in the network's history up until that time. The event became a pay-per-view the next year.\n\nThe first SummerSlam was held in Madison Square Garden in August 1988. These four events - the Royal Rumble in January, WrestleMania in March or April, SummerSlam in August, and Survivor Series in November - were the only annual pay-per-view offerings (other than the King of the Ring) from the WWF until 1995. After World Championship Wrestling (WCW) started showing more pay-per-views, the WWF increased the number of pay-per-views it showed. At first, the WWF used the name In Your House for its new shows. Beginning in 1996, it began using other names along with the In Your House name (such as Bad Blood and No Way Out). This was done to avoid confusion. By the end of February of 1999, the In Your House name was no longer used.\n\nBoth companies increased the number of pay-per-views until they each had one pay-per-view event each month. From the late '90s until 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment had a once-a-month pay-per-view schedule. The pay-per-view events in the United States can be bought through iN DEMAND, Dish Network or DirecTV.\n\nUp until 2003, the WWE ran two pay-per-views a year which were only shown in the United Kingdom. After the brand extension, they stopped doing these two events. Instead of the UK events, they did international tours which were taped for television. Currently, WWE has the WrestleMania Revenge tour, after WrestleMania, at the beginning of the year and the Survivor Series tour, at the end of the year, in the UK. Each includes a RAW, SmackDown!, and an ECW taping.\n\nIn Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on Main Event. In the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, some pay-per-views are shown on Sky Sports 1 and others on Sky Box Office.\n\nStarting with the 2008 Royal Rumble, all WWE pay-per-views were broadcast in High-definition.\n\nIn June 2003, WWE decided to only use people from one brand extension for many of its pay-per-views. Only the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series events used people from different brands. WrestleMania and The Royal Rumble were the only events with wrestlers from different brands competing against each other. This allowed WWE to show more pay-per-view events, such as Cyber Sunday and The Great American Bash. From late 2005, they decided to change this and matches with people from different brands were shown more often. In March 2007, it said they would stop only using one brand on each pay-per-view. All of its pay-per-views would have matchs from all three brands. The one-brand-only events were:\n\nWWE Backlash\nWWE Judgment Day \nWWE The Great American Bash\nWWE Unforgiven\nWWE No Mercy\nWWE Cyber Sunday\nWWE Armageddon\nWWE Fatal 4 Way\nWWE No Way Out\n\n", "id": "122285", "title": "List of WWE pay-per-view events"}

Siachen Glacier was the Land of Wild Roses before it became a battle field. It is the longest glacier in the Karakoram and second longest in the world's non-polar areas. It ranges from an altitude of 5,753 m (18,875 ft) above sea level at its source at Indira Col (pass) on the China border to its snout at 3,620 m (11,875 ft) \n\nThe Siachen War started on April 13, 1984. It has shown that the climatic conditions has killed the soldiers more than the enemy's attack. It is in the northern part of Kashmir. Muslim-majority Kashmir is at the heart of this hostility between India and Pakistan and was the cause of two of their three wars (the third was over the founding of Bangladesh). Indian and Pakistani forces, estimated to number between 10,000 and 20,000 troops combined, have faced off against each other ever since in these treacherous mountains above the Siachen glacier in the Karakoram range since 1984. The no-man's-land of Siachen is 20,000 feet (6,000 metres) above sea level. Military experts say the inhospitable climate and avalanche-prone terrain have claimed more lives than gunfire. The strategic importance of the glacier is debatable, military experts say. Until 1984, neither side had troops there. Both countries agree on a need to demilitarise the glacier, but neither side wants to take the first step. India controls the heights and is loath to withdraw for fear Pakistan might walk in. India says it is unwilling to bring its forces down until Pakistan officially authenticates the positions they hold. Pakistan has said it is willing to do so on the condition that it is not a final endorsement of India's claim over the glacier, a source of melt water for Pakistan's rivers.\n", "id": "122329", "title": "Siachen Glacier"}

She is referred to, by fans, as the Battling Bard of Potidaea. Her trademark weapons are the Amazon fighting staff and the sai.\n\nRenée O'Connor was chosen to play the role after she impressed producers with her role in the \"\" television movie \"The Lost Kingdom\".\n\nHer name is the feminine of Gabriel, from the Hebrew, which means \"messenger of God\". That is the name of the chief of Archangels, and during the show, Gabrielle becomes an Archangel. While Gabrielle is typically a French given name, it has a grammatically correct Greek feminine ending and contains no anti-Greek sounds (pronounced as Gab-ree-el-lay). Also, the Greek version of \"Gabrielle\" is Γαβριήλα, (Gavrila).\n\nIn the two musical episodes, Gabrielle's singing voice was provided by Susan Wood.\n\nGabrielle joins Xena in the first episode as her traveling partner and sidekick, and remains with her until the end of the show. It is this partnership which forms the premise of the show.\n\nWhen they meet, Gabrielle is a young, innocent, and idealistic scholar. She studies maps and the stars, reads mythology, writes stories, and dreams of traveling beyond her village to see the world. She wants to be a traveling bard. She also has strong ethical beliefs. She believes in the essential goodness of every person and is willing to put her life on the line for that.\n\nIn stark contrast, Xena is cynical, hard, and world-weary. Xena has killed thousands of people and, overcome with guilt, is returning home, perhaps to give up her own life. But on seeing Gabrielle's willingness to sacrifice herself for others, she is inspired to spend the rest of her life redeeming herself, and this becomes the driving theme throughout the show. Together they embark on an arduous, spirited adventure lasting over 30 years. Gabrielle acts as Xena's guiding light, keeping her dark memories at bay and reminding her of the goodness that she had once possessed. In return, Xena provides Gabrielle with travel and great adventures, teaches her about survival and the fighting arts, and acts as her protector, both physically and spiritually.\n\nGabrielle's story is one of growing up. Life with Xena is extreme in many ways, and traveling together often proves more dangerous than she had initially bargained for. Their friendship grows quickly, and they both overcome doubts, grief, loss of hope, and even death. As a burgeoning warrior, Gabrielle becomes more useful to Xena in combat and is increasingly treated as an equal. Eventually they learn that their destiny is woven together, in this and all future lives.\n\nBy the end of the series, when Xena dies and in the process finally redeems herself, Gabrielle has been transformed into a tough and courageous leader, a woman of the world, and a great warrior in her own right.\n\nWhen Gabrielle first meets the Warrior Princess, Xena, she is a farm girl living in the village of Potidaea. She and her sister Lila, along with several other village girls, have been kidnapped by the men of the warlord, Draco, to be sold as slaves. Xena intervenes and rescues them. Awed by her fighting skills, Gabrielle decides that she wants to become a warrior too. She also wants to avoid the marriage that her parents, Herodotus and Hecuba, have arranged for her with her childhood friend Perdicas. Gabrielle insists on following an initially reluctant Xena on the road. The two women soon develop a strong bond of love and friendship. Over the six years of the series, Gabrielle evolves from a naive, idealistic teenager into a fully fledged, but deeply conflicted warrior fighting alongside Xena.\n\nGabrielle becomes an Amazon when she defends a dying Amazon Princess during an ambush. Before she dies, the Princess Terreis passes her \"right of caste\" to Gabrielle, and Gabrielle inherits her rank and possessions. This leaves Gabrielle the heiress presumptive to the Amazon Queen, Melosa. Melosa's adopted daughter Velasca, becomes a rival for the position of Queen of the Amazons after Melosa's death, but Velasca's schemes (which include aspirations to godhood) are foiled by Xena and Gabrielle. As Gabrielle wishes to travel with Xena rather than rule the Amazons, she appoints her friend Ephiny to act as Amazon Queen in her place.\n\nGabrielle learns how to fight with a fighting staff from the Amazons. With Xena's encouragement, she develops a philosophy of fighting for the Greater Good without killing.\n\nAbout a year after meeting Xena, Gabrielle encounters Perdicas again and decides to marry him. The morning after their wedding, he is murdered by Xena's nemesis, Callisto. Gabrielle's grief and anger tests her ideals of reverence for life, but she nonetheless resists the impulse to kill Callisto. During this period, Gabrielle's strong commitment to peacemaking and compassion often serves as a counterbalance to Xena's warrior nature.\n\nWhen helping to defend Britannia against Caesar, Gabrielle comes into contact with an evil cult that tricks her into killing one of its priestesses, Meridian. The loss of Gabrielle's \"blood innocence\" enables the evil god Dahak to impregnate her. After a pregnancy that lasts only a few days, Gabrielle gives birth to a girl she names Hope. After becoming convinced that the baby is simply a vessel for Dahak, Xena wants to kill Hope. Gabrielle manages to save her daughter by putting her in a basket and sending her downriver.\n\nSeveral months later, Gabrielle finds Hope again, now looking like a nine-year-old, and already in the process of helping her father, Dahak, implement his plan to take over the world. Hope allies herself with Xena's enemy, Callisto. In revenge for Xena's attempt to kill her as a baby, Hope murders Xena's son, Solan. This forces Gabrielle to accept that Hope is indeed evil. She kills her daughter by giving her poison, an act that continues to haunt Gabrielle throughout the series. She holds herself responsible for Solan's death, as well as for betraying Xena a second time, even after reconciliation with Xena is effected through their musical journey in the Land of Illusia. When she once again encounters Hope, who was saved from the funeral pyre by her father, Gabrielle sacrifices herself to save Xena by jumping into a lava pit and taking Hope with her. Gabrielle mysteriously survives the fall, and is later reunited with Xena. It is later revealed that Ares saved Gabrielle, with plans to use her as a bargaining chip against Xena.\n\nAfter her first kill, and the traumatic events with Hope that followed it, Gabrielle temporarily embraces complete pacifism as an alternative to fighting by Xena's side. She and Xena travel barefoot on pilgrimage to India, where they encounter a series of false prophets and gurus, as well as a genuine healer and teacher, Eli. Eli claims to have found enlightenment and Gabrielle becomes interested in his philosophy of non-violence and inner peace, which he calls the Way of Love. Gabrielle attempts to follow Eli's way, and throws away her staff under his influence. However, when Xena is in the midst of a battle with the Romans in an effort to rescue Gabrielle, Eli, and a group of prisoners, Callisto, uses Xena's own chakram against her, breaking her back. Gabrielle chooses to fight to save Xena and even kills some of the soldiers herself. Before their crucifixion, Gabrielle tells Xena that she had chosen \"The Way of Friendship\".\n\nAfter being crucified, Gabrielle and Xena ascend into Heaven, but are soon ambushed by demons. The demons are able to take Gabrielle to Hell, where she comes face to face with the demonic form of Callisto. Xena and a group of Archangels are able to rescue Gabrielle from Hell before Gabrielle can fall to the darkness. She then learns that Xena has taken Callisto's place in Hell. She eventually forgives Callisto for the murder of Perdicas, and that act of forgiveness grants her the right to join the Archangels in battle. During her fight with the demon-Xena, they are restored to life by Eli.\n\nAt this time, Gabrielle accepts her new path as a warrior and acquires a pair of sai, which become her signature weapon thereafter. Xena's pregnancy, revealed shortly after the duo's return to life, further forces Gabrielle to fight and sometimes protect Xena. On two occasions, the god of war Ares, impressed by Gabrielle's new warrior skills, tries to recruit her to his side, but Gabrielle always resists.\n\nGabrielle and Xena sleep in an ice cave for 25 years after Ares places them there because he mistakenly believes they are dead. After waking up, Gabrielle discovers that her parents have been killed by the North African warlord Gurkhan, who has also kidnapped her niece, Sara, for his harem. Around this time, Gabrielle develops a close friendship with Joxer's eldest son Virgil, who shares many of her traits as a bard and warrior. Gabrielle struggles with the issue of seeking vengeance against Gurkhan. She is often troubled by her role as a warrior, particularly when she has to lead her Amazon tribe into a high-casualty battle against a superior army, led by the demigod Bellerophon, to rescue a fellow Amazon queen. Despite the success of the mission, Gabrielle tells Xena, \"With each battle, I lose more of myself\".\n\nThe series' final scene finds her on a ship headed to Egypt, where she intends to continue the fight for the Greater Good, with Xena accompanying her in spirit.\n\nGabrielle starts the series as a young girl who more or less stands behind Xena, and relies on Xena to protect her. In the course of 10 episodes, she acquires a fighting staff from the Greek Amazons and is a decent fighter with it shortly after. Another 10 episodes later, she displays immensely impressive skills with the staff, taking on numerous soldiers single-handedly, in the attempts to rescue Xena's presumably dead body. Probably what is most impressive, is that two episodes later she blocks an arrow in flight with her staff.\n\nAs time goes on, we see Gabrielle not only improve with her abilities with the staff, but as a total warrior as well. As she adds kicks, and minor acrobatics to her fighting, rolling over a hunched over opponent before proceeding to beat them.\n\nWhile in India, Gabrielle is also thrown through time by a Darsham to save Xena's soul. It is said that their souls are together throughout time. In this next life Xena is the Mother of Peace, Arminestra and Gabrielle is Shakti, a Warrior Prince of India. At the end of season 4, however, is when Gabrielle shows a leap in her warrior abilities. After months of following her path of the Way of Love, Gabrielle picks up the sword of a paralyzed Xena and fights off a large group Roman soldiers with incredible skill. This however sparked concern among fans, who wondered how Gabrielle knew how to use a sword so well. One theory that could make sense is that in her time as a complete non-violent person, Gabrielle as an experienced fighter, no longer had to focus on her fighting and instead watched as Xena fought. At that point, as a seasoned fighter, Gabrielle is able to grow in a dramatic way through observation.\n\nBy season 5, we see Gabrielle reach an undisputed status as a warrior, fighting with her sai, incorporating more acrobatic ability, even performing a wall run and back flip. Other than sai and sometimes a new casual staff, she can use a large array of weapons with proficiency. Gabrielle also fights against warriors with notable skill; she defeats the warrior Mavican and stands against Ares and Hades (two gods) in battle for a rather long period before they defeat her. She also fights in a sword duel with Brutus, Caesar's former right hand and one of leaders of Rome, eventually killing him. As previously mentioned, Gabrielle's abilities become noticed by the God of War who seeks her out as his new protégée. It is mentioned later by Gabrielle and numerous others that Xena trained her throughout the years, although there have only been a few episodes that actually show Xena giving her any sort of martial arts training. \nOne of Gabrielle's biggest fights of the season is her fight against fellow Amazon queen, Varia. They fight in an enclosed arena in a match in which Eve's life is at stake, and they appeared to be at a stand-off before she is beaten by Varia. Gabrielle takes the loss graciously and continues to grow in skill over the season, regaining the title of supreme Amazon queen very soon.\n\nGabrielle's bardic skills appear to be natural and self-taught. In the opening episode, she displays a remarkable ability to talk her way out of fearsome or difficult situations: she talks a cyclops out of eating her, and makes an ally of him; talks an old man into giving her a lift; talks a violent crowd out of killing Xena; and talks her way into joining Xena as her traveling partner.\n\nBesides her persuasive ability, she also reads and writes - rare skills for that time, loves to tell stories, and has some musical ability. As she travels with Xena, she records their adventures on a series of scrolls, with an eye for flair and drama. Occasionally her tendency to exaggerate and glamorize the facts gets her into trouble. She is also shown telling stories for money in an inn. In other episodes she wins a place in the Athens City Academy for the Performing Bards, is a famous playwright, is a theatrical director, plays the pan pipes with considerable skill, and is the only person able to recite a magical scroll with the correct accents.\n\nDespite Gabrielle's ascendancy as a warrior, her role as a bard remains important. About a year into her travels with Xena, her scrolls about Xena's exploits begin to gain popularity, apparently helping, according to Ares, turn Xena into a legend. After their 25-year sleep, Gabrielle finds out that her stories had been read as far away as North Africa where they were popular among nomad tribes.\n\nAccording to an episode set in modern times, Gabrielle's scrolls were preserved for thousands of years and later discovered by modern archeologists. They found their way to Hollywood, where they formed the basis of the television series.\n\nThroughout the course of the series, Gabrielle has a total of 7 regular costumes which become smaller, more conducive to her fighting style as the show progresses and more showing what the fans call \"Fab Gab Abs\" (Fabulous Gabrielle's Abdominals).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with Xena, occasionally, Gabrielle is known to be credited with a variety of discoveries and inventions.\n\n\nIn September 10, 2005, a month after Eris' discovery, its moon was discovered by the adaptive optics team at the Keck telescopes in Hawaii, who was carrying out observations of the four brightest Kuiper belt objects. In addition to its provisional designation , its discoverers (among them Michael E. Brown), informally nicknamed it \"Gabrielle\", while Eris was nicknamed \"Xena\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=122576", "text": "The Fox and the Hound\n\nThe Fox and the Hound is a 1981 American animated buddy drama movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Daniel P. Mannix. It is the 24th Disney animated movie. The movie tells the story of two unlikely friends, a red fox named Tod and a hound dog named Copper. They struggle to preserve their friendship, despite their emerging instincts and the people around them demanding them to be enemies. Directed by Ted Berman, Richard Rich, and Art Stevens, the movie features the voices of Mickey Rooney, Kurt Russell, Pearl Bailey, Jack Albertson, Sandy Duncan, Jeanette Nolan, Pat Buttram, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Dick Bakalyan, Paul Winchell, Keith Mitchell, and Corey Feldman.\n\n\"The Fox and the Hound\" was released to theaters on July 10, 1981 to financial success. At the time of release it was the most expensive animated movie produced to date, costing $12 million. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1988. A direct-to-video followup, \"The Fox and the Hound 2\", was released to DVD on December 12, 2006.\n\nA young red fox is orphaned. Big Mama the owl, Boomer the woodpecker, and Dinky the finch arrange for him to be adopted by a kindly farmer named Widow Tweed. Tweed names him Tod, since he reminds her of a toddler. Meanwhile, her neighbor, a hunter named Amos Slade, brings home a young hound puppy named Copper and introduces him to his hunting dog Chief. Tod and Copper become playmates and promise to remain \"friends forever\". Slade becomes frustrated with Copper for frequently wandering off to play and puts him on a leash. While playing with Copper at his home, Tod awakens Chief. Slade and Chief chase him until they are confronted by Tweed. After a violent argument, Slade threatens to kill Tod if he trespasses on his farm again. Hunting season comes and Slade takes his dogs into the wilderness for the interim. Meanwhile, Big Mama, Dinky and Boomer attempt to explain to Tod that his friendship with Copper can no longer continue, as they are natural enemies, but Tod naively refuses to believe them, hoping that he and Copper will remain friends forever.\n\nAs months pass, Tod and Copper both reach adulthood. Copper has become an experienced hunting dog, while Tod has grown up into a strong handsome fox. On the night of Copper's return, Tod sneaks over to visit him. Copper explains that while he still values Tod as a friend, he is now a hunting dog and things are different. Their conversation awakens Chief, who alerts Slade. In the chase that follows Copper catches Tod. Copper lets the fox go and distracts Chief and Slade. Tod tries escaping on a railroad track, but is caught and chased by Chief as a train suddenly passes by them. Tod ducks under the train, but Chief is struck by the train and falls into a river below, breaking his leg. Angered by this, Copper and Slade blame Tod for the accident and swear vengeance. Tweed, realizing that Tod is no longer safe with her, takes him on a drive and leaves him at a game preserve.\n\nTod's first night alone in the woods proves disastrous, accidentally entering a grumpy badger's den. Thankfully, a friendly porcupine offers Tod shelter. That same night, Slade and Copper plan revenge on Tod. The next morning, Big Mama finds Tod and introduces him to a female fox named Vixey. Wanting to impress her, Tod tries to catch a fish, but fails due to not having survival skills. Vixey and the other animals laugh at him, but Big Mama directs Tod to be himself. The two foxes reconcile and Vixey helps Tod adapt to life in the forest.\n\nMeanwhile, Slade and Copper trespass into the preserve to hunt Tod. As Tod manages to escape Slade's leghold traps, Copper and Slade chase both foxes. They hide in their burrow while Slade tries trapping them by setting fire to the other end of the burrow. The foxes barely escape without getting burned as Slade and Copper chase them up the top of a hill until they reach a waterfall. There, Slade and Copper close in for the kill, but a large bear suddenly emerges and attacks Slade, who then falls and steps into one of his own traps, dropping his gun slightly out of reach. Copper tries fighting the bear but is no match for it. Not willing to let his old friend die, Tod intervenes and fights off the bear until they both fall down the waterfall.\n\nWith the bear gone, a bewildered Copper approaches Tod as he lies exhausted near the bank of a waterfall-created lake. When Slade appears, Copper positions himself in front of Tod to prevent Slade from shooting him, refusing to move away. Slade lowers his gun and leaves with Copper. The former friends share one last smile before parting. At home, Tweed nurses Slade back to health while the dogs rest. Copper, before resting, smiles as he remembers the day when he first met Tod. On a hill, Vixey joins Tod as they look down on the homes of Slade and Tweed.\n\n\nWolfgang Reitherman read the original novel. He found it particularly touching because one of his sons owned a pet fox years before. He decided it would make for a good animated movie. Production of the movie began in spring 1977. Reitherman, Art Stevens, and Ron Miller fought over major parts of the movie with Miller supporting the younger Stevens. Miller told Reitherman to give up the junior personnel, but Reitherman did not because of a lack of trust in the young animators. Thinking the movie had a weak second act, Reitherman decided to add a musical sequence of two swooping cranes voiced by Phil Harris and Charo. They would sing a silly song titled \"Scoobie-Doobie Doobie Doo, Let Your Body Turn Goo\". Live-action reference footage was shot of Charo in a sweaty pink leotard, but the scene was strongly disliked by studio personnel. They thought the song was a distraction from the main plot. Stevens said \"We can't let that sequence in the movie! It's totally out of place!\" Stevens notified studio management and after many story conferences, the scene was removed. Reitherman later walked into Stevens's office, slumped in a chair, and said, \"I dunno, Art, maybe this is a young man’s medium.\" He later moved onto to undeveloped projects such as \"Catfish Bend\" and died in a car accident in 1985.\n\nBy late 1978, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Cliff Nordberg had completed their animation. Thomas had animated scenes of Tod and Cooper using dialogue Larry Clemmons had written and recorded with the child actors. This project would mark the last movie to have the involvement of the Disney's Nine Old Men. They had retired early during production. Animation was turned over the next generation of directors and animators, which included John Lasseter, John Musker, Ron Clements, Glen Keane, Tim Burton, Brad Bird, Henry Selick, Chris Buck, and Mark Dindal, all of whom would finalize the animation and complete the movie's production. These animators had moved through the in-house animation training program. They would play an important role in the Disney Renaissance of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nHowever, the transition between the old guard and the new resulted in arguments over how to handle the movie. Reitherman had his own ideas on the designs and layouts that should be used, but the newer team backed Stevens. Animator Don Bluth animated several scenes including of Widow Tweed milking her cow, Abigail, while his team worked on the rest of the sequence, and when Tweed fires at Amos Slade's automobile. Nevertheless, he declared Disney's work \"stale\" and on his 42nd birthday, September 13, 1979, Bluth, along with Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy, entered Ron Miller's office and turned in their resignation. Following their resignations, 13 animators followed suit in their resignations. Though Bluth and his team had animated substantial scenes, they asked not to receive screen credit. With 17% of the animators now gone, Miller ordered all of the resigning animators off the studio lot by noon of that same day. He would later push the release of \"The Fox and the Hound\" from Christmas 1980 to summer 1981. New animators were hired and promoted to fill the ranks. To make up for the lack of experience of the new animators, much of the quality control would rely upon a corp of veteran assistant animators. Four years after production started, the movie was finished with approximately 360,000 drawings, 110,000 painted cels and 1,100 painted backgrounds making up the finished product. A total of 180 people, including 24 animators, worked on the movie.\n\nIn an earlier version of the movie, Chief was supposed to die the same as in the novel. However, the scene was changed to have Chief survive with a cast on his back paw. Animator Ron Clements, who had briefly transitioned into the story department, protested that \"Chief has to die. The picture doesn't work if he just breaks his leg. Copper doesn't have motivation to hate the fox.\" Likewise, younger members of the story team pleaded with Stevens to have Chief killed. Stevens countered that \"Geez, we never killed a main character in a Disney film and we're not starting now!\" The younger crew members took the problem to upper management who would also back Stevens. Ollie Johnston's test animation of Chief stomping around the house with his leg in a cast was eventually kept, and Randy Cartwright re-animated the scene where Copper finds Chief's body and had him animate Chief's eyes opening and closing so the audience knew that he was not dead.\n\nEarly into production, the main characters such as young Tod and Copper, Big Mama, and Amos Slade had already been cast. The supporting characters were cast by Disney voice regulars including Pat Buttram for Chief, Paul Winchell for Boomer, and Mickey Rooney for adult Tod who had just finished filming \"Pete's Dragon\". Jeanette Nolan was the second choice for Widow Tweed after Helen Hayes turned down the part. The last role to be cast was for adult Cooper. Jackie Cooper had auditioned for the role, but left the project when he demanded more money than the studio was willing to pay. While filming the \"Elvis\" television movie, former Disney child actor Kurt Russell was cast following a reading that had impressed the moviemakers, and completed his dialogue in two recording sessions.\n\nThe soundtrack album for the movie was released in 1981 by Walt Disney Records. It contains songs written by Stan Fidel, Jim Stafford, and Jeffrey Patch.\n\n\"The Fox and the Hound\" was first released on VHS on March 4, 1994 as the last video of the \"Walt Disney Classics\" collection (it was not included in the \"Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection\"). On May 2, 2000, it was released to Region 1 DVD for the first time under the \"Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection\". A 25th anniversary special edition DVD was released on October 10, 2006.\n\n\"The Fox and the Hound\" was released on Blu-ray Disc on August 9, 2011 for the movie's 30th anniversary. The movie was released in a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack alongside its direct-to video followup \"The Fox and the Hound 2\" in a 2-movie Collection Edition. Featuring a new digital restoration, the Blu-ray transfer presents the movie for the first time in 1.66:1 widescreen and also features 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. \"The Fox and the Hound 2\" is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and features the same sound as the first movie. A DVD-only edition was also released on the same day.\n\nIn \"The Animated Movie Guide\", Jerry Beck considered the movie \"average\", though he praises the voice work of Pearl Bailey as Big Mama, and the extreme dedication to detail shown by animator Glen Keane in making the fight scene between Copper, Tod, and the bear. In \"The Disney Films\", Leonard Maltin also notes that the fight scene between Copper, Tod, and the bear received great praise in the animation world. Maltin thought the movie relied too much on \"formula cuteness, formula comedy relief, and even formula characterizations\". Overall, he considered the movie \"charming\" saying that it is \"warm, and brimming with personable characters\" and that it \"approaches the old Disney magic at times.\"\n\nCraig Butler from \"All Movie Guide\" said that the movie was a \"warm and amusing, if slightly dull, entry in the Disney animated canon.\" He also called it \"conventional and generally predictable\" with problems in pacing. However, he praised the movie's climax and animation, as well as the ending. His final remark is that \"Two of the directors, Richard Rich and Ted Berman, would next direct \"The Black Cauldron\", a less successful but more ambitious project.\" Richard Corliss of \"Time\", praised the movie for an intelligent story about prejudice. He argued that the movie shows that biased attitudes can poison even the deepest relationships, and the movie's bittersweet ending delivers a powerful and important moral message to audiences.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Times\" also praised the movie, saying that \"for all of its familiar qualities, this movie marks something of a departure for the Disney studio, and its movement is in an interesting direction. \"The Fox and the Hound\" is one of those relatively rare Disney animated features that contains a useful lesson for its younger audiences. It's not just cute animals and frightening adventures and a happy ending; it's also a rather thoughtful meditation on how society determines our behavior.\" \"TV Guide\" gave the movie four out of five stars, saying that \"The animation here is better than average (veteran Disney animators Wolfgang Reitherman and Art Stevens supervised the talents of a new crop of artists that developed during a 10-year program at the studio), though not quite up to the quality of Disney Studios in its heyday. Still, this film has a lot of \"heart\" and is wonderful entertainment for both kids and their parents. Listen for a number of favorites among the voices.\"\n\nMichael Scheinfeld of Common Sense Media gave the movie's quality a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, saying that the movie \"develops into a thoughtful examination of friendship and includes some mature themes, especially loss.\"\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes said that the movie received a 69% approval rating with an average rating of 6.6/10 based on 26 reviews. The website's consensus states that \"\"The Fox and the Hound\" is a likeable, charming, unassuming effort that manages to transcend its thin, predictable plot\".\n\nIn its original release, \"The Fox and the Hound\" grossed $39.9 million in domestic grosses. Its distributor rentals were reported to be $14.2 million while its international rentals grossed $43 million. The movie was re-released theatrically on March 25, 1988, where it grossed $23.5 million. \"The Fox and the Hound\" has had a lifetime gross of $63.5 million across its original release and reissue.\n\nThe movie was awarded a Golden Screen Award () in 1982. In the same year, it was also nominated for a Young Artist Award and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film.\n\nAs well as adaptations of the movie itself, comic strips featuring the characters also appeared in stories unconnected to the movie. Examples include \"The Lost Fawn\", in which Copper uses his sense of smell to help Tod find a fawn who has gone astray; \"The Chase\", in which Copper must safeguard a sleepwalking Chief; and \"Feathered Friends\", in which the birds Dinky and Boomer have to go to desperate lengths to save one of Widow Tweed's chickens from a wolf.\n\nA comic adaptation of the movie, drawn by Richard Moore, was published in newspapers as part of \"Disney's Treasury of Classic Tales\". A comic-book titled \"The Fox and the Hound\" followed, with new adventures of the characters. Since 1981 and up to 2007, a few \"Fox and the Hound\" Disney comics stories were produced in Italy, Netherlands, Brazil, France, and the United States.\n\nA direct-to-video followup, \"The Fox and the Hound 2\", was released to DVD on December 12, 2006. The followup takes place during Tod and Copper's childhood, before the events of the later half of the first movie.\n\n\n", "id": "122576", "title": "The Fox and the Hound"}

It first appeared in trial transcripts during the inquisition of the Knights Templar in the early 1300s. Some modern scholars believe the name to have been an Old French corruption and misspelling of the name Mahomet (Muhammad). Nowadays it is generally viewed as a symbol of the Devil.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Templar were accused of heresy, such as denying Jesus Christ and spitting on the cross. They also supposedly worshiped an icon called \"Bafomet\". Beyond this, little is known about the origins of the Baphomet.\n\nIn the 1800s, magician Eliphas Levi interpreted Baphomet as an occult symbol representing perfection, or the union of opposites to create divine harmony. To illustrate his point, he depicted the entity as a goat-headed androgyne with wings, female breasts, a rod between its legs, and a flaming torch between its horns.\n\nThis imagery was soon used by people who thought it was Satanic- notably in anti-Freemasonry tracts, where some writers accused Masons of worshiping the devil. Many evangelical Christians still believe masonry to be of the devil.\n\nIn modern times, Baphomet has been adapted as a symbol by occultists and Satanists. A related symbol (also drawn by Levi) is the Sigil of Baphomet, which is a goat's head drawn inside a five-pointed star. It has become a common icon among heavy metal bands like Slayer and Venom. The Sigil of Baphomet is also the official logo of the Church of Satan.\n\n", "id": "122637", "title": "Baphomet"}

Two outdoor areas for the butchering of mammoths, used by the Cro-Magnon Neanderthal people, have been discovered. \n\nSeveral Neolithic populations lived on the site. In particular, Chalcolithic people buried their dead in burial caves like Grotte des Enfants and Hole Roland, as well as under mounds, such as that of Greenhouse Aurouze. \n\nA Gallic oppidum, a pre-Roman town protected with a fort, was a feature on the massive Malpas and along the Rhone, the site of the Brégoule . This was the home of the tribe Segovellaunes who worshipped the goddess Soïo, and who gave the village its name. \n\nDuring the Roman period, the Romans built a town on the site of the existing village. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, Soyons became a principality, with a royal abbey and a Carolingian church.

The organization lasted for two centuries in the Middle Ages. It was founded after the First Crusade of 1096, with its original purpose to ensure the safety of the many Christians who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem after it was taken over.\n\nIt was officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129, and became a favored charity by many Christians and grew fast in membership and power. Templar knights wore white mantles quartered by a red cross and were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. Those members of the Order that did not fight managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom, innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking, and building many fortifications throughout the Mediterranean and the Holy Land.\n\nThe Templars' success was tied closely to the Crusades; when the Holy Land was lost, support for the Order faded. Rumors about the Templars' secret initiation ceremony created mistrust, and King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Order, began pressuring Pope Clement V to take action against the Order. In 1307, many of the Order's members in France were arrested, tortured into giving false confessions, and then burned at the stake. In 1312, Pope Clement, under continuing pressure from King Philip, disbanded the Order.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "122678", "title": "Knights Templar"}

He sang several roles in Mozart's operas, and gradually learned roles in many other operas, including Verdi's \"Rigoletto\" and \"Don Carlo\". There is an excellent recording of Mozart's \"Magic Flute\" in which Wunderlich sings the part of the Prince Tamino and the famous baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sings the part of Papageno, the birdcatcher.\n\nWunderlich had a lovely, clear voice which was excellent for German Lieder.

The book tells the story of two sisters Olanna and Kainene during the Biafran War.\n\n\"Half of a Yellow Sun\" won the 2007 Orange Prize for Fiction in the women-only section. The award is given annually for the best original full-length book; Adichie gained £30,000 as a reward for winning the prize. \"Purple Hibiscus\", her first novel, made the Orange Prize shortlist in 2004, and because of the success of \"Half a Yellow Sun\", critics have said that Adichie may have even more success in the future.\n\nThe book got good reviews from critics, and it was included in \"The New York Times\"' 100 Most Notable Books of the Year, as well as winning the Orange Prize. In a review for \"The Seattle Times\", Mary Brennan talks about the book as \"A sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative\". \"The Guardian's\" Kate Kellaway said \"An immense achievement, \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" has a ramshackle freedom and exuberant ambition,\" after reading the book. \"The New York Times\" did a review of the book, saying some good and some bad things about the book.\n\nThe Nigerian Civil War began on July 6, 1967 and lasted until January 15, 1970. The war began because of political struggles caused by the numerous attempts to secede from the southeastern provinces of Nigeria and create the Republic of Biafra. Political conflict between the Igbo’s, Yoruba’s, and the Hausa-Fulani ended up with two military coups. The Igbo tried to leave Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra, but did not have very much support. From 1968 onward, the war was mostly a tie, with Nigerian forces unable to get an advantage over the Republic of Biafra. Many people died in the war, and even today there is still anger between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria.\n\nThe story in \"Half of a Yellow Sun\" is centered around the war. The author has stated that many of the issues that caused the war remain today. She also said that the war is very talked about \"in uninformed and unimaginative ways,\" and that the war is as important to the people today as it was in her book. Because none of the major political events were changed in the book, Adichie said that the book had \"emotional truth,\" and that the book showed the war had a large impact on the people of Nigeria.\n", "id": "122871", "title": "Half of a Yellow Sun"}

It is meant to be a practical education which develops mental capacity. It was designed in the late medieval period (12th/13th centuries) using ideas from Ancient Greek and Roman culture. The students were meant to be young gentlemen, that is, from respectable and important families. In modern times, liberal arts colleges educate both sexes, and a wider range of people.\n\nThe seven liberal arts were taught in two groups: the \"trivium\" and the \"quadrivium\" :\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the liberal arts were central to university education. The \"quadrivium\" followed the preparatory work of the \"trivium\".\n\nThe area and range of the liberal arts evolved in time. Originally, most of the teaching, and all of the text-books, would have been in Latin, the language the students would have learnt at school before they came to college. In the beginning the courses were aimed at educating the elite in the classical works. Eventually, the meaning of \"liberal arts\" got extended to include both humanities and science. But even today, practical activities as agriculture, business, engineering, pedagogy or pharmacy are excluded from the liberal arts. The liberal professions include only professions which require education at university, mainly law and medicine.\n\nThe trivium (Latin for \"three ways\"), included the literary disciplines:\n\n\nThe quadrivium (Latin for \"four ways\"), included the disciplines connected with mathematics. They were:\n\n\nLiberal arts colleges are a modern re-interpretation of the old idea. Mostly in the United States, these colleges concentrate on good teaching, and are closer to the Oxford & Cambridge type of tuition than most universities. They are mostly or entirely fee-paying institutions, and so continue to offer an elite education to students from prosperous families. The courses are mostly or entirely undergraduate courses.\n\n", "id": "122998", "title": "Liberal arts"}

Brain cells are damaged, which often affects one's brain in a way that stops the brain from thinking or reacting the same way as it did before the brain was damaged.\n\nPhysical damage to the brain is called traumatic brain injury (TBI). It has occurred since ancient times, and old medical records exist.\n\nHead injuries and their effects were known in ancient times. \n\nAncient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550 BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain to be the center of thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.\n\nPerhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage. He survived an accident in 1848 when a large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying at least his left frontal lobe. \n\nHe recovered with no apparent sensory, movement, or big cognitive damage. However, his behaviour so altered that friends described him as \"no longer being Gage\". This suggested that the damaged areas are involved in \"higher functions\" such as personality. Many cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.\n\nIn the 1970s, awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew. A great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research, such as the discovery of primary and secondary brain injury. The 1990s saw the development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of TBI, with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure. Research since the early 1990s has improved TBI survival. That decade was called the \"Decade of the Brain\" for advances made in brain research.\n\n", "id": "123014", "title": "Brain damage"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123020", "text": "Assembly language\n\nAn assembly language is a programming language that can be used to directly tell the computer what to do. An assembly language is almost exactly like the machine language that a computer can understand, except that it uses words in place of numbers. A computer cannot really understand an assembly program directly. However, it can easily change the program into machine code by replacing the words of the program with the numbers that they stand for. A program that does that is called an assembler. \n\nPrograms written in assembly language are usually made of \"instructions\", which are small tasks that the computer performs when it is running the program. They are called instructions because the programmer uses them to instruct the computer what to do. The part of the computer that follows the instructions is the processor.\n\nThe assembly language of a computer is a low-level language, which means that it can only be used to do the simple tasks that a computer can understand directly. In order to perform more complex tasks, one must tell the computer each of the simple tasks that are part of the complex task. For example, a computer does not understand how to print a sentence on its screen. Instead, a program written in assembly must tell it how to do all of the small steps that are involved in printing the sentence. \n\nSuch an assembly program would be composed of many, many instructions, that together do something that seems very simple and basic to a human. This makes it hard for humans to read an assembly program. In contrast, a high-level programming language may have a single instruction such as PRINT \"\"This is a sentence\"\" that will tell the computer to perform all of the small tasks for you.\n\nWhen computer scientists first built programmable machines, they programmed them directly in machine code, which is a series of numbers that instructed the computer what to do. Writing machine language was very hard to do and took a long time, so eventually assembly language was made. Assembly language is easier for a human to read and can be written faster, but it is still much harder for a human to use than a high-level programming language which tries to mimic human language.\n\nTo program in machine code, the programmer needs to know what each instruction looks like in binary (or hexadecimal). Although it is easy for a computer to quickly figure out what machine code means, it is hard for a programmer. Each instruction can have several forms, all of which just look like a bunch of numbers to people. Any mistake that someone makes while writing machine code will only be noticed when the computer does the wrong thing. Figuring out the mistake is hard because most people cannot tell what machine code means by looking at it.\nAn example of what machine code looks like:\n\n05 2A 00\n\nThis hexadecimal machine code tells an x86 computer processor to add 42 to the accumulator. It is very difficult for a person to read and understand it even if that person knows machine code. \n\nWith assembly language, each instruction can be written as a short word, called a \"mnemonic\", followed by other things like numbers or other short words. The mnemonic is used so that the programmer does not have to remember the exact numbers in machine code needed to tell the computer to do something. Examples of mnemonics in assembly language include \"add\", which adds data, and \"mov\", which moves data from one place to another. Because 'mnemonic' is an uncommon word, the phrase \"instruction type\" or just \"instruction\" is sometimes used instead, often incorrectly. The words and numbers after the first word give more information about what to do. For instance, things following an \"add\" might be what two things to add together and the things following \"mov\" say what to move and where to put it.\n\nFor example, the machine code in the previous section (05 2A 00) can be written in assembly as:\nAssembly language also allows programmers to write the actual data the program uses in easier ways. Most assembly languages have support for easily making numbers and text. In machine code, each different type of number like positive, negative or decimal, would have to be manually converted into binary and text would have to be defined one letter at a time, as numbers.\n\nAssembly language provides what is called an abstraction of machine code. When using assembly, programmers do not need to know the details of what numbers mean to the computer, the assembler figures that out instead. Assembly language actually still lets the programmer use all the features of the processor that they could with machine code. In this sense, assembly language has a very good, rare trait: it has the same ability to express things as the thing it is abstracting (machine code) while being much easier to use. Because of this, machine code is almost never used as a programming language.\n\nWhen programs are finished, they have already been transformed into machine code so that the processor can actually run them. Sometimes, however, if the program has a bug (mistake) in it, programmers will want to be able to tell what each part of the machine code is doing. Disassemblers are programs that help programmers do that by transforming the machine code of the program back into assembly language, which is much easier to understand. Disassemblers, which turn machine code into assembly language, do the opposite of assemblers, which turn assembly language into machine code.\n\nAn understanding of how computers are organized, how they seem to work at a very low level, is needed to understand how an assembly language program works. At the most simplistic level, computers have three main parts: \n\n\nIn most computers, memory is divided up into bytes. Each byte contains 8 bits. Each byte in memory also has an \"address\" which is a number that says where the byte is in memory. The first byte in memory has an address of 0, the next one has an address of 1, and so on. Dividing memory into bytes makes it \"byte addressable\" because each byte gets a unique address. Addresses of byte memories cannot be used to refer to a single bit of a byte. A byte is the smallest piece of memory that can be addressed.\n\nEven though an address refers to a particular byte in memory, processors allow for using several bytes of memory in a row. The most common use of this feature is to use either 2 or 4 bytes in a row to represent a number, usually an integer. Single bytes are sometimes also used to represent integers, but because they are only 8 bits long, they can only hold 2 or 256 different possible values. Using 2 or 4 bytes in a row raises the number of different possible values to be 2, 65536 or 2, 4294967296, respectively. \n\nWhen a program uses a byte or a number of bytes in a row to represent something like a letter, number, or anything else, those bytes are called an \"object\" because they are all part of the same thing. Even though objects are all stored in identical bytes of memory, they are treated as though they have a 'type', which says how the bytes should be understood: either as an integer or a character or some other type (like a non-integer number). Machine code can also be thought of as a type that is interpreted as instructions. The notion of a type is very, very important because it defines what things can and can’t be done to the object and how to interpret the bytes of the object. For instance, it is not valid to store a negative number in a positive number object and it is not valid to store a fraction in an integer.\n\nAn address that points to (is the address of) a multi-byte object is the address to the first byte of that object – the byte that has the lowest address. As an aside, one important thing to note is that you can’t tell what the type of an object is - or even its size - by its address. In fact, you can’t even tell what type an object is by looking at it. An assembly language program needs to keep track of which memory addresses hold which objects, and how big those objects are. A program that does so is \"type safe\" because it only does things to objects that are safe to do on their type. A program that doesn’t will probably not work properly. Note that most programs do not actually explicitly store what the type of an object is, they just access objects consistently - the same object is always treated as the same type.\n\nThe processor runs (executes) instructions, which are stored as machine code in main memory. As well as being able to access memory for storage, most processors have a few small, fast, fixed-size spaces for holding objects that are currently being worked with. These spaces are called \"registers\". Processors usually execute three types of instructions, although some instructions can be a combination of these types. Below are some examples of each type in x86 assembly language.\n\nThe following x86 assembly language instruction reads (loads) a 2-byte object from the byte at address 4096 (0x1000 in hexadecimal) into a 16-bit register called 'ax':\n\nIn this assembly language, square brackets around a number (or a register name) mean that the number should be used as an address to the data that should be used. The use of an address to point to data is called indirection. In this next example, without the square brackets, another register, bx, actually gets the value 20 loaded into it.\nBecause no indirection was used, the actual value itself was put into the register. \n\nIf the operands (the things that come after the mnemonic), appear in the reverse order, an instruction that loads something from memory instead writes it to memory:\nHere, the memory at address 1000h gets the value of ax. If this example is executed right after the previous one, the 2 bytes at 1000h and 1001h will be a 2 byte integer with the value of 20.\n\nSome instructions do things like subtraction or logical operations like \"not\":\n\nThe machine code example earlier in this article would be this in assembly language:\n\nHere, 42 and ax are added together and the result is stored back in ax. In x86 assembly it is also possible to combine a memory access and mathematical operation like this:\nThis instruction adds the value of the 2 byte integer stored at 1000h to ax and stores the answer in ax.\nThis instruction computes the or of the contents of the registers ax and bx and stores the result back into ax.\n\nUsually, instructions are executed in the order they appear in memory, which is the order they are typed in the assembly code. The processor just executes them one after another. However, in order for processors to do complicated things, they need to execute different instructions based on what the data they were given is. The ability of processors to execute different instructions depending on something's outcome is called \"branching\". Instructions that decide what the next instruction should be are called \"branch instructions\".\n\nIn this example, suppose someone wants to calculate the amount of paint they will need to paint a square with a certain side length. However, due to economy of scale the paint store will not sell them any less than amount of paint needed to paint a 100 x 100 square.\n\nTo figure out the amount of paint they will need to get based on the length of the square they want to paint, they come up with this set of steps:\n\n\nThat algorithm can be expressed in the following code where ax is the side length.\n\nThis example introduces several new things, but the first two instructions are familiar. They copy the value of ax into bx and then subtract 100 from bx. \n\nOne of the new things in this example is called a label, a concept found in assembly languages in general. Labels can be anything the programmer wants (unless it is the name of an instruction, which would confuse the assembler). In this example, the label is 'continue'. It is interpreted by the assembler as the address of an instruction. In this case, it is the address of mult ax. \n\nAnother new concept is that of flags. On x86 processors, many instructions set 'flags' in the processor that can be used by the next instruction to decide what to do. In this case, if bx was less than 100, sub will set a flag that says the result was less than zero.\n\nThe next instruction is jge which is short for 'Jump if Greater than or Equal to'. It is a branch instruction. If the flags in the processor specify that the result was greater than or equal to zero, instead of just going to the next instruction the processor will jump to the instruction at the continue label, which is mul ax.\n\nThis example works fine, but it is not what most programmers would write. The subtract instruction set the flag correctly, but it also changes the value it operates on, which required the ax to be copied into bx. Most assembly languages allow for comparison instruction that do not change any of the arguments they are passed, but still set the flags properly and x86 assembly is no exception.\n\nNow, instead of subtracting 100 from ax, seeing if that number is less than zero, and assigning it back to ax, ax is left unchanged. The flags are still set the same way, and the jump is still taken in the same situations.\n\nWhile input and output are a fundamental part of computing, there is no one way they are done in assembly language. This is because the way I/O works depends on the set up of the computer and the operating system its running, not just what kind of processor it has. In the example section the Hello World example uses MS-DOS operating system calls and the example after it uses BIOS calls.\n\nIt is possible to do I/O in assembly language. Indeed, assembly language can generally express anything that a computer is capable of doing. However, even though there are instructions to add and branch in assembly language that will always do the same thing there are no instructions in assembly language that always do I/O.\n\nThe important thing to note is that the way that I/O works is not part of any assembly language because it is not part of how the processor works.\n\nEven though assembly language is not directly run by the processor - machine code is, it still has a lot to do with it. Each processor family supports different features, instructions, rules for what the instructions can do, and rules for what combination of instructions are allowed where. Because of this, different types of processors still need different assembly languages.\n\nBecause each version of assembly language is tied to a processor family, it lacks something called \"portability\". Something that has portability or is portable can be easily transferred from one type of computer to another. While other types of programming languages are portable, assembly language, in general, is not.\n\nAlthough assembly language allows for an easy way to use all the processor's features, it is not used for modern software projects for several reasons:\n\n\nAs a result of these drawbacks, high-level languages like Pascal, C, and C++ are used for most projects instead. They allow programmers to express their ideas more directly instead of having to worry about telling the processor what to do every step of the way. They're called high-level because the ideas the programmer can express in the same amount code are more complicated.\n\nProgrammers writing code in compiled high level languages use a program called a compiler to transform their code into assembly language. Compilers are much harder to write than assemblers are. Also, high-level languages do not always allow programmers to use all the features of the processor. This is because high-level languages are designed to support all processor families. Unlike assembly languages, that only support one type of processor, high-level languages are portable.\n\nEven though compilers are more complicated than assemblers, decades of making and researching compilers has made them very good. Now, there is not much reason to use assembly language anymore for most projects, because compilers can usually figure out how to express programs in assembly language as well or better than programmers.\n\nA Hello World Program written in x86 Assembly:\nA function that prints a number to the screen using BIOS interrupts written in NASM x86 assembly. Modular code is possible to write in assembly, but it takes extra effort. Note that anything that comes after a semicolon on a line is a comment and is ignored by the assembler. Putting comments in assembly language code is very important because large assembly language programs are so hard to understand.\n\n\n", "id": "123020", "title": "Assembly language"}

MSAs are used for official purposes.\n\nMSAs are made up of counties and for some county equivalents.

These are called New England City and Town Areas (NECTAs).\n\nMSAs are created around a central urban area —an areawhere there are a lot of people.

It was released on June 11, 1993, and got positive reviews.\n\nJohn Hammond, the owner of a scientific company, creates a theme park on an island that has dinosaurs which have been brought back to life by being cloned. He invites Dr. Alan Grant, a man who studies dinosaurs and doesn't work well with kids, and Dr. Ellie Sattler, a woman who studies ancient plants, to visit the park. \n\nAlong with a mathematician named Ian Malcolm and a lawyer named Donald Gennaro, they go to the park and see a few dinosaurs, like \"Brachiosaurus\". John says that the dinosaurs were brought back because of the dinosaur DNA found in some mosquitoes. To fix any broken parts of the DNA, they added the DNA of frogs to the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs were all made to be female so that they would not breed.\n\nLex and Tim Murphy, who are Hammond's grandkids, join the group. The group goes on a tour of the park in some Ford Explorer cars. A tropical storm heads towards the park, and it starts raining. Ellie is separated from the group when she tries to help a sick \"Triceratops\". Dennis Nedry, a worker at the park, betrays Hammond so he can get money from another company, and he turns off the park's safety systems. The cars that the group are in aren't able to move anymore. \n\nMany dinosaurs, including a \"T. rex\", break out of their pens. The \"T. rex\" eats Donald, hurts Ian, and pushes a car off a cliff. As Dennis tries to escape the park, he gets killed by a \"Dilophosaurus\". \n\nEllie, along with Robert Muldoon, a park worker, look for survivors. They rescue Malcolm and escape the \"T. rex\" in a Jeep. John, along with the park's main engineer named Ray Arnold, decide to reboot the park's systems. During the rebooting, the dangerous \"Velociraptors\" escape and start to wander the park. \n\nWhen Ray goes missing, Ellie goes to finish the rebooting process. She finds that Ray has been killed, and she runs away from one raptor. Two of the raptors show up, and they surprise and kill Robert. Meanwhile, Alan, Lex, and Tim, spend the night in a tall tree. They make friends with a \"Brachiosaurus\".\n\nThe next day, Alan, Lex, and Tim discover dinosaur eggs. At first, they are confused, since the dinosaurs are all female, and eggs can't be laid unless there is a male dinosaur involved. Alan figures out that the frog DNA in the dinosaur DNA allows the dinosaurs to change their genders. \n\nThey come across a group of running \"Gallimimus\", and they head towards an electric fence. When the park's power turns back on, Tim gets shocked by the fence and gets hurt. As Alan goes to look for Ellie, Lex and Tim are hunted by the raptors in a kitchen. They escape and meet up with Alan and Ellie. All four of them end up cornered by the raptors in the park's atrium, but the \"T. rex\" arrives and kills the raptors.\n\nJohn, Alan, Ellie, Ian, Lex, and Tim, all survive, and leave the park in a helicopter. John is disappointed that the park was unsuccessful, but Ellie is happy that Alan has learned to get along with kids.\n\nThe movie was based off a book by Michael Crichton. A few people wanted to be the director of the movie, like Tim Burton. Eventually, Steven Spielberg was chosen to direct.\n\nFilming the movie started in 1992 on Kaua'i, an island in Hawaii.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123168", "text": "Phallus\n\nThe word phallus refers to an erect penis, to a penis-shaped object such as a dildo, or to a mimetic image of an erect penis. \n\nAny object that symbolically resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus, or as being \"phallic\" (as in 'phallic symbol'). Such symbols represent the fertility associated with the male sexual organ, and the male orgasm.\n\nWhen an erect penis is shown in art, it is often called a phallus (). Erotic (sexually exciting) art has shown phalluses for a very long time. Pictures of men with erections appear on ancient objects and in paintings.\n\nThe erect penis was also a symbol or sign of health and fertility (the ability to give life). The Hohle Fels phallus was found in a cave in Germany. It is a piece of stone carved to look like a penis that is about 28,000 years old. \n\nFrom the fourth millennium B.C. (4000–3001 B.C.), Ancient Egyptians worshipped Min as the god of reproduction and the maker of all things. Min was shown in statues and on wall carvings as having an erect penis.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks believed in a god called \"Priapus\" who had a very large penis that was always erect. He was thought to protect livestock (animals kept by humans for food, milk, leather or wool), fruit plants and gardens, and men's sex organs. He was also seen as able to chase away evil, and as a protector of sailors, fishermen and others needing good luck. The oldest piece of writing about Priapus that is known is a comedy (a funny or silly play) written some time in the fourth century B.C. (400–301 B.C.). In Greek mythology, Priapus tried to attack a nymph (a female spirit) named Lotis who was sleeping so he could force her to have sex. However, a donkey brayed – it gave a loud cry. This made him lose his erection, and also woke Lotis up. To save Lotis, the gods turned her into a lotus plant. In the end, Priapus's lust – his strong desire to have sex – made him have an erection all the time, and his penis grew so large that he could not move. Although some temples were built for people to pray to Priapus, he was mostly worshipped in people's homes or gardens. Donkeys would sometimes be killed and offered to him, but gifts of fish, flowers, fruit and vegetables were also very common. Statues of Priapus were often placed at doorways and crossroads (places where two roads crossed). To make Priapus happy, people passing by would stroke the statue's penis.\n\nA Herma, or herm, is a sculpture with a head, and perhaps a torso, above a plain, usually squared lower section, on which male genitals may also be carved at the appropriate height. The form originated in Ancient Greece, and was adopted by the Romans, and revived at the Renaissance.\n\nIn ancient Greece the statues had an apotropaic function, and were placed at crossings and borders as protection. Hermes was a phallic god, associated with fertility, luck, roads and borders. His name comes from the word \"herma\". In Athens, they were placed outside houses for good luck and protection. They would be adorned with garlands or wreaths and anointed with olive oil to obtain luck.\n\nShiva, perhaps the most ancient of the Indian deities, and the third of the Hindu Trinity -- one of the most widely worshipped and edified deity in the Hindu pantheon, is worshipped often in the form of the lingam, or phallus. Evidence of phallic worship in the India date back to prehistoric times. Stone Lingams with several varieties of stylized \"heads\", or the glans, are found to this date in many of the old temples, and in museums in India and abroad. \n\nThe famous man-size lingam in the Parashurameshwar Temple in the Chitoor Distirct of the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh, better known as the Gudimallam Lingam, is about 1.5 metres in height, carved in polished black granite. Dated back to ca. 2300-2800 BC, it is one of the existing lingams from the pre-Buddhist period. The almost naturalistic giant lingam is distinguished by its prominent, bulbous head, and an anthropomorphic form of Shiva carved in high relief on the shaft. Shiva Lingams in India have tended to become more and more stylized over the centuries, and existing lingams from before the 6th century show a more leaning towards the naturalistic style, with the glans clearly indicated.\n\nToday, phalluses do not often appear in artworks or movies (except in pornographic movies which show people having sex with each other). This is because many people think that showing a man's penis when it is erect is obscene (not decent).\n\n", "id": "123168", "title": "Phallus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123223", "text": "Drosophila melanogaster\n\nDrosophila melanogaster is a small, common fly found near rotting fruit. It has been in use for over a century to study genetics and lends itself well to behavioral studies.\n\nThomas Hunt Morgan studied \"Drosophila\" early in the 1900s. He and his team were the first to discover sex-linkage and genetic recombination, which placed the small fly in the forefront of genetic research. \n\nDue to its small size, ease of culture and short generation time, geneticists have been using \"Drosophila\" ever since. It is one of the organisms whose entire genome is known, and many hundreds of genes have been identified and studied.\n\nFruit flies are easily obtained from the wild and most biological science companies carry a variety of different mutations. In addition these companies sell equipment to culture the flies. Costs are relatively low and most equipment can be used year after year. \n\nThe fly's vision is its most important sense organ. Approximately two thirds of the \"Drosophila\" brain is dedicated to visual processing. Although their ability to distinguish fine detail is worse than that of humans, their ability to time things (such as flight) is about ten times better.\n\nThe compound eye of the fruit fly contains 760 units or \"ommatidia\", and are one of the most advanced among insects. Each \"ommatidium\" contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1–8), support cells, pigment cells, and a cornea (lens). Wild-type flies have reddish pigment cells, which serve to absorb excess blue light so the fly is not blinded by ambient light.\n\nThe wings of a fly are capable of beating at up to 220 times per second. Flies fly via straight sequences of movement interspersed by rapid turns called \"saccades\". During these turns, a fly is able to rotate 90 degrees in fewer than 50 milliseconds.\n\nIt was long thought that the characteristics of \"Drosophila\" flight were dominated by the viscosity of the air, rather than the inertia of the fly body. However, research has shown that flies perform banked turns, where the fly accelerates, slows down while turning, and accelerates again at the end of the turn. This indicates that inertia is the dominant force, as is the case with larger flying animals.\n\nIn order to mate with a female fruit fly, the male fruit fly has to do a special courting dance. \n\nThe sexual intercourse usually lasts from about 15-20 minutes, in which several hundred relatively long sperm are released into the female’s body. The female then stores these sperm in her spermathecae, and then becomes pregnant. It only takes the female a few days to give birth to about five eggs.\n\nSome reports have the wing vibration earlier in the procedure. In any event, there are some differences between even closely related species.\n", "id": "123223", "title": "Drosophila melanogaster"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123330", "text": "Sarah Siddons\n\nSarah Siddons (5 July 1755 – 8 June 1831) was a Welsh actress. She was the best-known actress who played tragedies of the 18th century. She was the older sister of John Philip Kemble, Charles Kemble, Stephen Kemble, Ann Hatton and Elizabeth Whitlock. She is very famous for the way she played the Shakespearean character Lady Macbeth. She grew to liking the character Lady Macbeth very much.\n\nShe was born Sarah Kemble in Brecon, Brecknockshire, Wales. She was the oldest daughter of Roger Kemble, an actor and manager. He travelled around with his company, which included most members of his family, and Sarah \"Sally\" Ward.\n\nActing was only just becoming a respectable profession for a woman. At first, her parents did not like the fact that she had chosen to become an actress.\n\nIn 1774, Siddons had her first success as \"Belvidera\" in Thomas Otway's \"Venice Preserved\". Because of this role, David Garrick noticed her. Garrick later sent someone to see her act as Calista in Thomas Rowe's \"Fair Penitent\". After this, she was engaged to appear at Drury Lane. She was inexperienced. Because of this, and other factors, her first appearances as Portia in the play \"The Merchant of Venice\" and in other parts were not well received. She received a note from the manager of Drury Lane saying that her services would not be required. She was, in her own words :\n\nIn 1777, she went to play in the provinces. For the next six years she worked in provincial companies, in particular those in York and Bath. Her fame grew. Her next Drury Lane appearance on 10 October 1782 was very different. She was an immediate sensation playing the title role in Garrick's adaptation of a play by Thomas Southerne, \"Isabella, or, The Fatal Marriage\".\n\nHer most famous role was that of \"Lady Macbeth\". Because she was very good at expressing emotion when she acted \"Lady Macbeth\"'s murderous passions she could captivate her audience. Lady Macbeth was the play best adapted to her acting. She was tall and had a striking figure, brilliant beauty, powerfully expressive eyes, and solemn dignity of demeanour. This allowed her to claim the character as her own.\n\nAfter Lady Macbeth she played Desdemona in \"Othello\", Rosalind in \"As You Like It\", \"Ophelia\" and \"Volumnia\", all with great success. In \"Queen Catherine\" she discovered a role that was almost as well adapted to her acting powers as that of \"Lady Macbeth\".\n\nIt was the beginning of twenty years in which she was the queen of Drury Lane. Her celebrity status has been called \"mythical\" and \"monumental\". By \"the mid-1780s Siddons was established as a cultural icon.\" She mixed with the literary and social elites of London society. She knew people like Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, Hester Thrale Piozzi, and William Windham.\n\nIn 1802 she left Drury Lane. She then appeared on the stage of a rival theatre, Covent Garden, from time to time. It was there, on 29 June 1812, that she gave perhaps the most extraordinary farewell performance in theatre history. She was playing her most famous role, Lady Macbeth, and the audience refused to allow the play to continue after the end of the sleepwalking scene. Eventually, after tumultuous applause from the pit, the curtain reopened and Siddons was discovered sitting in her own clothes and character - whereupon she made an emotional farewell speech to the audience lasting eight minutes.\n\nMrs Siddons formally retired from the stage in 1812, but continued to appear on special occasions. Her last appearance was on 9 June 1819 as \"Lady Randolph\" in John Home's \"Douglas\".\n\nShe began as a ladies maid to Lady Greathead at Guy’s Cliffe House, near the Saxon Mill, Coventry Road, Warks.\n\nIn 1773, at the age of 18, she married William Siddons, an actor. She was less lucky with her family. She had seven children but five of them died. Her marriage to William Siddons was the cause of many problems. They could not divorce, but they separated, and lived in different places.\n\nSarah Siddons died in 1831 in London. She is buried in Saint Mary's Cemetery at Paddington Green.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds painted his famous portrait, \"Mrs. Siddons as the Tragic Muse,\" in 1784 (see Infobox), and signed it on the hem of her dress, \"for,\" he told her, \"I have resolved to go down to posterity on the hem of your garment.\"\n\nIn 1950, Joseph Mankiewicz saw the portrait and decided that it would provide the setting for the opening scene of All About Eve. The scene opened in the ballroom of the then fictitious Sarah Siddons Society. The occasion is the presentation of the Sarah Siddons award statuette, modeled on Sarah Siddons as the \"Tragic Muse\". In the climactic party scene, the painting is prominently displayed between Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe. The portrait also presides over the final scene when Anne Baxter moves past it.\n\nIn 1957, Bette Davis posed as Sarah Siddons in a re-creation of the painting staged as part of the Pageant of the Masters.\n\nAt the time of the release of All About Eve, \"The Sarah Siddons Award\" was a purely fictitious award. However, there now exists the American Sarah Siddons Award for dramatic achievement in theatre: a genuine and prestigious award, named in honor of Siddons. The award is given annually in Chicago by the \"Sarah Siddons Society.\"\n\nThe London Underground had an electric locomotive built by Vickers named after her. Used on the Metropolitan Line, No. 12 lasted along with other locomotives, until 1961. Painted a maroon colour, she is now the only one of twenty locomotives to remain preserved in working order. \n\nMichael Corby, founder of the 1970s group The Babys, is reportedly the great-great-great-great-grandson of Sarah Siddons. \n\nSarah Siddons' great-granddaughter, Margaret Siddons, married Charles Mackenzie Corby which is the origin of the name Siddons Corby. Their son John Siddons Corby, who founded the Corby trouser press company, had three children the youngest of whom was Peter John Siddons Corby (the inventor of the Corby 'electric' trouser press) and was the father of Michael John Siddons Corby, born July 3rd 1951.\n\n\n", "id": "123330", "title": "Sarah Siddons"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123332", "text": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\nThe atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuclear attacks on the Empire of Japan during World War II (WWII). The United States and the Allies were fighting against Japan and slowly winning. Two nuclear weapons were dropped on Japan, one on the city of Hiroshima and the other on the city of Nagasaki (the generals wanted to bomb Kokura instead of Nagasaki, but it was too cloudy over Kokura that day). U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered these attacks on August 6 and 9, 1945. This was near the end of WWII. The atomic bombs had been created through the Manhattan Project. Nuclear bombs are much more powerful than other kinds of bombs. At least 66,000 people were killed in Hiroshima, while 39,000 were killed in Nagasaki, totaling the deaths to 105,000. Six days after the explosion over Nagasaki, Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers on August 15. Japan signed the surrender paper on September 2. This officially ended the Pacific War and World War II.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen for several reasons. First, both cities were unsuitable for firebombing targets, mainly due to the river deltas preventing the firestorms from being very effective. Second, both cities had terrains which provided a good measurement for damage caused by the nuclear bombs. Third and finally, both cities contained strategic personnel and installations; Hiroshima was the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and 5th Division with 40,000 Japanese combatants stationed within the city's limit, and Nagasaki contained two large Mitsubishi armament factories and many other medium-to-small workshops and plants providing vital war components for Japan's war machine. In both cities, as with other Japanese cities, these targets were mixed in with civilian homes, schools, and temples. For example, at least 54% of the deaths in Hiroshima were combatants and slave laborers while 72% of the deaths in Nagasaki were war industry employees and slave laborers.\n\nThe vast majority of the people say that the atomic bombs actually saved many lives in the long run because it prevented the invasion of Japan. Without the bombs, the Allies would have had to invade Japan to end the war, which would drag out for years. More people would have been killed on both sides in a full battle in Japan. Allied generals believed that an invasion of Japan would have killed more than a million people on each side. Some say that the bombings were not necessary. People still argue about this. No nuclear weapon has ever been used in combat since August 9, 1945.\n\nThe decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan was made after an analysis showed that more than a million people -- combatants of both nations and civilians -- would die if Japan was invaded by Allied forces. The nuclear bombings, while shocking and unprecedented, actually paled in comparison with the \"Operation Meetinghouse\" firebombing of Tokyo on March 9/10, 1945, which killed 100,000 civilians and destroyed 16 square miles in a single night. Had not for the nuclear weapons, the U.S. would have resorted to firebombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki which would have caused equal amount of damage, but did not produce the shock value that nuclear weapons have. In addition, doing nothing or waiting it out for surrender was not an option because hundreds of thousands of combatants, civilians, and prisoners of war were dying each month in Japanese-occupied lands.\n\nPartly because of the atomic bombings, after the war Japan adopted the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. These principles said that Japan could not create or try to get nuclear weapons. \n", "id": "123332", "title": "Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki"}

Gilbert\n\nSir William Schwenck Gilbert (18 November 1836 – 29 May 1911) was an English dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator. He is best known for the comic operas (or operettas) that he wrote with Sir Arthur Sullivan.\n\nGilbert worked in the civil service for a few years, but he did not like it. He studied law and became a lawyer, but not many people hired him. To make more money, he wrote short stories and comic poems for magazines. He also worked as a theatre critic. Gilbert made drawings for some of his poems and signed them \"Bab\", a nickname he had when he was a baby. Those poems became known as \"The Bab Ballads\" and were very popular.\n\nIn the 1860s Gilbert started writing plays. At first he wrote parodies of other writers' plays and operas, but soon he developed his own way of writing. Gilbert wrote many plays; most of them are not performed anymore, but \"Engaged\" (1877), about a man who proposes marriage to every woman he meets, is still performed.\n\nIn 1871 Gilbert started working with Sullivan. They wrote fourteen comic operas together; Gilbert wrote the words and Sullivan wrote the music. Their fourth opera, \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1878), made the team of \"Gilbert and Sullivan\" famous all over the English-speaking world. Besides \"Pinafore\", their best-known operas are \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1879) and \"The Mikado\" (1885). The Gilbert and Sullivan operas are still performed very often, by opera companies, theatre companies, and groups in schools and colleges.\n\nGilbert and Sullivan sometimes argued about what to write and how to write it, but they worked together for 25 years, from 1871 to 1896. When they were angry with each other, they wrote operas with other people, but those operas did not make as much money as the operas they wrote together. When Sullivan died in 1900, Gilbert stopped writing operas.\n\nGilbert directed his own plays and operas. He wanted the actors to talk in a natural way, and not shout as if they were giving a speech to a big crowd.

It is owned by Facebook, Inc., Facebook has over one billion active users. Users may make a personal profile, add other users as friends, and send messages. Facebook users must register before using the site. Users may join user groups. These groups can be for a workplace, school or college, or other interest. The name of the service comes from the name for the book given to students at the start of the school year by some universities in the United States. These books help students get to know each other better. Facebook allows any users who say they are at least 13 years old to become users of the website.\n\nFacebook was started by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow computer science students Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The website's membership was only for Harvard students at first. Later it included other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It eventually opened for students at other universities. After that, it opened to high school students, and, finally, to anyone aged 13 and over. Based on ConsumersReports.org in May 2011, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts. This breaks the website's rules.\n\nA January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users. \"Entertainment Weekly\" put the site on its end-of-the-decade \"best-of\" list. It said, \"How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?\" Quantcast estimates Facebook had 138.9 million monthly different U.S. visitors in May 2011. According to \"Social Media Today\", in April 2010 about 41.6% of the U.S. population had a Facebook account. Facebook's growth started to slow down in some areas. The site lost 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011 relative to previous statistics.\n\nFacebook has been involved in many controversies over privacy. Some of these controversies have been about people being able to see personal information that other people post, and others are about companies and advertisers being able to see users' personal information.\n\nResearch published in the journal \"PLOS ONE\" has shown that Facebook may be responsible for spreading unhappiness through society as well as keeping people connected. Scientists found that the more time people spent on Facebook over a two-week period, the worse they subsequently felt. \"On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection. Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.\" \n\n", "id": "123387", "title": "Facebook"}

It is generally darker in color and stronger in texture than other hair found on the human body. It is caused by the rising levels of androgen during puberty. Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic.\n\nPubic hair appears during puberty in girls and boys. Beginning with only a few hairs, the area quickly fills out in a triangular shape making a thick patch of hair. \n\nThe growth of hair can go up toward the navel, but will always continue to grow down past the pubic region and ending at the anus (the hole between the buttocks). In females hair will cover the outer lips of the vagina; in males hair will grow around the base of the penis and lightly cover the scrotum (the outer sack containing the testicles).\n\nPubic hair is sometimes called a \"bush,\" \"nest,\" \"pubes,\" or \"curlies\". On Asian people, public hair is usually not so curly.\n\nPubic hair is sometimes made into a fashion item. Men and women do this. Some people may change the way their pubic hair looks, by trimming or shaping it. One style is called a landing strip, like a runway where an airplane lands. Some religions say to shave pubic hair. Some people use chemicals that dissolve pubic hair. Some people use wax or electrolysis to remove pubic hair. Use of wax to remove all pubic hair is sometimes called \"Brazilian\".\n\nSometimes people change the color. Sometimes people ask, \"Does the carpet match the drapes?\" This means, \"Is the person's pubic hair the same color as the hair on the person's head?\" Usually people with red natural hair color have darker red pubic hair.\n", "id": "123391", "title": "Pubic hair"}

It comes from the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal. Porto is a fortified wine. This means that alcohol was added to it to make it stronger. Porto is a sweet wine, but comes as dry or semi-dry too. It is often served as a dessert wine. Wines which are similar to the Portuguese product called \"port\" are made in several countries around the world. The biggest producers are Australia, South Africa, India, Canada and the United States. However, under European Union guidelines, only the product from Portugal may be labelled as \"Port\". In the United States, Federal law mandates that the Portuguese-made product be labeled \"Porto\" or \"Vinho do Porto\".\n\nPort is produced from grapes grown and processed in the Douro region. The wine produced is then fortified with the addition of a Brandy (distilled grape spirits). This is done to stop the fermentation leaving residual sugar in the wine and to increase the alcohol content. The wine is then stored and aged. For aging, it is often put in barrels stored in \"caves\" (\"Portuguese\" meaning \"cellars\") as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia. After aging, it is bottled. The wine received its name, \"Port,\" in the second half of the 17th century from the seaport city of Porto at the mouth of the Douro River. Much of the product was brought there. It was then either sold on a market or exported to other countries in Europe. The Leixões docks were used for this. The Douro valley where Port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region, or appellation in 1756. It is the oldest defined and protected wine region in the world.\n", "id": "123403", "title": "Port wine"}

It is found in the Nagar Valley about 100 kilmotres north of the city of Gilgit. \n\nRakaposhi means \"shining wall\" in the local language. Rakaposhi is also known as Dumani (\"Mother of Mist\"). It is ranked 27th highest in the world and 12th highest in Pakistan.\n\nNagar:\nNagar () was a princely state in the northernmost part of the Northern Areas of Pakistan, which existed until 1974. The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south and west, and the former princely state of Hunza to the north and east. The state capital was the town of Nagar. The area of Nagar now forms three tehsils of Hunza-Nagar District. Nagar along with Gilgit and Baltistan is claimed by India as part of the state of Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nNagar was an autonomous principality in close association with neighbouring Hunza. The British gained control of both states 1889 and 1892. The British retained Nagar's status as a 'principality' until 1947 but together with Hunza it was considered a vassal of Kashmir, although never ruled directly by it. The rulers of Nagar sent annual tributes to the Kashmir Durbar until 1947, and along with the ruler of Hunza, were considered amongst the most loyal vassals of the Maharajas of Kashmir.\n\nIn 1947, the state acceded to Pakistan, but continued as semi autonomous state. In 1968 Syed Yahya Shah the first educated politician of the valley, demanded civil rights from the Mir of Nagar. When Ayub Khan's dictatorship ended in Pakistan and the democratic government of the Pakistan Peoples Party under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto came into power through elections it realized the sentiments of the people against the Mir for democracy so the Government freed the prisoners of the movement and dissolved the Mirs of Hunza and Nagar and were merged into the Northern Areas in 1974.\n\nThe state was governed by the hereditary rulers of the Maghlot dynasty who were styled as Mir and were assisted by a council of Wazirs or Ministers. Details for early rulers are uncertain with the first definite dates available from 1839 CE onwards. The son of the last ruler, Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan, was in 2005 Northern Areas deputy chief executive.\n\n\nThe geography of Nagar was very difficult mountainous terrain, which provided a certain degree of protection against invading forces. The highest mountain was the 7,788 m (25,551 ft) Mount Rakaposhi which lay to the south of the town of Nagar. As of 2009[update], the Karakoram Highway crosses Nagar, connecting Pakistan to China via the Khunjerab Pass. The road follows the Hunza river for some distance through Nagar and into the Hunza region.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Nagar valley is around 90,000 (AKRSP Census, 2000). Nagar is home of people of two main ethnicities - the Burushaski speakers and the Shina speakers. The older type of Broshuski is still spoken in this valley with mild modern accent.\n\nAlthough the population was traditionally predominantly shia (Jafria). Following sectarian violences in January 2005, the Tanzim Ahle Sunnah wal Jama’at representing Sunnis, and the Central Anjuman-e-Imamia Northern Areas representing (Jafria) Shias signed on February 18, 2005 a six-point peace agreement arranged by Northern Areas Legislative Council (NALC) members to ensure peace in the city.\n\n", "id": "123407", "title": "Rakaposhi"}

Burnside (born Robert Lee Burnside, November 23 1926 - September 1 2005) was a blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist who lived in Holly Springs, Mississippi.\n\nHe played music for most of his life, but did not get popular till the 1990s.\n\nBurnside was born in Harmontown, Mississippi, in Lafayette County. He spent most of his life working as a sharecropper and a fisherman, as well as playing guitar at weekend house parties. \n\nHe was first inspired to play guitar in his early twenties, after hearing John Lee Hooker play. He learned music from Mississippi Fred McDowell, who lived nearby. He was also influenced by his cousin-in-law, Muddy Waters.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Burnside moved to Chicago, Illinois to get a better job, but things did not turn out as he had hoped. Within one month, his father, brother, and uncle were all murdered in the city. He used this tragedy to help him write music. He used it mostly for his interpretation of Skip James's \"Hard Time Killing Floor\", \"R.L.'s Story,\" and the opening and closing tracks on Burnside's 2000 album, \"Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down\".\n\nAround 1959, he left Chicago and went back to Mississippi to work the farms and raise a family.\n\nAfter a heart attack in 2001, Burnside's doctor advised him to stop drinking; Burnside did, but said that change stopped him from playing. \n\nMembers of his family continue to play blues in the Holly Springs area. His grandson, Cedric Burnside, tours with Kenny Brown, while his son Duwayne Burnside has played guitar with the North Mississippi Allstars. In 2004, the Burnside sons opened Burnside Blues Cafe, 30 miles southeast of Memphis in Holly Springs, Mississippi.\n\nHis earliest recordings were made in the late 1960s by George Mitchell and released on Arhoolie Records. Another album was recorded that year and \"Hill Country Blues\" came after in the early 1980s. An album with only singles followed, released in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nIn the 1990s, he began recording for the Oxford, Mississippi, label Fat Possum Records, founded by Peter Redvers-Lee and Matthew Johnson. Burnside stayed with Fat Possum until his death, and he usually played with his friend and understudy, the slide guitarist Kenny Brown.\n\nBurnside died at St. Francis Hospital on September 1, 2005 at 78 years old. \n\n\nBurnside was convicted of murder and sentenced to six months' in prison. Burnside's boss helped to keep the murder sentence short because he needed Burnside to work on the farm. \"I didn't mean to kill nobody,\" Burnside said. \"I just meant to shoot the sonofabitch in the head. Him dying was between him and the Lord.\"\n\nBurnside had a strong voice and played electric and acoustic guitars. He played in the style of North Mississippi hill country blues rather than Mississippi Delta blues.\n\nMany of his songs do not have chord changes, but use the same chord or bass line through the song.\n\n\n\n", "id": "123412", "title": "R.

However, the quark somehow manages to spin both ways at once, so the universe splits into two separate possibilities as the person pulls the trigger. In one universe, the person survives, in the other, the person dies. The person themself does not notice anything different.\n", "id": "123433", "title": "Quantum immortality"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123520", "text": "Michael Gambon\n\nSir Michael John Gambon, CBE (born 19 October 1940), is an acclaimed Irish actor with a career that spans nearly five decades and includes a variety of roles in theater, television and movie.\n\nGambon was born in Dublin during World War II. His father, Edward Gambon, was an engineer and his mother, Mary (née Hoare), was a seamstress. His father decided to seek work in the rebuilding of London, and so the family moved to Mornington Crescent in north London, when Gambon was five. His father had him made a British citizen — a decision that would later allow Michael to receive an actual, rather than honorary, knighthood and CBE. (although, under the British Nationality Act 1981 anyone born in Ireland before 1949 can still register as a British subject and, after five years' UK residence, as a British citizen).\n\nRaised a strict Catholic, he attended St Aloysius Boys' School in Somers Town and served at the altar. He then moved to St Aloysius' College in Hornsey Lane, Highgate, London, whose former pupils included Peter Sellers. He later attended a school in Kent, before leaving with no qualifications at fifteen. He then gained an apprenticeship with Vickers Armstrong as a toolmaker. By the time he was 21 he was a fully qualified engineer. He kept the job for a further year – acquiring a fascination and passion for collecting antique guns, clocks and watches, as well as classic cars.\n\nAged 19 he joined the Unity Theatre in Kings Cross. Five years later he wrote a letter to Michael MacLiammoir, the Irish theatre impresario who ran Dublin's Gate Theatre. It was accompanied by a CV describing a rich and wholly imaginary theatre career – and he was taken on.\n\nGambon made his professional stage début in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin's 1962 production of \"Othello\", playing \"Second Gentleman\", followed by a European tour. A year later, cheekily auditioning with the opening soliloquy from Richard III, he caught the eye of star-maker Laurence Olivier who was recruiting promising spear-carriers for his new National Theatre Company. Gambon, along with Robert Stephens, Derek Jacobi and Frank Finlay, was hired as one of the ‘to be renowned’ and played any number of small roles. The company initially performed at the Old Vic, their first production being \"Hamlet\", directed by Olivier and starring Peter O'Toole. He played for four years in many NT productions, including named roles in \"The Recruiting Officer\" and \"The Royal Hunt of the Sun\", working with directors William Gaskill and John Dexter.\n\nAfter three years at the Old Vic, Olivier advised Gambon to gain experience in provincial rep. In 1967, he left the NT for the Birmingham Repertory Company which was to give him his first crack at the title roles in \"Othello\" (his favourite), \"Macbeth\" and \"Coriolanus\". \n\nHis rise to stardom began in 1974 when Eric Thompson cast him as the melancholy vet in Alan Ayckbourn's \"The Norman Conquests\" at Greenwich. A speedy transfer to the West End established him as a brilliant comic actor, squatting at a crowded dining table on a tiny chair and sublimely agonising over a choice between black or white coffee.\n\nBack at the National, now on the South Bank, his next turning point was Peter Hall's premiere staging of Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal\", an unexpectedly subtle performance — a production photograph shows him embracing Penelope Wilton with sensitive hands and long slim fingers (the touch of a master clock-maker). He is also one of the few actors to have mastered the harsh demands of the vast Olivier Theatre. As Simon Callow once said: “Gambon's ‘iron lungs and overwhelming charisma are able to command a sort of operatic full-throatedness which triumphs over hard walls and long distances.”\n\nThis was to serve him in good stead in John Dexter's masterly staging of \"The Life of Galileo\" in 1980, the first Brecht to become a popular success. Hall called him ‘unsentimental, dangerous and immensely powerful’, even the Sunday Times’ curmudgeonly critic of the day called his performance ‘a decisive step in the direction of great tragedy...great acting’, while fellow actors paid him the rare compliment of applauding him in the dressing room on the first night. \n\nFrom the first Ralph Richardson dubbed him The Great Gambon, an accolade which stuck, outshining his 1990 CBE, even the later knighthood, although Gambon dismisses it as a circus slogan. But as Sheridan Morley perceptively remarked in 2000, when reviewing \"Cressida\": ‘Gambon's eccentricity on stage now begins to rival that of his great mentor Richardson’. Also like Richardson, interviews are rarely given and raise more questions than they answer. Gambon is a very private person, a ‘non-starry star’ as Ayckbourn called him. Off-stage he prefers to back out of the limelight, an unpretentious guy sharing laughs with his fellow cast and crew. \n\nWhile he has won screen acclaim, no-one who saw his ravaged \"King Lear\" at Stratford, while still in his early forties, will forget his superb double act with a red-nosed Antony Sher as the Fool sitting on his master's knee like a ventriloquist's doll. There were also notable appearances in \"Old Times\" at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, and as \"Volpone\" and the brutal sergeant in Pinter's \"Mountain Language\". \n\nDavid Hare's \"Skylight\", with Lia Williams, which opened to rave reviews at the National in 1995, transferred first to Wyndhams Theatre and then on to Broadway for a four-month run which left him in a state of advanced exhaustion. “\"Skylight\" was ten times as hard to play as anything I’ve ever done” he told Michael Owen in the Evening Standard. “I had a great time in New York but couldn’t wait to get back”.\n\nGambon is almost the only leading actor not to grace Yasmina Reza's \"ART\" at Wyndham's. But together with Simon Russell Beale and Alan Bates he gave a deliciously droll radio account of the role of Marc. And for the RSC he shared Reza's two-hander \"The Unexpected Man\" with Eileen Atkins, first at The Pit in the Barbican and then at the Duchess Theatre, a production also intended for New York but finally delayed by other commitments.\n\nIn 2001 he played what he described as “a physically repulsive’’ Davies in Patrick Marber's revival of Pinter's \"The Caretaker\", but he found the rehearsal period an unhappy experience, and felt that he had let down the author. A year later, playing opposite Daniel Craig, he portrayed the father of a series of cloned sons in Caryl Churchill's \"A Number\" at the Royal Court, notable for a recumbent moment when he smoked a cigarette, the brightly lit spiral of smoke rising against a black backdrop, an effect which he dreamed up during rehearsals.\n\nIn 2004 he finally achieved a life-long ambition to play Sir John Falstaff, in Nicholas Hytner's National Theatre production of \"Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2\", co-starring with Matthew Macfadyen as Prince Hal.\n\nHe made his movie debut in the Laurence Olivier \"Othello\" in 1965. He then played romantic leads, notably in the early 1970s BBC television series, \"The Borderers\", in which he was swashbuckling Gavin Ker. As a result, Gambon was asked by James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli to audition for the role in 1970, to replace George Lazenby. His craggy looks soon made him into a character actor, although he won critical acclaim as Galileo in John Dexter's production of \"The Life of Galileo\" by Brecht at the National Theatre in 1980. But it was not until Dennis Potter's \"The Singing Detective\" (1986) that he became a household name. After this success, for which he won a BAFTA, his work includes movies such as \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\" which also starred Helen Mirren.\n\nIn 1992 he played a psychotic general in the Barry Levinson movie \"Toys\" and he also starred as Georges Simenon's detective Inspector Jules Maigret in an ITV adaptation of Simenon's series of books. He starred as Fyodor Dostoevsky in the Hungarian director Károly Makk's movie \"The Gambler\" (1997) about the writing of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novella \"The Gambler\".\n\nIn recent years, movies such as \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" (1998) and \"Plunkett & Macleane\" (1998), as well as television appearances in series such as \"Wives and Daughters\" (1999) (for which he won another BAFTA), a made-for-TV adaptation of Samuel Beckett's \"Endgame\" (2001) and \"Perfect Strangers\" (2001) have revealed a talent for comedy. In 2004, he appeared in five movies, including Wes Anderson's quirky comedy \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\"; the British gangster flick \"Layer Cake\"; theatrical drama \"Being Julia\"; and CGI action fantasy \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\".\n\nPerhaps his most significant role in 2004, however, was Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' headmaster in the third installment of J. K. Rowling's franchise, \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", taking over from fellow Irish actor Richard Harris, who had died of Hodgkins disease. (Harris had also played Maigret on television four years before Gambon took that role.) Gambon reprised the role of Albus Dumbledore in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", which was released in November 2005 in the UK and U.S. He returned to the role again in the fifth movie, \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", which was released in 2007. He will once again return to portray Dumbledore in movie the sixth \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\". Gambon admits not having read the \"Harry Potter\" novels and says that this is because he does not want to be upset by an extremely large change or death in the books. Similarly, he has also stated in an interview that, when playing Dumbledore, \"I don't have to play anyone really. I just stick on a beard and play me, so it's no great feat. I never ease into a role – every part I play is just a variant of my own personality. I’m not really a character actor at all...\" \n\nIn an Ironic twist, Gambon also played a British spy in \"The Good Shepherd\" (2006). His codename was \"The headmaster\".\n\nMost recently, he was Joe in Beckett's \"Eh Joe\", giving two performances a night at the Duke of York's Theatre in London. He currently does the voice over to the new Guinness ads with the penguins. In 2007 he played major roles in Stephen Poliakoff's \"Joe's Palace\", and the five-part adaptation of Mrs Gaskell's \"Cranford\" novels, both for BBC TV.\n\nGambon married Anne Miller when he was 22, but has always been secretive about his personal life, responding to one interviewer's question about her: \"What wife?\" The couple lived together in a country house near Gravesend in Kent, where Anne has her workshop. Gambon was invested by Prince Charles as a Knight Bachelor on 17 July 1998 for services to drama (Queen Elizabeth II's approval for the award was notified in the 1998 New Year Honours List) and his wife thus became Lady Gambon. The couple have a son, Fergus, who appears as an expert on the BBC's \"Antiques Roadshow\".\n\nWhile filming \"Gosford Park\", Gambon brought Philippa Hart on to the set and introduced her to co-stars as his girlfriend. When the affair was revealed in 2002, he moved out of the marital home, but rather than moving in with his mistress, he bought himself a bachelor pad. Philippa, who worked with Gambon on the movie \"Sylvia\" in 2003, in late 2006 moved into a £500,000 terraced home in Chiswick, West London with her pet pug dog. In February 2007, it was revealed that Philippa was pregnant with Gambon's child, and was due to give birth in May 2007.\n\nGambon is a qualified amateur pilot, and his love of cars led to his appearance on the BBC's \"Top Gear\" programme. Gambon raced the Suzuki Liana and was driving so aggressively that it was launched into the air on the last corner of his timed lap. The final corner of the Dunsfold Park track has been named \"Gambon\" in his honour.

He clipped his namesake corner the second time, and when asked why by Jeremy Clarkson, replied that 'I dunno - I just do not like it'.\n\nIn February 2015 Gambon spoke for the first time of the \"frightening memory loss\" that had forced him to retire from the stage after 50 years. He said he has taken the \"heartbreaking\" decision to stop after finding he could no longer remember his lines.\n\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "123520", "title": "Michael Gambon"}

The rumour that a house is haunted often starts after something violent or tragic happens in the house, such as a murder or suicide. Haunted houses are common in gothic fiction, and are generally seen as old castles or creaky, old, abandoned houses. A haunted house can be a type of attraction in amusements parks too. One scientific explanation of haunted houses is that poisonous gasses such as carbon monoxide from defective gas-burning appliances are what causes the hallucinations that people experience. Another possible cause is infrasound.\n\nMany haunted houses have been investigated and found to contain high levels of carbon monoxide or other poisons, which can cause hallucinations. The carbon monoxide thing\n\nPesticides can cause the same types of hallucinations as carbon monoxide. Recreational drugs such as LSD and methamphetamine can cause hallucinations. Unpleasant hallucinations are known in the recreational drug community as a \"bad trip\". Drug users are usually, but not always, aware that they are experiencing hallucinations related to the drug, at least after they become sober again.\n\nSounds heard in a \"haunted\" house are often very normal sounds, for example footstep-like sounds can be caused by vermin such as squirrels or raccoons. Dead vermin can also cause unusual smells often associated with hauntings. Doors closing by themselves can be caused by wind. Moving shadow figures can be caused by the headlights of passing cars shining through a window. Many times normal sounds that come from outside can be mistaken for a sound inside the house.

The movie was directed and co-written by George Miller. It was released in North America in November 2006. While it is mostly animated, some scenes do include live-action. \"Happy Feet\" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature but did not win the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature.\n\n\"Happy Feet\" was dedicated to the following people: Nick Enright, Michael Jonson, Robby McNeilly Green, and Steve Irwin.\n\n\"Happy Feet\" is set in an Emperor Penguin colony, where each penguin must sing a song called the \"Heartsong\" to find a mate. Two penguins, Norma Jean and Memphis, are attracted to each other by their songs, and they start a family. While Norma Jean is fishing in the ocean, Memphis is left with the egg, and he accidentally drops it on the ice, exposing it to the cold temperatures of the Antarctic. The young penguin chick who hatches out of this egg has a terrible singing voice and later discovers he has no \"Heartsong.\" However, he does have a talent for tap dancing.\n\nWhile Mumble's mother, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his father, Memphis, says it \"just ain't penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a \"Heartsong\", Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity-hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different; especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of the colony, who ultimately casts him out of the community.\n\nAway from home for the first time, Mumble meets a group of different penguins—the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly accept Mumble's tap-dancing skills and invite him to party with them. In the home of the Adelies, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a Rockhopper penguin who claims he will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. In their conversation, Lovelace mentions \"aliens,\" which interest Mumble as he finds a frozen vehicle in a glacier. He decides to find the \"aliens.\"\n\nReturning home, Mumble and his friends find Gloria in the center of attention as her \"Heartsong\" is very attractive to the other penguins. However, she is not interested in the other males' \"Heartsongs\" but is excited when Mumble persuades her to sing in time with his tap-dance rhythm. The other penguins become interested and begin dancing. However, Noah the Elder feels that the recent lack of fish, the penguins' main food, is a punishment sent from their god in order to punish them for allowing Mumble's dancing. He therefore exiles Mumble from the colony, but before he leaves, Mumbles tells them that he will find the real cause of the famine.\n\nWith Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble travels many miles and through many obstacles, which include an attack by killer whales. Finally, they see a large quantity of commercial trawlers, ships that are fishing in the Antarctic waters, and Mumble follows them. Eventually, he is caught and put on display in an marine park exhibit. He attempts to communicate with the \"aliens\" (humans) who are surrounding him, but fails. After nearing going mad with the confinement, a small child taps on the glass of his enclosure. Mumble is excited and begins tap-dancing. After a large crowd gathers to watch him, he is released back to the wild with a tracking device and leads the humans back to his colony.\n\nLater on, a research team arrives to study the penguins, and the humans discover they are overfishing the ocean, which had resulted in the lack of fish. Fishing the Antarctic is banned, and the fish population returns and thrives. In the end, the Emperors and Amigos are shown dancing and celebrating.\n", "id": "123587", "title": "Happy Feet"}

He formed a piano trio with the violinist Jacques Thibaud and the cellist Pablo Casals. He was a piano teacher and conductor.\n\nCortot (pronounce “Cor-toe”) was born in Nyon in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. His father was French and his mother was Swiss. Cortot studied at the Paris Conservatoire. His teachers were Emile Descombes and Louis Diémer. He won a first prize (\"premier prix\") in 1896. His first public concert was at the Concerts Colonne in 1897 when he played Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 3. He helped opera singers to learn their music, and became assistant conductor at the Bayreuth Festival. In 1902 he conducted Wagner’s \"Götterdämmerung\". It was the first time it had been performed in Paris. He formed a concert society to perform Wagner's \"Parsifal\", Beethoven's \"Missa solemnis\", Brahms' \"German Requiem\", and new works by French composers.\n\nIn 1905, Cortot formed a trio with Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals, which became the most famous piano trio of the time. There are still several recordings of their playing. From 1907 to 1923, Cortot taught at the Paris Conservatoire, where his pupils included Clara Haskil, Dinu Lipatti, Vlado Perlemuter. In 1919, he founded the École Normale de Musique de Paris. Many people came to hear him teach about how to perform piano music. He travelled a lot and also conducted famous orchestras. He died in Lausanne.\n\nMany people did not agree with him when he supported the German occupation of France during the Second World War. He played in some concerts which were supported by the Nazis. He may just have played at these concerts because he liked German music, but it made him some enemies. His wife, Clothilde Breal, was of Jewish origin and her cousin, Lise Bloch, was married to Leon Blum, the first Jew to become President du Conseil or Prime Minister in France. Cortot and the Blums were good friends, although he was banned for a year from performing in France.\n\nHe was famous for playing the piano music of Chopin and Schumann, Cortot made editions of both those composers' music.

Lao Che wants the ashes of the Manchurian emperor Nurachi. In turn, he will give Jones a rare diamond. They trade items. However, Lao Che put poison in Jones's drink and offers him the antidote for the diamond. A fight ensures, where one of Lao Che's sons is killed and a dancer named Willie Scott picks up the antidote.

Jones signals to his friends to hold on and then he cuts the rope. Most of the Thuggees die when they are eaten by crocodiles down below. The rest of the people hang onto the bridge, which hits a cliff. Scott and Short Round easily make it up. Ram and Jones fight. It ends when Jones utters a chant that makes the stones very hot.

It is very beautiful, and can only be controlled with a golden bridle given to Bellerophon by Athena.\n\nLong ago, Perseus killed the monster Medusa using a reflective shield and winged sandals. He cut off her head, which had the hair of poisonous snakes and was so ugly it would turn to stone anyone who looked at it straight on, and from her blood sprang the winged horse Pegasus. Some stories say that Perseus rode Pegasus away, but other stories say he left before Pegasus was born. \n\nYears later, there was a young man named Bellerophon, living in Corinth. Bellerophon had always longed to ride Pegasus, but Pegasus refused to be tamed. Bellerophon decided to pray to Athena, who was the Greek goddess of wisdom. Athena gave him a golden bridle that allowed him to capture Pegasus.\n\nLater, the brother of a king sent Bellerophon on a quest to defeat the Chimera, a legendary beast with the head of a lion that breathed fire, a goat’s head sprouting from its back, and the tail of a snake. Together, they defeated it and Bellerophon was honored. Then Bellerophon decided he wanted to be immortal and tried to fly with Pegasus to Mount Olympus, home of the gods. Zeus, angry, sent a gadfly to sting Pegasus, who bucked Bellerophon back to Earth. \n\nFelson, Nancy. \"Pegasus.\" World Book Advanced.

The fur on the upper parts of the bat is normally brown or rust-orange and quite short. The ears are very long and rounded. The large feet are robust, with long curved claws. The muzzle is long and narrow, and the teeth are strong. The Noseleaf is shaped as in the photograph. \n\nThe bats are very good at hunting at night. They are predators. Their prey includes many vertebrates, such as amphibians, reptiles, small birds and mammals- they even hunt other bat species. Insects are also included, especially large crickets, cicadas etc. Surprisingly, a small amount of fruit is also eaten.\n\nWhen hunting, this species is extremely stealthy. It will often pounce from a position on an above branch onto its prey or fly like some owls by patrolling back and forth along forest edges, suddenly dropping on something in the grass.

From 1933 to 1945 it was also part of Germany's national anthem.\n\nThe lyrics of the song were composed in 1929 by Horst Wessel, a Nazi activist and local commander of the Nazi militia, the SA, in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain. Wessel was assassinated by a Communist activist in January 1930, and the propaganda apparatus of Berlin Gauleiter Dr Joseph Goebbels made him the leading martyr of the Nazi Movement. The song became the official Song of Consecration (\"Weihelied\") for the Nazi Party, and was extensively used at party functions as well as being sung by the SA during street parades.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" was recognised as a national symbol by a law issued on May 19, 1933. Nazi Germany thus had a double anthem, consisting of the first verse of the \"Deutschlandlied\" followed by the \"Horst Wessel-Lied\". A regulation attached to a printed version of the \"Horst Wessel-Lied\" in 1934 required the right arm to be raised in a \"Hitler salute\" when the first and fourth verses were sung.\nWith the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945, the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" was banned, and both the lyrics and the tune remain illegal in Germany and Austria to this day except for educational and scholarly uses (under sections 86 and 86a of the \"Strafgesetzbuch\").\n\nThe lyrics of the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" were published in the Berlin Nazi newspaper, \"Der Angriff\", in September 1929, attributed to \"Der Unbekannte SA-Mann\" (\"the Unknown SA-Man\"), as follows:\n\nThe \"Rotfront\" (\"Red Front\") was a reference to the Rotfrontkämpferbund, a communist militia tied to the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). It was common for Nazis' Sturmabteilung and Communists' Redfront to attack each other in violent street fights, which eventually grew into full-scale battles after 1930. \"Reaction\" was a reference to the conservative parties and the liberal democratic German state of the Weimar Republic period, which made several unsuccessful attempts to ban the SA. \"Servitude\" means what the Nazis saw as Germany's \"servitude\" to the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, which imposed huge reparations on Germany and deprived her of her colonies and territory along her eastern border.\n\nSome changes were made to the lyrics after Wessel's death:\n\nThe dropping of the reference to \"barricades\" reflected the Nazi Party's desire in the period 1930-33 to be seen as a constitutional political party aiming at taking power by legal means rather than as a revolutionary party.\n\nThe line \"Kameraden, die Rotfront und Reaktion erschossen\" is ghastly German, but it was never amended.\n\nAfter Wessel's death, new stanzas were composed in his honour. These were frequently sung by the SA but did not become part of the official lyrics used on party or state occasions.\n\nAfter Wessel's death, he was officially credited with having composed the melody as well as having written the lyrics for the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\". Between 1930 and 1933, however, German critics disputed this claim, pointing out that the melody had a long prior history. Such criticism became impossible after 1933.\n\nThe most likely immediate source for the melody was a song popular in the German Imperial Navy during World War I, which Wessel would no doubt have heard being sung by Navy veterans in the Berlin of the 1920s. The song was known either by its opening line as \"Vorbei, vorbei, sind all die schönen Stunden\", or as the \"Königsberg-Lied\", after the German light cruiser \"Königsberg\", which is mentioned in one version of the song's lyrics. The opening stanza of the song is:\n\nAnother German song, \"Der Abenteurer\" (The Adventurer), begins:\nIn 1936 a German music critic, Alfred Weidemann, published an article in which he identified the melody of a song composed in 1865 by the Weimar composer Peter Cornelius as the \"Urmelodie\" (source-melody). According to Weidemann, Cornelius described the tune as a \"Viennese folk tune.\" This appeared to him to be the ultimate origin of the melody of the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\". \nThe musical score is much more complex than the text of the song; given its characteristics, it could easily be sung even by people without much singing practice, and be played by amateur bands. Often, fanfares were used to give a more military touch to the tune. \nSee also the Wikipedia article on Carl Boberg (1859-1940), particularly the note on similarities and dissimilarities between \"Horst Wessel Lied\" and the Swedish tune O STORE GUD (widely sung as \"How Great Thou Art\").\n\nDuring the 1930s and '40s the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" was adapted for use by fascist groups in other European countries. The anthem of the British Union of Fascists was set to the same tune, and its lyrics were to some extent modelled on the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\", but appealing to British nationalism rather than German nationalism. Its opening stanza was:\n\nIn Spain, the Falange fascist movement sang to the same tune:\n\nWhile in Vichy France the fascists of the radical Milice sang:\n\nBetween 1930 and 1933 the German Communists and Social Democrats sang various parodies of the \"Horst-Wessel-Lied\" during their street battles with the SA. Some simply changed the political character of the song, such as:\n\nThe Stahlhelm was a veterans' organisation closely aligned with the Nazis.\n\nOthers substituted completely new lyrics:\n\nErnst Thälmann was the KPD leader.\n\nThese versions were of course banned once the Nazis came to power and the Communist and Social Democratic parties repressed. But during the years of the Third Reich the song was parodied in various underground versions, most of them poking fun at the corruption of the Nazi elite. One version ran:\n\nWilhelm Frick was the Interior Minister. Baldur von Schirach was the Hitler Youth leader. Heinrich Himmler was head of the SS and police.\n\nIn the first year of the Nazi regime radical elements of the SA sang their own parody of the song, reflecting their disappointment that the \"socialist\" element of National Socialism had not been realised:\n\nKurt Schmitt was Economics Minister 1933-35.\n\nThis article is largely based on George Boderick, \"The Horst-Wessel-Lied: A Reappraisal,\" \"International Folklore Review\" Vol. 10 (1995): 100-127, available online here\n\n", "id": "124039", "title": "Horst-Wessel-Lied"}

His father was a draper, selling cloth and fabrics. He joined the navy in 1770 at the age of 12. He was made the captain's servant on the \"HMS Swallow\". He served in the West Indies and then fought in the American War of Independence. He became a midshipman and later a lieutenant. He served with Captain Arthur Phillip in \"HMS Ariadne\". He went to India with Phillip in 1783 in the ship \"HMS Europe\". Phillip was very pleased with King. He made King a lieutenant on HMS \"Sirius\" when he took the First Fleet to Australia in 1787 to start the penal colony.\n\nThree weeks after the First Fleet got to Sydney, Governor Phillip sent King to Norfolk Island. His task was to set up a small penal colony that would make use of the timber and flax growing on the island. These would be of use to the British Navy. He arrived at the island on March 3, 1788. There was no safe place to land on the island and this made it a difficult place to have a settlement. King had a group of 23 people including 15 convicts. Over the next two years they began clearing land (removing trees) to grow crops and to raise cattle and other animals. King was made Lieutenant-Governor of Norfolk Island. In March 1790, Phillip sent King back to England. He was to go back and tell the British government about the problems of the new settlements in Australia.\n\nKing stayed in London for about four months. He married Anna Josepha Coombe on March 11, 1791, and they left for Australia four days later. After reporting to Phillip in Sydney, they were back on Norfolk Island in November, where his son Phillip Parker King was born.\n\nWhile he had been away, Norfolk had been governed by Lieutenant-Governor Robert Ross. Phillip had moved Ross to the island because of his difficulties in working with him at Sydney. When King arrived, the convicts, settlers and soldiers were very unhappy because of Ross's leadership. King made new rules, which made things better for people who wanted to settle on the island, many of whom had been marines or convicts. In 1794 the island was growing all of the wheat it needed, and had so many pigs it was able to send food to Sydney.\n\nThe flax on the island was too hard to turn into cloth. Two Maoris from New Zealand were kidnapped and brought to Norfolk to teach people how to work the flax. The two men did not know about flax, because in New Zealand it was work done by the women. In November 1793, King left the island for ten days to take the men back home. He did not have permission to leave and got into trouble from Lieutenant-Governor Francis Grose. King also had problems with many of the soldiers. They said he punished them more than the convicts. King arrested 20 soldiers and charged them with mutiny, and sent them to Sydney. Grose released the soldiers and told the soldiers on Norfolk that they were in charge, not King. These orders were later changed by the Duke of Portland.\n\nKing became ill with gout, and in October 1796 Governor John Hunter let him go back to England to get medical treatment.\n\nHe soon became better with proper medical treatment. He began to look for work, and Phillip wanted the government to send him back to New South Wales to be the new governor. After many delays, he set out for Australia in a new ship partly designed by Sir Joseph Banks. This ship turned out to be unsafe, and could not sail in rough seas. King was forced to return to England. After further delays, he finally sailed on the ship \"Speedy,\" and arrived in Sydney on November 26, 1799.\n\nHunter remained in charge until he could arrange to sail back to England in Spetember, 1800. King as the new governor, immediately set about to try and make changes. He wanted to control the amount of alcohol being brought to Australia by the military and sold at a profit. For example, the two surgeons that came to Australia on the \"Speedy\" had brought 4359 gallons (19,816 litres) of alcohol to sell. He tried to get merchants in Calcutta and the US not to send alcohol. He started a brewery to make beer, hoping this would be less of a problem than the alcohol like rum.\n\nKing arranged for the government to bring in supplies for sale at a reasonable price, which ended the power of some of the military. He also brought in controls over prices, wages, working hours, baking, butchers, interest rates, weights, measures and currency. He reduced the number of convict servants that the military officers could have. He arranged for more convicts to be put to work on farms and projects like building roads, guard houses, and granaries. The new colony began to grow all of its own food. King looked at ways to increase the food supply and arranged for the import of sheep and cattle to build up stocks. King also began to employ convicts who had finished their prison sentences, called emancipists. He started a school for female orphans, a newspaper (the Sydney Gazette), and even had people vaccinated for smallpox.\n\nKing was often in conflict with the military, the New South Wales Corps. As soldiers, they did not like taking orders from a naval officer. They felt that their duties were to protect New South Wales, and not to be responsible for the convicts. They wanted the colony to be run like a prison, even though there was no other people but them to run it. They objected to freed convicts being given any rights or land. King's changes had also upset their money making schemes through the sale of alcohol and other goods. King's orders were often ignored or disobeyed. In 1801 he sent an officer, John Macarthur, back to England to be tried for refusing orders and fighting a duel with his commanding officer. Instead of going to trial, Macarthur was able to make the British government believe that he was innocent, and all the problem were caused by King's lack of ability. Macarthur left the army and returned to Australia in July 1805 as a hero, having been told he could have of the best land. King asked for leave, and was told his resignation was accepted.\n\nKing had to stay until August 1806 so that a new governor could be sent out. His health broke down and he was not fit to sail until February 1807. He reached England in November 1807. King died on September 3, 1808, and was buried in London.\n", "id": "124066", "title": "Philip Gidley King"}

It was the beginning of a plan to transport thousands of prisoners to Australia to make convict settlements. The fleet was led by Captain Arthur Phillip. This journey lasted eight months, and used a route across the oceans that had only been used three times; once by Abel Tasman and twice by James Cook.\n\nThe 1700s were a period of great change in Europe, and especially in England. There was an industrial revolution. This was a time when many machines were being invented for use in large factories. With machines now doing the ordinary tasks of men, people were left without jobs and wages. This made it very difficult to survive. Men, women and even children resorted to theft in order to live. With the rise of machines, farmers were also forced to move to the city to look for jobs. As a result, London had become very overcrowded, and so had the prisons. In fact, prisons had become so overcrowded that convicts had been relegated to hulks (floating prisons). \n\nTo solve the problem, the British Government made the decision to settle what is now Australia in order to transport convicts and soldiers to a new penal settlement in Botany Bay.\n\nThere were 11 ships altogether. Two navy ships, six convict transports and three storeships.\n\nThe convicts were housed below deck and often further confined behind bars. Conditions were extremely cramped. In many cases the prisoners were restrained in chains and were only allowed on deck for fresh air and exercise. On deck, thick wooden walls were built to separate the convicts from the rest of the ship. The walls had small holes in them so the guards could shoot in case of trouble. The hatches (doors up to the deck) were kept shut with cross bars, bolts and locks. Guards were almost always on duty at each hatch, and a guard with a gun was always on the quarter-deck (back of the ship). People slept in hammocks and there were tables for eating and stools to sit on. \n\nThe prisoners were gathered from places throughout England - Wiltshire, Devonshire, Surry, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, Plymouth and London - many had already been locked up for several years in various prisons under appalling conditions and were in a poor state of health. Many, especially those from smaller country jails were not in good health. Captain Phillip thought that he might have to make one of the ships a hospital ship to care for the sick. Newspapers wrote that they expected about 80% of the convicts would not survive the long journey. Before they even left England, several of the convicts died and some of marines were so sick that they were removed from the ships. However the number of people that died on the trip was quite small, and shows that the planning and treatment of the convicts during the journey was actually successful. Most had put on weight and were healthier when they arrived in Australia than when they left England.\n\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787. The entire journey took 252 days (a little over 8 months). From England, the fleet sailed to Australia making stops in Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. They arrived in Botany Bay in mid-January 1788. \n\nThe journey began with good weather so Captain Phillip decided to let the convicts up on deck. However the weather would become very hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck during this time, as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing. As a result, they were kept below deck in the foul, cramped holds.\n\nSome convicts on the \"Scarborough\" planned a mutiny but were caught, but most convicts were well behaved.\n\nOn 3 June 1787, the fleet arrived at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. On 10 June they left to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro. The weather was very hot and there were lots of storms. Many people became sick and there were lots of rats, bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas. People were only allowed to drink three pints of water each day (about one and a half litres).\n\nThe fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August. The ships were cleaned and fixed. More water, clothing and lots of food was taken on board. The fleet left on 4 September and reached Cape Town on 13 October. They bought plants, seeds and animals to take to Australia. The animals included: two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and poultry. They left on 12 November.\n\nFrom Cape Town it took the Fleet two months to reach Australia. Phillip took a few ships ahead to start building at Botany Bay. They arrived on 18 January 1788. The other ships arrived only two days after he did.\n\nConvicts were given two thirds of the amount normally provided for sailors. Each week a sailor was given:\n\nAs well as this food, there was sometimes rice, dried fish, and soup. When the ships were in a harbour there was also fresh meat and vegetables. Women and children were given a slightly different list of food. Sick people were also given wine and spirits.\n\nWhen the Fleet arrived in Sydney, Arthur Phillip worked out they only had enough food for 49 weeks. He should have been given enough for two years.\n\nThe Fleet also took a number of animals, plants and seeds. The animals included sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, goats, turkeys, geese, ducks, chickens, pigeons, horses, and cattle. Plants and seeds included coffee, cocoa, cotton, bananas, oranges, lemons, tamarinds, guava, prickly pear, eugenia or pomme rose, jalap, ipecacuanha, figs, bamboo, sugar cane, esparto grass, vines, quinces, apples, pears, strawberries, oaks, myrtles, rice, wheat, barley, and maize. Some of this was brought from England, and the rest from when the Fleet stopped at Rio de Janeiro and Capetown.\n\nThe first ship, \"Supply\", reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Aboriginal people from the Cadigal tribe saw the First Fleet ships arrive. Phillip soon decided that this site, picked by Sir Joseph Banks, was not suitable. It had poor soil, no safe place to leave the ships, and no drinking water. Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson.\n\nOn 26 January the marines and convicts arrived at Sydney Cove. 1403 people left Portsmouth. On the voyage 7 babies were born. 69 people died or left the ships. 1332 people landed in Port Jackson which is now known as Sydney. It was a successful trip, as only 40 convicts had died. Phillip named the settlement Sydney after Lord Sydney, the British government's Home Secretary.\n\nThe Aboriginal people from the Eora nation lived in the Sydney area. They could not understand why the British wanted to own their land and make farms with fences. The British did not understand the Aboriginal people's way of living and there was a lot of fighting and many people died.\n\nOnce in Australia, convicts were ordered to build the infrastructure (buildings and prisons) for the new colony. Their punishment was work. Convicts were expected to work everyday except Sunday from sunrise until sunset without a break. Male prisoners were required to do very hard labour. Female convicts often worked as household servants, cooking, cleaning and sometimes taking care of children. Some of the convicts had special skills and did work such as keeping records, printing, making pottery and keeping the town clocks. Many convicts were sent to work for free settlers. Free settlers were people who came to Australia to make a new life. \n\nStrict rules were enforced by prison officers. If convicts broke the rules, they could be whipped with the ‘cat-o’-nine-tails’ or kept in solitary confinement for several days, with only bread and water to eat. \n\nThere was a shortage of food during the first few years of the colony. Crops did not grow well so people relied on supplies from Great Britain. Eventually, food was grown locally. Convict received rations (a share of food and water) every day.\n\nNaval escorts:\nConvict transports:\nFood Transport:\n\n", "id": "124097", "title": "First Fleet"}

The theory behind homeopathy is that an ill person can be healed with very small amounts of something that produces the symptoms of the illness in a healthy person. Scientists say that homeopathy does not work and only makes people think they feel better (this is called the placebo effect.)\n\nHomeopaths make their medicines by taking the ingredients, adding water, and shaking the mixture. They then take a drop of the mixture, throw out the rest, and add more water. They do this usually 30 times but sometimes up to 200 times. They call it potentisation. Hahnemann said this would bring out the \"spirit-like medicinal powers held within a drug\". Science can show how many atoms or molecules - tiny things that cannot be divided up any more - of the original substance are left in the homeopathic drug. In most homeopathic drugs, there is not a molecule left of the substance they started out with. Homeopaths believe that the solution carries a \"memory\" of the original substance. Science says that goes against the laws of physics and chemistry.\n\nHomeopathy became popular because it was created at a time when medicine did not work very well and could make people sick. Back then, taking homeopathy might have kept people from getting hurt by bad doctors. However, medicine has improved since then, and now helps a lot more than it hurts people. Homeopaths have also been known to tell their patients not to take medicines like antibiotics and vaccines that could cure (or keep them from getting) dangerous diseases.\n", "id": "124101", "title": "Homeopathy"}

Temple has the distinction of being the first Academy Juvenile Award recipient in 1934.\n\nTemple began her movie career at age 3 in a series of Poverty Row shorts starring very young children clad in diapers. In 1934, she soared to superstardom in \"Bright Eyes\". Other movies followed that exploited her waiflike charm and abundant talent such as \"Curly Top\", \"The Little Colonel\", \"Dimples\", \"Wee Willie Winkie\", and \"The Little Princess\". \n\nThe public adored the child Temple, but her popularity declined as she grew into a young woman. She made several bombs in her teens, but three have become highly regarded classics: \"Since You Went Away\", \"Fort Apache\" with Henry Fonda and John Wayne, and \"The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer\" with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. Temple married John Agar in 1945. In 1950 she married Charles Black and retired from the movie industry at age 22.\n\nMarriage and motherhood occupied Temple in the following years, but she returned to show biz in the late 1950s with the television series, \"Shirley Temple's Storybook\" for NBC. The series was child/family-oriented with dramatizations of fairy tales like \"Beauty and the Beast\", children's stories like \"Pippi Longstocking\", and more mature fare like \"The House of Seven Gables\" and Victor Herbert's Broadway musical, \"Babes in Toyland\". Celebrity stars like Charlton Heston, Tor Johnson, Sterling Holloway, Elsa Lanchester, and Agnes Moorehead appeared in the series. The series was nominated for an Emmy Award in children's programming. It faced stiff competition from other networks, and left the air after two seasons.\n\nTemple became active in the Republican Party in California. Temple was extensively involved with the Commonwealth Club of California, a public-affairs forum in San Francisco. She spoke at several of the meetings through the years and served as its president in 1984.\n\nTemple was appointed Representative to the 24th United Nations General Assembly by President Richard M. Nixon (September – December 1969), and was appointed United States Ambassador to Ghana (December 6, 1974 – July 13, 1976) by President Gerald R. Ford. She was appointed first female Chief of Protocol of the United States (July 1, 1976 – January 21, 1977), and was in charge of arrangements for President Jimmy Carter's inauguration and inaugural ball. She served as the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (August 23, 1989 – July 12, 1992), having been appointed by President George H. W. Bush.\n\nTemple had breast cancer in the early 1970s and had a mastectomy.

The song \"Walk of Life\", the last single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached Number 25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two BRIT Awards and was named Best Female Star at the \"Smash Hits\" Poll Winners' party, although at the latter ceremony she began crying after being nastily booed by jealous fans of Ritchie Neville, member of boyband Five, whom she was dating at the time.\n\nOn 15 January 2007, BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles started a campaign to get \"Honey to the B\" back into the Top 100 on download sales as a way of testing out new chart rules that favour download sales. The campaign was highly successful, with \"Honey to the Bee\"re-entering the official UK singles chart at #17, eight years after it was first released.\n\nPiper prefers lip singing during performances. She backs this up with the reason that she is afraid she would not be able to sing live. However, in 1999 she decided to try actually singing during her tour in America. The audience loved it, but Piper said it made her too nervous to do it in Britain, where she had many more fans.\n\nAfter an extended break, Piper decided to end her pop career in 2003 and return to her first ambition, acting. She took acting lessons while living in London. Piper gained very good reviews for these appearances and critics said that she was a far better actress than she was a singer.\n\nIn 2004, Piper appeared in the movies \"The Calcium Kid\", as the romantic interest of Orlando Bloom's character, and \"Things to do Before You're Thirty\". Shortly before starting work on \"Doctor Who\", she was one of the main characters in the horror movie \"Spirit Trap\" alongside Russian pop star Alsou, released in the summer of 2005 to bad reviews.\n\nIn May 2004, it was announced that Piper was to play the character Rose Tyler, companion to The Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston, in the long-running BBC television series \"Doctor Who\", beginning in 2005.\nPiper won the Most Popular Actress category at the 2005 and 2006 National Television Awards for her work on \"Doctor Who\". BBC News named Piper as one of its \"Faces of the Year\" for 2005, primarily due to her success in \"Doctor Who\". At \"The South Bank Show\" Awards on 27 January 2006 Piper was awarded \"The Times\" Breakthrough Award for her successful transition from singing to acting. In March 2006, the Television and Radio Industries Club named Piper as best new TV talent at their annual awards ceremony. In September 2006, Piper was named Best Actress at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards.\n\nAfter the completion of the very successful first series of the revamped \"Doctor Who\", the British media regularly released conflicting reports about how long Piper would be staying with the programme. In March 2006, she claimed that she would continue on \"Doctor Who\" into its third season in 2007. On 10 May 2006, however, she was reported to be considering quitting the series, although she did express an interest in playing a female version of the Doctor in the future (possibly related to a proposed \"Doctor Who\" spin-off series about Rose which was later dropped). On 15 June 2006, the BBC announced that she was to depart in the final episode of the second series, \"Doomsday\". Piper's decision to leave had been taken a year previously, but remained a secret until news of her departure became public.\n\nOn 27 November 2007, the BBC confirmed that she would return her role as Rose Tyler in the fourth series for three episodes. Later, it was confirmed by Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Magazine that this return had been planned since she left. It was also revealed in the Turn Left Doctor Who Confidential that Billie had made arrangements to return as Rose since she decided to leave.\n\nThe series began in April 2008, and after several cameos, Piper made her official return as Rose in the series four final episodes Turn Left, The Stolen Earth and Journey's End. She has not said whether she will be reprising the role again, although on Doctor Who Confidential she said that she thinks \"It's never really the end for the Doctor and Rose\" but it probably was \"for the foreseeable future\".\n\nIn November 2005, Piper starred as Hero in a BBC adaptation of \"Much Ado About Nothing\", updated for the modern day like in \"Canterbury Tales\" series in which she featured, with Hero now being a weather presenter in a television station.\n\nPiper has completed work on a BBC version of Philip Pullman's historical novel \"The Ruby in the Smoke\" broadcast in December 2006, Piper played main character Sally Lockhart, a Victorian orphan. The BBC plans to film all four of Pullman's Sally Lockhart novels, with Piper continuing in the role in \"The Shadow in the North\" which was shown in December 2007. In 2007 she appeared as the main character, Fanny Price, in an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel \"Mansfield Park\", screened on ITV1. This was her first acting role on television for a broadcaster other than the BBC.\n\nPiper has provided voiceovers for various television commercials, including one for \"Comfort Fabric Softener\" airing in June 2007.\n\nPiper stars in \"Secret Diary of a Call Girl\", an ITV2 version of Belle de Jour's \"The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl\", a memoir detailing the life of a high-class prostitute. The series, which aired from 27 September 2007, saw Piper in several semi-nude scenes, including a lesbian romp and one scene featuring her saddling a client and riding him like a horse. A second series, with Piper in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which two body doubles were hired in order to effectively hide Piper's pregnancy.\n\nPiper made her first stage appearance in a touring production of Christopher Hampton's play \"Treats\", which opened in early 2007 in Windsor. \"Treats\" was to have ended its tour in the West End, at the Garrick Theatre, starting on 28 February 2007 with previews from on 20 February. The play officially finished as of 26 May.\n\n\n", "id": "124183", "title": "Billie Piper"}

The second series is also about them but is set in a flat. The third is set in a shop.\n\nFielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up performance at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theatre. The pair soon found that they shared comic interests, formed a double act, and \"decided to be the new Goodies\". After their first performance together at a bar in London in April 1998, Barratt and Fielding developed their zookeeper characters - Howard Moon and Vince Noir, respectively - in a series of sketches for Paramount Comedy’s \"Unnatural Acts\". It was here that they also met Rich Fulcher, who would become Bob Fossil. Fielding’s friend Dave Brown and Fielding's own brother Michael also became regular collaborators.\n\nThe Boosh soon produced three stage shows - \"The Mighty Boosh\" (1998), \"Arctic Boosh\" (1999) and \"Autoboosh\" (2000) - all of them were at the Edinburgh Fringe. With the success of \"Autoboosh\", a radio series was commissioned by the BBC. Produced by Danny Wallace, \"The Boosh\" was first broadcast in 2001 on BBC London Live, later moving to BBC Radio 4, from which the team were given a half-hour television show of the same name. \n\nThe first eight-part series, directed by Paul King, was then commissioned for BBC Three and broadcast in 2004, with a second of six episodes the following year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting, and instead Howard, Vince, Naboo the shaman and Bollo the talking ape living in a flat in Dalston. In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with \"The Mighty Boosh Live\", which featured a new story entitled \"The Ruby of Kukundu\".\n\nAfter two years, the Boosh returned to the television in November 2007. Set in Naboo’s second-hand shop below the flat, the third series drew in approximately one million viewers with its first episode, and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an entire night of \"The Mighty Boosh\" on March 22, 2008, which included a new documentary and six of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from all three series.\n\nThere will not be a fourth series till at least 2010 because they will be working upon a movie.

The first British settlements in Australia were started as penal colonies.\n\nLife in penal colony was often very hard, sometimes including severe physical punishment. Some prisoners were sentenced for the rest of their natural lives. Many died from hunger, disease, neglect, working too hard, or trying to escape.\n\nIn the penal colony system, prisoners were sent far away to stop escapes and to make it hard to get home after their prison term finished. Penal colonies were often in unsettled lands, especially places where no else wanted to work or live. The prisoners' unpaid work would help the government develop new areas without spending a lot of money.\n\nThe British used parts of North America as a penal colony. Convicts would be transported by private companies and sold by auction to plantation owners. About 50,000 British convicts were sent to colonial America. This was about one quarter of British settlers during the 1700s.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Britain had to find somewhere else to send its prisoners. They established Sydney, Norfolk Island, Van Diemen's Land and Western Australia as big penal colonies. \n\nIn colonial India, the British had made various penal colonies. Two of the most infamous ones are on the Andaman islands and Hijli Detention Camp. In the early days of settlement, Singapore was sent Indian convicts.

Because they were heavily used, the punched cards often had errors, which needed to be corrected by employees.\n\nHamming codes are used for digital signal processing and telecommunications. Hamming codes are generated according to certain rules. Hamming codes use multiple parity bits. A parity bit tells whether a group of bits is even or odd. In a hamming code, each bit of data is covered by several parity bits. This allows to detect errors, and in certain cases, to correct them as well. A hamming code uses redundancy. If there are three parity bits per code word, the code word must have a length of 7 (formula_1, for k as the number of parity bits). This leaves 4 bits of user data per code word, in the example. Usually, this is written as (N,n), where the first number is the total length of a code word, and the second is the number of bits for user data. The example above is (7,4). \n\nThe shortest possible Hamming code is (3,1), 2 parity bits are used for one data bit.

It ceased to exist on 1 November 1960, when it was replaced by the \"Benelux Economic Union\" after a treaty signed in The Hague on 3 February 1958. It was preceded by the (still existent) Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, established on 25 July 1921. Its founding contributed to the founding of the European Union (EU).\n\nA Benelux Parliament (originally referred to as \"Interparliamentary Consultative Council\") was created in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourgish parliament. The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (\"Benelux Economische Unie/Union Économique Benelux\") was signed 3 February 1958 and came into force in 1960 to promote the free movement of workers, capital, services, and goods in the region. Its secretariat-general is located in Brussels. \n\nIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It entered into force in 1975. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This international judicial institution is in Brussels.\n\nThe Benelux is particularly active in the field of intellectual property. The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both situated in The Hague. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006.\n\nDutch and French are the official languages of the Benelux and its institutions.

(24b18–20)\n\nEach proposition must have some form of the verb 'to be' in it. A categorical syllogism is like a little machine built of three parts: the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion. Each of these parts is a proposition and, from the first two, the \"truth value\" of the third part is decided.\n\nEach of the three distinct terms represents a category. In the above example, \"men,\" \"mortal,\" and \"Greeks.\" \"Mortal\" is the major term; \"Greeks\", the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the \"middle term\"; in this example, \"man.\" Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.\n\nHere, the major term is \"die\", the minor term is \"men,\" and the middle term is \"mortals\". The major premise is universal; the minor premise and the conclusion are particular. Aristotle studied different syllogisms and identified valid syllogisms as syllogisms with conclusion true if both premises are true. The examples above are valid syllogisms.\n\nA sorites is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, if one argues that a given number of grains of sand does not make a heap and that an additional grain does not either, then to conclude that no additional amount of sand will make a heap is to construct a sorites argument.\n\nThe syllogism was replaced by first-order logic after the work of Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. This logic is suitable for mathematics, computers, linguistics and other subjects, because it uses numbers (quantified variables) instead of sentences.\n", "id": "124367", "title": "Syllogism"}

It was published in North America by Atlus, and in PAL regions by Koei. It was later re-released for the PlayStation Portable with extra content, and again on the Nintendo DS. It's about a demon named Laharl, another demon named Etna, and an angel named Flonne. It has two sequels called \"\" and \"\", though the characters in this game are not the main characters in those games. It's linked to a game that was out earlier called \"\", and later games that were made called \"Phantom Brave\" and \"\" that have \"Disgaea\" cameos. It has an anime called \"Makai Senki Disgaea\".\n\nThe game is based in a place called the Netherworld, where demons live. The game also goes outside of the Netherworld to Celestia, a place where angels live, and Earth.\n\n\n\"Disgaea\" starts in a castle where the player controls Laharl. He or she can buy weapons, armor, accessories, and items, cure their team at a hospital, go to a place called Item World, go to a place called the Dark Assembly, or go to another place through a portal.\nThe main gameplay is a turn-based strategy role-playing game. The characters start from a blue portal on the level, and the player can take up to ten people out for a battle. The level is on a grid, and each character can move a certain number of spaces. The player can do many things after they are out of the portal, like attacking, defending, or throwing someone.\nThere are many kinds of items like weapons, armors, accessories, and help items.\nThere are two main kinds of character types - human-shaped characters, like Humans, Angels, and Demons who look like humans, and Monster characters, which are demons who do not look like humans.\nThe Item World is a world where the player can send the characters into an item. The levels in the Item World are randomly made, and at every ten floors, there's a more powerful enemy and an exit. The more floors the player goes to, the stronger the item gets. In Item World, there are also characters called Specialists. If one of the player's characters kills them, they are captured, and make the item more powerful in some ways. For example, if the player captures a Gladiator, the item boosts the attack power of who's holding it.\nThe Dark Assembly is a place where Laharl can go to propose a law, which include a law that gets more expensive \n\nThe PlayStation 2 version of \"Disgaea\" got an award from IGN for \"Best Game no one Played\" in 2003.\n\n", "id": "124368", "title": "Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"}

The movie was released in the United States on March 18, 2003. The movie was produced by Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, Universal Animation Studios, and Nickelodeon; and distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment in North America and Universal Studios Home Entertainment overseas.\n\nThe movie is about a pig named Wilbur, who lives on a farm and has to take care of three young spiders, who are the daughters of the older spider Charlotte who died in the first movie. He must also save his new friend, a friendly black lamb named Cardigan, from being eaten an evil fox named Farley. The sequel was not received very well, with Robert Pardi of TV Guide stating that the movie does not capture the heart and spirit of the original. He also criticized the animation (which he called mediocre, or bad). Mike Long of DVD Talk also said that the animation was mediocre and resembled a Saturday morning cartoon, and that the story was lame.\n\nFebruary 16 2007\n\nThe movie starts in springtime, about a year after Charlotte has died. Charlotte's three daughters, Nellie, Aranea, and Joy, are now teenagers, with Wilbur taking care of them. During this time, Wilbur becomes friends with a newborn lamb named Cardigan, who is rejected by the other lambs and the younger sheep of his flock because he has black wool. Wilbur takes Cardigan under his wing and shows him the farm, the ways of animal life, and dangers to look out for. However, after only a few weeks, farmer Zuckerman suddenly sells Cardigan to another farmer, so Wilbur, along with Charlotte's daughters and Templeton the Rat, set out to visit Cardigan and make sure he is okay.\n\nHowever, Wilbur is hungry so he gets some grapes which make him look purple. Some bark from the trees comes and lands on his head. This makes him look like a wild pig. A near hit by a car then reveals that two other guys have now seen the wild pig. This makes it hard for Wilbur to visit Cardigan.\n\nMeanwhile, an evil fox named Farley comes and steals a hen from the barn. Farly comes and steals Cardigan from the barn, and plans to eat him. Wilbur now must save his friend, and does so by trapping him in a \"pig web\". Charlotte's daughters spin the word \"fox\" in a spider web, and Fern arrives just in time to save Wilbur. The fox, while not shown, is probably disposed of. Aranea and Joy decide to stay with Cardigan, and the movie ends as Wilbur has to baby sit Templeton's kids. He had promised to do this earlier when Templeton had to get Wilbur out of some brambles bushes, which also helped make him look like a wild pig.\n\n\nRobert Pardi of TV Guide reviewed the movie saying \"This 20-years-later follow-up fails to capture the zest (heart/spirt) of the original cartoon, transforming (turning) E. B. White's beloved characters into cute sidekicks worthy of Barney.\" He also said the animation was poor (bad). Mike long, of DVD Talk, reviewed the movie saying \"The lame story isn't helped by the mediocre (bad) at best animation. The art has no real style and could have come from any Saturday morning cartoon. He continuously called the movie different and humorus names: \"Charlotte's Web 2: The Quickening\", \"Charlotte's Web 2: Dead by Dawn\", \"Charlotte's Web 2: Island of Lost Dreams\", \"Charlotte's Web 2: The Nightmare Isn't Over\", \"Charlotte's Web 2: When Nature Calls\", and \"Charlotte's Web 2: The Wrath of Khan\". He went on to say that \"as \"Charlotte's Web\" is one of my all-time favorite stories, I had a great interest in \"Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure\". However, what I found was a bargain-basement sequel that does nothing to advance the original stories or characters. The DVD offers a very nice transfer, but the extras are pointless. There will be no spiders claiming that this is \"Some DVD\".\" Out of five stars, he gave the content a one, the video a four, the audio a four, the extras a one, and the overall reply a one, with the advice to skip it. The one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes that weighed in on the movie, Brian Webster of apolloguide.com, gave it rotten as well. Their summery of their review was \"This is the sort of bland adventure that kids will have seen a hundred times before, with not-so-tense near-misses and not-so-exciting chases along the way.\" \n\n\n", "id": "124369", "title": "Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure"}

The constellation is normally represented as an eagle. \n\nAquila is just a few degrees North of the celestial equator. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are within its borders. However, they are dim and there are not many galaxies.\n\nAquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. \n\nThe Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is in the same area as the Greek constellation.\n\nTwo major novae have been observed in Aquila. The first one was in 389 BC and was recorded as being as bright as Venus. The other was in 1918 and is known as (Nova Aquilae 1918). It briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila.\n\nThree interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila:\n\nIn illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair. The tips of the wings spread out to the southeast and northwest. The head of the eagle stretches off to the southwest.\n\nIn mythology, Aquila was owned by the Roman god Jupiter and did many tasks for him.\n\nIn a book by Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man (LU.USH) in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the Classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology, Aquila was identified as Αετός Δίας (\"Aetos Dios\"). He was the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus. He was sent by Zeus to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede to Mount Olympus. The constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede.\n\nIn the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Niu Lang (Altair) and his two children (β and γ Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu (Vega) who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way.\n\nIn Hinduism, the constellation Aquila is identified with the half-eagle half-human deity Garuda.\n\nIn Chinese astronomy, ζ Aql is within the Heavenly Market Enclosure (天市垣, \"Tiān Shì Yuán\"), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North (北方玄武, \"Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ\").\n\n\n", "id": "124498", "title": "Aquila (constellation)"}

Its name means Great Bear in Latin. It was named that because many different groups of people around the world have thought that its stars look a lot like a bear with a long tail. All of the stars in the constellation except Dubhe and Alkaid are moving toward the same point in the sky through proper motion. This group of stars is known as the Ursa Major Moving Group.\n\nSeveral bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major, including the pair Messier 81 (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and Messier 82 above the bear's head, and the Pinwheel galaxy (M101), a beautiful spiral galaxy northwest of the star η Ursae Majoris. Other well-known spiral galaxies are NGC 4102, NGC 4605, Messier 108 and Messier 109. The constellation has about 50 galaxies that can be seen with a small telescope. The Owl nebula, the brightest planetary nebula, can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper. \n\nThe seven stars in the upper-left corner of Ursa Major form an called the Big Dipper (or the Plough in Great Britain). This group has been recognized by almost all groups of people who live or lived in places where it can be seen in the sky and it is one of the best-known star patterns. The Big Dipper is helpful in finding the north star because an imaginary line drawn through the two stars on the right side will point directly at the north star.

Just like the related constellation Ursa Major, or the Big Bear or Big Dipper, it seems to have a long handle leading to a cup or ladle. The end of the handle is the North Star, called Polaris.\n\nThe ancient astronomer Ptolemy included Ursa Minor in his list of 48 constellations. It is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor is special because it includes the north celestial pole. However, this will change after several hundred years because the Earth will change the direction of its axis. That movement is called precession\n\nUrsa Minor is often called the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to be in the shape of a dipper (ladle or scoop). The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris, the North Star.\n\nPolaris is the brightest star in the constellation. It is a 'yellow-white' supergiant shining at 2.02 apparent magnitude. It belongs to an unusual class of stars called Cepheid variables. The brightness of Polaris can change. The second brightest star is β UMi (Kochab). It is a 2.08 orange giant star.\n\nThe four stars in the \"bowl\" of the little dipper are very useful for star watchers. They are of second, third, fourth and fifth magnitude. These stars are an easy guide to knowing what magnitude stars are visible. This is helpful for people who live in cities where light can make dim stars hard to see. It is also a way of testing your eyesight.\n\nThere is one dwarf galaxy in the area of the constellation. It is called Ursa Minor Dwarf.\n\nDrawings of Ursa Minor often show it as a baby bear with an unusually long tail. In some stories, the tail is so long because the baby bear was held by the tail and spun around the pole.\n\nGreek mythology connected Ursa Minor and Ursa Major to the story of Callisto and Arcas. However, one older version of the story has Boötes in place of Arcas. In that story Ursa Minor was a dog. This earlier tradition explains both the length of the tail and an older name for Polaris. The North Star used to be called \"Cynosura\" which means the dog's tail.\n\nIn another story from early Greek mythology, the seven stars of the Little Dipper were seven sisters. They were Atlas' daughters, the Hesperides. They were part of a story with the nearby constellations Boötes, Ursa Major, and Draco.\n\n\n\n", "id": "124504", "title": "Ursa Minor"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=124505", "text": "Polaris (star)\n\nPolaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) is the Pole Star or North Star. \n\nIt is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. It is almost straight above Earth's north pole. Because of this, when it is seen from Earth, it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky. Many years ago, sailors in the northern hemisphere used Polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving.\n\nThere are some interesting facts about Polaris. The first is that it is part of a triple star system. It has a very close dwarf binary, and a larger star, Polaris B, which orbits 2,400 AU away.\n\nThe main Polaris A star is a giant with 4.5 times the mass of the Sun. It is a classic Cepheid variable, the closest to us in the whole Milky Way. Polaris B can be seen even with a modest telescope. It was found by William Herschel in 1780 using one of the most powerful telescopes of the time: his own reflecting telescope. The nearby dwarf star, Ab, was predicted in 1929, but only seen quite recently. The dwarf orbits as close to A as Uranus is to our sun.\n\nEven though Polaris is the North Star today, this has not always been the case. The place in the sky that the Earth's north pole points at changes slowly over time. This movement is called stellar precession. In 3000 BC, a faint star called Thuban in the constellation of Draco was the North Star. Polaris did not become the North Star until about AD 500. It will get closer to straight above the Earth's north pole until sometime in 2102. Then it will move away again. It will be the closest star to the pole until about AD 3000.\n\nSurprisingly, considering its relative nearness, its distance is not yet known for certain. Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 434 light-years (133 parsecs). However, some suggest it may be as much as 30% closer. If correct, this would be especially notable because Polaris is the closest Cepheid variable to Earth. Its physical parameters are critical to the whole astronomical distance scale.\n", "id": "124505", "title": "Polaris (star)"}

It stars Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. The story is set six months after the events of \"Iron Man\". Tony Stark has revealed his identity as Iron Man. He is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the technology. Ivan Vanko, meanwhile, has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own.\n\nAfter the successful release of \"Iron Man\" in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same same year, Theroux was hired to write the script. Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey and Paltrow were to repeat their roles from \"Iron Man\". Cheadle was brought in to replace Terrence Howard in the role of James Rhodes. In early 2009, Rourke, Rockwell and Johansson completed the supporting cast. The movie went into production that summer. Like its predecessor, the movie was shot mostly in California, except for a key sequence in Monaco.\n", "id": "124528", "title": "Iron Man 2"}

White. It was made into an animated musical movie by Hanna Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. The movie, sent to theaters by Paramount Pictures on March 1, 1973, is the first of only three Hanna Barbera movies not based upon one of their famous television cartoons. The song score of music and lyrics was written by the Sherman Brothers.\n\nThe movie has stayed popularity over the years because of television and VHS; in 1994 the movie became one of the best selling movies of the year, 21 years after its first premiere. No other non-Disney musical animated movie has become so popular again later. This new popularity helped to create a direct-to-video sequel, \"\", which Paramount released in the US on March 18, 2003 (Universal released the movie internationally), followed by a live-action movie version of E. B. White's original story, which was released on December 15, 2006. The movie was presented by Pulitzer Prize in 1985, the year in which author E. B. White died. E. B. White himself wrote about it.\n\nA litter of 11 piglets are born to a mother pig on a farm owned by the Arable family. The 11th of the 11 baby pigs is a very small and the mother pig can't feed it. So John Arable decides to \"do away with it\". However, when his daughter, Fern Arable, hears of the pig's fate she rescues him and tells her father it is unfair to kill a helpless piglet since it is smaller than the others. John agrees and Fern is allowed to keep the little piglet as a pet naming him Wilbur. Fern and Wilbur loved each other. Fern takes Wilbur around in a baby carriage and gives him a bath. However, after only six weeks of raising him, John Arable tells Fern that it's time for him to be sold. Wilbur was no longer a baby pig but a full grown pig. Fern sadly says good-bye as the young pig is sold down the street to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman. When Wilbur wants to play with a lamb, the lamb's father says that sheeps do not play with pigs because it's only a matter of time before they are turned into smoked bacon and ham. Wilbur starts crying saying that he does not want to die, but a voice from above tells him to \"chin up\". Wilbur goes to sleep feeling better.\n\nThe next day the voice sings a song about \"chinning up\", and reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte. Charlotte saves Wilbur by writing messages in her web, which is why the movie is called \"Charlotte's Web.\" She starts to write messages in her web, calling him \"terrific\" and \"some pig.\" The messages get a lot of attention from the media and other neighbors to the fair. Wilbur is such a media hit that this convinces the Arables, Zuckermans and Fussys to keep him and not kill him. Charlotte eventually lays her eggs and dies. When the baby spiders are born (514), most of them leave. Three of them stay, and for a number of years a few of Charlotte's kids stay around the farm and keep Wilbur company. But as much as Wilbur loves them, they will never replace the memory of his friend Charlotte.\n\nThe movie was released to theaters on March 1, 1973 by Paramount Pictures in the United States. It was released on February 22, 1973 in New York City in less theaters, and also released in West Germany on March 30, 1973, as well as August 11 in Sweden, and August 25 in Japan.\n\nRotten Tomatoes says that the movie has a 74% \"fresh\" rating based on 19 reviews, with a score of 6.6. The RT community gave the movie an 86% approval rating, with a score of 7/10.\nCraig Butler of All-Movie Guide criticized the animation and the musical score, but said it was close to the book. He said that, “no attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the story's core” (no one tried to soften the major sad parts of the story, like when Charlotte dies at the end). Dan Jardine criticized the songs and the “Saturday morning cartoon quality” of the animation, but also says that Hamner kept just enough of White’s prose to keep the movie from being only an experiment that did not work out. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said that the animation is sometimes “downright bad, but E. B. White's classic fable needs little to make it come to life”. He later went on to say that the movie is “a must-own for anyone with children, and a must-see for everyone else.” He rated it four out of five stars. When it was reissued on DVD the movie was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award.\n\nAccording to Gene Deitch, a director of animation and friend of E. B. White, the author's wife wrote the following words in a 1977 letter: \"We have never ceased to regret that your version of \"Charlotte's Web\" never got made. The Hanna-Barberra version has never pleased either of us... a travesty...\" E.B. White himself wrote of the film: \"The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song. I do not care much for jolly songs. The Blue Hill Fair, which I tried to report faithfully in the book, has become a Disney World, with 76 trombones. But that's what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood.\"\n\n\n\"Chin Up\" is sung by Charlotte the spider when she first meets Wilbur the pig in the barnyard. She convinces him to look on the bright side.\n\n\"I Can Talk!\" is sung by Wilbur the pig who had previously been unable to utter words. The Goose realizes as she is sitting on her eggs that her new neighbor in the pen beside her, Wilbur the pig, has not been eating his food, and that he seems to be sad. She offers him an ear if he will come over to her and talk since she cannot get off of her eggs. But soon she realizes that Wilbur cannot talk. She encourages him to try... And with a couple grunts, and a \"Wa... Wa... Wa\" \"Wi... Wi... Will...bur.. WILBUR!\" Suddenly, with the Goose's help, Wilbur realizes he can talk and say all the things he wants. Wilbur sings a song about his new talking skills, while waking up some of the other farm animals with his excitement.\n\n\"A Veritable Smorgasbord\" is introduced and sung in the story by the Goose, sung again by the Goose and Templeton. It is sung another time, this time at a \"double time\" tempo sung solo by Templeton.\n\n\"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\" is the title given to Wilbur the pig hero which saves him from being killed in the story, and the theme of the finale song in the movie. The song was composed and arranged in a barbershop quartet style by the Sherman Brothers, in keeping with the time and place of the story. It was covered by the Brady Kids and was chosen for release on their first single taken from \"The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album\" by producer Jackie Mills.\n\n\"We've Got Lots in Common\" is sung by Wilbur to the new gosling (baby goose), Jeffery, who, like Wilbur, is a runt. Wilbur passes on one of the lessons which Charlotte has taught him. The other barnyard animals sing along as well. In the advertisement for suppliers of the movie, a rare piece of footage of the Sherman Brothers singing \"We've Got Lots In Common\" can be seen. In this part, Richard Sherman plays piano while Robert Sherman stands over his brother's shoulder and sings along. The song was filmed in an unnamed recording studio in Los Angeles in 1972.\n\n\"Mother Earth and Father Time\" is introduced in the story by Charlotte and sang a second time in the movie as Charlotte is dying. According to \"The Annotated Charlotte's Web\" by Peter F. Neumeyer, some fans of the book are not in favor of the song's placement in the movie because it ruins E. B. White's strong words from the book, \"...And she didn't move again.\" which many people find extremely moving. The Sherman Brothers' father, songwriter Al Sherman, believed the \"Charlotte's Web\" song score, and \"Mother Earth and Father Time\" in particular, to be the brothers' finest work. The lyric addresses the idea of thinking about one's life. In the storyline the song is sung by Charlotte at the end of her life. Ironically, Al Sherman died shortly after the movie was released.\n\n\"There Must Be Something More\" is introduced in the story when Fern is learning about love from a little runt she saved from an \"untimely death\", when her father was about to \"do away with it\". Fern found it to be an injustice, and relates herself, saying to her father if she had been small, would he have killed her too? Her father gives in and lets her raise the pig she names Wilbur. Fern learns about love and life through Wilbur, and sings a song to tell Wilbur just how much she loves him. The song goes through the first two weeks of Wilbur's life with Fern. The song is sung by Fern to a baby Wilbur in a motherly way. The song is then sang again briefly by Wilbur when Fern gets a bit older begins to show an interest in young \"Henry Fussy\". Suddenly Wilbur is no longer so important in Fern's life. Charlotte explains to Wilbur that this is the nature of the world.\n\n\"Charlotte's Web\" is the title song of the movie. In the movie the song is sung back-to-back with \"Deep in the Dark\". The title song was covered by The Brady Bunch among others. In the movie, Charlotte tells Wilbur to go to sleep, and she would see him in the morning, and she sings a song called \"Deep In the Dark\" to put the barnyard to sleep.\n\nThe title song was covered (when an artist sings a song that is not their own) by The Brady Bunch among others: \"The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album\" features three Sherman Brothers songs including \"River Song\" from \"Tom Sawyer\", \"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\" and \"Charlotte's Web\". Their cover of the song is also featured on their \"Greatest hits\" album \"It's a Sunshine Day: The Best of The Brady Bunch\".\n\n", "id": "124555", "title": "Charlotte's Web (1973 movie)"}

According to researchers, the total population of the group is estimated to be around 50 million.\n\nSome Pashtuns believe that their ancestors were ancient Hebrews who arrived to what is now Afghanistan over 2,000 years ago and setteled there. However, scholars believe that the Pashtuns are of mixed origins, intermingling of ancient Aryans from the north with subsequent migrants, travellers or invaders. They were first mentioned by a Greek historian in 500 BC, then by Alexander the Great, and in the 3rd century they are called \"Abgans\" (\"Afghans\") by the Persian rulers. In the army of the Ghaznavids and Ghurids, thousands of Afghans were reported to be serving. They ruled Delhi Sultanate in the past and also Persia between 1725 to 1729 until they established the last Afghan empire that became to what is now Afghanistan.\n\nThe Pashtun people follow a strict code of honor, known as \"Pakhtunwali\", that requires them to support the poor, the weak, and the challenged; to fight evil; to provide shelter to anyone who needs it and many more. Pashtun are also strict with obedience with in their families and society. They are also known as the best at welcoming guests and taking good care of them. They really love to see respectful people around the society with great manners and obedience. \n\nThe Pashtuns are mostly farmers, herdsmen, and warriors but many of them are also businessmen and politicians. Most tribesmen are sedentary farmers, combining cultivation with animal husbandry; some are migratory herdsmen and caravaners. Large numbers of them have always been attracted to military service.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Pashtun make up around 50% of the total population. They form about 60 tribes of different size and importance, each of which occupies a different territory. In Afghanistan, where Pashtun are the major ethnic group, the main tribes are the Durrani who mostly live in the south and west, and the Ghilzai live in northern and eastern parts of the country.\n\nThey are over 15% of Pakistan's population, with Peshawar and Quetta being their principal cities. They predominate north of Quetta between the Sulaiman Range and the Indus River. Significant number of Pashtuns also live in most other major Pakistani cities, particularly Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore. In the hill areas the main tribes are, from south to north: the Tarin, Kakaṛ, Sherani, and Ustarana south of the Gumal River; the Maḥsud, Darwesh Khel, Waziri, and Biṭani between the Gumal River and Thal; the Turi, Bangash, Orakzay, Afridi, and Shinwari from Thal to the Khyber Pass; and the Mahmand, Utman Khel, Tarklani, and Yusufzay north and northeast of the Khyber.\n", "id": "124708", "title": "Pashtun people"}

The name of the conflict may be derived from a pun on the term \"Cold War\" (with \"cod\" reading so similarly to \"cold\"), possibly via the British tabloid press.\n\nIn 1972, Iceland unilaterally declared an Exclusive Economic Zone extending beyond its territorial waters, before announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. It policed its quota system with the coast guard, leading to a series of net-cutting incidents with British trawlers that fished the areas. As a result, a fleet of British Royal Naval warships and tug-boats was employed to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of British fishing crews by the Icelandic craft.\n\nIn 1976, a compromise between the two states allowed a maximum of 24 British trawlers access to the disputed 200 nautical mile (370 km) limit. Two-hundred-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zones became recognized internationally on November 14, 1994, after having been agreed at the conference on the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982.\n", "id": "124709", "title": "Cod wars"}

The constellation has other names in different cultures: it is mentioned under a Hebrew name in the Book of Job.\n\nThe constellation has a clear hour-glass shape with \"Orion's Belt\" in the centre. That part is made up of three bright stars (Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka) in line. The Orion constellation has 81 visible stars, including some of the brightest and most important stars in the night sky. Rigel is the brightest star in it, and Betelgeuse is a huge, rather unstable red giant. \n\nThe constellation includes a series of starburst nebulae where new stars are forming. The whole group of nebulae is known as the Orion complex. The complex is 1,500 to 1,600 light-years away, and hundreds of light-years across. It includes\n\nIn Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter who joined Artemis's Hunt. He was the first ever male to ever enter the Hunt. Inevitably, he slowly started getting closer to Artemis, and eventually fell in love with her, even though he knew she had sworn an oath of maidenhood. Artemis did not sense this at the time, so she let him stay in the Hunt. The problem was that Orion was too good a hunter, and got in over his head. He killed too many animals, which was against the Hunters' nature, which was not to harm nature if it was not of danger to them. Gaea, the Earth Spirit, sensed this, and sent a giant scorpion to kill him, to punish him for his sins against nature. Artemis mourned his death, and herself made a constellation dedicated him, namely, the Orion's Belt.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians equated the constellation with Osiris, god of the afterlife. The ancient Egyptian \"First Time\", \"when Osiris walked on the Earth\", has by some fringe archeologists been held to be around 10,500 BC; thanks to precession (which was known to the astronomers of the Early Dynasties), around that time at the Spring Equinox the constellation could be seen \"walking\" on the horizon just before dawn.\n", "id": "124713", "title": "Orion (constellation)"}

Before the launching of the Hipparcos satellite telescope, distance estimates for the star varied widely, from 96 light years to 1200 light years. Hipparcos established Canopus as lying 310 light years (96 parsecs) from our solar system. \n\nThe difficulty in measuring Canopus' distance stemmed from its being a \"less luminous supergiant\". Such stars are rare and poorly understood. They are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from red giant status. This in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright Canopus is, and therefore how far away it might be. Direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem. Canopus is too far away for Earth-based parallax observations to be made, so the star's distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s.\n\nCanopus is 13,600 times more luminous than the Sun and the most intrinsically bright star within about 700 light years. In fact, from 1 astronomical unit, Canopus would have an apparent magnitude of -37. Canopus appears less bright than Sirius in our sky only because Sirius is much closer to the Earth (8.6 light years).\n\nThe surface temperature of Canopus is 7350 ± 30 K. Its diameter has been measured at 0.6 astronomical units (the measured angular diameter being 0.006 arcseconds), 65 times that of the Sun. If it were placed at the centre of the solar system, it would extend three-quarters of the way to Mercury. An Earth-like planet would have to lie three times the distance of Pluto for its star to appear the same size in the sky as our own sun.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125097", "text": "Flying disc\n\nA flying disc is a flat round object with a thick rim. The rim make the disc easier to grip and throw, and also keeps the disc from turning over as it flies. Detailed throwing instructions are below, but the basic goal is to throw the disc while also making the disc spin. \n\nAlso mentioned below is a flying ring, made under the brand name Aerobie. Although these designs are very different, they both use air resistance in the same way to fly.\n\nUnlike the Aerobie, flying discs are used in both Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Golf. The Frisbee brand of flying disc is rarely used in official competition in either game, which is why the team sport of Ultimate Frisbee is officially called simply \"Ultimate.\" Still, as \"Kleenex\" was once a word used to mean \"facial tissue,\" \"Frisbee\" is still broadly used as a synonym for a flying disc.\n\nThe Aerobie Superdisk is an alternative design of flying disc that, although somewhat differently shaped, still has very similar properties to the conventional disc. It has less air resistance. Because there is less resistance to motion, the Aerobie discs can fly farther than the conventional disc. The Aerobie flying ring has minimal drag and holds the world record for the longest flight by a human-thrown projectile. However, due to the lack of a rim, the Aerobie is less suited to angled, curved flights and air-bouncing.\n\nThe spin of the disc helps to keep the disc stable in flight and prevent unplanned tilting. This is because a large angular momentum stabilises the disc in the same way that it keeps a gyroscope steady, with the angular force forcing the mass of the disc away from the centre of mass, perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Any unequal force acting on a particular area of the disc is quickly redirected to be equal over the circumference of the disc.\n\nAs the disc spins faster, it becomes more stable due to the rapidity of the equalisation of forces.\n\nThe force required to accelerate the disc is directly proportional to the mass of the disc. This decreases the acceleration of the disc, assuming that the force of projection is constant. Therefore, discs come in a variety of weights, although those used for Ultimate are mainly 175 g in mass, heavier than the majority of discs and considerably heavier than an aerobie.\n\nFlying discs (including Frisbees) can be thrown in many ways. All involve spinning the disc to give it gyroscopic stability, and accelerating its mass to a certain velocity. Without spin, a disc will wobble and fall; without velocity, the disc will not go anywhere. Using these two guidelines, any number of throws are possible. Most discs are designed to create lift when thrown with the flat side up.\n\nRight-side up throws are all similar in that they react the same way to the tilt of the disc when it is released. A disc thrown right-side up will accelerate in the direction of the low end of the disc. A disc tilted leading-edge up will lose speed at the end of the throw and make a gentle landing; if tilted sideways (known in aeronautics terms as roll), it can curve around objects.\n\nThere is a language for describing throws that curve. Both descriptions are relative to the direction the person is facing and intends to throw. This axis is marked in \"red\" in the picture.\n\n\nThis is probably the most commonly learned throw, and also one of the most powerful. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis throw is also known as the \"flick,\" \"two-finger,\" or the \"side-arm\". Focused in the wrist, this throw takes little time to execute. Along with the backhand, it is one of the two most common throws used in Ultimate.\n\n\n\nThe forehand is a versatile throw, and can be adapted to many different situations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Push Pass: A relatively little-used throw, it is thrown with a grip similar to a backhand (index finger on the outer rim of the disc, thumb on top, other fingers curled underneath) but is released on the forehand side from a forehand stance. A pronating wrist snap similar to a forehand release pushes the disc forward, while spin is imparted \"backwards\" by rolling the disc off the index finger. A final flick of the index finger finishes the release. It is difficult to impart as much spin to the push pass as one can typically impart to a forehand or backhand, resulting in a less stable throw. It is useful in Ultimate for very short throws released to the forehand side.\n\nThe thumber forehand is also known as a The Beach Thumber, Peach, or in the sport of guts, simply as a thumber. Its primary advantage is that it can be thrown quite hard and with a great amount of spin, and is relatively easy to learn. It is often seen used in a game of Guts due to its power and velocity. It is unpopular in Ultimate due to several disadvantages when compared to the standard forehand. It is relatively difficult to impart different curves or release angles to, it is harder to release extended away from the thrower's body, and it makes for slow grip transitions to a backhand or hammer.\n\n\n\nThe Overhand (also known as \"Hungarian\", \"flamingo\", \"dragonwing\", \"windmill\", \"waffle\", \"discus\", \"wrist-hook\", \"chicken wing\", or \"biscuit\") is rarely used among ultimate players, because the alternative, the traditional forehand, allows greater sideways arm extension, useful in moving the disc around defenders. The Overhand is most useful when the disc is caught above the head and must be thrown quickly without changing grips, such as during a Greatest attempt.\n\n\n\nThe Duck (also known as a \"bear claw\", a \"duder,\" or a \"useless\") is thrown with a similar grip to the Overhand, except it is the backward version of it. While the Overhand is thrown with counter-clockwise spin (for right-handers), the duck is thrown with clockwise spin. It is usually thrown with the arm out to the side or above the head. It is called the duck due to the shape of the gripping hand during the throw, as if making a duck shadow puppet. This throw is used in attempts at The Greatest (jumping out of bounds and throwing the Frisbee back in to play while in the air).\n\nA disc thrown upside-down has a very different flight path than one thrown right-side up. The lift force does not enforce stable flight as it does on a right-side up disc, resulting in a more of a parabolic arc in flight. As with a right-side up throw, however, the flight path of the disc will curve toward the lower edge. This banking effect is most pronounced when the disc is at a 45 degree angle, and less pronounced when it is near-vertical, or near-horizontal. \n\nGyroscopic precession causes the disc to rotate toward horizontal through its flight path. Unlike a right-side up throw, however, an upside-down disc will not precess toward a stable flat state, and will in stead oscillate past horizontal and begin to bank in the opposite direction. This shuttlecock-like effect is known as \"helixing\", and is generally avoided due to the difficulty in controlling a helixing flight path. For this reason, an upside down throw is typically released with either clockwise rotation and the left edge up, or counterclockwise rotation and the right edge up. The longer the disc is expected to remain in the air, the closer to vertical it must be at release to avoid the helixing effect.\n\nThe Hammer is gripped just like a normal forehand throw, and is generally a mid-range, high and arching throw.\n\n\n\nA hammer, when thrown by a right-handed thrower, will arc up and to the left as it moves away from the thrower, and will bank towards the right in flight. The banking effect will be more pronounced if the disc is thrown higher and spends more flight time near a 45 degree angle.\n\nAnother upside-down variant of the forehand, the scoober (also known as the \"Spoon pass\" or \"Hiawatha\") is similar to a hammer, but released away from the body from a backhand stance, instead of over the head from a forehand stance. The scoober travels in a path similar to the hammer, although the initial release is typically more flat than a hammer release. Although it is more difficult to impart power to a scoober than a hammer, a scoober can be an effective short-range (10 to 20 yards/meters) throw and is used in Ultimate for breaking the mark and to throw over defenders in a zone defense.\n\n\nThe Thumber (not to be confused with the \"thumber forehand\") is a throw that is rarely used in competitive play, compared to the Hammer or standard forehand. It has a flight path that is the mirror-image of the Hammer (arcing high and to the right for a right-handed thrower). It can be useful when the disc needs to drop quickly and fly with an opposite curve to a Hammer in order to avoid defenders.\n\n\nThis table represents the fundamental disc throws with classic technique in the foreword form, in fact exist many variations of throws and grips that make the number of pitches quite infinite. \n\nThe \"natural path\" is the trajectory the disc takes without pre-release tilt.\n\nThe \"hyzer path\" is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted downward.\n\nThe \"anhyzer path\" is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted upward.\n\nThe \"spin\" is the rotation of the disc.\n\nEvery throw can be done with the right hand or the left hand and this is shown in the \"hand\" column.\n\nRH=right hand, LH=left hand, R=the path tends to the right of the thrower, L=the path tends to the left of the thrower, 0 means that the path is quite linear.\n\nSo R with RH and L with LH are outside-in (OI) paths; R with LH and L with RH are inside-out (IO) paths.\n\nIn \"spin\" column numbers represent the sign of the angular momentum relative to the upside of the disc (+1=positive (counter-clockwise rotation), -1=negative (clockwise rotation)).\n\nThrows may be signed as follows: hand acronym+throw acronym+tilt acronym. For example LHBHIO is an inside out backhand throw pitched with the left hand; RHFH0 is a linear forehand throw pitched with the right hand. To have linear paths the disc must be released with a light opposite tilt than his \"natural path\".\n\n", "id": "125097", "title": "Flying disc"}

It is recognised as one of the official languages of the country.\n\nAlthough British rule in South Asia lasted for almost two hundred years, the areas that are now Pakistan were some of the last places to be taken over by the British. Punjab (which included the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province) was captured in 1849, Sindh a few years before; while Balochistan was never fully taken over by the British. This meant that English had less time to become part of local culture. However, in 1947, when Pakistan became independent, English (along with Urdu) became Pakistan's official language - this was written into law in 1973.\n\nPakistani English has many similarities with Indian English, but since Independence there have been some very obvious differences. These include words and phrases not used in India, as well as accents. Foreign companies find accent naturalisation easier in Pakistan than in India. However, like Indian English, Pakistani English has preserved many phrases that are now considered old in Britain.\n\nEnglish is Pakistan's official language. All government documents, military communications, street signs, many shop signs, business contracts and other activities are in English. The language of the courts is also English.\nEnglish is taught to all school level Pakistani students, and in many cases English is also the language used to teach the students other subjects. At College and University level all instruction is in English.\nPakistan has a large English language press and (more recently) media. All of Pakistan's major dailies are published in or have an edition in English. Dawn News is a major English Language News Channel.\n\nSince English in Pakistan is a well-established and popular, expanding language, people there read and write in it too. Pakistani English literature is increasingly making its mark worldwide. A List of English language writers from Pakistan is given here, listing some of the better known literary figures.\n", "id": "125122", "title": "Pakistani English"}
