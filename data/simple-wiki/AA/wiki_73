{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310949", "text": "Wildfire\n\nWildfire is a general term which includes forest fires, grassland fires, bushfires, brush fires and any other vegetation fire in countryside areas.\n\nWildfires occur on every continent except Antarctica. They can occur naturally, but many are caused by humans, accidentally or deliberately. Fossil records and human history show that wildfires do occur at intervals. \n\nWildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life, but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas. Some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction, although large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects.\n\nStrategies of wildfire prevention, detection, and suppression have varied over the years. One of the more controversial techniques is controlled burning: permitting or lighting small fires to cut the amount of flammable material for a potential wildfire. While some wildfires burn in remote forested regions, they can cause extensive destruction of homes and other property in the zone between developed areas and undeveloped wilderness.\n\nPlants in wildfire-prone ecosystems often have adaptations to their local conditions. Such adaptations include physical protection against heat, increased growth after a fire event, and flammable materials that encourage fire and eliminate competition. For example, plants of the genus \"Eucalyptus\" contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves that resist heat and drought. This makes them dominant over less fire-tolerant species. Dense bark, shedding lower branches, and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures. Fire-resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation, as shown by 'pioneer' species, which are first to start up after a fire. \n\nSmoke, charred wood, and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds. Smoke from burning plants promotes contains orange butenolide, which induces germination of seeds.\n\nGrasslands in Western Sabah, Malaysian pine forests, and Indonesian \"Casuarina\" forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire. The deadwood litter of Chamise (Californian greasewood shrub) is low in water content and flammable, and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire. \"Sequoia\" relies on periodic fires to reduce competition, release seeds from their cones, and clear the soil and canopy for new growth. Some have adapted to, and rely on, low-intensity surface fires for survival and growth. The optimum fire frequency for Caribbean pine in Bahamian pineyards is every 3 to 10 years. Too frequent fires favour herbaceous plants, and infrequent fires favour other tree species.\n\n", "id": "310949", "title": "Wildfire"}

A bipod is sometimes attached to a firearm to help support it. It also makes it more stable. It gives the best stability along two axes of motion: side-to-side and up-and-down. \n\nOn firearms, bipods are often used on rifles and shotguns to allow the gun to rest and stop it from moving. They can also be seen on long-barrelled weapons. The bipod allows the gunner to rest the weapon on the ground, a short wall or other object. This allows for more accuracy. Different types of bipods are set up in different ways. Some bipods are a specific length that can not be changed, but some bipods' length can be changed. Mostly, when bipods are not being used, they are folded forwards, not back towards the gunner. Some types of bipod can fold into grips for the gunner to hold to keep the weapon steady.\n\nWhen firing a weapon without a bipod, it is harder to aim and keep the weapon steady.\nThe good thing about having a bipod is that it makes weapons more accurate. At first, the bipod was only used on long-barreled rifles, such as snipers. However, light and heavy machine guns now use them, as well as small pistols. \n", "id": "310960", "title": "Bipod"}

Many brands want to be cultural icons, but fail. Cultural icons are often timeless, imprinted in our consciousness. They can go through several stages, from \"rumblings, undercurrents\" via \"catharsis, explosion\" and \"mass acceptance, ripple effect\" to \"glorification, representative value\". While brands are rational and driven by features, cultural icons are emotional, free, driven by feeling, and creating emotional bonds. An example of \"branding\" might include the wearing of a consistent fashion look by such music stars as Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley, making them instantly recognizable. Royal or church clothing could also be understood as a form of emotional iconography.\n\nExamples include: Andy Warhol, Budweiser, BMW, Chanel, Coca-Cola, Guinness, Harley-Davidson, LEGO, Martha Stewart, Nike, Norman Rockwell, Vuitton, Škoda Auto...\n\nCultural icons may be national, regional or about a city. And they can be symbols for a nation, or can show the values held by that state. For example, France uses Marianne as a symbol of the French Revolution. Bruce Lee is a symbol for the martial arts and philosophical culture of insight and knowledge in the entire world. Charlie Chaplin symbolises comical action while Clint Eastwood is a symbol for strength and masculinity. Jackie Chan is a global icon of comical stunts and martial arts based action.

A writer in \"Liverpool Daily Post\" calls \"iconic\" \"a word that makes my flesh creep\", a word \"pressed into service to describe almost anything\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311037", "text": "Defence against herbivory\n\nDefence against herbivory describes plant defences to avoid being eaten. There are many adaptations which improve the survival and reproduction of plants by reducing the impact of herbivores. \n\nPlants use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores. Many plants produce chemicals which change the behaviour, growth, or survival of herbivores. These chemical defences can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores, or reduce plant digestibility. Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores, which in turn protect the plant. \n\nOther defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place. They may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores. They may grow when herbivores are not around. Herbivores may get diverted towards non-essential parts, or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory. \n\nEach type of defence can be either \"constitutive\" (always present in the plant), or \"induced\" (produced in reaction to damage or stress caused by herbivores). Plants can and do react to damage. \n\nHistorically, insects have been the most significant herbivores, and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects. While most plant defences are directed against insects, other defences have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defences against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also because these defences can be used in agriculture, including human and livestock food sources.\n\nThe earliest land plants evolved from aquatic plants around 450 million years ago (mya) in the Ordovician period. These early land plants had no vascular tissue and needed free water for their reproduction. Vascular plants appeared later and their diversification began in the Devonian era (about 400 mya). They had adaptations such as protective coatings to reduce evaporation from their tissues. \n\nReproduction and dispersal of vascular plants in these dry conditions was achieved through the evolution of specialized seed structures. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) during the Cretaceous period is associated with the sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.\n\nOur understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; the observation of plant debris in fossilised coprolite (animal faeces); and the construction of herbivore mouthparts.\n\nLong thought to be a Mesozoic phenomenon, evidence for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it. Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian, around 420 mya, there is evidence that they were being eaten. Animals fed on the spores of early Devonian plants, and the Rhynie chert also provides evidence that organisms fed on plants using a \"pierce and suck\" technique. Many plants of this time are preserved with spine-like enations, which may have performed a defensive role before being co-opted to develop into leaves.\n\nDuring the ensuing 75 million years, plants evolved a range of more complex organs – from roots to seeds. There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving, and it being fed upon. Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian, with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period.\n\nHerbivores depend on plants for food, and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defences. Herbivore adaptations to plant defence have been likened to \"offensive traits\" and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant. Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change, called co-evolution. \n\nWhen a herbivore eats, it eats plants that do not mount a sufficient defensive response. This creates the opportunity for plants which \"can\" mount a defence. So plants with defences become the more common. In cases where this relationship demonstrates \"specificity\" (the evolution of each trait is due to the other), and \"reciprocity\" (both traits evolve), the species are thought to have co-evolved. \n\nThe \"escape and radiation\" mechanism for co-evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind speciation, and have played a role in the radiation of insect species during the age of angiosperms. Some herbivores have evolved ways to hijack plant defenses to their own benefit, by sequestering (keeping) these chemicals and using them to protect themselves from predators.\n\nMost of the plants which defend their leaves so vigorously nevertheless do need animals. Up to 98% of flowering plants in tropical lowland rain forests rely on animals for pollination and seed dispersal.\n\n", "id": "311037", "title": "Defence against herbivory"}

Opened in 1966, the Wheeling Tunnel cost $6.9 million to build. It was rebuilt between 2007 and 2010 for $13.7 million. In 2009, an average of 59,600 cars used the tunnel every day.\n\nThe Wheeling Tunnel is between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250. These two highways use the same road through the city of Wheeling to go through Wheeling Hill. People who need to use exit 1A at the western end of the tunnels use the tunnels' right lanes as acceleration (speeding up) and deceleration (slowing down) lanes. Changing lanes is not allowed inside the tunnel.\n\nSeveral accidents involving semi-trailer trucks caused local politicians to try to ban trucks from the tunnel. Their plan would have the trucks use the nearby I-470.\n\nA total of 13,000 square feet (1,200 m) of industrial tile was used to cover the inside of the tunnels. The tunnels cost $6.9 million (which is the same as $ million in 2017) to build. The then-governor of West Virginia, William Wallace Barron, and the state roads commissioner started construction on the tunnel on August 22, 1963. Barron said it was the largest single building project in the state's Interstate Highway program. The state gave the construction contract to C.J. Langenfelder & Son, Inc. in Baltimore, Maryland. During construction, several workers became sick after breathing a lot of carbon monoxide. As a result, the company stopped construction in 1964 until fans were installed. The tunnel officially opened to traffic on December 7, 1966.\n\nThe West Virginia Division of Highways began planning to rebuild the tunnel in 2005. Rebuilding began in January 2007. The plan allowed three months for the work. However, rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel took over eleven months. There were problems with the glue that attached the tiles to the tunnel wall. Problems with drains in the tunnel also caused delays. Workers found a coal mine in the tunnel. This also delayed the project.\n\nLocal officials suggested closing the tunnels because of these problems. They planned to just build a road over Wheeling Hill instead. Building the new road would have removed at least fifty families from their homes. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was against this plan because those people's houses would be destroyed. The state canncelled the plan for the new road. Rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel started again in July 2008. \n\nDuring this rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel, the westbound tunnel was only closed overnight for rebuilding. New guard rails, fire sprinklers, and security cameras were added. The whole tunnel was also cleaned very well. Workers put a new road surface in the tunnel. A German tile maker replaced the tiles. The German company got the contract because no other company could finish the work on time. The company finished rebuilding the eastbound tunnel on October 31, 2008. The state closed the westbound tunnel in February 2010. It opened a month ahead of schedule in September 2010. The total cost of the project was over double the original plan.

Schinkel was one of the most importat architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings.\n\nSchinkel was born in Neuruppin, Brandenburg. When he was six, his father died in Neuruppin's disastrous fire. He became a student of architect Friedrich Gilly (1772–1800) (the two became close friends) and his father, David Gilly, in Berlin. He made a trip to Italy in 1805. Then he started to earn his living as a painter.He worked for the stage and created in 1816 a star-spangled backdrop for the appearance of the \"Königin der Nacht\" in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera \"The Magic Flute\". When he saw Caspar David Friedrich's painting \"Wanderer above the Sea of Fog\" at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture. After Napoleon's defeat, Schinkel worked at the Prussian Building Commission. In this position, he was not only responsible for reshaping the city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia, but also had to work projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to Königsberg in the east.\n\nFrom 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed \"Schloss Rosenau\", Coburg, in the Gothic Revival style.\n\nSchinkel's style was more influenced by Greek than by than Imperial Roman architecture. His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin. These include Neue Wache (1816–1818), the Schauspielhaus (1819–1821) at the Gendarmenmarkt, which replaced the earlier theater that was destroyed by fire in 1817, and the Altes Museum (old museum, see photo) on Museum Island (1823–1830).\n\nLater, Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether and preferred the Gothic Revival style. \nSchinkel died in Berlin, Brandenburg.\n\nSchinkel, however, is famous as well for his theoretical work and his architectural drafts. Some of his merits are best shown in his unexecuted plans for the transformation of the Athenian Acropolis into a royal palace for the new Kingdom of Greece and for the erection of the Orianda Palace in the Crimea. These and other designs may be studied in his \"Sammlung architektonischer Entwürfe\" (1820–1837) and his \"Werke der höheren Baukunst\" (1840–1842; 1845–1846).

All hardwoods are angiosperms (flowering plants), the largest group of land plants. \n\nHardwood is contrasted to softwood, which comes from conifers, cone bearing seed plants. Hardwoods are not always harder than softwoods, balsa wood being an example of this. Hardwood trees are more varied than softwoods and there are about 100 times more species of hardwood than there are softwoods. Hardwoods usually have broad leaves. Hardwoods all have enclosed nuts or seeds, where softwoods are gymnosperms, naked seed plants.\n\nEach species of hardwood has its own set of properties, however they have some properties in common. Hardwoods normally have broad leaves and come from deciduous or broad-leafed evergreen trees. Hardwoods grow slower than softwoods. Evergreen softwoods grow faster than deciduous hardwoods, and can grow to a larger size. Some hardwoods are excellent for carving. One of the hardest hardwoods is black ironwood which is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest wood. Ironwoods are so dense that they sink in water rather than float as other woods do.\n\nThe properties of the wood are caused by its structure. Hardwoods have a denser structure, which is the reason they are usually harder and heavier. Hardwood has xylem vessels which are used to transport water. Their cell walls are strongly lignified: lignin is a hard material used to support plants above the surface. The quantity of lignin is probably the main factor in their hardness.\n\nSoftwoods have a vascular structure which looks similar to a bunch of drinking straws held together. They also have lignin, but of a slightly different type, and less of it than most hardwoods.\n\nCommon species of hardwood found in the USA, and Europe. Many species are also found in other areas of the world. This is not a complete list of all hardwood trees. \nThe use of hardwood is much reduced in the modern world. The destruction of tropical and temperate forests has made it expensive and scarce. Many things once made of hardwood are now made of ceramics, plastic or softwood.\n\nHardwoods are often used to make items that get used a lot because of their density.

The first prisoners arrived in 1851. The prison was closed on 1 May 1997.\n\nPentridge was often known by the nicknames \"The Bluestone College\", \"Coburg College\" or the \"College of Knowledge\". The grounds were originally landscaped by renowned landscape gardener Hugh Linaker. Since closing, much of the prison has been pulled down to make way for a housing development. Large buildings have been built and a 16 floor modern apartment block is being planned.\n\nThe northern section of the prison being developed by Valad Property Group and the other areas by Pentridge Village. The National Trust does not like the development plans approved by Heritage Victoria. These plans include taking down sections of the outside walls and building apartments between the historic prison buildings.\n\nThe prison was split into many divisions, named using letters of the alphabet.\n\n\nJika Jika, opened in 1980 at a cost of AU$7 million. It was a 'gaol within a gaol', designed to hold Victoria's toughest and longest serving prisoners. It was awarded the 'Excellence in Concrete Award' by the Concrete Institute of Australia. It was closed after the deaths of five prisoners in 1987.\n\nJika Jika had six separate units each at the end of radiating spines. It had electronic doors, closed-circuit television and remote locking. This meant it could use less staff but still have maximum security. The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in escape proof yards.\n\nIn 1983 four prisoners escaped from ‘escape proof’ Jika Jika. When two prison officers were disciplined in relation to the Jika Jika escape a week-long strike occurred.\n\nInmates Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris - from one side of the unit - and Craig 'Slim' Minogue and three other inmates on the other side sealed off their section doors with a tennis net. Mattresses and other bedding were then stacked against the doors and set on fire. They covered windows in the day room with paper so the prison officers could not see which prisoners caused the damage.\n\nPrisoners Robert Wright, Jimmy Loughnan, Arthur Gallagher, David McGauley and Ricky Morris died in the fire. Convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates survived as they were evacuated when the fire started.\n\nThe graves of executed prisoners were unmarked in a corner of the prison. In 1929, 32 bodies were moved from the Melbourne Gaol during the building of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. These graves were found in 2008. The skeleton of bushranger Ned Kelly was among those discovered.\n\nThere were 11 executions at Pentridge. The gallows beam and the trapdoor were moved from the Melbourne Gaol and put into \"D\" Division in 1924.\n\nWhen the gaol was closed, the beam and the trapdoor were taken back to the Melbourne Gaol to be part of its historical display.\n\nRonald Ryan was the last man executed at Pentridge Prison and in Australia. Ryan was hanged in \"D\" Division at 8.00 on 3 February 1967. He had been convicted of murdering a prison officer during an escape from the same prison. Later that day, Ryan's body was buried in an unmarked grave within the \"D\" Division. There is still debate about his hanging.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "311077", "title": "HM Prison Pentridge"}

He was the 2005 Indy Racing League IndyCar Series champion, and winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 and 2011. On October 16th, 2011, Wheldon was killed in a 15-car crash at the Las Vegas Indy 300. He was 33 years old.\n\nDan Wheldon was born in Emberton, near Olney, Buckinghamshire, England. Wheldon started to race Go-Karts at the age of four. During his early career in open wheel racing, Wheldon had a rivalry with Jenson Button before he left the United Kingdom to start racing in America. Wheldon moved to America because he thought the potential for success in America were greater than in the UK. Wheldon moved to the United States in 1999. He spent many years racing in lower open-wheeled circuits like the U.S. F2000 Championship Series, the Toyota Atlantic series and the Indy Lights series before moving to a higher series.\n\nIn 2002, Wheldon moved up to the IRL IndyCar Series for two races. He drove for Panther Racing with his teammate Sam Hornish, Jr. In 2003 Wheldon joined Andretti Green Racing, winning the Rookie of the Year award. In 2004, he won his first IRL race at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan. He finished the 2004 season second in points with three wins.\n\nIn 2005 Wheldon won the Indianapolis 500, and finished the season first in points winning the IndyCar Series championship.

Panther Racing decided to replace Wheldon with J.R. Hildebrand. Wheldon raced in the 2011 Indianapolis 500 with Bryan Herta Autosport, winning the race after J.R. Hildebrand crashed going into the final turn.\nWheldon was very emotional after winning the race. He did not have a ride for the rest of the season, and he was worried about his mother who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He dedicated his win to his mother.\nIt was Wheldon's first series win in three seasons.\n\nOn October 16th 2011, Wheldon was involved in a 15-car wreck on lap 11 at the Las Vegas Indy 300.

The third Bourbon to rule Spain, he died childless and his half brother Charles became king. \n\nBorn at the Royal Alcazar (Royal Palace) of Madrid, he was the youngest son of Philip V of Spain and his wife Queen Maria Luisa. His parents enjoyed a loving relationship, Ferdinand being their fourth child. However, his mother died in 1714 and the king married again, this time to Elisabeth Farnese, a niece of the Duke of Parma. Queen Elisabeth was a domineering woman who ruled her husband. As such, the new queen would have a further seven children including Ferdinand's own successor Charles III. Ferdinand was by temperament melancholy, shy and distrustful of his own abilities. When complimented on his shooting, he replied, \"It would be hard if there were not something I could do.\" Shooting and music were his only pleasures, and he was the generous patron of the famous singer Farinelli, whose voice soothed his melancholy. As the younger son, his brother Louis, Prince of Asturias was heir to the throne. However, Louis died aged sixteen in 1724 having reigned for a mere eight months. As such Ferdinand became Prince of Asturias and heir to the throne. \n\nOn 20 January 1729, Ferdinand married Barbara of Portugal, daughter of John V of Portugal and Maria Anna of Austria. This marriage further cemented a union with Portugal who had engaged Barbara's brother to Ferdinand's half sister. The very homely looks of his wife were thought by observers to cause the prince a visible shock when he was first presented to her. Yet he became deeply attached to his wife, and proved in fact nearly as adoring of her as his father was of Queen Maria Luisa.\n\nWhen he came to the throne, Spain found itself in the War of the Austrian Succession which ended without any benefit to Spain. He started his reign by getting rid of the influence of the widow Queen Elisabeth and her Italian courtiers. As king he followed a firm policy of neutrality in the war between France and Britain, and refused to be tempted to join the war by the offers of either. The most important tasks during the reign of Ferdinand VI were carried out by the Marquis of Ensenada, the Secretary of the Treasury, Navy and Indies. He suggested that the state help modernise the country. To him, this was necessary to maintain a position of outward strength so that France and Great Britain would consider Spain as an ally without supposing Spain's renunciation of its claim to Gibraltar. Plans for modernising Spain included a new Treasury; the stimulation of commerce in the Americas; modernising the Navy; improving relations with the church and ensuring cultural progress. \n\nThe death of his wife Barbara, who had been devoted to him, and who carefully abstained from political intrigue, broke his heart. Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own in August 1759, he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress, but wandered unshaven, unwashed and in a nightgown around his park.

The biggest popularity was in the 1970s, probably because people needed higher quality recordings. This technology was like a revolution, because everyone could record any kind of sound (vinyl records, radio broadcast, voice and music), then play it many times without the quality getting worse, and they could overwrite it many times. This technology has some weak points though: size of reels, sensibility, durability; but still, it has certain advantages over today’s “digital media formats.” Also, some famous bands and artists used reel to reel technology as a musical instrument or even as a separate band.\n\nThese reel to reel decks are usually analogue sound devices using a magnetic tape of ¼ inch (i.e. 6.25 cm) width. This plastic tape is covered by a special magnetic substance which is being made into magnetic domains when it is being recorded. The tape recorder must have a record, playback and an erase head which transfer the signal onto the tape. The more expensive tape decks have three or six separate heads. Tape recorders combine knowledge both on mechanics and electronics. There must be very precise motors and moving parts, but also a complicated circuit board. It has to contain transistors, amplifiers etc.\n\nThe usual functions of tape recorders are:\n\n\nThese functions can be handled mechanically (system of rubber belts and metal levers), or electronically (magnets, coils, integrated circuits).\n\nThe tape speed is one of the things that finds out the playback time. This table gives information on tape speed and the playback time with an 18 cm reel.\n\nThere were many producers during the era of tape recorders, such as Sony, Akai, Revox, Teac, Pioneer, Technics, Tesla and many others. These producers usually had several product series', which were different in price and functions. The best ones had digital programmable counters, reverse mechanic, electronic buttons, they could use big reels (such as 26.5 cm). There was also a big selection of tape producers – Maxell, Basf (Emtec), Quantegy, Agfa, etc.\n\nThere were only a few producers of tape recorders in Czechoslovakia. The most important was Tesla, n.p. The main development was realized in Tesla Pardubice, but the mass production was held in Tesla Přelouč. Product numbers were in thousands pieces and tens of model lines. One of the most popular decks was monophonic Tesla Sonet Duo (1959). It was compact, portable and reliable. The collectors of Tesla decks agree that probably the most progressive model was Tesla B73 Hi-Fi Stereo (1978) which provided the principles to the later models. The supreme models were Tesla B115, B116 (1981) and Tesla CM130, CM160 (1986) which were able to compete with similar models made by world’s producers. Still, there were (political) restrictions, so the best ideas and solutions could not be realized. The manufacture finished in 1990 as this technology turned out to be out-of-date.\n\nTape recorders were one of the ways that you could store digital data. Those with TTL control interface could be handled by special devices and data could be recorded as a sequence of tones of certain frequency. Nowadays, this method is not very good, because the capacity of a reel is usually low.\n", "id": "311171", "title": "Reel-to-reel tape recorders"}

It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present.\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222; with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286). This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which, together with a royal banner displaying the same, was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland. Since 1603, the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland; as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom. Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences, the Royal Standard of Scotland continues to be one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.\n\nThe Flag of Scotland, also known as the Saint Andrew's Cross or more commonly The Saltire, is the national flag of Scotland.

It is the symbol of the Order of the Thistle, a high chivalric order of Scotland. It is found in many Scottish symbols and as the name of several Scottish football clubs. The thistle, crowned with the Scottish crown, is the symbol of seven of the eight Scottish Police Forces (the exception being the Northern Constabulary). The thistle is also the emblem of Encyclopædia Britannica, which originated in Edinburgh, Scotland. Carnegie Mellon University features the thistle in its crest.\n\nAccording to a legend, an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours Cotton Thistle \"Onopordum acanthium\", perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the Spear Thistle \"Cirsium vulgare\", an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including Dwarf Thistle \"Cirsium acaule\", Musk Thistle \"Carduus nutans\", and Melancholy Thistle \"Cirsium heterophyllum\" have also been suggested.\n\nMaud Grieve recorded that Pliny and medieval writers had thought it could return hair to bald heads and that in the early modern period it had been believed to be a remedy for headaches, plague, canker, sores, vertigo, and jaundice.\n", "id": "311275", "title": "Thistle"}

He was the first to show that apes could solve problems by thinking.\n\nIn 1910–13, he worked with fellow psychologists Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka. He and Koffka were subjects for Wertheimer’s studies, which led them to conclusions about the inherent nature of vision. They collaborated on the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called Gestalt theory, from the German word for “whole\". This was influenced by some earlier work of Stumpf (Köhler’s teacher) and Christian von Ehrenfels. Wertheimer had attended Ehrenfels' lectures at the University of Prague. \n\nKöhler’s famous quote, “the whole is different from the sum of its parts” is usually quoted differently. Though perhaps a simple error made in translation, many lectures in textbooks of modern-day psychology quote Gestalt theory by saying “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”. It is difficult to imagine that a translation error occurred here, especially when considering that ‘greater’ is ‘größer’ and ‘different’ is ‘unterschiedlich’ in German, respectively.\n\nIn 1913, Köhler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, to be the Director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences anthropoid research station. Here, Köhler observed how chimpanzees solved problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when placed out of their reach. They stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, in order to get the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside the cage, they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. \n\nKöhler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through trial-and-error (which American psychologist Edward Thorndike claimed to be the basis of all animal learning, through his law of effect). Rather, they had an insight (also sometimes known as an “aha experience”). They saw the answer mentally, then they got the bananas in a way which was, in Köhler’s words, “unwaveringly purposeful”.\n\nSo, he concluded that the animals were capable of problem-solving and that they did \"not\" arrive at their methods through trial and error. This is one of the most important findings from the research done on apes. Köhler’s work on the mentality of apes was a turning point in the psychology of thinking. In the book \"The mentality of apes\", Köhler explains that he was inspired to work with the chimpanzees for two main reasons. The first was because the “structure of their brains is more closely related to the chemistry of the human body and brain-structure than to the chemical nature of the lower apes and their brain development” Köhler (1925). The fact that human traits can be observed in the everyday behaviours of this animal was very intriguing for Köhler. Kohler also wanted to gain knowledge of the nature of intelligent acts.\n\nKöhler recognized that, like humans, there is a great deal of individual differences in the intellectual field. Chimps demonstrated that they were able to grasp the objects around them in a variety of fashions. This is incorporated in their everyday playing behaviours. For this reason, it was not necessary to use experimental tests to introduce chimps to handle matter. In his book, Köhler describes how the apes use their hands: “large, powerful and flexible hands are natural links between himself and the world of things, and he attains the necessary amount of muscular force and co-ordination at an earlier age than the human child” Köhler (1925).\n\nThese are the editions in English:\n", "id": "311298", "title": "Wolfgang Köhler"}

Raven-Symoné however declined saying that \"I want to work on my solo career right now. I loved being a Cheetah Girl but I don't want to be known as 'Galleria from The Cheetah Girls’, and as 'Raven Baxter' forever. Right now I just want to be Raven-Symoné.\" \n\nAdrienne Bailon (who at the time had a reoccurring role on \"That's So Raven\") claimed to \"understand\" but still said she was \"disappointed\" in Raven for not continuing what she started. However, the 3 remaining Cheetahs recorded \"I Won't Say (I'm In Love)\" for \"Disneymania 3\". They also kept their names from \"The Cheetah Girls\" movie. Kiely was known as \"Aqua\", Adrienne was known as \"Chanel\" and Sabrina was known as \"Dorinda\".

It is famous as the place where three policemen were murdered on 26 October 1878. The policemen, Sergeant Michael Kennedy, Constable Thomas Lonigan, and Constable Michael Scanlan were searching the forest for the Kelly brothers. They were wanted for the attempted murder of another policeman, Constable Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe creek is in the Toombullup State Forest, 50km from Benalla and 36km from Mansfield. The area has been developed for visitors and includes picnic area, camping, toilets and walking tracks. A memorial stone was put in place in 2001. It is near the remains of the hut. A tree near the site of two of the murders (Lonigan and Scanlan), the Police/ Kelly Tree, was scarped by a farmer in the 1930s. He carved the names of the three murdered police into it as a memorial. It has had a small copy of Ned Kelly's helmet attached to it. This caused great upset to the families of the murdered policemen. The other murder site (Kennedy's) is approximately 400 - 500 metres North West. It is across the Stringybark Creek Road. \n\nA group of four policemen from Mansfield set out to search for the Kelly brothers who they thought were hiding in the bush near Mansfield. They set up camp at Stringbark Creek on 25 October 1878, not knowing that the Kellys were living in a small hut on Bullock Creek, less than 1km away. The next day Kennedy and Scanlan went to search the nearby forest, while Lonigan and Constable Thomas McIntyre stayed at the campsite. The Kellys heard noises from the police camp and went to investigate. Ned Kelly decided to try and capture the policemen and take their guns, horses and food. He called on the two policemen to give themselves up. McIntyre raised his hands, but Lonigan attempted to run and reached for his gun. Ned Kelly shot him in the eye.\n\nThe bushrangers then waited for Kennedy and Scanlan to return. When they rode into the camp, McIntyre warned them that the Kelly brothers were there, and to give themselves up. Scanlan went to unsling his rifle and was shot dead immediately. Kennedy jumped off his horse, and while shooting at the Kellys ran into the bush. Ned and Dan Kelly chased after him, shooting him twice as they hunted him for over 800 yards. Kennedy surrendered. Kelly walked up to him and shot him again in the chest and killed him. During the earlier shooting at Scanlan and Kennedy, McIntrye was able to get onto Kennedy's horse and escaped. He reached Mansfield the next day to report the deaths.\n\nNed Kelly, Dan Kelly, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws, and a large reward was offered for their capture, either dead or alive. The three murdered policemen were taken to Mansfield and buried in the cemetery. A large memorial, funded by public donations, was built in the main street of Mansfield.\n\nIn 1879, G. Wilson Hall printed a book in Mansfield called \"The Kelly Gang, Outlaws of the Wombat Ranges\". It included a song called \"Stringybark Creek\" which is believed to have been written by Joe Byrne. It described in verse the story of what had happened. The first verse is:<br>\n\"A sergeant and three constables\"<br>\n\"Rode Out from Mansfield town,\"<br>\n\"Near the end of last October\"<br>\n\"For to hunt the Kellys down.\"<br>\n\"So they travelled to the Wombat\"<br>\n\"And they thought it quite a lark,\"<br>\n\"And they camped upon the borders\"<br>\n\"Of a creek called Stringbark.\"\n\nThe song has been recorded many times, including the Australian folk-rock band the Bushwackers on their 1979 album, \"Bushfire\".\nIn 1880 a local school teacher's poem was read at the unveiling in Mansfield of the monument dedicated to the three murdered policemen.

The gestalt effect is most clear with sight. We recognise figures and whole forms, not just a collection of lines and curves. In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism. The phrase \"The whole is greater than the sum of the parts\" is often used when explaining Gestalt theory. A better wording is : \"The whole is different from the parts\".\n\nEarly 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw vision of objects as all elements taken together in a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to understand perception – seemingly innate mental laws which determined the way in which objects are perceived.\nIt is based on the here and now, and in the way you view things. It can be broken up into two: figure or ground, at first glance do you see the figure in front of you or the background?\n\nThese laws took several forms. An example is the way we tend to see similar objects, or close together objects, as meaningfully connected. Gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive, but it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects, and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.\n\nGestalt psychology was a forerunner to modern cognitive psychology. It is distinct from gestalt psychotherapy.\n\nGestalt psychologists were the first to study problem solving in humans and apes. Wolfgang Kohler showed that chimpanzees could solve problems by thought alone; Max Wertheimer studied how diagrams helped students solve geometry problems, and Karl Duncker studied general problem-solving. Generally, both Wertheimer and Duncker preferred the broader term 'productive thinking' to 'problem solving', but it is not used much now.\n", "id": "311469", "title": "Gestalt psychology"}

When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, it became apparent to Wertheimer that he must leave Germany. In the end, he accepted an offer to teach at The New School in New York. \n\nIn New York he continued to investigate problem-solving, or what he preferred to call “productive thinking\". The relationship between the book and his earlier work was this: all the problems in the book except one could be solved by considering geometric diagrams. In other words, they were partly visual in essence, and could be represented and partly solved visually. That thread ran through much of the gestalt work.\n\nWertheimer completed the book (his only book) in late September 1943, and died just three weeks later of a heart attack. Wertheimer was buried in Beechwood Cemetery in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nThe phi phenomenon is an optical illusion described by Wertheimer in 1912, in which the persistence of vision was exploited by the cinema film, applied by Hugo Münsterberg in 1916. This optical illusion is based in the principle that the human eye is capable of perceiving movement from pieces of information, for example, a succession of images. In other words, from a slideshow of a group of frozen images at a certain speed of images per second, we observe constant movement.\n\n", "id": "311475", "title": "Max Wertheimer"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311479", "text": "Optical illusion\n\nAn optical illusion (also called a visual illusion) is one which shows images that differ from normal reality. \n\nThe information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception. That is normal, but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. \n\nThere are three main types of visual illusion: \n\nThe general explanation for most illusions is the way the brain works on sense data to produce a meaningful perception. A great 19th century psychologist Hermann von Helmholtz described perception as \"unconscious inferences from sensory data and past experience\". Richard Gregory discussed how the brain makes an hypothesis about what's out there, and sometimes the hypothesis does not quite work out. His model of perception is an interaction between data from sense organs and previous knowledge and experience.\n\nResearcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York thinks optical illusions are due to a 'neural lag'. When light hits the retina, about one-tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world. Scientists have known of the lag, and have discussed how humans compensate for it. Some suggest that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay.\n\nChangizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one-tenth of a second into the future. This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present, enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd. Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future, and those perceptions do not match reality. \n\nEssentially, the ideas of Helmholz, Gregory and Changizi are similar. We do not mechanically turn sense data into a picture of the world, as some had thought. What we do is use our brains to work out what it is we are looking at. This involves the use of memory and logic, though at a fast rate. The process is very good, but not foolproof. When it fails we get an illusion.\n", "id": "311479", "title": "Optical illusion"}

Approaches to solo creation vary from the jagged/atonal approach of Andy Gill from Gang of Four and Andy Partridge from XTC, the studio-produced soundscapes of Jimi Hendrix or Bill Nelson, or the composed approach of Frank Zappa.\n\nThe use of the guitar solo in popular music was especially notable during the 1980s, where a flashy and attention-grabbing instrumental was virtually obligatory for a guitar-based band.

It was discovered in 2005 in Inner Mongolia.\n\nSince 2001, in a quarry, remains of the sauropod \"Sonidosaurus\" had been uncovered. In April 2005 Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing was asked to reenact the discovery of \"Sonidosaurus\" for a Japanese documentary. Xu obliged them by digging out a thighbone. As he wiped the bone clean, he suddenly realized it was not from a sauropod, but from an unidentifiable theropod about the size of \"Albertosaurus\". He stopped the filming to secure the serendipitous find. This way, the discovery of the \"Gigantoraptor\" fossil was captured on videotape.\n\nIn 2007 the \"Gigantoraptor erlianensis\" was named and described by Xu and colleagues. The type specimen was found in strata dating to about 70 million years ago. It is the remains of a single subadult individual.The partial skeleton lacks the skull but includes the lower jaws, a single neck vertebra, most of the back, tail and leg elements.\n\n\"Gigantoraptor\" belonged to the Oviraptorosauria, a group named after \"Oviraptor\". Compared to other known members, \"Gigantoraptor\" was much larger, about three times as long and 35 times more massive than the earlier discovered oviraptorosaurid \"Citipati\". Xu \"et al.\" estimated the length at and the weight at 1400 kilogrammes. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul even gave an estimate of two tonnes (2.2 tons).\n\nThe toothless lower jaws of \"Gigantoraptor\" are fused into a broad shovel-like mandibula. The skull would have been over half a metre long and toothless, probably with a horny beak. The back tail vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone. The front limb is rather long because of an elongated slender hand. The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very rounded head. The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb. The hindlimb is also long because of an elongated lower leg. The thighbone is relatively slender and short with a distinct head and neck. The foot is robust with large and strongly curved toe claws.\n\nNo direct evidence of feathers was preserved with the skeleton. It might have been \"naked\" because it is three hundred times more massive than the smaller feathered species. Very large animals rely more on mass for temperature regulation, losing the insulating coverings found on their smaller relatives. Arm feathers were probably still present on \"Gigantoraptor\", since their main functions, such as display and covering the eggs while brooding, are not related to the regulation of body heat.\n\nIn 2007 Xu \"et al.\" put \"Gigantoraptor\" into the Oviraptoridae family. But in 2010 a second analysis of \"Gigantoraptor\" found it was in the sister group, the Caenagnathidae. This was later confirmed by other studies.\n\nThe diet of \"Gigantoraptor\" is uncertain. Although some oviraptorosaurs such as \"Caudipteryx\" and \"Incisivosaurus\" are thought to have been mostly herbivorous, \"Gigantoraptor\" had long hind legs with proportions that allowed for fast movement, and large claws, a combination that is not usually found in herbivores of this size. Paul suggested that \"Gigantoraptor\" also was a herbivore and used its speed to escape predators.\n\nThe specimen has advanced ossification and growth rings in the fibula that indicate it was likely eleven years of age when it died. It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven, and probably would have grown much larger when it reached the adult stage. This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non-avian theropods.\n\nThe existence of giant oviraptorosaurians as \"Gigantoraptor\" explains several earlier Asian finds of very large, up to 53 centimetres long, oviraptorosaurian eggs. These fossil eggs were laid in enormous rings with a diameter of three metres.\n\n", "id": "311595", "title": "Gigantoraptor"}

Koopman, who became his wife. They had two children – Esther (born 1968) and Mathijs (born 1970).\n\nAfter getting his engineer's degree in 1952, Simon van der Meer worked for the Philips Research Laboratory in Eindhoven. When he was there, he was mainly working on high-voltage equipment and electronics for electron microscopes. In 1956, he moved to CERN, which was new at the time. When he first started at CERN, his work was mainly on technical design, and power supplies. While he was working at CERN, he invented the idea of stochastic cooling, which led to the discovery of W and Z bosons. In 1984, van der Meer and Carlo Rubbia won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work with the project. \n\n\n", "id": "311666", "title": "Simon van der Meer"}

He exhibited his paintings worldwide. Twombly's paintings blur the line between drawing and painting. Many of his best-known paintings of the late 1960s are reminiscent of a school blackboard on which someone has practiced cursive \"e\"s. Twombly had at this point discarded painting figurative, representational subject-matter, citing the line or smudge – each mark with its own history – as its proper subject. \n\nLater, many of his paintings and works on paper moved into \"romantic symbolism\", and their titles can be interpreted visually through shapes and forms and words. Twombly often quoted the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, as well as many classical myths and allegories in his works. Examples of this are his \"Apollo and The Artist\" and a series of eight drawings consisting solely of inscriptions of the word \"VIRGIL\". In a 1994 retrospective, curator Kirk Varnedoe described Twombly's work as “influential among artists, discomfiting to many critics and truculently difficult not just for a broad public, but for sophisticated initiates of postwar art as well\".

Under the professional name of \"Bear\" he is known around the world as the music producer, engineer and artist to psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead.\n\nBear was the road manager for The Grateful Dead. He met the band when Kesey had them come to an Owsley Acid test party to try a new batch of LSD. Bear's technical interests helped the band's interest in electronic, acoustic and mystical properties of sound. He became their sound engineer. He was one of the first to mix sound live, and in stereo, and achieved a high sound quality. He often recorded live tapes behind his mixing board. They developed their own high-fidelity audio components and sound-systems for their performances. The bands tours evolved around a gigantic \"Wall of Sound\", with stacks of Stanley-designed equipment. His expert changes meant fans of the Grateful Dead could enjoy the full sonic range of the concert even in the outdoors.\n\nHis abilities helped The Dead to experiment further afield, playing in dramatic and remote places. Their need for support to tour with big shows, and their need for special equipment, meant that companies formed to supply them. These needs were the starting point for both Marin County's high-end music-instrument makers Alembic Inc and concert-sound manufacturer Meyer Sound. And his drug making helped to get the band started.\n\nStanley was one of the first people to manufacture mass quantities of LSD. His LSD is still known for its quality and purity. Between 1965 and 1967, Stanley produced more than 1.25 million doses of LSD. This amount of quality LSD was responsible for the wide popularity of the drug, and the development of an anti-authoritarian, anti-war counter-culture.

His thesis was on character recognition.\nIn 1959, Baran joined RAND Corporation. He designed a \"survivable\" communications system that could keep working across long distances even if hit by nuclear weapons. Baran proved that by dividing communication into short packages, the packages could be easily rerouted when a part of the network was lost. Special computers (called \"routers\") would steer the packages around the network toward their final destinations. This later became the basic design of the internet.\nIn 1968, Baran was a founder of the Institute for the Future, and then involved in other networking technologies developed in Silicon Valley.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311826", "text": "Separatist movements of India\n\nSeparatist movements are groups of people wanting to start a new country that is separate from a large existing country.\n\nIn India, some groups want separate countries for groups that have ethnic or language differences. Some groups call for a separate state, others for regional autonomy while some extreme groups demand complete full independence from India.\n\nArunachal Pradesh is also called the disputed territory of Southern Tibet.\n\n\nThe Arunachal Dragon Force (ADF), also known as the East India Liberation Front, is a violent secessionist movement in the eastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. The ADF seeks to create a state resembling the pre-British Teola Country consisting of area currently in Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighboring Assam.\n\n\nGeographically and culturally, the region now called north-east India is between the two traditions of Indic Asia and Mongoloid Asia and is regarded as part of Southeast Asia. This geographical-cultural condition of \"in-betweenness\" is an important factor in the area’s crisis of identity. The leaders of the present-day \"underground outfits\" continue to struggle for independence, as the political integration of the northeast to India was brought about without the approval of its people. The people of northeast India, who are culturally Mongoloid, refuse to accept the caste-ridden social system advocated by ‘Indian’ culture. Similar struggles for independence are also going on in other northeastern subdivisions or sister regions, such as Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Assam has been the hotbed of militancy for a number of years due to its porous borders with Bangladesh and Bhutan. The main causes of the friction include the anti-foreigner agitation in the 1980s and the simmering Assam-Bodo tensions. The insurgency status in Assam is classified as very active. The government of Bangladesh has arrested and extradited senior leaders of ULFA or the United Liberation Front of Asom was formed in April 1979 to establish a sovereign state of Assam through an armed struggle. In recent times the organisation has lost out its middle rung leaders after most of them were arrested. The National Democratic Front of Bodoland was formed in 1989 as the Bodo Security Force, aims to set up an autonomous region Bodoland. Problems in Meghalaya arise from the divide between tribals and non tribal settlers, identity issues and growing corruption besides the fear of being reduced to minority by native tribals. The activity status is classified as active.\n\n\nInsurgent groups in Manipur may be broadly classified into hill-based (mostly tribals) and valley based (mostly majority meiteis). While the former demand for tribal state to preserve their tribal cultures from outside influence, the latter based their demands for independence from historical perspective claiming that Manipur a Princely state with its geographical area extending to as far as the disputed Kabaw Valley of modern Myanmar during the British colonialism, was never a part of India. They say that Manipur should not be a part of the modern nation of India as well. About 90% of the hill-based insurgents and a few of the valley-based insurgents have now entered what is called Suspension of Operation. The Peoples Liberation Army is a leftist organisation formed in 1978 with the aim of liberating Manipur from India.\n\n\nMizoram's tensions are largely due to the simmering Assamese domination and the neglect of the Mizo people. In 1986, the Mizo accord ended the main secessionist movement led by the Mizo National Front, bringing peace to the region. Insurgency status is classified as partially active, due to secessionist/autonomy demands by the Hmars, chakmas, Brus, Pawis, Lais and the Reangs.\n\n\nNagaland was created in 1963 as the 16th State of Indian Union, before which it was a district of Assam. Insurgent groups classified as active, mainly demand full independence. The Naga National Council led by Phizo was the first group to dissent in 1947 and in 1956 they went underground.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan say that Kashmir is a part of their nation. At one time, they were both a single country. But Hindus and Muslim people did not live in peace, so India was divided based which religion was more popular in each state. They fought wars over which country should get Kashmir. Separatists say that Kashmir should be a country that is separate from both India and Pakistan.\n\n\nThe insurgent groups in Tripura were emerged in the end of the 1970s, as ethnic tensions between the Bengali immigrants and the tribal native population. So many people moved from India and Bangladesh that they outnumbered the native population. Being outnumbered, the native population worried about its economically, socially, culturally status. This resulted in native leaders demanding that tribal rights and cultures should be protected. Hatred and suspicion grew. Insurgent groups in Tripura are classified as very active. The National Liberation Front of Tripura was formed in March 1989. The All Tripura Tiger Force was formed by the local aboriginal tribals in 1990, with the sole aim of the expulsion of all Bengali-speaking immigrants from mainland India and nearby Bangladesh.\n", "id": "311826", "title": "Separatist movements of India"}

It uses flash memory to store data even after power is turned off. SSDs are designed to access data in the same way as traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). A HDD can usually be directly replaced with a SSD.\n\nThe best thing about solid state drives is that they have a much faster read/write speed than hard disk drives. They also have no moving parts, which means they don't make noise or break as easily. Unfortunately, SSDs are much more expensive than hard disk drives. This also means that for the same price, someone can get much more capacity if they select a HDD instead.\n\nA hybrid drive combines the features of an HDD and an SSD into one unit. It contains a large HDD and a smaller SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed files. A hybrid drive can offer almost the same performance as an SSD and it can contain more capacity.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311923", "text": "Jumping spider\n\nJumping spiders belong to the family \"Salticidae\". These spiders catch their prey by jumping on them.\n\nSpecies live in many habitats, from leaves lying on the ground, to the tops of trees in the forest, and even way up on Mt. Everest. They are found on every continent in the world except for Antarctica. \n\nAt present, 5026 species in 530 genera have been found. They are actually the largest family of spiders, with about 13% of all species.\n\nThey are easy to identify because their eye pattern is distinctive. They have eight eyes, two of which are very large, and because their faces form a flat surface, facing where they are going.\n\nThey often hunt high up in bushes, or on vertical walls. To save themselves from falling they do something very much like what climbers do to protect themselves in the mountains. Humans tie a rope to the mountain and attach the other end to the harness they wear. Jumping spiders attach silk from their spinnerets to the thing on which they are standing and then they jump. While they are moving through the air they make silk so that there is always a safety rope trailing out behind them. \n\nJumping spiders can jump long distances for their size, as much as 16 cm. When they jump, they use their hind legs. They raise their front legs to be ready to grab their prey.\n\nMany other kinds of spider hunt at night, but jumping spiders depend on their eyes, so they like to come out in the daytime. Often they will find a sunny spot on a wall or tree trunk.\n\nThere are however many variations, and many surprising aspects. For one thing, Salticids do not necessarily follow a straight path in approaching prey. They may follow a circuitous course, sometimes even a course that takes the hunter through places where the prey is not visible. Such complex behaviour is hard to reconcile with an organism that has such a tiny brain. Some spiders in species of \"Portia\" can take long detours from one bush down to the ground, then up the stem of another bush to capture a prey item on a particular leaf. Such behaviour is the subject of research.\nBecause they have very good eyes, jumping spiders can see human beings when they approach. Some jumping spiders may run away from approaching humans, and others seem not to be very much afraid. But either way a jumping spider will watch a nearby human being. When they do not run away, but do turn to keep watch over a human being, it may seem that they are interested in us. Some of them will even jump from where they are sitting on branches, rocks, etc. onto a person's finger or camera. These spiders only bite to get something to eat or to defend themselves, so if they jump on somebody's hand they will not bite. People get bitten if they pinch or squeeze a jumping spider.\n\nJumping spiders are able to climb glass and other very smooth surfaces because besides having two claws on each foot they also have sticky hairs (called \"scopulae\") that hold onto the surface. Many tiny ends on each hair are held to the glass by Van der Waals forces, the force that will make two very flat sheets of glass stick tightly together without any glue.\n\nJumping spiders are able to see very clearly. Two of their eight eyes are very large and are complicated inside. The eyes cannot move, so the spider will often move its body to look at what it wants to see. However, it can also move the retinas of its two main eyes on the inside of the eye, so the center of the eye's picture can be moved. So the jumping spider has binocular vision.\n\nVery few kinds of jumping spider make webs; instead they use their silk for their safety rope and also to make a kind of tent where they sleep at night, shed their skins (molt), lay their eggs, and enjoy a long sleep during winter (hibernate). Their silk comes out of their spinnerets (see diagram).\n", "id": "311923", "title": "Jumping spider"}

His family moved to Lexington, Kentucky in 1920.He lived there until he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941. Then he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1946.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1959, he taught at the University of Minnesota. From 1959 to 1990, he was a professor of chemistry at Harvard University. After 1990, he became a professor emeritus at Harvard.\n\nLipscomb went to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts until his death in 2011 from pneumonia.\n\nLipscomb was one of the first people to use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study chemical structures. He learned out how to look at NMR data to find what atoms are connected together in a molecule. This is called \"chemical shift\".\n\nLipscomb studied molecules. These molecules included boron atoms. Lipscomb used this work to learn basic ideas about how atoms form chemical bonds. Lipscomb and his students created many important ideas in the field of theoretical chemistry. His work on boron compounds won a Nobel Prize in 1976. Three of his students went on to also win separate Nobel Prizes in Chemistry.\n\nLipscomb's later research was on the atomic structure of proteins. He studied how enzymes work. His group used x-ray diffraction to measure the three-dimensional structure of these proteins. He calculated the exact location of every single atom in these large molecules. Lipscomb then studied these details to learn how the molecules work in biological systems.\nCarboxypeptidase A was the first protein structure from Lipscomb's group.\n\nFive books and published collections of writings are dedicated to Lipscomb.\n\n", "id": "311926", "title": "William Lipscomb"}

The bill would give the police more access to information in order to find and catch people who make and/or distribute child pornography.\n\nThis bill would create laws that give bigger punishments for people charged with child pornography. The bill also makes companies that people in the United States get internet service from (internet service providers or ISPs) keep records of all of their customers' internet use for twelve months.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312087", "text": "Morrison Formation\n\nThe Morrison Formation is a geological formation laid down in the Upper Jurassic. It is a distinctive sequence of sedimentary rock in the western United States, and is named after Morrison, Colorado. It has been the most fertile source of dinosaur fossils in North America. \n\nIt is composed of mudstone, sandstone, siltstone and limestone. Its colour is light grey, greenish gray, or red. Most of the fossils occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones, relics of the rivers and floodplains of the Jurassic period.\n\nThe formation is in Wyoming and Colorado, with outcrops in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Idaho. Equivalent rocks under different names are found in Canada. It covers an area of 1.5 million square km (600,000 square miles), although only a tiny fraction is exposed and accessible to geologists and paleontologists. Over 75% is still buried under the prairie to the east and much of the rest was destroyed by erosion as the Rocky Mountains rose to the west.\n\nThe first fossils were discovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877. That same year, it became the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. \n\nIn Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, the Morrison Formation was a major source of uranium ore.\n\nAccording to radiometric dating, the Morrison Formation dates from 156.3 ± 2 million years old at its base, to 146.8 ± 1 million years old at the top, which places it in the later Jurassic. This is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Throughout the western USA, it lays over the Middle Jurassic Summerville, Sundance, Bell Ranch, Wanakah, and Stump Formations.\n\nAt the time, the supercontinent of Laurasia had recently split into the continents of North America and Eurasia, although they were still connected by land bridges. North America moved north and was passing through the subtropical regions.\n\nThe area was low-lying, and sediments were laid down in rivers, lakes, shallow water of various kinds. The details varied from time to time. \n\nThe Morrison Basin, which stretched from New Mexico in the south to Alberta and Saskatchewan in the north, was formed when the early pre-Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. Streams and rivers in the east-facing drainage basin swept sediment down from the heights. The sediment was dropped in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels and floodplains. In the course of time, this became the Morrison Formation.\n\nIn the north, the Sundance Sea, an extension of the Arctic Ocean, stretched through Canada down to the United States. Coal is found in the Morrison Formation of Montana, which means that the northern part of the formation, along the shores of the sea, was wet and swampy, with much vegetation. Aeolian, or wind-deposited sandstones are found in the southwestern part, which indicates it was much more arid — a desert, with sand dunes.\n\nDinosaur National Monument is a National Monument on the southeast flank of the Uinta Mountains on the border between Colorado and Utah at the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers. The \"Dinosaur Quarry\" is in Utah just to the north of the town of Jensen, Utah. This park has fossils of dinosaurs including \"Allosaurus\", \"Abydosaurus\" (a nearly complete skull, lower jaws and first four neck vertebrae of the specimen DINO 16488 was found here) and various long-neck, long-tail sauropods. \n\nThe dinosaur fossil beds (bone beds) were discovered in 1909 by Earl Douglass, a paleontologist working and collecting for the Carnegie Museum. He and his crews excavated thousands of fossils and shipped them back to the museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for study and display. President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the dinosaur beds as Dinosaur National Monument in 1915. The monument boundaries were expanded in 1938 from the original tract surrounding the dinosaur quarry in Utah, to its present extent of over 200,000 acres (800 km²) in Utah and Colorado, including the spectacular river canyons of the Green and Yampa.\n\nThe roster of dinosaurs from the Morrison is impressive. Among the theropods, \"Allosaurus\", \"Saurophaganax\", \"Torvosaurus\", \"Ceratosaurus\", \"Coelurus\", \"Ornitholestes\", \"Tanycolagreus\", \"Stokesosaurus\", and \"Marshosaurus\" are found in the Morrison. An abundance of sauropods has been found there, including \"Apatosaurus\", \"Diplodocus\", \"Barosaurus\", \"Brachiosaurus\", \"Camarasaurus\", and \"Amphicoelias\", which is possibly the largest known dinosaur ever to exist. Two genera of stegosaurs, \"Stegosaurus\" and \"Hesperosaurus\", have been found there. Finally, ornithopods found in the Morrison include \"Dryosaurus\", \"Camptosaurus\", \"Drinker\", \"Othnielia\", and \"Othnielosaurus\".\n", "id": "312087", "title": "Morrison Formation"}

The title is a literal translation of Beelzebub, a Semitic deity which was worshipped in the Philistine city of Ekron. \n\nGolding based this novel on two personal experiences: his time teaching at boys' public schools and his experiences in World War II. He had read books like \"Coral Island\" which showed young boys getting stranded on desert islands and living in perfect Utopia. He wanted to write about what he thought would really happen in this situation. \n\nThe book portrays their descent into savagery. Left to themselves, far from modern civilisation, the well-educated children revert to a primitive state.\n\nThe central theme is the conflicting human impulses toward civilization living by rules, peacefully and in harmony and toward the will to power. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. How these play out is the story of Lord of the Flies.\n\nA group of boys of different ages, from different schools and backgrounds, are stranded on an island after their plane is brought down. The country they came from has been hit with a atom bomb and all the adults on their plane are dead. There is no one else on the island and no one knows where they are. On Piggy's advice, Ralph blows a conch shell to gather the boys from across the island to a meeting. There they are introduced to Merridew (Jack) who is head of the Choir and various other characters. \n\nA vote is called for leader, which is won by Ralph. He gives the task of registering the boys to Piggy, while he, Jack and Simon (a member of the choir) go to explore the island. They discover that they are truly alone on the island and that it is an island. On the way back they walk through a the forest and come across a pig. Jack pulls out a knife and makes to kill it, but is unable to. He swears to kill the next one he finds. \n\nThe three return to the beach where the first meeting was held and discover that Piggy was unable to take the register. During a meeting concerns are raised by one of the younger children about a \"beastie\" or \"snake-thing\". Ralph and the other older boys are quick to dismiss this theory. All the same, fear from some of the younger boys spreads. Ralph suggests that they build a signal fire; the group is instantly excited by this idea and rush to the top of the mountain to pile wood. They discover they have no way of igniting it, then Piggy arrives with the conch (essential for meetings, whoever has the conch talks). They use his glasses to start a fire which burns well, then ignites a large portion of forest, possibly killing a young child.\n\nJack and half of his choir hunt while the other half is assigned to tending the signal fire. Jack becomes obsessed with the idea of a kill while Ralph is still more interested in building shelters (with Simon's help) and escaping the island, something Jack does not seem bothered about anymore. He wants to kill a pig.\n\nJack eventually gets angry with Ralph and goes and forms his own tribe. They steal piggy's glasses so they can start a fire. Simon is killed by the boys because they thought he was the beast. Only Ralph, Piggy and Sam and Eric are left in the original tribe. They go to the top of the mountain where Jack's tribe are. Jack and Ralph fight and Roger sends a boulder tumbling down that narrowly misses Ralph but kills Piggy and breaks the Conch. Sam and Eric are taken by Jack's tribe and Ralph runs away. Ralph goes up to the mountain again to see Sam and Eric and they tell him that Jack plans on hunting him down. He goes and hides but is soon found by the tribe. A fire is created to smoke him out. He runs for it down onto the beach being chased by the tribe holding spears. Ralph runs into a navy officer who saw the smoke from the fire and has come to rescue them. It is ironic because Jack only wanted to hunt for food and not bother keeping the fire going but he ends up starting the fire that gets them rescued...\n", "id": "312173", "title": "Lord of the Flies"}

The obligor is the non-custodial parent; the obligee is either the custodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian or the state.\nSupport orders end based on local laws and the facts of each case. Support orders usually end when the child reaches the age of majority. (This can be an age from 16 to 21 (New York State) or graduates from high school.) Some countries and states have laws that make support continue past the age of majority if the child is enrolled as a full-time, degree-seeking post-secondary student.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312222", "text": "Nuclear magnetic resonance\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb, then re-emit electromagnetic radiation. This energy is of a specific resonance frequency that depends on the magnetic field strength, and the magnetic properties of the isotopes of the atoms. Many scientific techniques exploit the NMR phenomena to study molecular physics, crystals and non crystalline materials through NMR spectroscopy. NMR is also used for advanced medical imaging techniques, for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nAll isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or of neutrons (see Isotope) have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum, in other words a nonzero spin, while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero. The most commonly studied nuclei are H and C, although nuclei from isotopes of many other elements (e.g. H, Li, B, B, N, N, O, F, Na, Si, P, Cl, Cd, Xe, Pt) have been studied by high-field NMR spectroscopy as well.\n\nA key idea of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field. This resonance is used in imaging techniques. If a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located. Scientists try to use the highest possible magnetic fields to get the best image quality.\n\nThe principle of NMR usually involves two sequential steps: \n\nThe constant field and the pulse field are usually set perpendicular to each other. This maximizes the NMR signal strength. The resulting response by the total magnetization (M) of the nuclear spins is the phenomenon that is used in NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Both use intense applied magnetic fields (H) in order to achieve dispersion and very high stability to deliver spectral resolution. Scientist explain their readings as chemical shifts, the Zeeman effect, and Knight shifts (in metals).\n\nNMR is used in low-field NMR, NMR spectroscopy and MRI in the Earth's magnetic field (referred to as Earth's field NMR), and in several types of magnetometers.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance was first described and measured in molecular beams by Isidor Rabi in 1938. In 1944, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work. In 1946, Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell expanded the technique for use on liquids and solids. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for this discovery.\n\nPurcell had worked on the development of radar during World War II at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory. His work during that project on the production and detection of radio frequency power and on the absorption of such RF power by matter laid the background for Rabi's discovery of NMR.\n\nRabi, Bloch, and Purcell noticed that magnetic nuclei, like H and P, could absorb RF energy when placed in a magnetic field of a strength specific to the identity of the nuclei. When this absorption occurs, the nucleus is described as being \"in resonance\". Different atomic nuclei within a molecule resonate at different (radio) frequencies for the same magnetic field strength. The observation of such magnetic resonance frequencies of the nuclei present in a molecule allows any trained user to discover essential, chemical and structural information about the molecule.\n\nAfter World War II, the development of NMR as a technique in analytical chemistry and biochemistry happened at the same time as the development of electromagnetic technology and advanced electronics and their introduction into civilian use. In the 1960s, William Lipscomb was a pioneer in using NMR to study chemical structures. He worked out how to look at NMR data to tell what atoms are connected together in a molecule. This is called chemical shift.\n", "id": "312222", "title": "Nuclear magnetic resonance"}

Moulting is also known as sloughing, shedding, or for some species, ecdysis.\n\nMoulting can involve the epidermis (skin), and hair, fur, wool, or other external layer. In some species, other body parts may be shed, for example, wings in some insects. Examples include old feathers in birds, old hairs in mammals (especially dogs and other canidae), old skin in reptiles, and the entire exoskeleton in arthropods.\n\nIn arthropods, such as insects, arachnids and crustaceans, moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton (or shell). \n\nThis process of moulting is called ecdysis. It is the defining feature of a whole group of invertebrates, the clade Ecdysozoa. This group includes the arthropods, nematodes, velvet worms, horsehair worms, rotifers, tardigrades and Cephalorhyncha. Since the cuticles of these animals often forms an inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312302", "text": "Voynich manuscript\n\nThe Voynich manuscript is a manuscript, named after Wilfrid Michael Voynich, who bought it in the early 20th century. The manuscript is made up of about 240 vellum pages, and was probably written in the early 15th century in northern Italy. Today, it is in the library of Yale University.\n\nMany pages contain illustrations. Many authors have been thought to have written this manuscript, the author remains unknown. The text is written in an unknown language, in an unknown writing system. It looks like there are no errors in the text. There are no corrections to it. The text is probably some ciphertext; many people working in cryptography have tried to break its code, both amateur and professional cryptographers. Much less attention has been given to the illustrations, which seem to show plants, anatomic or astronomic links. It has been described as \"the world's most mysterious manuscript\".\n\nIn 2009, University of Arizona researchers performed radiocarbon dating on the manuscript's vellum, which they say (with 95% confidence) was made between 1404 and 1438. In addition, the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago found that much of the ink was added not long afterwards, confirming that the manuscript is an authentic medieval document.\n\nAs the text has not been translated yet, it has been sectioned based on the images. The sectioning is usually the following:\n\nThe very last page seems to have some sort of \"key\": three lines of text, with a script resembling that used in 15th-century Germany.\n\nThe manuscript consists of quires. A quire is made of folded parchment. The quires consist of folios, with text or illustrations on both sides of the folio. The quires are numbered from 1 to 20, the folios from 1 to 116. Some of the fold-outs have unusual shapes. Depending on the way of counting, this gives a total of 240 pages. As there are gaps in the numbering, it seems likely that some pages were lost; the manuscript probably had at least 272 pages. The gaps were already there when Voynich bought the manuscript in 1912. \n\nA quill pen was used for the text and figure outlines. The figures were colored with paint, possibly at a later date. There is strong evidence that many of the book's folios were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what we see today.\n\nThe text is written from left to right, because there are irregular margins on the right. There is no obvious punctuation. The person or people writing the text seem to have been fluent in the language. There probably was another \"source\" they copied from. The flow of the text is smooth, which gives the impression that the symbols were not enciphered. \n\nIn total there are about 170,000 glyphs. Given the space between these, there seem to be \"words\" and \"paragraphs\". It is difficult (and a question of debate) to determine the alphabet used in the text; some glyphs may be variations of others, and some may simply be two glyphs joined together. The text can probably be represented with an alphabet of between twenty and thirty characters. \n\nThere are about 35,000 \"words\", made of glyphs or characters. A statistical analysis has been done, and the \"words\" resemble \"natural language\":\n\nThe purpose of the book was probably to serve as a manual to make drugs, or as a book about medicine. The first section is almost certainly a herbal. A herbal is a collection of plants, with their description. An identification of the plants, based on the images has mostly failed, though. Two plants can be guessed, with some certainty: the Wild pansy and the Maidenhair fern. Many of the plant pictures are composite: they combine parts of plants; the root of one plant is added to the leaves of another; the flowers may be from a third species. The leaves and fruit of the Castor oil plant have been identified, as well. \n\nBecause of the tubes in the biological section, the text may be related to alchemy. This would also make sense, if the text was about making certain kinds of medicine. The problem with that theory is that alchemy books of the time all use a common set of motifs for their pictures; these motifs cannot be found the manuscript.\n\nAnother idea is that the book is about astrology; practices common at the time, such as bloodletting were often connected with astrology. The problem with this approach is, that except for the signs of the zodiac, and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets, no one has shown that the symbols are found in other astrological traditions.\n", "id": "312302", "title": "Voynich manuscript"}

For much of the 20th century Soho had sex shops, prostitutes, jazz clubs, bars, night clubs, theatres and the movie industry. \n\nSince the early 1980s, the area has changed greatly: it has moved upmarket. It now is a fashionable district of expensive restaurants and media offices, with only a few sex industry venues. Some music venues survive, such as Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. The area includes Carnaby Street, the centre of the 'Swinging London' fashion scene of the 1960s, and Wardour Street, a centre of the movie and entertainment industry.\n\nSoho was never an administrative unit with formal boundaries. It is an area of about a square mile, bounded by Oxford Street to the north, Regent Street to the west, Leicester Square to the south and Charing Cross Road to the east. Apart from Oxford Street, all of these roads are 19th-century metropolitan improvements. \n\nThe area to the west is known as Mayfair, to the north Fitzrovia, to the east St Giles and Covent Garden, and to the south St James's. According to the Soho Society, Chinatown, the area between Leicester Square to the south and Shaftesbury Avenue to the north, is part of Soho, although some consider it a separate area.\n\nA significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was Dr. John Snow's study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho. He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public water pump located at the junction of Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street), close to the rear wall of what is today the \"John Snow\" public house. \n\nJohn Snow mapped the addresses of the sick, and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump. He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump, thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected. The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage. This is an early example of epidemiology, public health medicine and the application of science–the germ theory of disease.\n\nScience writer Steven Johnson describes the 2006 appearance of places related to the Broad Street Pump cholera outbreak: \n\nA replica of the pump, with a memorial plaque and without a handle (to signify John Snow's action to halt the outbreak) was erected near the location of the original pump.\n\nSoho is near the heart of London's theatre area, and is a centre of the independent movie and video industry as well as the television and movie 'post-production' industry. It is home to Soho Theatre, built in 2000 for new plays and stand-up comedy. The British Board of Film Classification, formerly known as the British Board of Film Censors, can be found in Soho Square.\n\nSoho is criss-crossed by a rooftop telecommunication network, and below ground level with fibre optics making up Sohonet, which connects the Soho media and post-production community to British movie studios such as Pinewood Studios and Shepperton Studios, and to other major production centres (such as Rome, New York City, Los Angeles, Sydney and Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nThere are also plans by Westminster Council to deploy high-bandwidth Wi-Fi networks in Soho as part of a programme to further encourage the development of the area as a centre for media and technology industries.\n\n", "id": "312358", "title": "Soho"}

Red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young.\n\nAlthough many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's.

The word \"Dame\" means a woman who has the title of a Knight. The children were usually taught by women and did not learn very much. The schools were most common from the 17th century to the 19th century. Most of these schools were located in Britain, the United States, and Australia. The Dame schools were also a common place for girls to be educated because they could not go to other schools, which were only for boys. The girls at Dame schools often learned how to sew or do other crafts. \n\nDame schools were different—some were day care facilities overseen by women who were not literate, but other schools taught the students how to read and write. The differences of Dame schools in England were shown in 1838 by the Statistical Society of London that found almost half of all children surveyed were only taught spelling, with few being taught mathematics and grammar. Dame schools became less common in Britain after the introduction of compulsory education in 1870. Schools that were below government-specified standards of tuition were closed.\n\n\nIn North America, \"dame school\" is a name for a private school with a female teacher during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The education at these schools could be good or very good. Most dame schools were in New England, where every child needed to be literate because of the laws. In the Southern colonies, there were not as many women who knew enough to teach the children.\n\nMotivated by their Puritan religion, some colonial women in 17th century opened small, private schools in their homes to teach reading to young children. All children needed to know their religion and how to read because of the Massachusetts School Law of 1642. This law was later made more important by the famous Old Deluder Satan Act. According to Puritan beliefs, Satan would try to keep people from understanding the Scriptures, therefore all children had to be taught how to read. For a small fee, women, often housewives or widows, offered to take in children to whom she would teach a little writing, reading, basic prayers, and religious beliefs. These women received pay in coin, home industries, alcohol, baked goods, and other valuables. Teaching materials generally included a hornbook, primer, Psalter, and Bible. Both girls and boys were provided education through the dame school system. Dame schools generally focused on the four R's of education-\"Riting, Reading, Rithmetic, and Religion\". In addition to primary education, girls in dame schools might also learn sewing, embroidery, and other \"graces\". Most girls received their only formal education from dame schools because of sex-segregated education in common or public schools during the colonial period. If their parents could afford it, after attending a dame school for a rudimentary education in reading, colonial boys moved on to grammar schools where a male teacher taught advanced arithmetic, writing, Latin, and Greek.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, some dame schools offered boys and girls from wealthy families a \"polite education\". The women running these special dame schools taught \"reading, writing, English, French, arithmetic, and music, and dancing\". Schools for upper-class girls were usually called \"female seminaries\", \"finishing schools\" instead of \"dame schools\".\n\nThe first school in Australia started in 1789. The school was a Dame school where children were taught basic skills by a prisoner, Isabella Rossen.\n\n", "id": "312514", "title": "Dame school"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312516", "text": "Marine (military)\n\nA marine is a member of a military force. Marines specialize in military actions in other countries, such as amphibious warfare. Marines usually have strong links with the country's navy. The commander in the field is usually the commander of the fleet. Support for the marines such as medical, legal, and supplies come from the navy. The anchor is often used as a symbol for the marines. The word \"marine\" is from the English word \"marine\", meaning \"of the sea\", from the French \"marin(e)\", \"of the sea\" which was from the Latin \"marinus\" (\"maritime\"). The name \"marine\" means \"navy\" in French, Dutch, and German. Marine forces are usually part of the navy, but they can be part of the army or act on their own.\n\nIn the past the marines have protected ships at sea. When ship crews were pressed (forced to serve) the marines protected the ship from mutiny. They would also board other ships during battle or capture prize ships. They carried out raids on the shore to help the navy. Marines would also take part in campaign ashore, to help the army.\n\nIn the earliest days of naval warfare, there was little difference between sailors and soldiers on a warship. The oarsmen of Ancient Greek and Roman ships had to be able to fight the oarsmen of other ships. Armed soldiers were used on Greek ships to get on board enemy ships to fight their crews. The Roman Navy's two legions, I \"Adiutrix\" and II \"Adiutrix\", were among the first special naval infantry units.\n\nThe first organized group of marines was created when Charles V first assigned the naval infantry of the \"Compañías Viejas del Mar de Nápoles\" (Naples Sea Old Companies) to the Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterráneo (Mediterranean Galley Squadrons) in 1537. This was the start of the current Spanish Navy Marines (Infantería de Marina) corps. The American Marine Corps began on 10 November 1775 in Tun Tavern, Philadelphia, just seven months before America declared its independence on 4 July 1776.\n\nThe main task for marine troops is military actions near the coast. Based on ships they are trained to land on and secure key points to around 50 miles inland. Marines leave the warships using helicopters, landing craft, hovercraft and amphibious vehicles.\n\nMarines are also in other naval roles such as boarding other ships, ship clean up, naval port security, mess duty, and field day operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Two Marine Forces (\"Pasukan Marinir\"), a unit similar to a division, led by a Marine Brigadier General.\n2. Three Marine Infantry Brigades (with nine Marine Infantry Battalions).\n3. Two Marine Cavalry Regiments (with Marine Amphibious Tank and also Amphibious Artillery-bearer Landing Craft Battalions).\n4. Two Marine Artillery Regiments (with Marine Rocket, Howitzer and Gun Battalions).\n5. Two Marine Combat Support Regiments, with Marine Engineer, Military Police, Base Defense, Motorized Transportation, Amphibious-Reconnaissance and also Logistic Battalions.\n6. Two Marine Bases in Jakarta and Surabaya.\n7. Two Marine Hospitals.\n8. An anti-terrorism unit called \"Detasemen Jala Mangkara\" (literally \"Sea Ghost Detachment\").\n\n\nThe Iraqi Navy is a small force with 800 sailors and six platoons of marines designed to protect the shoreline and inland waterways. The navy also protects offshore oil platforms. The navy will have coastal patrol squadrons, assault boat squadrons and a marine battalion. The force will consist of 2,000 to 2,500 sailors by 2010.\n\n\n\nItalian Navy\nItalian Army\n\nThe JSDF has brigades operated similar to marines:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient Greek states did not possess specialized marine infantry, instead they used hoplites and archers as an onboard contingent (\"epibatai\").\n\nThe Roman Navy used regular infantry as marines. Naval personnel were trained for raiding and also provided the troops for at least two legions (I \"Adiutrix\" and II \"Adiutrix\") for service on land. The various provincial fleets were usually provided with marines from the adjacent legions.\n\nFor several centuries, the Byzantine navy used the descendants of the Mardaites, who were settled in southern Anatolia and Greece, as marines and rowers for its ships. Emperor Basil I also established a separate marine regiment, 4,000 strong, for the central Imperial Fleet based at Constantinople. These were professional troops, and were counted among the elite \"tagmata\".\n\nIn the 1260s, when emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos rebuilt the navy, he recruited the \"Tzakones\" (settlers from Laconia) and the \"Gasmouloi\" (men of mixed Greek-Latin descent) as special marine troops. Despite the progressive decline and virtual disappearance of the navy, they remained active until the late Palaiologan period.\n\nThe Confederate States Marine Corps (CSMC), a branch of the Confederate States Navy, was established by the Confederate Congress on 16 March 1861.\n\nMarineregimentet (The Marine Regiment) was the naval infantry of the Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy.\n\nThe Meredessantpataljon, was a short lived infantry battalion of the Estonian Navy. The battalion was created in 1919 from the crews of the Estonian surface warships and was based in Tallinn. The unit was mainly used on the Southern Front during the Estonian War of Independence. The unit was operational from March to June in 1919.\n\nThe \"Troupes de marine\" were founded in 1622 (as \"compagnies ordinaires de la mer\") as land forces under the control of the Secretary of State of the Navy, notably for operations in French Canada. The \"Compagnies de la Mer\" were transformed in line infantry regiments by Napoleon, but became once more marine forces in 1822 (for the artillery) and 1831 (for the infantry). These \"Troupes de marines\" were in the 19th century the main overseas and colonial forces of the French military. In 1900 they were put under the orders of the War Ministry and took the name of \"Troupes Coloniales\" (Colonial Forces). In 1958 the designation of \"Troupes Coloniales\" was changed to \"Troupes d'Outre-Mer\" (Overseas Forces) but in 1961 it reverted to the original \"Troupes de marine\". Throughout these changes in title these troops continued to be part of the French Army.\n\nThe Confederation of Gran Colombia Marines were formed in 1822 and were disbanded in 1829, Personnel were mostly from Venezuela.\n\n\n\nThe Blackshirt militia maintained an independent \"Marine Group\" with four MVSN battalions (24th, 25th, 50th and 60th).\n\nBoth the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army maintained marine-type units. Both were dissolved at the end of World War II and Japan no longer has marines.\n\nThe Lebanese Forces militia maintained a small elite marine unit until the LF was disarmed and disbanded the unit. The Marines were the navy of the militia and it maintained a force of small boats.\n\nThe Corps was founded on 10 December 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War by the unofficial leader of the republic Johan de Witt and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter as the Regiment de Marine. Its leader was Willem Joseph Baron van Ghent. The Dutch had successfully used ordinary soldiers in ships at sea in the First Anglo-Dutch War. It was the fifth European marine unit formed, being preceded by the Spanish Marines (1537), the Portuguese Marines (1610), the French Marines (1622) and the English Royal Marines (1664). Like Britain, the Netherlands has had several periods when its Marines were disbanded. The Netherlands itself was under French occupation or control from 1810 until 1813. A new marine unit was raised on 20 March 1801 during the time of the Batavian Republic and on 14 August 1806 the Korps Koninklijke Grenadiers van de Marine was raised under King Louis Bonaparte. The modern Korps Mariniers dates from 1814, receiving its current name in 1817.\n\nThe battle honors on the Korps Mariniers' colors are: Raid on the Medway (1667), Kijkduin (1673), Sennefe (1674), Spain, Dogger Bank (1781), West Indies, Algiers (1816), Atjeh, Bali, Rotterdam (1940), Java Sea (1942), Java and Madoera (1947–1948), and New Guinea (1962).\n\nThe role of Ottoman naval infantry originated in Orhan's conquest of the Karasi Beylik and the capture of its fleet. From then on Janissaries and Azaps were sometimes deployed as marines during the 14th Century. The Deniz azaps were used during the 16th Century; while troops called Levend (Bahriyeli) were raised on and off over the centuries - over 50,000 of them by the late 18th century. The last raised units were the \"Ta'ifat al Ru'sa\" (corsair captains militia) recruited from among the North African Arabs and indigenous Berbers. Ottoman marines were part of the Ottoman navy.\n\nPortugal raised numerous companies of Special Marines (\"Fuzileiros Especiais\") and African Special Marines (\"Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos\"), both at home and in the African colonies of Guinea-Bissau, Angola and Mozambique, for service in Africa during the Portuguese Colonial Wars. The African Special Marines were all-black units.\n\nThe Imperial Russian Navy used several regiments of marine equipage troops that fought as much on land as they served in ship detachments. One battalion was formed within the Guard, and served on the Imperial family's ships.\n\nThe Ushkuiniks were medieval Novgorodian pirates who led a Viking-like life and often raided other Russian settlements.\n\nThe Soviet Navy had a number of small battalion-sized naval infantry and coastal defence units that mostly served in the ports and bases before the Second World War. During the war, and building on the visuals of the mutinied sailors of Petrograd in 1917, the Stavka ordered formation of naval infantry brigades from the surplus to either ship or shore duty sailors, and forty brigades served in mostly ground troops roles until 1944 when they were used for amphibious operations in Norway and along the Black Sea coast.\n\nThe South Africa Marine Corps was set up as a sub-branch of the South African Navy in 1979, with the primary purpose of protecting harbours. The Marines were disbanded in 1989, following a major restructuring of the Navy at the end of the South African Border War.\n\n\n\nThe forerunner of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps (VNMC) was established by Ngo Dinh Diem, then prime minister of what was then the State of Vietnam on October 13, 1954. The Republic of Vietnam was established in October 1955 after Diem used a fraudulent referendum to topple Bao Dai. The VNMC became defunct on 1 May 1975 after the fall of Saigon.\n\nThe 12th Naval Infantry Brigade (\"Mornaricka Pesadijska Brigada\") of the Yugoslavian Navy consisted of 900 to 2,000 men in three battalions. A multi-ethnic unit, the brigade was broken up during the dissolution of the Yugoslav federation and saw little action.\n\n\n", "id": "312516", "title": "Marine (military)"}

The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument.\n\nAristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to three premises and a conclusion. Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises, for example:\n\nIt is understood that Socrates is a man. The fully expressed reasoning is thus:\n\nIn this example, the first two independent clauses before the comma (namely, \"all men are mortal\" and \"Socrates is a man\") are the premises, while \"Socrates is mortal\" is the conclusion.\n\nIn logic, an argument requires a set of two declarative sentences (or \"propositions\") known as the premises, with another declarative sentence (or \"proposition\") known as the conclusion. This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure. \n\nMore complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion, or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises. An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic.\n\n", "id": "312567", "title": "Premise"}

Clements was the first Republican to have served as governor of the U.S. state of Texas since Reconstruction. Clements' eight years in office were the most served by any Texan governor prior to former Governor Rick Perry.\n\nClements was born in Dallas and worked as an oil driller for many years. He studied at Southern Methodist University (SMU) but did not finish a degree. He founded SEDCO in 1947, which became the world's largest offshore drilling company. He entered politics as the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. From 1975-1977 he worked under Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. \n\nOn January 16, 1979, Clements replaced Democrat Dolph Briscoe as governor of Texas. He defeated State Representative Ray Hutchison in the Republican primary by a vote of 115,345 to 38,268. Clements won the November 1978 general election defeating Democrat John Hill. Hill had been the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court and had been the Texas Attorney General for six years. Clements got 49.96% of the votes. With help from the votes of several minor candidates he narrowly won the election. \nClements ran for reelection in 1982 but was defeated by Democratic Attorney General Mark White. People think that he lost votes because the economy was bad. \n\nAfter being defeated, Clements was chairman of the board of governors of SMU in Dallas. He ran again in 1986 and won a primary against U.S. Representative Thomas Loeffler of New Braunfels and former Democratic turned Republican Congressman Kent Hance of Lubbock. At the election Clements defeated Governor White getting 52.7% of the votes.\n\nHis first term was marked by SEDCO's involvement in the then largest oil blowout in history, the Ixtoc I oil spill, which caused extensive environmental damage. Charlie Brooks, Jr., became the first prisoner to be executed by lethal injection (December 1982). Clements faced heavily Democratic state legislatures. In 1980, Clements changed the death penalty for Randall Dale Adams to life in prison. Adams was the subject of \"The Thin Blue Line\", an Errol Morris documentary movie. Adams was found to be innocent in 1989 after serving twelve years in prison.\n\nDuring his second term, Clements worked to reduce crime, improve education, and boost the Texas economy. He tried to improve relations with Mexico, especially on immigration and the War on Drugs. \n\nClements's second term was hurt by actions he took at SMU. On March 3, 1987, Clements admitted that he and the SMU board of governors had approved a secret plan to pay 13 college football players using money from an alumnus. The NCAA shut down the SMU football program for the 1987 season. They did not have a team in 1988 as well. The shutdown and other sanctions hurt the team for many years. The College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church investigated the scandal. The discovered Clements had met with athletic director Bob Hitch, and agreed that the payments had to continue.\nIn late 1985 then SMU President L. Donald Shields and board of trustees chairman Edwin L. Cox wanted to stop the payments completely. Clements told President Shields to \"stay out of it\" and to \"go run the university\".\n\nA week later, Clements said he was sorry that he kept making the payments. He said the he had learned about the payments in 1984, and discovered that players had been paid since the mid-1970s. The board \"reluctantly and uncomfortably\" decided to continue paying players who had already been guaranteed payments. However, he now knows that they should have stopped the payments immediately.\n\nClements faced calls for his impeachment as a result of these statements. Two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected Governor had told the truth about his role in the scandal. Because of this, Clements did not run for a third term as governor. On January 15, 1991, Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards replaced him.\n\nAfter leaving the governorship, Clements worked hard to help Republican candidates seeking office in Texas. He lived in Dallas with his second wife, Rita Crocker. She was later appointed to the University of Texas Regents by Governor George W. Bush. Clements was known for his acerbic, energetic personality, which Democrats hated but Republicans loved. In 1993, he unsuccessfully supported the conservative Congressman Joe Barton in a special election for the U.S. Senate. \n\nIn June 2009, Clements donated $100 million to UT Southwestern Medical Center, the largest civic donation in Dallas history. A high school in Sugar Land, Texas and a state office building in Austin, Texas are named in honor of Clements.\n\nOn Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Clements died at age 94 in a Dallas hospital from natural causes.\n\n\n", "id": "312689", "title": "Bill Clements"}

A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides. Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents.\n\nTidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation.\n\nTidal stream power is a relatively new technology. It was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis.\n\nThe potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. Water is about 800 times the density of air. So, water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed. Also, the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project. In practice, the tide must move at speeds of at least 2 knots (1 m/s) even close to neap tides to be a source of power. \n\nAs with wind power, selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine. Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions, for example at the entrances to bays and rivers, around rocky points, headlands, or between islands or other land masses. \nThe main concern has been whether the turbines kill fish. Very little direct environmental research or observation of tidal stream systems exists. Most direct observations consist of releasing tagged fish upstream of the device(s) and direct observation of mortality or impact on the fish.\n\nOne study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE, Verdant Power) project in the East River (New York City), utilized 24 split beam hydroacoustic sensors (scientific echosounder) to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines. The results suggested (1) very few fish using this portion of the river, (2) those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes, and (3) no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas.\n\nWork is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological conditions and monitor environmental changes associated with tidal energy development.\n", "id": "312753", "title": "Tidal stream power"}

Later, Ronnie and the Relatives became 'The Ronettes'. They had eight songs on the \"Billboard\" Top 100. They were the only girl group to tour with the Beatles, in August 1966. The group broke up in 1967.\n\nThe trio worked with Phil Spector from 1963. Veronica Bennett was married to Phil Spector from 1968 to 1974, and took his name professionally. She claimed he abused her physically and mentally. Ronnie stated in her autobiography that she walked out of the house through the closed and locked rear sliding glass door, shoeless, shattering the glass as she left, and feet all cut up by the time she got to the gate. She never returned. Ronnie Spector filed for divorce in 1972. She wrote a book about her experiences, and said years later: \"I can only say that when I left in the early 1970s, I knew that if I didn't leave at that time, I was going to die there\". She and Spector separated in 1973 and divorced one year later. In August 2011, Spector admitted that she went to rehab in order to escape living with Phil.\n\nThe first top hit credited to the Ronettes was \"Be My Baby\" in 1963. They had already recorded several hits which were issued and credited to another group, the Crystals. \"Walking in the Rain\" (Ronette version) won a Grammy Award in 1965, and \"Be My Baby\" went into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Other hits were \"Silhouettes\", \"Baby, I Love You', \"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up\".\n", "id": "312864", "title": "The Ronettes"}

After, they began developing their plan for a microfinance project that became Kiva. Kiva means “unity” in Swahili. \n\nIn January 2006, Premal Shah became Kiva’s president. More and more countries were included in Kiva’s projects like Mongolia, Liberia and Columbia in 2009. On top of that, since its creation, the organization has won a lot of prizes, for example the World Summit Award for “e-Business” in 2007 and the Webby People’s Choice Award for Charitable Organizations in 2008.\n\nKiva has become more and more popular. It belongs to the “50 best websites 2008” according to TIME magazine. President Clinton’s book \"Giving\" names Kiva \"a way to give back\". In October 2010, Kiva celebrated its fifth birthday. In five years it has given 100 million loans.\n\nKiva follows the rules of microcredit. Small, interest-free loans to people in difficulties or who cannot access a regular bank loan. The following points represent the different steps of the Kiva system.\n\nTo simplify all the transfers of money, there is a Kiva account which allows you to have a Kiva credit. When you are repaid, the money is available on this account, and you can loan it again. So, if you loan 25$, when you have been repaid you can lend it again, and actually, you have given 50$!\n\nKiva has achieved a total value of all loans at present of 251 142 725 $\n\nIn July 2007, the Kiva headquarters moved to their current address at 3180 18th Street, San Francisco.\n\nKiva's team is composed of around 450 employees and volunteers who work for the organisation. There are different sectors:\n\n\nEveryone who works for the organisation is personally engaged in Kiva. \n\nThe system of microcredit generally deals with the attribution of low sum loans to businessmen or artisans who cannot have regular bank loans. Microcredit is being developed in developing countries : nations with a low level of material wealth, where it allows small “micro” projects to become reality. It favours activity and wealth creation. Microcredit is also practiced in developed countries.\n\nMicrocredit is one of the financial sectors, like savings, micro insurance and others which compose the microfinance system.\n\nOn the 13th October 2006, Muhammad Yunus and the bank he created, Grameen Bank, were awarded the Nobel Peace prize. They were rewarded because of microcredit development at international, almost worldwide level.\n\nThis microcredit system is aimed at local economic development generally in poor countries to help small businesses and artisans to increase their goods or services production. Thanks to this system, little by little it allows economic development at national level, then at international level. It represents a solution to improve the situation of poor people.\n\n", "id": "313287", "title": "Kiva Microfunds"}

On October 6, 2009, he won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit—the CCD sensor\".\n\nBorn in Amherst, Nova Scotia, he was the son of a medical doctor and moved to Quebec with his father and mother Beatrice when he was three. He was home schooled by his mother until age fourteen, when he attended Montreal's Lower Canada College to complete his secondary education. Boyle attended McGill University, but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He was loaned to the Britain's Royal Navy, where he was learning how to land Spitfires on aircraft carriers as the war ended. He gained a Bachelor of Science (1947), Master of Science (1948) and PhD (1950) from McGill University.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Laboratory and two years teaching physics at the Royal Military College of Canada. In 1953 Boyle joined Bell Labs a part of Bellcomm, where he invented the first continuously operating ruby laser with Don Nelson in 1962. He also helped invent a semiconductor injection laser. He became director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at the Bell Labs in 1962. They provided support for the Apollo space program and helped to select Moon landing sites. He returned to Bell Labs in 1964, working on the development of integrated circuits. \n\nIn 1969, Boyle and George E. Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD). Before CCDs were used in cameras, all cameras used chemicals to capture photographic images. CCDs made electronic photography possible. Boyle and Smith jointly received the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973, the 1974 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, the 2006 Charles Stark Draper Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the CCD. NASA used the CCD to send clear pictures to Earth back from space. CCD is also used in many digital cameras today. Smith said of their invention: \"After making the first couple of imaging devices, we knew for certain that chemistry photography was dead.\"\n\nBoyle was Executive Director of Research for Bell Labs from 1975 until his retirement in 1979. In retirement, he split his time between Halifax and Wallace, Nova Scotia where he helped launch an art gallery with his wife Betty, a landscape artist. He married Betty in 1947, and has four children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2010.

The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti, James Collinson, Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven-member \"brotherhood\". After they had broken up, John William Waterhouse painted in their style. Their influence shrank as the impressionists and post-impressionists became more important.\n\nThe group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the 'mechanistic approach'. This was first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo. The Brotherhood believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art. So, they are called Pre-Raphaelites. \n\nIn particular, they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts, whom they called \"Sir Sloshua\". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, \"sloshy\" meant \"anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind\". In contrast, they wanted to return to the abundant detail, intense colours, and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art.\n\nThe Pre-Raphaelites continued to accept the idea of history painting, and the imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. Despite this, they were a reform movement: they created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, \"The Germ\", to promote their ideas. Their debates were recorded in the \"Pre-Raphaelite Journal\".\n\nThe Brotherhood were highly praised by the art critic John Ruskin, and in turn they were influenced by his ideas.

It is completely within the City of Westminster. St. James's lies to the south of the eastern section of the street, while the western section overlooks Green Park. The area to the north is Mayfair.\n\nIt is the location of Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, The Ritz Hotel, the RAF Club and Hatchards book shop. Simpsons, once amongst the United Kingdom's leading clothing stores, opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s. The store closed in 1999 and the site is now the flagship shop of the booksellers Waterstone's.\n\nThe name Piccadilly may come from a tailor named Robert Baker, in the late 16th century and early 17th century. He amassed a large fortune by making and selling \"piccadills\" – stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border, which were then in fashion. With his great fortune he bought a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London.\n\nAfter the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, Piccadilly and the area to the north (Mayfair) began to be systematically developed as a fashionable residential locality. Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of Piccadilly: Clarendon House, Berkeley House (later Devonshire House), and Sir John Denham's house (later Burlington House) were built in the 17th century. Later mansions included Melbourne House (now The Albany), Apsley House, Bath House and Cambridge House. Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street, and that part was colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row. \n\nBy the 1920s most of these buildings had been demolished or were in institutional use. The enlargement of Park Lane and the formation of Hyde Park Corner as a major traffic gyratory system has cut off the western stretch of Piccadilly, with the result that Apsley House has become detached from it.\n\n21st century Piccadilly is not one of London's principal shopping streets, despite the presence of several famous shops.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313781", "text": "Lock picking\n\nLock picking is the art of opening a lock without the key and without damaging or destroying the lock or its door. It is usually used by locksmiths to let people back in who have lost their keys or locked them inside a car or house. Lock picking is very rarely used by criminals, because picking a lock is difficult and other ways of entering such as breaking a window are much easier. Some people pick their own locks as a hobby. In most places picking locks that you own is legal, but it is illegal to pick locks that you do not own or do not have permission to pick.\n\nWarded locks are the simplest locks to pick and are picked by inserting a warded lock pick (also called a skeleton key) into the keyhole and turning it as if it were the key. A pick for warded locks can be made by filing down all of the teeth on a regular key except the last one, or for some locks, the last two.\nPin-tumbler and wafer-tumbler locks normally open when the correct key pushes all of the pins or wafers to the shear line. An incorrect key will push the pins or wafers too little or too far. These locks are more difficult to pick than warded locks and are picked by putting tension on the keyhole and pushing the pins or wafers up individually until they reach the shear line. When all of the pins have reached the shear line, the lock will turn as if the key were inserted. Other methods of raising the pins or wafers involve moving an S-shaped pick called a rake through the keyhole to vibrate the pins or wafers to the shear line, or using the pick gun, which bounces the pins to the shear line. It is also possible to pick a pin-tumbler lock with a bump key, which, when struck with a hammer, will bump the pins to the shear line. The force on the hammer should be slightly less than that used for driving a nail, because too much force will break off the head of the key, leaving the rest of the key stuck in the lock. Many newer locks have special pins that make picking more difficult. The special pins are usually spool-shaped and work by wedging into the shear line when pushed up by the pick.\n\nMost padlocks can be opened by inserting a thin piece of metal called a shim between the shackle and the body of the lock. This will need to be done on both sides if there are locking levers on both sides. The shim pushes the locking latch aside and allows the lock to open. High-security padlocks often use a ball-bearing latch, which can not be pushed aside with a shim. Some door locks can be shimmed with a credit card or similar thin plastic object. The card is placed between the door and doorframe, which pushes the latch aside. Combination locks can not be picked, but it is often possible to find the combination by feeling for certain clicks inside the lock, except on certain high-security safe locks. Some combination locks have small cracks through which the parts inside the lock can be seen, allowing the combination to be determined. The Master Lock #175 brass combination lock has a very unique flaw allowing a small piece of metal to be inserted into the bottom of the lock, which pushes the locking bar aside, opening the lock. A special pick exists for disc-detainer locks, but it is only effective on inexpensive locks that do not have false gates. A well-made disc-detainer lock with false gates (such as the Abloy Protec) is considered almost impossible to pick. Lever locks are considered difficult, although possible, to pick and also require a special pick. Tubular locks can be picked with a special tubular pick. Some poorly-made tubular locks can be picked with an ordinary writing pen. Most car locks can be defeated by inserting a metal or plastic rod with a small hook on the end into the area between the rubber seal on the window and the car body, and using the hook to pull the lock lever that is normally pulled by hand from the inside of the car. On most cars, it is possible to electrically connect the switch contacts on the ignition lock to start the car without a key, completely bypassing the mechanical lock. This is called hotwiring the car. Most cars use a wafer-tumbler based lock, so it is also possible to pick the door or ignition locks the traditional way. Some cars, such as many Honda and BMW models, have electronic protection against both hotwiring and traditional picking.\n", "id": "313781", "title": "Lock picking"}

It has views across Hyde Park and a position at the most fashionable western edge of London. It became lined with some of the largest privately owned mansions in London, including the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor House and the Holford family's Dorchester House (demolished in 1929 and replaced by 1931 with The Dorchester, which are now both hotels, and the Marquess of Londonderry's Londonderry House, which has been demolished. \n\nOn a corner with Oxford Street, Somerset House (No. 40), built in 1769-70, was successively the town house of Warren Hastings, a former Governor-General of India, the third Earl of Rosebery, and the Dukes of Somerset.\n\nIn the 1960s the Lane was widened to three lanes each way either side of a central reservation.

It is a creeping annual or perennial herb often grown for its curiosity value: the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken, re-opening minutes later. The species is native to South America and Central America, but is now a widespread weed.\n\nThe stem is erect in young plants, but becomes creeping or trailing with age. The leaves of the \"Mimosa pudica\" are compound leaves.\n\nThe leaves are bipinnately compound, with one or two pinnae pairs, and 10-26 leaflets per pinna. The round-shaped flower heads, which are inflorescences, are 8–10 mm in diameter (excluding the stamens). The floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. The fruit consists of clusters of 2-8 pods from 1–2 cm long each. The pods break into 2-5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 2.5 mm long. The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects. The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination.\n\n\"Mimosa pudica\" is well known for its rapid plant movement.\nLike a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed \"sleep\". The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light.\n\nThe leaves also close when touched, warmed, blown, or shaken. When the plant is disturbed, specific regions on the stems release potassium ions which force water out of the cell vacuoles. The water diffuses out of the cells, producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse; this differential turgidity between different regions of cells results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf petiole. This is quite a common trait in the Mimosoideae subfamily of the legume family, Fabaceae. The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighbouring leaves. The function of this trait is not known. The plant may use its ability as a defense from predators. Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one. Another possible explanation is that the sudden movement dislodges harmful insects.\n\n[change]\n", "id": "313901", "title": "Mimosa pudica"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313948", "text": "Muhammad Ali Pasha\n\nMuhammad Ali Pasha al-Mas'ud ibn Agha (4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army. He became Wāli, and self-declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan. \n\nThough not a modern nationalist, he was the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms he made to the army, economy, and culture of Egypt. He also ruled some Levantine territories outside Egypt. The dynasty he established ruled Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.\n\nMuhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire, in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia. His parents were Albanian, and their language was the only one he spoke well. He also spoke some Turkish, but not Arabic. He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt. They were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleon's French troops left. The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali (Governor) with Mamluk troops. The Mamluks were former slaves.\n\nThe French Capitulation of Alexandria left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province. Mamluk power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power. During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself. As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the then Wāli, Ahmad Khurshid Pasha, step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new Wāli in 1805.\n\nMuhammad Ali’s goal was to establish a powerful, European-style state. To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali’s land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, and kept the surplus. This was very profitable for Egypt, especially with their cotton, which was of high quality. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.\n\nBeyond building a more modern economy, Muhammad Ali started to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising men to Europe to study. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. European education also provided talented Egyptians with social mobility. Bright boys from poor families could work their way up, and become successful.\n\nA byproduct of Muhammad Ali’s training program was the establishment of a Civil service. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was needed for Muhammad Ali’s other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the Wāli had to fill the posts that the Mamluks had previously filled. He divided Egypt into ten provinces, each leader responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order. Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nAt the start, Muhammad Ali waged war on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, in Arabia, and Greece. Later, he came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHis first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula. The holy cities of Mecca, and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud, who held a form of Islam called Wahhabism. Armed with their new religious zeal, the Muhammad ibn Saud began conquering parts of Arabia. \n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that recaptured Hejaz. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, Abdullah ibn Saud, was sent to Istanbul, and executed.\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns of his own design, beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable addition of territory, gold, and slaves. Sudan at the time had no real central authority and used primitive weaponry in its tribal infighting. \n\nIn 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail, south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority. Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance. Ultimately, Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the conquest of Sudan. Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia, and Uganda. His administration captured slaves from the Sudan, who were then made into a foot regiment of soldiers. Ali's harsh reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, led eventually to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammed Ahmed, in 1881. \n\nAs Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire faced ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The rebellion in the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army failed to put down the revolt, and ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople. Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammed Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, Ibrahim Pasha.. Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the Navarino, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington (1770–1851). Muhammad Ali suffered the loss of his competent, expensive navy. With its fleet destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy for no gains.\n\nTo compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the conquest of Syria was set in motion. Like other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control the Levant, both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources. Not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the Levant. It would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Perhaps best of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria started the First Turko-Egyptian War. The Egyptians overran most of Syria with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more to support his campaign, and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia. At the Battle of Konya (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali watched the European powers carefully. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, he continued the practice of using the Sultan’s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories. He continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness. So long as Muhammad Ali’s march did not threaten the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained passive observers.\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant Abdülmecid. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid. This led to the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi. Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, so they worked for a negotiated solution. In May 1833 the Convention of Kutahya was signed. \n\nThe terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete and the Hijaz as compensation. Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed Wāli of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.\n", "id": "313948", "title": "Muhammad Ali Pasha"}

His two kingdoms Great Britain and Ireland were merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Also during his reign Great Britain and its successor the United Kingdom were at war with republican and Napoleonic France. His land in Hanover, Germany became a Kingdom. He suffered from periodic bouts of insanity. One of these caused a Regency crisis in 1788 during which the kingdom of Ireland attempted unsuccessfully to nominate his son George IV as regent. He quickly recovered and prevented this.\n\nGeorge III signed the Quebec Act of 1774 abolishing William of Orange's anti-Roman Catholic laws in Great Britain's 13 North American colonies. Also during his reign George III signed legislation abolishing some of the anti-Catholic Laws in Great Britain and Ireland, such as Catholic Relief Acts of 1772 and 1774 allowing Roman Catholics to have land leases in Great Britain, and a 1793 Irish Parliament bill called Hogart's Act allowing Roman Catholics to vote in Irish elections.

Although it has since been suggested that he suffered from the genetic blood disease porphyria, the cause of his illness is not certain. After a final relapse in 1810, a regency was established, and George III's eldest son, George, Prince of Wales, ruled as Prince Regent.

Typically, an athlete goes through a cycle of training in which the body is overloaded with work in the beginning and middle segments of the cycle. The workload is decreased in the final stage as the swimmer approaches the competition in which he or she is to compete in. This final stage is often referred to as \"shave and taper\"; the swimmer tapering downs his or her workload to be able to perform at their optimal level. At the very end of this stage, before competition, the swimmer shaves off all exposed hair for the sake of reducing drag and having a sleeker and more hydrodynamic feel in the water.

Some of them are: \n\nFront crawl: fastest and most efficient technique; also called freestyle, because swimmers use it in freestyle events.\n\nBackstroke: only stroke that is swum on the back with the swimmer looking up; uses the same flutterkick as crawl.\n\nBreaststroke: one of the easiest and most relaxing strokes for novices; competitive swimmers find it difficult because it uses more energy when swum at a fast pace.\n\nButterfly: powerful and fast; relies on good technique; uses the dolphin kick; the hardest and least popular stroke.\n\nSometimes equipment is used when swimming.

They grew up in Long Beach, California, where their parents had lived. Their parents divorced in 1997.\n\nThe Sprouses started acting at the age of eight months. The twins first acted in a commercial for diapers. They switched on-screen time every few seconds. Similar to many twin actors, the two have often played the same role. This is so there is more time for the character to be filmed. Starting at eight months old, they acted on the ABC-TV series \"Grace Under Fire\" from 1993 to 1998. They played one character, Patrick Kelly.\n\nIn 1999, the boys acted in their first major movie, \"Big Daddy\".

However, in the middle of 2010, Dylan said that they would not be doing the movie. Part of the reason they did not do it was because they became too old for the movie. In March 2009, they started advertising for Dannon Danimals. In August 2010, the twin brothers started making advertisements for Nintendo DS. \n\n, Dylan and Cole are not acting in any shows or movies. They are paying attention to college.

They continued their clothing line which is 'on hold'. The things in their clothing lines are only sold online.\n\nDylan Sprouse has said that the experience of becoming famous after the success of \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" is \"kind of scary, how fast everything is moving. Just a year ago none of this was happening, it was just doing \"Suite Life\", and now I can't wait for what's in store...\" While filming \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\", the two went to school on-set for three hours each day. They said they were getting \"straight A's and honors.\" The accuracy of this statement is debatable.\n\nThe twins' family has three dogs. Bubba is Dylan and Cole’s dog. Pinky is their father's dog. Curry is their stepmother's dog. Their favorite actor and co-star is Adam Sandler.\n\nIn 2010, the twin brothers were both accepted to New York University.

The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, Puyi, who was living in exile in Tianjin was invited by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo, which was controlled by the Japanese army. In January 1933, to guard Manchukuo’s southern borders, a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe, and after conquering that province by March, drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast outside the Great Wall into Hebei Province.\nThe Western powers blamed Japan's actions but did little else. When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting, the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27, 1933.\nAs the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito (who wanted a quick end to the fight with China) not to go into the Great Wall, the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933.\n\nOn May 22, 1933, Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight. The Japanese demands were serious: a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up, with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control. No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone, although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained. Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps.\nTwo secret clauses left out any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments. Having lost every major battles and much territory, and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese, the Chinese government agreed to all demands. Furthermore, the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang.\n\nThe Tanggu Truce resulted in the \"de facto\" recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government, and acceptance of the loss of Rehe. It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period, relations between the two countries improved. On May 17, 1935, the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of , and on June 10, 1935, the He-Umezu Agreement was concluded. The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party, though at the cost of northern China. However, Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314556", "text": "Undergraduate education\n\nUndergraduate education is a level of education wherein a student completes their first degree. The first degree of an undergraduate degree is normally named a bachelor's degree. Therefore, for many subjects in many systems of education, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelor's degree. This education usually takes place in a university. In the United States, a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is between secondary education and a master's degree, for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.\n\nIn Brazil, it normally takes four or five years to complete an \"undergraduate\" degree. Students need to choose their main subjects before they join the university by taking a test named a \"vestibular\".\n\nUndergraduate degrees are not like in the United States where students have general studies during the first years and only specialize in a \"major\" during the last years of college. European students enroll in a specific course of studies they want to do from the start. They are expected to have received a good general education already in the secondary level in a school (like a gymnasium or lycée). In many countries they go to university at 18 or 17. The degree normally takes four or five years. After completing the first degree students can move on to doctoral studies. In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is only now being introduced by the Bologna process. This means that the old first degree would be approximately equal to a master's degree in the US or the UK.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, undergraduate normally means students studying to get a Bachelor's degree. It is also called an award. Getting a bachelor's degree normally takes three years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, it takes four years to obtain what is known as an \"ordinary\" degree, and five years to obtain a Scottish master's degree. Some undergraduates in England do a master's degree as their first degree in a similar manner to Scotland. The first three years are spent attaining a bachelor's degree and the last year includes research and more difficult subjects. In England, this is more common for degrees in science and engineering.\n\nThe only universities where it is possible to receive a master's degree without even attending the university beyond the award of the bachelor's degree are Oxford and Cambridge. Master's are generally awarded to Oxford and Cambridge graduates a year after they have graduated with bachelor's degrees.\n\nIn Ireland, undergraduate study is like in the United Kingdom. It is like this because undergraduate education was first taught the same in both countries. In Ireland, the undergraduate degree is closest to the Scottish type in the United Kingdom. They are four year undergraduate programmes.\n\nIn India, it takes 3 years to complete the undergraduate course (other than engineering, law and medicine). There are two types of undergraduate courses. Arts and Science is the first one which takes 3 years to complete the courses. Another one is Engineering, this will take 4 years to complete the courses (B.E/B.TECH).\n\nIn the United States most undergraduate education is done at colleges or universities. Undergraduate education gives a bachelor's degree. This usually takes four years of study, although some courses take five years.\n\nIn the United States students in different years are often given different names:\n\nSome students choose to attend a community college or junior college for two years beforehand to further study at another college or university.\n\nMost universities also offer graduate study. Some institutions (e.g. liberal-arts colleges) only give undergraduate education or only give a small number another level of education. Getting an undergraduate degrees normally needs many courses to be completed. The courses have different subjects and different levels of difficulty. The academic discipline of the most number of subjects taken is called a \"major\" or concentration.\n\nUnlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment. However, nursing is taught as an undergraduate program.\n", "id": "314556", "title": "Undergraduate education"}

A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated. \n\nSome fluids are anti-thixotropic: constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification. Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing. They are much less common.\n\nIt is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it. This is a thixotropic response to pressure. In extremes, a quicksand may be danger to man and animals.\n\nSome clays are thixotropic, and their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering. Landslides, such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis, Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this. Similarly, a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event, which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest. \n\nDrilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic. Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions.(Heather honey). \n\nAnother example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones.\n\nSome clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism: an initially solid-seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed. These clays were deposited in the past by low-velocity streams which tend to deposit fine-grained sediment.\n\nThese properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces, such as paint or toothpaste. With paint, the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water (or oil) evaporates.\n", "id": "314567", "title": "Thixotropy"}

Weapons used for this are selective fire rifles. They usually have a bipod and a heavier barrel so that they can be used as light machine guns. SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles used by other people in the squad/section.

Every real number (that is not zero) is either positive or negative, and therefore has a sign. Zero itself is without a sign, or signless. In addition to putting signs in to real numbers, the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity. Usually, if numbers are seen without a sign, they are seen as a positive number.\n\nThe word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs, such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign.\n\nA real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero, and negative if it is less than zero. The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number. Zero itself is not considered to have a sign.\n\nIn arithmetic, the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number. For example, +3 would denote a positive 3, and −3 would denote a negative 3. When no plus or minus sign is given, the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive.\n\nThe sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function. For example, the absolute value of −3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3. In symbols, this would be written |−3| = 3 and |3| = 3.\n\nThe number zero is neither positive nor negative, and therefore has no sign. In arithmetic, +0 and −0 both mean the same number 0.\n\nBecause zero is neither positive nor negative, the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number:\nThus a non-negative number is either positive or zero, while a non-positive number is either negative or zero. For example, the absolute value of a real number is always non-negative, but is not necessarily positive.\n\nThe same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values. For example, a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive, or non-negative if all of its values are non-negative.\n\nIn many texts, it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle, particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation. In such a situation, the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. Though different conventions can be used, it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive, and clockwise angles count as negative.\n\nIt is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions, assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented. Specifically, a right-handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive, while a left-handed rotation counts as negative.\n\nIn arithmetic and physics, it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative. For a basic example, the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right, and negative numbers to the left:\nOn the Cartesian plane, the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive, with rightward being the positive \"x\"-direction, and upward being the positive \"y\"-direction.\n\nIn addition to the sign of a real number, the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences:\n", "id": "314603", "title": "Sign (mathematics)"}

At first, he supported the Corsica becoming a part of Italy, but then promoted the autonomy of Corsica after World War II.\n\nRocca, called Petru in Corsican, was a gifted writer since young age. He contributed in Corsica to the magazine \"A Tramuntana\". During World War I, he wrote about the war and was decorated with the French Legion of Honor.\n\nFrom May 1920, Rocca worked with the literary magazine \"A Muvra\". During the first half of the 20th century, this was the most important Corsican publication in Italian. In 1922 he created the \"Partitu Corsu d'Azione\", following the model of the Italian Partito Sardo d'Azione of Sardinia that had autonomism ideals.\n\nAfter that, in the late 1920s, he created the \"Partito autonomista di Corsica\" with the support of Domenico Parlotti and Dr. Croce, director of the Archivi di Stato della Corsica.\n\nDuring the late 1930s Rocca, slowly changed his political opinions from wanting autonomy for Corsica to supporting the union of Corsica with Italy. He supported the ideals of Petru Giovacchini, an irredentist leader who created the main pro-Italian political organization in Corsica: the \"Gruppi d’Azione Irredentista Corsa\".\n\nIn 1938, the French government punished him for his approach to the Italian Risorgimento ideals. They took away his French Legion of Honor medal. \"A Muvra\" started in 1939 to write articles against the Jews (responsible in Rocca's opinion for the French \"occupation\" of Corsica) and was quickly closed.\n\nDuring World War II, Rocca supported Benito Mussolini's ideals about the union of Corsica to the Kingdom of Italy. When Italian troops occupied the island in 1942, Rocca was proposed to be \"Governor\" of a Corsica united to Italy. After the Italian defeat in September 1943, he was harassed by the French authorities.\n\nAs a consequence of this in 1946 he was sentenced to 15 years of jail and sent to French Guiana. When released, he quickly recreated his original \"Partito autonomista di Corsica\".\n\nIn 1953, Rocca created an academy for the defense of the Corsican language. He demanded from France the recognition of the Corsican people and language and the creation of the University of Corte. Rocca was, until his death in 1966, a strong supporter of Corsican nationalism.\n\n\n", "id": "314660", "title": "Rocca Petru"}

The town lies in Lyme Bay, on the English Channel coast at the Dorset-Devon border. It is nicknamed 'The Pearl of Dorset'. \n\nThe town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The harbour wall, \"The Cobb\", features in Jane Austen's novel \"Persuasion\", and in the movie and novel, \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\", by local writer John Fowles.\n\nThe town's population at the most recent census was 4,406, 45% of whom were retired.\n\nThe town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches, which are part of the Jurassic Coast–a World Heritage Site. The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of . \n\nThe coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earth's history. The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones.\nThe Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic, a time from which good fossil records are rare. Many of the remains are well preserved, with complete specimens of several important species. Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis, notably those discovered by Mary Anning (1799–1847). Significant finds include \"Ichthyosaur\", \"Plesiosaur\", \"Dimorphodon\", \"Scelidosaurus\", one of the first armoured (Thyreophora) dinosaurs. The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival. A fossil of the world's largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis.\n\nThe coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips. This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches, but also causes devastation to the town.\n\nOne of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839, west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as \"The Dowlands Landslip\". About of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than across, deep and long. The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as \"Goat Island\" among the newly formed gullies. On 3 February 1840, five weeks later, there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former. This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors, and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened. The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history.\n\nIn 2005, work began on a £16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion. The town's main beach was reconstructed and re-opened on 1 July 2006.\nOn the evening of 6 May 2008, a section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth. Local Police described the landslip as the \"worst for 100 years\". \n", "id": "314701", "title": "Lyme Regis"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314812", "text": "States of Malaysia\n\nMalaysia is a federation which consists of thirteen states (\"Negeri\") and three federal territories (\"Wilayah Persekutuan\"). Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula while the remaining two states and one federal territory are on the island of Borneo.\n\nMalaysia is a federation consisting of 13 states (\"Negeri\") and 3 federal territories (\"Wilayah Persekutuan\"). These are divided between the two regions of Malaysia, with 11 states and 2 federal territories on Peninsula Malaysia and the other 2 states and 1 federal territory in East Malaysia. \nAs Malaysia is a federation, the governance of the states is divided between the federal and the state governments, while the Federal government has direct administration of the federal territories. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a \"pauper's bequest\" because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government. \n\nThe 13 states are based on historical Malay Kingdoms, and 9 of the 13 states, known as the Malay States, retain their royal families. The Federal King (titled \"Yang di-Pertuan Agong\") is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. The nine \"Malay States\" have a hereditary Ruler as titular Head of state and an executive Chief Minister or \"Menteri Besar\" as politically responsible Head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans (typically Islamic). Only Negeri Sembilan's elective ruler holds the rare, autochthonous Malay title of \"Yang di-Pertuan Besar\", whereas only the Ruler of Perlis is titled \"Raja\". Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular) and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a federally appointed titular Governor (styled \"Yang di-Pertua Negeri\") and an executive Chief Minister or \"Ketua Menteri\".\n\nSabah and Sarawak have additional powers as part of the terms when they joined Malaysia, such as immigration controls. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Malaysians for travelling between these two states or between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, however Peninsular Malaysians who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and fill in a special form in lieu of a passport.\n\nEach state has a unicameral legislature called \"Dewan Undangan Negeri\" (\"DUN\", State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on the population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advise of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, in order to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in dissolving the DUN.Each state sends two representatives to the \"Dewan Negara\" (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government in order to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into \"Divisions\".\n\n was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965.\n\n\n", "id": "314812", "title": "States of Malaysia"}

His commentary was also the second Sanskrit commentary on Prasthanatrayi of Ramananda Sampradaya, an the first was made by Ramananda himself and it was named \"Ānandabhāṣyam\". Rambhadracharya's commentary in Sanskrit on the Prasthanatrayi was the first written in almost 600 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nRambhadracharya's most controversial work was the critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas.

There are many kinds of tanning beds, but most look like the one in the photo.\n\nTanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979. He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas. His company, \"Wolff Systems\" does not build the tanning beds, they research and design for the tanning lamp. Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS, Inc., SCA, Sun Industries, Inc., Montego Bay, Sunal. Later, Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff, who was the founder of Cosmedico, Ltd., another pioneer in the tanning industry.\n\nTanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps (16 to 32 per tanning bed) that creates visible light and ultraviolet light. Like all fluorescent lights, they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp, which is most often 100 watts per lamp. The tanning beds use a special acrylic, or clear shield over the lamps. Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet, but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through. Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system, to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot. All tanning beds have a timer, a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light. After a few minutes, the timer makes the bed turn off.\n\nLike the sun, tanning beds help your skin to produce vitamin D due to the exposure to the UV (ultraviolet light). Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long. Getting too much UV, or many sunburns can cause skin cancer, including melanoma, which can be deadly.

Complete protection against all weapons is not possible.\n\nIt is usually made from two or more types of material, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex (bend) instead of shatter. There must be a clear view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three-quarters of an inch to three inches.\n\nA popular method is stick a special plastic film to the inner surface of ordinary glass. This 'security laminate' bonds to the glass with an adhesive. This gives a protection similar to the multi-layered bullet-resistant glass. Transparency is better, tint-free; thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50-70%. The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows; this a called a 'retrofit'.\n\nThe plastic provides little bullet-resistance. Glass, much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet. The plastic deforms, absorbing energy and (perhaps) stopping the bullet. The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness. Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick.\n\nAll the parts of the glass must be transparent. The essential components are these:\n\nThe most usual method today requires three parts in layers:\n\nA simpler version is used for car windshields. It consists of two panels of toughened glass, bonded together with polyvinyl butyal (PVB). The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading.\n\nThe idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out, while attackers can't shoot in. One-way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers, a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside. A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first, shattering an area of it. This absorbs some of the bullet's kinetic energy, and spreads it on a larger area. When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer, it is stopped. \n\nHowever, when a bullet is fired from the inside, it hits the flexible layer first. The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area; the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullet's progress. A problem with this idea is that a two-layer glass has limited stopping power.\n\nThere is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass. As the outside 'strike plate' layer, it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride 'glass' can defeat .50 caliber armour-piercing rounds. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.\n\nCertain types of ceramic can also be used for \"transparent\" armour. They are denser and harder than traditional glass. These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass.\n", "id": "315085", "title": "Bullet-proof glass"}

He is most famous for joining in the first new SETI (Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) experiment in 1960 and for making the Drake equation.\n\nBorn on the 28th of May 1930 in Chicago to Richard and Winifred Drake. As a young boy (in Chicago), Drake loved electronics and chemistry. He says that he thought of life on other planets but never said the idea with his family or teachers.\n\nHe enrolled at Cornell University on a Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. Once there, he began studying astronomy. A lecture from astrophysist Otto Struve in 1951 strengthen Drake's ideas about the possibility of extraterrestrial life. After college, he served briefly as an electronics officer on the USS Albany. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard in radio astronomy.\n\nDrake's hobbies include lapidary and orchid cultivation.\n\nDrake started his career undertaking radio astronomical research at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia, and for a short time in 1963 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted key measurements which revealed the presence of a Jovian ionosphere and magnetosphere.\n\nIn 1960, he started Project Ozma, which searches for extraterrestrial life. Drake is one of the pioneers of the modern field of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence with Giuseppe Cocconi, Philip Morrison, Iosif Shklovsky, and Carl Sagan. \n\nDrake joined the Astronomy faculty of Cornell University in 1963. Drake lead the conversion of the Arecibo Observatory to a radio astronomical facility. He lead Arecibo's improvements in 1974 and 1996. As a researcher, Drake was involved in the early work on pulsars. In this period, Drake was a professor at Cornell University and Director of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center (NAIC) – the formal name for the Arecibo facility. In 1974 he wrote the Arecibo message.\n\nDrake co-designed the Pioneer plaque with Carl Sagan in 1972, the first physical message sent into space. The plaque was made to be read by clever alien life if they find it. He later helped the making of the Voyager Golden Record. He was elected to the AAAS in 1974.\n\nDrake is a member of the National Academy of Sciences where he chaired the Board of Physics and Astronomy of the National Research Council (1989–92). He also served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He was a Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University (1964–84) and served as the Director of the Arecibo Observatory. He is currently involved in \"The Carl Sagan Center for the Study of life in the universe\".\n\nHe is Emeritus Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California, Santa Cruz where he also served as Dean of Natural Sciences (1984–88). He serves on the Board of Trustees of the SETI Institute.\n\nDrake Planetarium at Norwood High School in Norwood, Ohio is named for Dr. Drake and linked to NASA.\n\n", "id": "315113", "title": "Frank Drake"}

Lasting just 13 days, it is considered one of the shortest wars in history.\n\nDuring the war, Indian and Pakistani forces fought on the eastern and western fronts. The war effectively came to an end after the Eastern Command of the Pakistani Armed Forces signed the Instrument of Surrender (1971) on December 16, 1971. After the surrender, East Pakistan seceded as the independent state of Bangladesh. Around 97,368 West Pakistanis who were in East Pakistan at the time of its independence, including some 79,700 Pakistan Army soldiers and paramilitary personnel and 12,500 civilians, were taken as prisoners of war by India.\nThe Soviet Union sided with the Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and Mukti Bahini during the war. The Soviets thought that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and China. The USSR gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the United States or China developed, it would take counter-measures. This assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971.\n\nThe United States supported Pakistan politically and with supplies. President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been negotiating a \"rapprochement\". Nixon was planning to visit China in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would give the Soviets control over the region. It would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of America's new tacit ally, China. In order to demonstrate to China the \"bona fides\" of the United States as an ally, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan, routing them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the \"genocidal\" activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram. This prompted widespread criticism and condemnation both by Congress and in the international press.\nThe United States introduced a resolution in the UN Security Council calling for a cease-fire and the withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan. It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. In the following days Nixon and Kissinger tried to get India to withdraw, but they did not succeed.\n\nPresident Nixon requested Iran and Jordan to send their F-86, F-104 and F-5 fighter jets in aid of Pakistan. \n\nWhen Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector seemed certain, Nixon deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier USS \"Enterprise\" into the Bay of Bengal. The \"Enterprise\" and its escort ships arrived on station on 11 December 1971. According to a Russian documentary, the United Kingdom deployed a carrier battle group led by the aircraft carrier HMS \"Eagle\" to the Bay.\n\nOn 6 December and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they trailed U.S. Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean from 18 December 1971 until 7 January 1972.

The spiceosomes govern alternative splicing.\n\nThe background to this is that, in eukaryotes, most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA. This is because, of a total gene, coding bits (exons) are separated by non-coding bits (introns). The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways. Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs, and these produce different proteins. Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing.\n\nThe two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA. The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA, or snRNA, and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length. The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it 'recognises' the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns. The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA: it acts both as an enzyme (catalyst) and builds structure.\n\nSnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz.\nThomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery, winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development.\n", "id": "315385", "title": "SnRNP"}

Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic. He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain, but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions.\n\nHalkett's first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber. This boat could be filled with air (inflated) to float on water or the air could be removed (deflated) so it would be smaller and lighter to carry. When deflated, the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak. The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella. Next, he created a two-man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack. When it was deflated, It could be used as a waterproof blanket.\n\nMany people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people. He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed. He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck. They were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist. One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae. The other is in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum.\n\nPeter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s. He was the son of John Halkett, a director of the Hudson's Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England. Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time. He was very interested in John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. This expedition had many problems.\nFranklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years. He was looking for the Northwest Passage. His search ended very badly. It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people. 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed. The people that were not killed had to eat lichen, their own boots, and the remains of dead animals left by wolves. They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm. John Richardson tried to swim to safety. This caused him very bad hypothermia. One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow. They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe.\n\nHalkett was an amateur inventor. During his spare time while in the navy, he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness, but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them.\n\nHalkett made a waterproof cloak. It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth. This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber. The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid. It was made of four different airtight sections. If one section was damaged and could not hold air, the others would still keep the boat floating. The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows. The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick. This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle. There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat. The cloak weighed about . It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat. Once the boat was inflated, it could carry six to eight people.\n\nIn early 1844, Halkett tested the first boat-cloak on the River Thames. He paddled it without taking on any water. His test went very well. Because of this, he took the boat-cloak with him while on naval service. He used it whenever he could to test it under many different sea conditions. In November 1844, Halkett wanted to test the boat-cloak in bad weather conditions. The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad, but the weather was unusually calm when he got there. The boat-cloak was very well liked by explorers. John Richardson (who had almost died during the 1819–1822 Coppermine expedition) wrote that \"Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition, I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely\".\n\nBecause of how well the boat-cloak did during his tests, Halkett built a larger version. This boat could be folted into a knapsack. When inflated, it could carry two men. Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat. When deflated, the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket. This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground. The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy. On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert, First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that \"My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious, and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions, but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service\".\nAlthough the Navy saw no use for Halkett's boats in general naval service, this larger boat was liked very much by explorers. John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition. This expedition ended badly. All 129 men and their two ships wee lost and never found. Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada. He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region. He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition.\n\nOrkneyman John Rae, known by the Inuit as (, \"He who takes long strides\"), was a Hudson's Bay Company surgeon. He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic. Unlike most Europeans of that time, Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions. He travelled Inuit-style, using sledges and snowshoes. He slept in snow igloos. Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846. He said that it was \"most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay\". He also said that \"although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair\" and \"ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition\".\n\nIn 1848, the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklin's expedition. The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae. They had a Halkett boat bought by the government. The party did not find Franklin, but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful. During the search, they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips. Rae said that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold, it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed. Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin. During these they were used for fishing.\n\nIn 1851 French explorer Joseph René Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin. This was paid for by Franklin's wife. Bellot took a Halkett boat-cloak on the journey. He said that it was \"of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft\". Bellot's expedition did not find Franklin. It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae (using with \"two beautiful Halkett boats\") found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier.

It is a group of igneous rocks which were formed during a massive igneous event starting about 1,270 million years ago. The large igneous province extends from the Arctic in Nunavut to near the Great Lakes in northwestern Ontario.\n\nMLIP is one of the largest Proterozoic magmatic provinces on Earth, as well as the world's largest and best-preserved continental flood basalt terrain. This huge area of igneous rock was spewed out in a short time, geologically speaking. The MILP is much larger than other well-preserved large igneous provinces. The standard size classification for large igneous provinces is a minimum of . However, the Mackenzie dyke swarm itself occupies an area of at least , making the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province larger than the Ontong Java Plateau in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or the U.S. state of Alaska.\n\nThe Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by processes other than normal plate tectonics and seafloor spreading. Igneous rocks of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province are generally mafic in composition, including basalt and gabbro.\n\nLike most large igneous provinces, the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province was caused by a mantle plume—an upwelling zone of abnormally hot rock within the Earth's mantle. As the head of the Mackenzie plume reached the Earth's lithosphere, it spread out and melted catastrophically to form large volumes of basaltic magma. This resulted in the creation of a stationary volcanic zone west of Victoria Island, called the Mackenzie hotspot.\n\nThe Coppermine River Group is a sequence of Mesoproterozoic continental flood basalts forming part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada. It is one of the largest flood basalt provinces on Earth, covering the area with a volume of approximately .\n\nBetween 1,200 and 740 million years ago, a series of flood basalt eruptions took place. At the northern portion of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province, vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large part of the northwestern Canadian Shield. This constructed a large lava plateau with an area of , a volume of lavas of at least 500,000 km (120,000 cubic miles). \n\nThis extensive area of flood basalt lava flows has been called the Coppermine River flood basalts. With an area of and a volume of 650,000 km (120,000 cubic miles), the Coppermine River flood basalt sequence is larger than the Columbia River Basalt Group in the United States. It compares in size to the Deccan Traps in west-central India. This makes the Coppermine River flood basalts one of the largest flood basalt events ever to appear on the North American continent, as well as on Earth. The maximum thickness of the Coppermine River flood basalts is and has 150 lava flows, each to thick.\n\nThe Coppermine River flood basalts occurred shortly after a period of crustal uplift. The uplift then collapsed. This sudden uplift was likely caused by rising magma of the Mackenzie plume, which caused the Mackenzie hotspot. The Coppermine River basalts show over 100 individual lava flows.\n", "id": "315506", "title": "Mackenzie Large Igneous Province"}

Orsini lived and worked mainly in the city of Sebenico (modern-day Šibenik, Croatia), Republic of Venice.\n\nGiorgio Orsini descends from ancient and noble House of Orsini. Hard times had been fallen upon the House branch Giorgio belonged to. Mateo, Giorgio's father, as much as Giorgio himself, has forced to support himself and his family by manual labor. As the architect and sculptor, he was educated in the art workshop of sculptors Giovanni and Bartolomeo Buon in Venice. While in Venice, Giorgio married Elizabetta da Monte, who brought him a fair dowry, money and homes in Venice. He invested Elizabetta's money in a grocery store and in a merchant ship which brought them good returns. Elizabetta's husband entrusted her of a power of attorney by which she was able to attend to his affairs while he was absent. In July 1455 Giorgio bought home from a local nobleman Simeonich, where he engraved his family's heraldic symbol - a bear. When signing contracts, Giorgio often used his art name Georgius Dalmaticus, Sixty five years after his death, his grandson, Giacomo, an advocate by vocation, was recognized as a descendant of the noble House of Orsini. Giorgio's and Elizabetta's daughter Flavia married another Dalmatian painter, Giorgio Culinovich (Schiavone) in the year of 1463. Other source claims that the Orsinis' daughter's name was Elena (who married Schiavone).\n\nIn Venice, in 1441, Giorgio was invited to Sebenico to replace Messer Antonio di Pietro Paolo who had fallen into disrepute with the building committee of the cathedral of Sebenico. Antonio commenced the Cathedral building in 1431. Giorgio abandoned the Gothic style based ideas of his predecessor and followed revolutionary ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture, The whole cathedral building is roofed with wagon vaults, made of huge slabs of marble supported on strong transverse ribs, the same stone covering forming the ceiling inside and the roof outside. He was the chief cathedral architect from 1441 to 1473. From July 1, 1477 the work was continued by another architect, Niccolò di Giovanni da Firenze. In 1444 Giorgio went to Spalato to build the chapel of S. Ranier in the church of S. Benedetto. The work was finished in two years. He came back to Spalato in 1448 to make the chapel of S. Anastasius in the cathedral.\n\nOrsini did not follow always the Renaissance. There are also several fine late Ancona Gothic buildings, among them the facade of S. Francesco and S. Agostino churches, the build of Palazzo Benincasa, all done by Giorgio Orsini. Work on S. Agostino facade was finished in 1455. On the S. Agostino facade, Orsini worked between 1455 and 1459. On the Loggia dei Mercanti, which was built by Giovanni Pace in 1443, the facade, with statues representing the virtues, is the work of Giorgio Orsini (1451-9) In 1460, Giorgio returned to Sebenico. In 1464 and 1465 he was at Ragusa, where he helped in building the Torre Menze, and in restoring the palace of the Rectors. The Palace of Rectors was badly damaged by the 1462 earthquake. Orsini replaced the tree central capitals, who were damaged beyond repair, of that building. The next year he was at Pago (today Pag, Croatia), improving and enlarging the courtyard of the bishop's palace. The design and work on facade of the cathedral at Ossero belongs to him, too. In the next year he undertook work on the facade of the Cappella Grande of the parish church at Pago. In 1470 he went to Rome, where his compatriot Giovanni Dalmato, the sculptor, of Trau (today Trogir, Croatia), was at work on the monument of Paul II. In 1472 he commenced the facade of S. Maria, Cittanova, in the Marche.\n\nHe had many pupils, some of whom continued to work on the cathedral at Sebenico after his death in 1475.\n\nIn Croatia, Giorgio Orsini is celebrated as a Croatian sculptor and architect, known under the Croatian name \"Juraj Dalmatinac\". This name is translation of his art name \"Georgius Dalmaticus\". The translation is coming from the second half of 19th century. Another version of the Orsini's croatised name is \"Juraj Matejević\". This name comes as translation of the \"Georgvs Mathei\" (Georg, Mathew's son) text engraved in the marble of St. Jacob cathedral church in Sebenico. Croatian author Fisković claims that \"Orsini\", as his family name, was never used by the artist and it was adopted by his son, after the death of his father. His claim is not supported by any documents or records dated back to the times Orsini lived and worked. Fisković's claim is defeated by the home sale contract where Giorgio Orsini was named as the home buyer. Two Italian authors recorded the use of Giorgio's family name by his son Mateo and grandson Giovanni and refuted Fiskovic\nCroats erected a monument celebrating Orsini in the front of St. Jacob cathedral church in Šibenik, Croatia. This monument, an over-sized standing statue of Orsini, is a work of Yugoslav sculptor Ivan Meštrović. Two elementary schools in Croatia bear that name: one in Pag, and one in Šibenik.\n", "id": "315522", "title": "Giorgio Orsini"}

He is considered to be one of the most famous and versatile singers of the subcontinent. He is also considered to be the first regular pop singer of south Asia. and credited as having sung the \"first-ever South asian\" pop song. In 1954, he recorded the official National anthem of Pakistan with several other singers. Rushdi has recorded the highest number of movie songs in the history of \"Pakistani cinema\" in many languages. He suffered from poor health during the latter part of his life and died of a heart attack at the age of 48, after recording approximately five thousand movie songs for 583 released movies. Besides popular music, Rushdi also helped popularize the ghazals of Naseer Turabi. In 2003, 20 years after his death, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf awarded him the \"Sitara-e-Imtiaz\".\nMany of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained singers, although Rushdi never had any influences from any classical singer. He is famously known as \"Magician of voice\" and his popularity also turned traditional classical singers against him but did not affect his fame and his death is termed as irreparable loss to the industry. Actor \"Waheed Murad\" declared Rushdi's song, \"Bhooli hui hoon daastan\", his favorite song. Music directors like M.Ashraf and Nisar Bazmi also hold centaury partnerships with Ahmed Rushdi and they have composed hundreds of songs for him. According to complete songography, M.Ashraf composed 734 songs in 211 movies for Rushdi but available figures indicate a composition of 132 songs in 100 movies for him. The first movie of this pair was \"Speran\" in 1961 and the last was \"Hero\" in 1983. Ahmed Rushdi influenced many singers in music industry.\n\nSince 1976, Ahmed Rushdi was a heart patient and his doctors advised him to abstain from singing but Rushdi refused by saying that music was his life. When he had a second heart attack in 1981, he was composing a musical album in the voice of singer \"Mujeeb Aalam\". On the night of April 11, 1983, he had a third heart attack.

Floorball is very popular today and in 2020 it is going to be part of the Summer Olympic Games.\n\nFloorball was invited in the USA, but has been most popular in Sweden since the 1970s. Its popularity quickly spread to Finland and Switzerland, but with different rules. For example, in Switzerland a goalkeeper is allowed to use a stick. In 1986, the International Floorball Federation (IFF) was founded and rules became the same.\n\nFloorball is played in a gym on an area of 40x20 meters bordered by boards 50 centimetres high. The formations are very similar to ice hockey. Both teams play with 3 attackers, 2 defenders and a goalkeeper. They can relieve whenever they want.

Floorball is a contact sport so players can play with their body, but it has limits. The only thing they can give a goalkeeper is a stick, but they can handle the ball with the body. They cannot hit the ball with their hands or head and they cannot jump. The goalkeeper can hit the ball with every part of his body and he can it for 3 seconds.

Users can draw directly to computer as if they were drawing on a paper or any other material. These tablets are also used to subscribe some documents or in East Asia to capture local handwriting. \n\nAnother thing that tablets can do is digitizing. It´s process which trace an image from piece of paper.\n\nSurface: A tablet has a flat surface on which the user can draw. This surface can be different sizes or shapes. Images drawn on the tablet are not shown on surface itself but they appear on the monitor. However there are screen hybrids which allow user to see drawing right on the drawing surface. These hybrids are combination of an ordinary tablet and touchscreen (unlike touchscreen, they offer pressure sensitivity and higher resolution).\nStylus: A stylus is a pen-like device (often powered by battery) that allows sending user action to the tablet. It detects different degrees of pressure, e.g. for use in a drawing program to differentiate line thickness or color density. \n\nPuck: After stylus, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. Professional pucks often have a loupe for greater precision.\n\nPassive tablets use electromagnetic induction technology. The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus.\n\nActive tablets use self-powered electronics that generate and send a signal to the tablet. Tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, so it eliminates inaccuracy of transmission.\n\nOptical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus.\n\nAcoustic tablets were early models. A small sound generator was mounted in the stylus, and the acoustic signal picked up by two microphones placed near the writing surface.\n\nElectromagnetic tablets work by generating and detecting an electromagnetic signal.\n\nSince a stylus can sense pressure, tilting and other attributes, it is good for computer graphic usage (especially two dimensional). These attributes can make differences between brush size, opacity, shape, color, etc. in certain graphic programs. Graphics tablets are much used for technical drawing and computer-aided design.\n\nThey are also used for online teaching, e.g. live tutorials or lessons where visual information is needed. Some users prefer tablet computers for some purposes, though those devices mostly lack sensors for pressure and tilt.\n\n", "id": "315701", "title": "Graphics tablet"}

Unlike the toy soldiers, which cost more, army men are sold at low prices in discount stores, supermarkets, and dollar stores. Also unlike many toy soldiers, army men are sold unpainted and almost always dressed in modern military uniforms and armed with 20th Century weapons.\n\nArmy men are sold in plastic bags or buckets, and often include different colors such as green, tan, or gray, to represent different sides. They have a lot of different kinds of weapons, from World War II to the current era. These include rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, sniper rifles, pistols, grenades, flame throwers, and bazookas. They may also have radio men, minesweepers, and men armed with bayonets. Army men are sometimes packaged with additional accessories including tanks, jeeps, helicopters, half tracks, artillery, helicopters, jets, and buildings. Their vehicles are usually manufactured in the same size, to save money. \n\nThe first American plastic toy soldiers were made by Bergen Toy & Novelty Co.

He was the first person to create a telegraph with only one wire, and also helped come up with the brilliant idea of Morse code.\n\nSince the 1700s, there were different types of telegraphs being made, but they were hard to use because they had several wires. (The first telegraph ever built had 26 wires, which made it almost impossible to use.) Morse spent years trying to build one with only one wire, and managed to do it in 1836. Morse and his assistant made a code with \"dots and \"dashes\", which were two different types of \"clicks\" on the telegraph.\n\nMorse's invention made it possible to quickly communicate with people far away, and many telegraph lines were built. A telegraph line using his invention was built between Washington, D.C. and Baltimore in 1844. By the 1860s, there were telegraph lines all around North America, and in 1866, a telegraph line was built across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSamuel F. B. Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts\n\nMorse was a painter before he was an inventor. He was a professor of art at New York University. He wanted to do some paintings that were going to be done at the United States Capitol, but was not chosen to do them. He was so disappointed that he gave up painting.\n\nMorse was a devout Christian. The first message he sent on his 1844 telegraph line was \"What hath God wrought?\", which comes from the Book of Numbers in the Bible.\n\nHe died in New York City on April 2, 1872.\n", "id": "315813", "title": "Samuel Morse"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315836", "text": "Ryan Stiles\n\nRyan Lee Stiles (born April 22, 1959) is an American actor, comedian, director, and voice actor whose work is often paired with improvisational comedy. He is best known for his improv and co-production work on the American and British versions of \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" and the role of Lewis Kiniski on \"The Drew Carey Show\". He played Herb Melnick on the CBS comedy \"Two and a Half Men\" and was a performer on the show \"Drew Carey's Improv-A-Ganza\".\n\nStiles was born in Seattle, Washington, the youngest of five children. His father, Sonny, was a fishing plant supervisor. Stiles lived in Vancouver, British Columbia as a teenager. At the age of seventeen, he dropped out of his high school, Richmond Secondary, to have a career in comedy. He worked in his father's fish-processing plant to earn a living. He then began performing improv with Vancouver TheatreSports League. In 1986, Stiles successfully auditioned for a berth at Toronto's renowned Second City comedy ensemble.\n\nBy 1989, the producers of the comedy show, \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\", noticed his work. Stiles was a regular guest on the show until 1998, and the show's short production season allowed him to make numerous television and motion picture appearances in the United States.\n\nIn 1995, Stiles was asked by American comic Drew Carey to be a regular on his comedy \"The Drew Carey Show\". Stiles played Drew's smart but under best friend, Lewis Kiniski. Stiles' first line in the first episode of the show, \"And that's why the French don't wash,\" is a line he had used in an episode of the British version of \"Whose Line?\".\n\nIn 1998, Carey successfully got ABC to get an American version of \"Whose Line?\" produced. Following the final season of the British version in 1998, the American version premiered, with both Stiles and Carey as executive producers. Stiles and Colin Mochrie were the only two actors to appear in every episode of the US version, though Wayne Brady also became a regular near the beginning of the second season. The series was produced until 2006.\n\nStiles was the most iconic performer on the original UK version of \"Whose Line?\", appearing in 76 of the series 136 episodes (including compilations). He first appeared in the fifth episode of the second season, which aired in late 1988. He appeared in one other episode of that season, before returning for four episodes of the third season. His prominence increased with each season, including appearances in every episode of Season 4 which was filmed in New York; ultimately appearing in every episode from the seventh season onwards.\n\nStiles was known for several recurring impressions he performed on the shows, performed both at his own decision and as an assignment in games. These included Carol Channing, Elvis Presley, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Steve Irwin and Christopher Lloyd's character in \"Taxi\", Jim Ignatowski. He made clear his dislike of the musical segments of the show at every opportunity whenever he was chosen to perform in them, mostly because of his inability to form lyrics quickly. In particular, he disliked the games Hoedown and Irish Drinking Song, often reacting negatively (or sarcastically positively) to its being announced. Other than in early UK playings, Stiles was always the last performer to sing in Hoedown and other similar musical games, allowing him more time to devise lyrics, and giving him the final punch-lines, as well as injecting (usually not-so subtle) jabs at the Hoedown itself, or of the host for having him perform in it.\n\nStiles had first met Colin Mochrie years before while performing stand-up. They first performed together in Vancouver TheaterSports then in Second City, Toronto.There were a number of games which paired Mochrie and Stiles at every playing. Though other performers did so, he was the most common performer to make bald jokes at Mochrie. In return, Mochrie often made jokes about Stiles's height, nose, attractiveness, and tendency to wear exotic, flamboyant shoes, which were designed by George Esquivel. However, he would sometimes stand up to or make jokes at the other performers (including Drew Carey) who made fun of Mochrie's baldness or Mochrie in general, mostly during Scenes From A Hat.\n\nStiles received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program in 2002 for his work on the show.\n\nIn 1981, Stiles met Patricia McDonald at Punchlines where she was waitressing. They lived together for seven years before marrying in 1988. They have three children: Sam, Mackenzie, and Claire. When not working in Hollywood, he lives at his home on Lake Sammamish, outside Bellingham, Washington, where he has opened the Upfront Theatre, a small theatre dedicated to live improv comedy.\n\nStiles once lived in a house previously owned by Liberace in Sherman Oaks, California, but he sold it.\n\nStiles appeared in the 1991 film \"Hot Shots\" as Mailman Farnham, and also starred in the 1993 sequel (follow-up) \"Hot Shots! Part Deux\", as marine Rabinowitz.\n\nSince 2004, Stiles has been seen as the reappearing character Dr. Herb Melnick in several episodes of the comedy \"Two and a Half Men\" which stars his \"Hot Shots\" co-star Jon Cryer and formerly Charlie Sheen. Stiles also made short guest appearances on \"Murphy Brown\", \"Mad About You\", \"Mad TV\", and \"Dharma & Greg\". In July 2008, he was a guest star on \"Reno 911!\" as Sergeant Clift, an acting coach.\n\nDuring the 1994 Major League Baseball strike Stiles appeared in several commercials for Nike, hanging out in an empty ballpark doing things such as playing the organ and attempting to do the wave alone. The commercials ended with the tag line: \"Play ball. Please.\"\n\n", "id": "315836", "title": "Ryan Stiles"}

There already begins Moravian Highlands with the occurrence of minerals and ores containing silver.\n\nIn 1526 King Louis Jagelonsky granted brothers Medencum of Ratiborice and Podoli right to extract minerals in a half miles in circumference around Ratiborice. The king reserved the preferential right to purchase precious metals, gold and lot for two stacks and talent of silver for three and a half stack.\n\nThis privilege started extensive mining activity area Ratiborice, which enriched the local landscape of picturesque islands heaps especially with forest vegetation.

The sport normally takes place on water that is moving very slowly or not moving at all. The goal of the sport is to move the canoe a given distance in the shortest time. This sport is an Olympic event. At one time, wooden boats were used for racing. Over time, people started using boats made of carbon fibers. These boats are lighter and tougher than wooden boats.\nThere are two main types of races. These are canoe (C1, C2, C4) and kayak (K1, K2, K4). The number tells how many people are on the boat. In a kayak, a person sits. In a canoe, a person kneels on one knee. A kayak has a rudder. It is used to steer the boat. A canoeist (person who uses a canoe) uses the paddle to move the boat. This is done by moving the paddle from the bow to the stern (front to back). After each race, the boats are looked at to make certain they are legal. If a boat does not have enough weight, the racer is disqualified and cannot win the race.\n\nRaces are divided into several groups based on how long they are.\nIn short distance races, the races are either 200 m, 500 m or 1000 m long. The path of the race is laid out using buoys. Each person has a separate path to follow from the starting line to the finish. On longer races, there may be a point where the paths cross each other to let the person turn their boat.\n\nLong distance races are 5000 m long. Marathon races are at least 15 km. Men's marathon has a minimum length of 20 km. Women's marathon has a minimum of 15 km. Most major races are 30 km or longer. There is no maximum distance for marathon races. There is a marathon race that is about 1000 km long on in the Yukon. The longer races are usually broken up into several parts and may be raced over several days. In long distance and marathon races, all racers start at the same time. They do not use \"intervals\" where the racers are started at different times.\n", "id": "315921", "title": "Canoe racing"}

Players use a receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide or look for containers, called \"geocaches\" or \"caches\".\n\nOne of the main ideas of geocaching is putting caches in places that are interesting, but not often visited by tourists. In the listing of the cache, information about the places is given.\n\nAfter 13 years of activity there are over 2,000,000 active geocaches. There are over 5 million geocachers worldwide.\n\nGeocaching was invented shortly after the removal of artificial error from GPS on May 2, 2000. Accuracy of the GPS before this date was about 100m, after this date is less than 3m. Improved accuracy allowed geocachers to specify where caches are located.\n\nThe first cache was placed on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer in Beavercreek. It was found by Mike Teague of Vancouver on May 6, 2000. The original name of the game is \"GPS Stash Hunt\", but it was changed on May 30, 2000 after the discussion of several players to \"Geocaching\". \n\nThe cache is usually in a waterproof plastic container with a logbook where geocachers write their registered nickname and date they find it. Larger containers usually contain items for trading like plastic toys, hockey cards or special trackable items called Travel Bugs or Geocoins. Trackable items are logged on the website and moved from cache to cache.\n\nThe coordinates of a hidden cache with the rating of the difficulty and terrain and information about size are placed by owner at the official website Geocaching.com. After checking by a reviewer, they are published and available for other geocachers.\n\nTraditional cache: The basic cache type, hidden on the place defined by coordinates in header of listing.\n\nMulti cache: The geocacher usually has to go over the stages, find some information at every stage (such as number on information board etc.) and at the finish calculate the coordinates of the final cache.\n\nMystery/puzzle cache (also called \"Unknown cache\"): The coordinates of the final cache are usually hidden in some cipher, image or text and the geocacher has to discover it.\n\nLetterbox hybrid cache: A combination of geocaching and letterboxing in the same container. Instead of a classic cache there is a stamp, which the finder can print to his or her diary.\n\nWebcam cache: It is not a typical cache where the geocacher has to find a hidden box with a logbook. Instead, he has to find a webcam on the published coordinates and take a photo of himself.\n\nVirtual cache: Similar to webcam cache, there is no hidden box at the coordinates. The geocacher only has to find out information such as the name on a monument and send it to the owner of the cache.\n\nEarth cache: Very similar to virtual cache, but in a geographically interesting place. The geocacher has to find out answers for the questions in a listing, take a photo here, and send it to the owner of the cache.\n\nEvent cache: Meeting organized and attended by geocachers. There is also special type of event – CITO (Cache in, trash out), where geocachers have to clean up an area. An event attended by more than 500 people is called a Mega-event, and an event attended by more than 5000 people is called a Giga-event\n", "id": "315927", "title": "Geocaching"}

Exiled from the court, El Cid went on to command a Moorish force. After the Christian defeat, El Cid was recalled to service. He took command of a combined Christian and Moorish army. He used this army to create his own fiefdom in Valencia. He was a brave general that lead his country to victory. El Cid was born in Vivar, also known as Castillona de Bivar. The Muslims gave him the nickname \"El Cid\" from the Spanish Arabic word al-sid, meaning \"lord.\" \n\nAfter his father, Diego Laínez was killed in 1058, El Cid was an orphan. He was then taken to the court of King Ferdinand I of Castile, and Ferdinand’s eldest son, Prince Sancho II became in charge of him. El Cid studied alongside Sancho III, Prince Sancho II’s son, and they soon became friends. El Cid then proved to become a fantastic warrior.\n\nWhen King Ferdinand (Ferdinand VI of Spain) of Castile died in 1065 the kingdom was divided into three parts, Castile for Sancho, Leon for Alfonso, and Galicia for García. El Cid became Sancho’s armiger regis, meaning standard bearer, and also became general of the army. \n\nBut King Sancho wanted to reunite all the three parts of his dead father's kingdom. He attacked his older brother Alfonso and defeated him and his army at Llantada in 1068. In 1072, with the help of El Cid, Sancho defeated Alfonso again at Golpejera. King Alfonso then sent his brother into exile. A Zamora knight slaughtered Sancho in October. \n\nAfter his brother's death, Alfonso returned from exile attempting to claim his dead brothers throne. El Cid then swore Alfonso to the throne and named him King.\n\nAlthough, Alfonso feared that El Cid would not prove loyal, but with no proof. In 1074, El Cid married Alfonso's niece, Jimena. Some believe the marriage was encouraged by Alfonso to bring El Cid under his watchful eye. Alfonso never gave El Cid a chance to make a better name for himself in the military, and kept him from becoming famous. \n\nEl Cid soon became fed up, and in 1081, without Alfonso's permission, he invaded the city of Toledo.\n\nThis made Alfonso very mad, and his advisors told him that El Cid had tried to betray him by attacking the city without his permission, false information. Alfonso then banished him from the city of Castile. \n\nEl Cid then worked as a paid, professional soldier for the Muslim king of Saragossa. During the time that had past, El Cid defeated Christian attacks and continued to make himself better known and more famous as a general. This caused other kings and generals to fear that El Cid would overtake them with his power.\n\nIn October 1086, Alfonso had a battle with the Almoravids. They attacked each other at Sagrajas, where Alfonso was defeated. The loss made Alfonso reconsider banishing El Cid. Alfonso called him back, hoping El Cid could defeat the Almoravids. However, the trust issues led the two men to go their separate ways yet again. The Alfonso and El Cid were meet together with their armies, but they failed to because of miscommunication. People convinced King Alfonso that El Cid had planned to not show up, and let Alfonso and his army be defeated. Once again, Alfonso exiled El Cid.\nEl Cid and his small army left, and invaded land in eastern Spain. Four years later, he ruled a large, wealthy plot of land, it’s capital being Valencia.\n\nHe ruled well, allowing Muslims and Christians to mingle. King Alfonso begged for El Cid’s help in his ongoing battle with the Almoravids. Meanwhile, the kingdom El Cid had worked so hard to build was falling apart from Muslim revolts. El Cid went back to Valencia and returned the city to peace.\n\nEl Cid continued to conquer many cities before his death on July 10, 1099 in Valencia.

As something starts to look more human-like, there is a point at which people start to feel it looks wrong. At this point, they have negative feelings toward the object. These feelings keep getting worse as the object is made to look more human-like. At a certain point, as the object starts to get very close to looking human-like, how people feel towards it tend to reverse and they have more positive emotional feelings towards it. The theory was created by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970.\nOne of the main points of the theory to explain this is that people are not as affected in an emotional way by the object if it is easy to tell it is not human. After a certain point, people start to feel emotionally about it, but feel negatively because it is so nonhuman. As it gets closer to looking human, they start to feel more positive emotions towards it. A graph of these feeling shows a valley.

Black started in the physiology department at the University of Glasgow. While there, he became interested in how adrenaline affected the human heart. He went to work for ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. While working for ICI, he created propranolol. Propranolol is a beta blocker, used to treat heart disease. Black also created cimetidine. It is a drug used to treat stomach ulcers. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for creating these drugs.\n\nBlack was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire. He was the fourth of five sons of a Baptist family. His father was a mining engineer. He grew up in Fife. Black went to Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. At the age of 15, he won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews. At St Andrews, he studied medicine. He graduated in 1946.\n\nAfter graduating he joined the Physiology department at University College as an Assistant Lecturer. He later took a lecturer position at the University of Malaya. Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he perceived as the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.\n\nAfter graduation, Black took a teaching job in Singapore for three years. He moved to London in 1950. Later in 1950, he returned to Scotland. He joined the University of Glasgow (Veterinarian School). There that he became interesteed in how adrenaline affects the human heart. He was mainly interesting in how it affected people with angina. He found the effects of adrenaline did not help. He joined ICI Pharmaceuticals in 1958. He worked with the company until 1964. During this time, he created propranolol, which became the world's best-selling drug. While at ICI, Black developed a new way of doing research. Before this, drug molecules would be created and then tested to find in what ways the molecules could be used as medicine. Black chose to pick a medical use and then try to create the molecules for that medicine. The discovery of propranolol was said to be the greatest discovery in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of digitalis.\n\nAt the same time, Black was trying to find a treatment for stomach ulcers. ICI did not wish to do this so Black stopped working for them in 1964. He joined Smith, Kline and French. He worked for them for nine years until 1973. While there, Black developed his second major drug, cimetidine. It was first sold under the brand name Tagamet in 1975. Tagamet soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.\n\nBlack became the department head of pharmacology at University College London in 1973. He created a new undergraduate course in medicinal chemistry. He had many problems trying to get money for research, so he quit. He went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1978. He worked there until 1984. Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of King's College London medical school. He stayed there until 1992. He created the James Black Foundation in 1988 with money from Johnson and Johnson. He worked with 25 scientists in drugs research. This research included gastrin inhibitors which may stop some stomach cancers.\n\nBlack helped increase basic scientific and clinical knowledge in cardiology. His creation of propranolol is thought to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and pharmacology of the 20th century.

Usually the person who exhibits this type of aggression feels provoked to do so. Instrumental relational aggression (predatory, goal-oriented) is used in order for an individual to get what they want.\n\nPredatory or defensive behavior between members of different species is not normally considered as \"aggression.\"\n\nLike most, or even all behaviors, aggression can be examined in terms of its ability to help an animal reproduce and survive. Animals may use aggression to gain and secure territories, as well as other resources including food, water, and mating opportunities.\n\nThe most apparent type of aggression is that seen in the interaction between a predator and its prey. An animal defending itself against a predator becomes aggressive in order to survive and predator in order to secure food. Because aggression against a much larger enemy or group of enemies would be nearly certain to lead to the death of an animal, animals have developed a good sense of when they are outnumbered. This ability to gauge the strength of other animals gives animals a \"fight or flight\" response to predators; depending on how strong they gauge the predator to be, animals will either become aggressive or flee.\n\nAlthough humans share aspects of aggression with non-human animals, they differ from most of them in the complexity of their aggression because of factors such as culture, morals, and social situations.\n", "id": "316206", "title": "Aggression"}

Many scientists have to send their information to the database. Major scientific journals and some funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health in the United States have rules telling scientists to send the data to the PDB. The PDB has the original or primary data. Hundreds of other databases reuse the data. These secondary databases organize the information in different ways.

In 2010 the population was only 14, making it the second-smallest incorporated community in Illinois. It was a major French colonial town of the Illinois Country. Its peak population was about 7,000 when it was a regional center. Kaskaskia became the capital of the Illinois Territory on February 3, 1809. In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state and Kaskaskia was its capital until 1819. \n\nIn April 1881, the Mississippi River moved its path to the east. This flooded most of the town. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. Kaskaskia is on a small part of Illinois west of the river. It can only be reached from Missouri.\n\nThe town was named after the Native American word for the Kaskaskia River. The site of Kaskaskia had been a Native American village for thousands of years. In 1703 French Jesuit missionaries started a mission. They wanted to change the Illini (Native American) people's religion to Catholicism. The first stone church was built in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post at the village. French settlers came to farm and mine lead on the Missouri side of the river. In 1718 Kaskaskia became the capital of Upper Louisiana and a fort, Fort de Chartres,was built.\nFrom its beginning, Kaskaskia was a French/Indian settlement, with a few French men and many Illinois and other Native Americans. In 1707, the population was about 2,200. Most were Illinois, who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. From the French, the Native Americans, and their mixed-race descendants at Kaskaskia came the voyageurs and coureurs des bois. They explored and hunted in the Missouri River country. The French wanted to trade with all the Prairie tribes, and with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. This idea horrified the Spanish. The explorer Claude Charles Du Tisne set up trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.\n\nKing Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church. During French rule, Kaskaskia and the other farming settlements in the Illinois Country were important for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn. Farmers sent tons of flour south over the years. These staple crops could not grow in Louisiana's climate.\n\nIn 1733, the French built Fort Kaskaskia. The British destroyed the fort in 1763 during the French and Indian War. After the war France gave up the territory east of the river. Many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to the Spanish-held, Upper Louisiana settlements of Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas.\n\nOn July 4 1778, during the American Revolution, the city was captured by George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men including Captain Leonard Helm. It was one of the western-most battles of the Revolution. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, which has since been called the \"liberty bell\". The bell is housed in a brick building near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The brick church was built in 1843 in the squared-off French style.\n\nAs a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia was the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until Illinois became a state in 1818. Zaskaskia continued as the state capital until 1819. Its peak population was about 7,000 before the capital moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River helped the economies of river towns in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Loss of trees (Deforestation) along the river banks was caused by steamboat crews' cutting trees to feed the engine fires. River banks became unstable and collapsed into the water.\n\nAt first, the town had a good site where the Kaskaskia and Mississippi Rivers joined. But from St. Louis to the junction of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, with more severe flooding. Much of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns have been lost through flooding and erosion. Following the Great Flood of 1844, Kaskaskia was rebuilt to the south. The original site became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed the original town, and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town. Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area.\n\nAs the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which is in the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old river bed, is regularly flooded. It has a bridge to carry traffic over it.

Such projections are necessary to create maps. The problem with projections is that they change the surface in some way; this is called distorsion. Depending on the purpose of the map, some distorsions may be acceptable. For this reason, there are different map projections that serve different purposes.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss showed that is not possible to project the surface of a sphere to a plane, without distorting it. This theorem is known as Theorema egregium today.\n\nTo understand the projections, it is easier to imagine a light source, a globe, and another geometric object. The light source shines \"a shadow\" of each point of the globe onto the geometric object. At the end the surface of the geometric object is unrolled, this yields the map. It is possible to tell the projections apart by the type of helper object used.\n\n", "id": "316327", "title": "Map projection"}

These days, it still exists in various cultures around the world among indigenous people in India, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Africa, North America and South America.\n\nThese range from the spiritual and physical protection of the child, bonding of father with child as well as wife, the public recognition of fatherhood and support and relief of mother so she can maintain the household after the childbirth.

Corydon was the second capital of the Indiana Territory, from May 1, 1813, until December 11, 1816. When Indiana became a US state in 1816, Corydon became Indiana's first state capital. On January 10, 1825 the capital moved to Indianapolis. The town remains the county seat of Harrison County. It had a population of 3,122 at the 2010 census.\n\nCorydon was part of the land captured for the United States by George Rogers Clark from the British during the American Revolution.\n\nIn the early 1800s, Edward Smith and his family settled on the site of today's county fairgrounds. William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana Territory, often stopped to rest at their home while travelling to and from Vincennes. Harrison decided to build a town there and asked Edward Smith's daughter, Jenny, to name it. She chose the name \"Corydon\" from Harrison's favorite hymn, the Pastoral Elegy.\n\nHarrison sold the town site to Harvey Heth in 1808, a government surveyor and large landowner. Heth donated the town square for public use, and sold individual lots to settlers and the government. In 1809, Corydon was joined by road to Doup's Ferry, 15 miles (24 km) to the south in Mauck's Port. This gave access to the Ohio River for trade. Corydon sent a mounted militia company company nicknamed the Yellow Jackets to support the US army in the War of 1812. They fought in the Battle of Tippecanoe.\n\nCorydon, Madison and Jeffersonville all wanted to be the new capital of the territory, but Corydon was more central to the population of the newly reorganized Indiana Territory. Corydon became the second capital of the Indiana Territory on May 1, 1813, when it was moved there from Vincennes. When Indiana became the 19th US state on 11 December 1816, Corydon became the state capital of Indiana. The first state capitol building made using limestone from a nearby quarry, was built from 1814-1816. The Governor's Mansion and First State Office Building were built in 1817. The Grand Masonic Lodge, the first in the state, was built in 1819.\n\nThe state's first constitution was written in Corydon during June 1816. The 43 delegates, representing Indiana Territory's counties, met in the Harrison County Courthouse. Because of cramped conditions inside the courthouse and the summer heat, they often met outside under a giant elm tree next to Big Indian Creek. This tree is now known as the Constitution Elm, and its trunk is still preserved. \n\nDennis Pennington, the speaker of territorial legislature and others from Harrison County in the Indiana General Assembly did not want to move the capital from Corydon. They added a clause to the state constitution during the convention preventing the capital from leaving the town before 1825. But as the population of the state shifted continually northward, it was no longer convenient to have a state capital at the southern edge of the state. The capital was finally moved to Indianapolis on January 10, 1825.\n\nCorydon was the site of the only Civil War battle fought in Indiana. On July 9, 1863, Confederate cavalry led by Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan, and citizens of Brandenburg, Kentucky, crossed the Ohio River into Indiana. This became known as \"Morgan's Raid\". Morgan's 2,500 men were opposed by 400 hastily assembled home guard at the Battle of Corydon. The Union troops were quickly defeated and the town surrendered. Corydon was sacked in retaliation for Union looting in Kentucky. The town's treasury of $690 was seized, and prisoners in the jail were released. Morgan demanded from $600 to $700 from each mill and shop owner; otherwise their buildings would be burned. Tradition says one Corydon miller overpaid by $200; Morgan promptly returned it to him.\n\nThe railroad reached Corydon in 1882. Corydon was connected by Southern Railways to the main line running across northern Harrison County at Crandall. The line remained open to passenger traffic until 1996. In 2008, the line was owned by Lucas Oil.\n\nIn 1929, the county built a new courthouse to replace the old state capitol building. The old statehouse was converted into an historical memorial.\n\nThe Old Capitol Building is now a state historic site and the downtown area became a National Historic District in 1973. The Governor's Headquarters, Constitution Elm, First State Office Building and Posey House are also part of the historic area. The O'Bannon Publishing Company prints the \"Corydon Democrat\"', a weekly newspaper. Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon owned the publishing company and his wife still lives nearby.\n\nCorydon is located at (38.212724, -86.125318).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km²), all land.\n\n", "id": "316370", "title": "Corydon, Indiana"}

China is a society which has had a very long history. This history was affected by the dynasties which have ruled it. They have slowly changed China into its current form.\n\nThe Xia dynasty lasted from 2070 BC until 1600 BC. It was the first ruling dynasty in Chinese history. The Xia was probably created by emperor Yu the Great. It is not known for certain if the Xia dynasty actually existed. Many people thinks that the Xia dynasty is only a legend. This is because there is no evidence that can prove that there was some dynasty before 1600 BC. There were found some archaeological excavations from 1500 BC which may come from the Xia dynasty. For example one of the excavations causes archaeologists to believe that the foundations of China were created during the Xia dynasty. Also there are findings of the oldest Chinese calendar called a lunar calendar. Xia dynasty was ended by a dynasty named Shang.\n\nThe Shang dynasty lasted from 1600 BC until 1046 BC. It started when Tang took control from the last Xai emperor, Jie. The dynasty ended with the suicide of Di Xin.\n\nThe Shang dynasty was important for Chinese culture. The first Chinese character fonts were created at this time. They were mainly used by seers and shaman. People made their own ritual vessels, agricultural and craft tools and even weapons. Everything was made of cast bronze.\n\nIn agriculture, millets, wheats and rice were the main crops. Mulberries were also grown. They were used to feed mulberry silkworms.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty lasted from 1045 BC until 256 BC. The Shangs had became weak because they were always fighting with a neighboring tribes. This was good for the less advanced Zhou. They defeat the Shang in the current town of An-yang. After that, the Zhou dynasty took the government. They ruled for the longest time of all Chinese dynasties. \n\nZhous were nomadic shepherds from the Shanxi province. The rulers of Zhou dynasty divided the country into four smaller areas. Each of these areas were controlled by relatives and members of aristocracy. Princes controlled fortified towns with a peasant background. They also helped the rulers at times of war.

It is a simple device and is easy to configure. A hub acts like a repeater: all data that arrives to one port is sent to all other ports (without looking at IP address for the data's destination). That means that all devices in this network will get all data. A hub is very simple device and does not operate Ethernet traffic. In contrast, a switch hub has a lower latency. Many hubs have LED signal lamps to show the state of the hub (which ports are conected and if the hub working). A \"collision\" happens when two or more devices on the same network try to send packets at the same time. When collisions happen all of the devices have to go through a routine to resolve the conflict. The process is set in the Ethernet Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) protocol\n\nSome hubs may also come with a BNC and/or Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) connector to allow connection to legacy 10BASE2 or 10BASE5 network segments.\n\nThere are three kinds of hubs:\n\nHubs can be used for:\nHistorically, the main reason for purchasing hubs rather than switches was their price.
