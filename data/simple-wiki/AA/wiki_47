{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157441", "text": "Saltwater crocodile\n\nThe Saltwater crocodile (\"Crocodylus porosus\") is the largest of all living reptiles. They are amphibious, living in sea water, rivers and on land. In terms of weight, it is the third largest amphibious animal, after the bull elephant seal (typically 2700 kg/6000 lb; 5 m/16 ft) and the walrus. \n\nCrocodiles are an ancient form of life, with fossils from 200 million years ago. 'Salties', as they are commonly called, are found in Northern Australia, New Guinea, some parts of Southeast Asia, and the surrounding waters. They live in habitats near the coast: rivers, swamps, billabongs, beaches and sometimes the open sea.\n\nThe saltwater crocodile is a large reptile growing to about in length. The males are bigger than the female, with some rare individuals as long as 6.32 metres (20.7 feet). Others believe in a slightly smaller size of 6.3 metres (20.7 feet). They can weigh up to . They have a powerful tail which helps with swimming. They have a wide snout, with big scales making two rows down their neck and back.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles are now a protected species in Australia. However, if a human is at risk of being attacked, the crocodile will be moved to avoid possible harm. Many years ago, Australia used to export crocodile skin. Between 1945 and 1958 more than 87,000 skins were exported. They became so scarce that hunters had difficulty finding any. They were protected in Western Australia in 1969, the Northern Territory in 1971, and Queensland in 1974. Hunting crocodiles is now illegal. There are now farms to breed crocodiles for the skins to make leather, meat and for Chinese medicines.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles reproduce during the wet season, in Australia from November to March. There is a complex mating ritual which includes them rubbing their heads and bodies together, before they mate in the water. The female builds a nest with plants that she breaks off with her teeth, and then pushes together with her back legs. A female crocodile can lay up to 60 eggs at a time. These eggs are large, with a hard shell. They take about three months to hatch. If the temperature in the nest is less than 32 degrees Celsius, the baby crocodiles will be female. If the temperature is between 32 and 33 degrees the babies will be male. When the crocodiles hatch out of the eggs, the mother will carry them in her mouth to the water. Only a very small number of them survive in the wild and grow to be adult crocodiles.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles can be dangerous (and very aggressive) to both humans and other animals. They can move very fast in the water and on land. Sometimes, they can kill a person, but this does not happen very often. Usually, there are \"No Swimming\" signs near areas with high crocodile activity. Crocodiles can lie very still for up to one hour. They are able to leap as high as . In March 1987, a Toyota land cruiser collided with a crocodile at Cahill's Crossing on the East Alligator River. The crocodile knocked the motor car off the roadway with its tail. Crocodiles can also live in fresh water. Scientists have found crocodiles up to 235 kilometres from the sea.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles can go a long time without eating. When it is time for them to eat, they will catch fish, crustaceans, birds or grazing animals that have come to the water to drink. \n\n\n", "id": "157441", "title": "Saltwater crocodile"}

It is about 100 kilometres west-northwest of St. John's. South Dildo is a neighbouring unincorporated community.\n\nDildo's history goes back to 2000 BC, when Maritime Archaic aboriginal people lived at Anderson's Cove. By 700 AD, the Dorset culture was on Dildo island. In 1613, the Beothuks, who were living on Dildo Island at this time. Henry Crout met them, traded with them, and left gifts. In 1711, the people of Trinity Bay were ordered by Governor Crow to leave their homes during the winter, to defend themselves against the French who burned their houses. Dildo Island was one of the places designated for this purpose. The town of Dildo was created in the late 1700s and settled to use the marine resources such as fish (mostly cod), whales and seals.\n\nThe first church was built in 1878. It was a simple structure with no tower. It was wide by long. It could hold 250 people. It was heated by two coal stoves, one at each end, which shared a chimney. This church served the community until 1964 when the present (larger) building was constructed.\n\nDildo has a fast-growing tourist industry. It has picturesque scenery, several bed and breakfasts, places to eat, the Dildo Museum interpretive centre, the Historic Dildo Days celebration in August, boat tours, the Society of United Fishermen, the Lions centre, several heritage structures, walking trails, many businesses and road sign souvenirs.\n\nDildo has been in many media outlets. It was on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's \"On the Road Again\" and \"Land and Sea\". It was also on a live radio broadcast from the interpretation centre. In August 2006, Dildo was the subject of the \"What the...?\" segment on the Australian television talk show \"Rove Live\". The town is mentioned in the song \"A Night in Dildo\" by The Arrogant Worms.\n\nSouth Dildo is an unincorporated community. In 2008, 205 people lived there. At the beginning of the 20th century, South Dildo had lumbering work. It supplied a schooner to the Labrador fishery. It had the roadside attraction of a wooden life-size humpback whale head. (The whale head was destroyed at the beginning of the 2006-2007 winter.)\n\n", "id": "157443", "title": "Dildo, Newfoundland and Labrador"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157570", "text": "Natural gas vehicle\n\nA natural gas vehicle or NGV is an alternative fuel vehicle that uses (compressed or liquefied) natural gas instead of other fossil fuels.\n\nNatural gas is a mixture. It consists mainly of hydrocarbons. The main component is methane. Natural gas is often found in the ground together with petroleum.\n\nThe main difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation. Natural gas pipelines are economical, but are impractical across oceans. Liquefied natural gas tankers are also used.\n\nCompressed natural gas (CNG) is stored in containers at high pressure. \nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) is stored at temperatures as low as - 260°F (- 162°C). At these temperature conditions, natural gas is in a liquid state.\n\nNatural gas is used for the production of electricity, it is also often used because it makes less pollution than other fossil fuels. Some is used as fuel for vehicles.\n\nÉtienne Lenoir built 1862 the first gas engine, before there have been fuel and diesel engines. Over the years gas was used in many different machines, so the technology improved also. From the 1950s the automobile industry focused more on fuel technology than on gas technology. There have only been single cars with natural gas technology and few gas stations which offered natural gas. Because of climate and environment the role of natural gas became more and more important.\n\nWorldwide existing about 5.7 million natural gas vehicles.(Argentina, Brasilia and Pakistan together count 4.2 million!)\n\n\"Europe\"\n\nThe French automobile producer Citroen is cooperating with a French gas supplier and wants to offer a compressor which is connected to the private gas connection at home, so that everyone can refuel his car at home.The price for the compressor will be about 500 €. There will be also a tax reduction for people who have bought a new NGV. And the business group carrefour wants to install natural gas stations.(Region Toulouse)\n\nIn London and surroundings, NGVs are free from paying the city toll. Owners of NGVs have to pay less motor vehicle tax.\n\nUntil 2011 MAN will deliver 135 busses with natural gas engines for the municipal use of the city Den Haag.\n\n\"Asia\"\n\nThe Turkish capital Ankara will increase their use of natural gas vehicles about 500.\n\nIn India has already started a development programme to reduce pollution.\n\nThe number of NGVs increases very fast in Pakistan. Meanwhile there are driving about 1.4 million cars.\n\nIn Thailand, the government is planning a switch from fuel gas stations to natural gas stations, and to develop the NGVs.\n\n\"America\"\n\nIn Brasilia, the police of Rio de Janeiro had 632 natural gas vehicles.\n\nThe use of NGV in the USA, makes it possible to maintain under the Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Standards(ULEV).\n\nThere are two variants of NG-technology, either the bifuel version, that means that the vehicle can drive with fuel or natural gas, or the monofuel version, this vehicle can only drive with natural gas. In principle the natural gas engine works like a otto-engine, the only significant difference is that this engine needs a natural gas-air-mix instead of fuel-air-mix.\n\nA conversion is possible with each car(with a few exceptions).\n\nThe automobile industry will offer a new natural gas technology with turbo --> Turbo natural gas(TNG).\n\n\nThe advantages of natural gas are the lower price in comparison with fuel and the lower tax rate.\n\nSince January 2008 there are 771 natural gas stations in Germany. The supply network will expand constantly.The E.ON Gas Mobil GmbH wants to install over 150 natural gas stations close to the freeways.\n\nThe natural gas technology was and is still very popular. Because of the current gas-conflict in Russia, natural gas became less popular. However, natural gas is a finite resource. The prices for gas will increase in the next years (like fuel), so there will be needed new technologies in the future.\n\n", "id": "157570", "title": "Natural gas vehicle"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=157665", "text": "Serial number\n\nA serial number is a unique number used for identification. Serial numbers are made in such a way that they change by a fixed discrete integer value, each time a new serial number is needed. Most people refer to any identifier that has numbers and letters in it as a serial number and that can be used to pick a certain item of a large number of items. Not every numerical identifier is a serial number; identifying numbers which are not serial numbers are sometimes called nominal numbers.\n\nSequence numbers are almost always non-negative, and typically start at zero or one. \n\nSerial numbers can be very useful for quality control. That way, if there is a problem with a certain batch of products, the serial number of one defective item can tell which items are affected by the problem. Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products, because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used. Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily.\n\nMany computer programs come with serial numbers, often called \"Compact Disc keys\", and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue. These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys. \n\nSerial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency, because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number. \n\nThe International Standard Serial Number or ISSN can be seen on magazines and other periodicals. It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for books. It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical, like a newspaper.\n\nCertificates and Certificate Authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic \n\nThe term \"serial number\" is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression \"service number\". In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft. It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft's fin/rudder(s). Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a \"tail number\".\n\nIn the case of the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the \"Serial\" takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers, e.g., \"BT308\"—the prototype Avro Lancaster, or \"XS903\"—an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook . During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had \"/G\" added to the end of the serial, the \"G\" signifying \"Guard\", denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., \"LZ548/G\"—the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or \"ML926/G\"—a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this two-letter, three-number scheme, the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps (RFC) utilised a serial consisting of a letter followed by four figures, e.g., \"D8096\" - a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or \"K5054\" - the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The serial number follows the aircraft throughout its period of service.\n\nSerial numbers are often used in network protocols. However, most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently-allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers, but not other recently-allocated serial numbers. To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, RFC 1982, \"Serial Number Arithmetic\" defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers.\n\nLollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols.\n\n\n\n", "id": "157665", "title": "Serial number"}

The place where the government and courts for the town is called the \"county seat\". \n\nOn average, a county in the United States has a population of around 100,000 people. The county that has the most people living in it is Los Angeles County, California. Around 9.8 million people live there. The county that has the fewest people living in it is Loving County, Texas, with only 67 people living in the entire county. \n\nThe average number of counties in each state is 62. Delaware has the least amount of counties with only 3 counties. Texas has the most counties with 254. \n\nThese pages list all of the counties in each state:\n\n", "id": "157913", "title": "County (United States)"}

Sixteen formed from a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern shores of Nicaragua on October 13. The disturbance quickly turned into a tropical depression the next day while being very close to the coastline. Because of its close distance towards land, the depression was not able to form strong convection, which was the reason why it did not become stronger. Once off the northern shores of Honduras, the depression became disorganized, but was able to strengthen a little bit, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. The depression then moved onshore and quickly died out by the next morning.\n\nA lot of rainfall from the depression started deadly flooding in Central America which left at least 75 people dead and forcing 100,000 people to move, and being responsible for $150 million in damage.\n\nOn the afternoon of October 13, a large area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, about 160 mi (160 km) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The low was found in a place that was good for development and a tropical cyclone formation alert was given out soon after the low formed. The low slowly became better organized and was thought to have turned into a tropical depression the next morning while it was 50 mi (80 km) northeast of the Nicaragua/Honduras border. The depression was predicted to move across from the coastline, and later move to the west when it was north of Honduras, and by then make landfall in Belize as a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) on October 18.\n\nBut the convection that was associated with the depression went away and the whole structure of the storm started to get worse. The depression stayed disorganized during the morning, in spite of curved banding traits forming, they stayed far from the center of circulation. In the late afternoon, the depression mooved onto the northern coastline of Honduras with winds still at 30 mph (45 km/h). Even though being over land and still being disorganized, the depression became a little bit more strong enough to reach its peak intensity of 35 mph (55 km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. This happened because of a mistake of a QuikSCAT satellite pass a ship, with the code H3VR, reporting 38 mph (61 km/h) sustained winds, and a buoy report. However, the winds were actually though to have been weaker than what was said because of the ridge of high pressure that was over the southern United States. The final advisory on the depression was given out the next morning as it turned back into a remnant low.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center gave out a lot of tropical storm watches while the storm was still alive, while in Costa Rica a red alert warning was put into effect across much of the country, and more than 100,000 people were told to move to safer places. Because the depression never became a tropical storm, tropical storm-conditions were not felt in the watch areas.\n\nHeavy rains from the depression's remnant low left at least 16 people dead and six missing and forced 100,000 other people from their homes across Central America. The depression destroyed bridges, flooded villages and blocked roads. Total damage is thought to be at about $150 million (2008 USD).\n\n\n", "id": "157957", "title": "Tropical Depression Sixteen (2008)"}

It was discovered on November 14, 2003 by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. Around 1250-1800 km in diameter, Sedna takes roughly 10,500 years to orbit the Sun, much higher than most known trans-Neptunian objects. It is one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System. Therefore, Sedna's surface temperature never rises above -240°C. \n\nThe name \"Sedna\" comes from the Inuit goddess of the sea, thought to live at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.\n\nNASA is not currently planning any space missions to explore Sedna, but there is some talk of missions to happen when Sedna reaches perihelion again. It is considered to be a likely candidate as a dwarf planet.\n\nNo pictures can be taken of Sedna because very little light from the Sun reaches it. For this reason, Sedna is known as \"Cobian\", meaning shadows in Ancient Greek. Due to its orbit, the chances of Sedna being found were 0.017%. 40-120 more objects this size should exist without us knowing, but, as they are so small and far away, they may not be discovered for a while.\n", "id": "157961", "title": "90377 Sedna"}

The snake is found in Central and South America, and on some islands in the Caribbean. The common name is the same as the scientific name, which is unusual. The color pattern of its skin can vary considerably. Boa constrictors grow to a large size. There are ten subspecies.\"\n\nThe size adult animals reach varies among subspecies. The largest animals have been found in Northern south America. Two animals from Suriname are currently the largest on record: One reached 411cm (13.5 ft), the other 427cm (a bit over 14 ft). Such sizes are rare, boas reaching 3m are considered large. There is a report of a boa reaching 5.6m in Trinidad, but it is believed that snake was an anaconda,\"Eunectes murinus\", taken for a boa. \n\nBoas can use their tail to grasp things. Boas do not have organs that react to warmth around the mouth.\n\nBoas have a color pattern that is brownish, and becomes brick red around the tail. Dorsally, the ground color is overlaid with a series of large tan-colored saddles that become lighter towards the tail. Here, the saddles break up into half rings of a pale cream color in vivid contrast with the red.\n\nAll boids are constrictors, that is, they kill by squeezing their prey to suffocation. This species is a rare instance of an animal having the same common and scientific binomial name.\n\nAll subspecies are referred to as \"boa constrictors\". \n\"B. c. constrictor\" is also called the \"common boa.\"\n\nOther common names include \"jibóia\" (Brazil) and \"macajuel\" (Trinidadian, pronounced \"mah-cah-well\").\n\nFound from northern Mexico through Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) to South America north of 35°S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina. Also in the Lesser Antilles (Dominica and St. Lucia), on San Andrés, Providencia and many other islands along the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America.\n\nFlourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid country.\n\nSmall individuals may climb into trees and shrubs to forage, but they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. It is said that specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily.\n\nPrey includes a wide variety of mammals and birds. Their diet mostly consists of rodents, but larger lizards and mammals as big as ocelots are also reported to have been consumed.\n\nOvoviviparous, females give birth to live young that average 15-20 inches (38-51 cm) in length.\n\nThis species does well in captivity, usually becoming quite tame. It is a common sight in zoos. Captive longevity is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts of over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, it is widely bred in captivity.\n\n", "id": "157964", "title": "Boa constrictor"}

The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine. The term \"vermiform\" comes from Latin and means \"worm-like in appearance\".\n\nThe appendix has no function in humans, but it can cause diseases (like appendicitis). In us, it is a vestigial organ.\n\nDarwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates. Over time, humans have eaten fewer vegetables and have evolved. Over thousands of years, this organ has become smaller to make room for the stomach. It is a vestigial organ which has degraded to nearly nothing in the course of evolution.\n\nHerbivorous mammals such as the Koala have large appendices, and usually other adaptations as well. Cellulose, from plant cell walls, is hard to break down. The cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines as it is in humans, but is very long. This enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown.\n\nEarly man’s ancestor may have also relied upon this system and lived on a diet rich in foliage. As man began to eat foods easier to digest, they became less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy.\n\nRecent work shows the appendix is a safe place for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines. This proposal is based on a new understanding of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial gut flora, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop University-Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of \"Clostridium difficile\" colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a \"safe house\" for commensal (\"good\") bacteria. This reservoir of gut flora could then serve to repopulate the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera.\n", "id": "158019", "title": "Vermiform appendix"}

They can be found in the Amazon River and to the people who live there, they are the most feared fish in its waters, even over the piranha. They are eel-shaped and translucent, making them very difficult to see in the water. Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 inches (~15 cm) in length.\n\nThe area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the Rio Negro, near Brazil's inland city of Manaus.\n\nCandiru are parasites. Their ability to find breath currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species, where they feed on their prey's blood.\n\nWhile the fish in the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood, fish in Stegophilinae may feed on scales, mucus, or carrion.\n\nTo hunt for its prey, the Candirú lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals, such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish. Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines. Then, it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes, which usually causes the victim to die. It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal. \n\nThese smaller species are known for being thought to invade and make use of a person's urethra. Even with reports as old as the 1800s, the first written case of the removal of a candiru from a person did not occur until 1997, and even that incident is not believed by everyone.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158508", "text": "Slide rule\n\nThe slide rule, or \"slipstick\", is a mechanical analog computer. The slide rule is used mainly for multiplication and division, and also for \"scientific\" functions such as roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but usually not for addition or subtraction.\n\nThere are many different styles of slide rules. They are usually linear or circular. They have a standardised set of markings (called scales). These scales are used for mathematical computations. Some slide rules have been made for special use, as for aviation or finance. Those slide rules have special scales for those applications, as well as normal scales.\n\nWilliam Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 1600s. The slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by John Napier. Before electronic calculators were developed, slide rules were the tool used most often in science and engineering. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced; but around 1974 the pocket calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business.\n\nIn its most basic form, the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More complex slide rules allow other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.\nMathematical calculations are done by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with one on one of the fixes strips. \nThe relative position of other marks can then be observed. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.\n\nThe user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.\n\nMost slide rules have three linear strips of the same length. The strips are aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.\n\nSome slide rules (\"duplex\" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip, still others on one side only (\"simplex\" rules). A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not next to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.\n\nA logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules formula_1 and formula_2. \nMoving the top scale to the right by a distance of formula_3, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label formula_4 on the bottom, aligns each number formula_5, at position formula_6 on the top scale, with the number at position formula_7 on the bottom scale. Because formula_8, this position on the bottom scale gives formula_9, the product of formula_4 and formula_5. For example, to calculate 3*2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top.\n\nOperations may go \"off the scale;\" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2×7. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively multiplying by 0.2 instead of by 2, as in the illustration below:\n\nHere the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2×7, but instead we calculated 0.2×7=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2×7; some other methods are:\n\n\nMethod 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.\n\nThe illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.\n\nIn addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular were trigonometric, usually sine and tangent, common logarithm (log) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), natural logarithm (ln) and exponential (\"e\") scales. Some rules include a Pythagorean scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:\n\nThe Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.\n\nThere are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute formula_12, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.\n\nFor formula_13 problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with x on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find y on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with x on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If y is \"off the scale,\" locate formula_14 and square it using the A and B scales as described above.\n\nThe S, T, and ST scales are used for trigonometric functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees. Many slide rules have their S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes. So-called \"decitrig\" models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.\n\nBase-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e.\n\nThe Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student, Stephen B. Cohen, in 1958. The original intent was to allow the user to select an exponent \"x\" (in the range 0 to 2.3) on the Ln scale and read e on the C (or D) scale and e on the CI (or DI) scale. Pickett, Inc. was given exclusive rights to the scale. Later, the inventor created a set of \"marks\" on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 2.3 limit, but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rules.\n\nSlide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.\n\nThe first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:\n\nFor subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:\n\nThis method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the logarithmic number system in specialized computer applications like the Gravity Pipe (GRAPE) supercomputer and hidden Markov models.\n\nThe second method uses a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.\n\nThe length of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal length of the scales. Scales on the most common \"10-inch\" models are actually 25 cm in length, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5 inches. Models a couple of meters long were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes. \n\nTypically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifying cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.\n\nVarious other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called \"Darmstadt\" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often \"split\" to get higher accuracy.\n\nSpecialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.\n\nCircular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors (left), and another with a movable disk and a single cursor (right). The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by maintaining a fixed angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The single cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.\n\nThe basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the longest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by π). For example, the outer scale of a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30 cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate \"off-scale\" calculations, because the scales were designed to \"wrap around\"; they never have to be re-oriented when results are near 1.0—the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale length is shortened to make room for end margins.\n\nCircular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1 mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2 mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than \"split\" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale.\n\nThe main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a rotating disc, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.\n\nOne slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called \"prayer wheel\" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of its mastery.\n\nIn 1952, Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a \"navigation computer\", featured airspeed, rate/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer–nautical mile and gallon–liter fuel amount conversion functions.\n\nTraditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.\n\nIn 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933 , and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid or plastic. Later slide rules were made of plastic, or aluminum painted with plastic. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.\n\nAll premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool. For painted slide rules, and the faint of heart, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.\n\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620–1630, shortly after John Napier's publication of the concept of the logarithm. Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale, which, with additional measuring tools, could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by Edmund Wingate (c. 1593 – 1656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled \"“L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie”.\" The book contains a double scale on one side of which is a logarithmic scale and on the other a tabular scale. In 1630, William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules, held together with the hands, to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, Isaac Newton, Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students, but delayed in publishing them, and like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, Henry Coggeshall created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the Coggeshall slide rule. His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, Peter Roget invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nThe more modern form was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Amédée Mannheim, \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around that time, as engineering became a recognized professional activity, that slide rules came into wide use in Europe. They did not become common in the United States until 1881, when Edwin Thacher introduced a cylindrical rule there. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co. of New York.\n\nAstronomical work also required fine computations, and in 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.\n\nIn World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule \"chassis\" with an aluminum body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession (in the same way that the stethoscope symbolizes the medical profession). German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun brought two 1930s vintage \"Nestler\" slide rules with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War II to work on the American space program. Throughout his life he never used any other pocket calculating devices; slide rules served him perfectly well for making quick estimates of rocket design parameters and other figures. Aluminum Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions, including to the moon, according to advertising on Pickett's N600 slide rule boxes .\n\nSome engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, and even into the mid 1970s this was a common sight on campuses. Students also might keep a ten-or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.\n\nIn 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on \"prosthaphaeresis\", an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. There has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype, however. \n\nThe importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s, became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. The introduction of Fortran in 1957 made computers practical for solving modest size mathematical problems. IBM introduced a series of more affordable computers, the IBM 650 (1954), IBM 1620 (1959), IBM 1130 (1965) addressed to the science and engineering market. John Kemeny's BASIC programming language (1964) made it easy for students to use computers. The DEC PDP-8 minicomputer was introduced in 1965.\n\nComputers also changed the nature of calculation. With slide rules, there was a great emphasis on working the algebra to get expressions into the most computable form. Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation. Fortran allowed complicated formulas to be typed in from textbooks without the effort of reformulation. Numerical integration was often easier than trying to find closed form solutions for difficult problems. The young engineer asking for computer time to solve a problem that could have been done by a few swipes on the slide rule became a humorous cliché. Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note \"In case of emergency, break glass.\"\n\nAnother step toward the replacement of slide rules with electronics was the development of electronic calculators for scientific and engineering use. The first included the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2, introduced in 1965, which used logarithms for multiplication and division and the Hewlett-Packard HP-9100, introduced in 1968. The HP-9100 had trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in addition to exponentials and logarithms. It used the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.\n\nThe last nail in the coffin for the slide rule was the launch of pocket-sized scientific calculators, of which the 1972 Hewlett-Packard HP-35 was the first. Such calculators became known as \"slide rule\" calculators since they could perform most or all of the functions on a slide rule. At several hundred dollars, even this was considered expensive for most students. While professional slide rules could also be quite expensive, drug stores often sold basic plastic models for under $20 USD. But by 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for under $50. By 1976 the TI-30 offered a scientific calculator for under $25. After this time, the market for slide rules dried up quickly as small scientific calculators became affordable.\n\n\nOne advantage of using a slide rule together with an electronic calculator is that an important calculation can be checked by doing it on both; because the two instruments are so different, there is little chance of making the same mistake twice.\n\n\n\nGeneral information, history:\n\nHow-to's:\n", "id": "158508", "title": "Slide rule"}

Nick is not rich, but he lives in a rich area that has two towns called East Egg and West Egg. The \"old rich\" live in East Egg while the \"new rich\" live in West Egg. Nick lives in a small house in West Egg. Nick's next-door neighbor is Jay Gatsby. Jay is in love with Nick's cousin Daisy. However, Daisy is married to a man named Tom. The novel is about Jay and his hope that he can steal Daisy from Tom. \n\nThe events of the novel happen in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a man who grew up in the American Midwest, is the narrator. Nick is a World War I veteran and a Yale University graduate who wants a more exciting life. He moves to New York, to be a bonds salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of West Egg. The person living next to him is Jay Gatsby, a mysterious man who also has a lot of money. Jay Gatsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never participates in his own parties; because of this, many rumors are formed as to Gatsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment.\n\nLater in the summer, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties. There, he meets Gatsby himself, a young and charming man. Nick learns that Gatsby was once in a romantic relationship with Daisy, many years ago. Gatsby is still in love with her, and spends many nights looking at the green light from Daisy's dock across his mansion. He is hoping that he could impress Daisy with his rich lifestyle and wild parties. Gatsby grew up very poor and with little opportunity to move up in the world, and this motivated him to pursue wealth to reinvent himself and become worthy of being with Daisy. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange for Daisy and him to meet. Nick invites them both over for tea, and they begin to fall in love again. They then start an affair with one another.\n\nAfter a short time, Tom notices that Daisy and Gatsby are in love. The group meets at a hotel, where Daisy is forced to choose between Gatsby and Tom. She chooses Tom, and the group begins to drive home. Along the way, Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally hits and kills Myrtle. Gatsby tells Nick that he will take the blame in order to save Daisy. Later, he is then shot dead by Myrtle's husband, George, believing that Gatsby was the one responsible. George then kills himself.\n\nNick holds a funeral for Gatsby, but very few people show up despite Gatsby having been famous. Angry and sad about everything that has happened, Nick decides to leave New York to move back to the Midwest.\n\n", "id": "158557", "title": "The Great Gatsby"}

It plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines. \n\nMucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides, which are long-chain carbohydrates. These molecules are stiff when dry, and sticky and slippery when wet. They are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to man. \n\nIn vertebrates mucus is made by mucous membranes. Mucus may have antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes) and immunoglobulins (antigens). A major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by fungi, bacteria and viruses. \n\nMucus protects epithelial cells in the lungs, gut, genital, visual, and auditory systems in mammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. Snails, slugs, hagfish, and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus. As well as a protective function, slime helps movement and plays a role in communication. \n\nMucus is produced in many parts of the body. All the alimentary canal, nose, and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces. The surfaces are mostly internal surfaces, though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal. Slugs are an example of this. Mucus glands are exocrine glands, so they pass their mucus to the surface along ducts.\n\nIn the human digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, such as food passing down the oesophagus. \n\nA layer of mucus along the inner walls of the stomach is vital to protect the cell linings from the highly acidic environment inside the stomach. Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract. \n\nAlkaline mucus is also found in other places, such as eyes, saliva and cervix.\n", "id": "158813", "title": "Mucus"}

The luna moth is thought to be North America's most beautiful insect.\n\nThe luna moth has a wingspan of 7.5 to 10.5 cm. The wings are lime-green. The bottom wings have long tails. There is a clear spot on each wing. There is a reddish-brown border on the top edge of the top wing. Some individuals have pinkish borders on the outer edge of both wings. Other individuals have yellowish borders instead. Adult Luna Moths have no mouth at all, rendering them completely harmless. They live by the fat they stored up at the larval stage. Because of this, they only live for about one week.\n\nThe luna moth is found in North America. It is found from Nova Scotia, west to North Dakota, south to Texas, and east to Florida.\n\nThe luna moth is found in habitats such as woodlands and forests.\n\nThe luna moth is seen from May to July in the northern part of its range. It is seen from March to September in the southern part of its range.\n\nThe luna moth's eggs are brown. The caterpillar is green. It has bright red spots on its body. There are two yellow stripes that run down each side of the body. The caterpillar will grow to 6.5 cm long. The luna moth caterpillar is similar to the polyphemus moth (\"Antheraea polyphemus\") caterpillar. The polyphemus moth caterpillar does not have the yellow stripes on its body. The luna moth's cocoon is made of dead leaves on the ground. It overwinters (spends the winter) as a cocoon. The luna moth has one brood (a brood is a group of offspring) each year in the northern part of its range. It has three broods each year in the southern part of its range.\n\nThe caterpillars feed on the following host plants:\n\n", "id": "158829", "title": "Actias luna"}

They are also known as Golden hamsters because the first ones kept as pets were gold coloured. Now there are over 100 different colours because of selective breeding. Little is known about their life in the wild. They are kept as pets in many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Australia.\n\nA Syrian hamster's anatomy is similar to other rodents. It is very close to other hamsters.\n\nSyrian hamsters have 16 teeth. There are 4 incisors and 12 molars. There is a space between the incisors and the molars. That space is called the diastema.\n\nThe spine, like in other animals, is made up of several bones called vertebrae. A Syrian hamster has 43-44 vertebrae. Thirteen to fourteen of them are in the tail.\n\nAll hamsters have short legs. Because of this, their legs have small bones which can get broken more easily. Obese hamsters are more likely to have problems with their legs.\n\nSyrian hamsters have, like most animals, five senses. They can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. They have bad eyesight. They use smell to find food. Some people believe they are colorblind and don't see well in daylight. This is because they are nocturnal and can see blue-green colours but not red colours. Other evidence suggests they can see very well. Their tongue senses taste in the same way as humans do, salty at the tip of the tongue, bitter at the back and sweet at the sides.\n\nNot much is known about Syrian hamster breeding in the wild. They have been bred well in captivity (i.e. in labs, by breeders and when kept as pets). People have learned a lot about their breeding. Breeding in captivity is probably the same as in the wild.\n\nSyrian hamsters are believed to have the shortest gestation period of any animal. Their gestation is 16 days.\n\nThey also have a short ovulation period. Syrian hamsters come into heat once every 4 days for about 1-2 hours.\n", "id": "158861", "title": "Syrian hamster"}

The wave moved west-northwest with a small amount of convection, before being completely organized enough to become a tropical depression while west of the Cape Verde Islands. It became a tropical storm later that same day, and began weakening almost right away thereafter as it moved in to an area of higher vertical wind shear. The storm finally died out early on October 15. Nana did not have an effect on any land areas or ships.\n\nA tropical wave moved west, awat from the western coast of Africa on October 6. This wave continued moving west with just a little bit of convection until October 8, when organized cloud bands began to form around its low-level center. The wave continued moving westward and organizing until it was called a tropical depression early on October 12, west of the Cape Verde Islands. It began moving towards the west-northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge while becoming stronger to its strongest point of . As it did so, it went into an area of strong upper level winds, which began moving the thunderstorm clouds to the east of the center of circulation. Just twelve hours later, it had weakened back into a tropical depression, and by October 14 it had weakened back to just little more than a low-level cloud swirl. It died out early the next day as it combined itself with a powerful front, east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.\n\nTropical Storm Nana's formation was expected for a few days before it actually developed. Movement and strength predictions were also better than the long term average. Because of Nana's short life the sample size is not very meaningful. Tropical Storm Nana stayed in the middle of the Atlantic and never came near land. As a result, it had no known impact. No ships reported strong winds that came from the tropical storm.\n\n", "id": "158919", "title": "Tropical Storm Nana (2008)"}

Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer-than-normal. It got some characteristics more normal for subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it came closer to western North America, it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused a lot of rainfall in British Columbia.\n\nA cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved into a place with sea surface temperatures as high as 2 °C above normal for two days. By October 31 the system had gotton convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like characteristic. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest.\n\nOn November 1, the system had estimated winds of 100 km/h (60 mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, moved counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. On November 2, wind shear started affecting the storm, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520 mi (840 km) off the coast of Oregon.\n\nThis system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989 mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured.\n\nAs a result, to the weather system, the American National Weather Service gave out wind watches for the Oregon Coast. The system brought heavy rain to parts of Vancouver Island.\n\nIf Storm 91C is really a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it has several records. Since right now it is not officially either, its holding these records is also unofficial. Because the storm formed at 36°N, this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32°N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's track data shows that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149°W and dissipated at 135°W. Only two other known tropical cyclones had done that before.\n\nThis system has been thought to be a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone.\n\nMark Guishard, a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service, had the opinion that the system had finished tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone. Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes, Hurricane Vince in example. James Franklin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, thought that:\nThe system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually lost... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on balance, it was more tropical than subtropical.\nClark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was same with that of a subtropical or barely tropical cyclone. NASA, which is not a meteorological agency, thought that the system was a subtropical cyclone.\n\nIn its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said that the storm was to be an extratropical cyclone. Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100 km/h (60 mi/h), which are above the 60 km/h (39 mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would be able to be a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Centre, include this system in their yearly archives, nor is it included in the official \"best track\" file. So this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.\n\n", "id": "158968", "title": "2006 Central Pacific cyclone"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159308", "text": "Tropical Storm Laura (2008)\n\nTropical Storm Laura was the twelfth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Laura formed out of a large non-tropical low pressure area 1015 miles (1635 km) west of the western islands of the Azores on September 29. Laura slowly got tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September 30, Laura had gotten enough tropical characteristics to be designated as a \"Tropical Storm\". Soon after becoming tropical, Laura began to start an extratropical transition, which did not completely take place until the morning of October 1. Laura became reduced into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the storm.\n\nIn late September, a large non-tropical system over the north-central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores. The low produced hurricane-force winds, but did not exhibit the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. The storm steadily weakened over the following days, but developed tropical characteristics as it moved over slightly warmer waters. By September 29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mph (95 km/h).\n\nThe overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics. During the afternoon, satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80 mi (130 km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was upgraded to a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 41.2°N.\n\nNot long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day. Overnight, convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October 1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system. Laura later degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, a term that had been previously used by the Canadian Hurricane Centre to describe a storm that has lost tropical characteristics, but is not subtropical or extratropical. The transition was forecasted to be complete by the end of the day.\n\nWhile Laura was a tropical cyclone, it never came near land, so no effects or damages happened and no one died. But, the storm's remains were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and was pushed towards Europe. Heavy rain fell across parts of Britain, creating localized build up of flood waters. Because of that, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously wet soil, as well with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed because of bad driving conditions.\n\nAfter the remains of now extratropical Laura made its final landfall on the southern coast of the Netherlands, its rain clouds started mix with a cold front related to a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113 mm (4.5 in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands, flooding streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef. More than 10,000 people lost electricity in southern Norway because of damage to the electrical system created by the remains of the storm.\n\n\n", "id": "159308", "title": "Tropical Storm Laura (2008)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159351", "text": "Digital subscriber line\n\nDSL (for Digital Subscriber Loop or Digital Subscriber Line) is a way to transmit digital data over a telephone line. Telephone lines only transmit a limited spectrum of signals (roughly 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz, for voice). This means that the other frequencies can be used to transmit data. The data is combined or multiplexed onto the telephone line. At both ends, a device called a \"Splitter\" (or DSL filter) separates the data part and the telephony part. DSL provides the physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model that is used for understanding how the different parts of a telecommunications network can connect with each other. In this model, ATM or Ethernet are two communications protocols used as the data link layer (layer 2) and IP is used at the network layer (layer 3).\n\nWhile most DSL signals are multiplexed for transmission onto telephone lines, DSL can also be used without a telephony line (or multiplexed onto something else, for example Cable TV).\n\nAt the consumer end, a DSL modem converts the signals to be able to travel on the phone line; at the other end, a DSLAM multiplexes or combines the signals onto the internet backbone of the provider.\n\nMost DSL lines of consumers are asymmetric, meaning that connection speeds or bit rates are different in each direction. Asymmetric DSL is abbreviated as ADSL. \n\nTypically, the download speed of consumer DSL services ranges from 256 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s, depending on DSL technology, line conditions and service level implemented. Typically, upload speed is lower than download speed for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and equal to download speed for the rarer Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL).\n\nDSL (or VDSL, Very highspeed Digital Subscriber Line) typically works by dividing the frequencies used in a single phone line into two primary \"bands\". The ISP data is carried over the high-frequency band (25 kHz and above) while the voice is carried over the lower-frequency band (4 kHz and below). The user typically installs a DSL filter on each phone. This removes the high frequencies from the phone line, so that the phone only sends or receives the lower frequencies (the human voice). The DSL modem and the normal telephone equipment can be used on the line at the same time without interference from each other.\n\nThe customer end of the connection consists of a DSL modem, also known as a Terminal Adaptor. The modem converts data from the digital signals used by computers into a voltage signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line for transmission back to the service provider. \n\nIn some DSL variations (for example, High-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL)), the modem is directly connected to the computer via a serial interface, using communication protocols such as RS-232 or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with other functions, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the entire equipment is usually referred to as a DSL router or DSL gateway.\n", "id": "159351", "title": "Digital subscriber line"}

The movie is based on the book \"Dr. No\" by Ian Fleming. It starred Sean Connery as James Bond. This is the first movie in which Connery played Bond. The movie is remembered by many people because of the moment when Ursula Andress walks out of the sea in a white bikini. It is also the first time we here the now famous line \"Bond, James Bond\" as James Bond introduces himself. This movie started the James Bond series of movies which are still being made today.\n\nThe plot begins in Jamaica, where local English secret agent Strangways and his secretary are killed by three men pretending to be blind beggars, called the \"three blind mice\". MI6 (the English spy agency) sends their best agent, Bond, to find out why Strangways was killed. He travels to Jamaica, but not before romancing the beautiful Sylvia Trech. Whilst in Jamaica, the Three Blind Mice try to kill Bond. First they try shooting at him and then by chasing him in a car. The second time Bond turns the tables by causing their car (a funeral hearse) to fall off a cliff after a very dangerous car chase. Bond jokes (after seeing their car explode at the bottom) that he thinks they were on their way to a funeral. The deadly Miss Taro also tries to romance (then kill) Bond, and almost succeeds, before Bond realises that she is working for the enemy. Determined to find out who the enemy is, Bond discovers that Strangways was doing some research on an island called Crab Key and it's owner, a mysterious Chinese man called Dr. No.\n\nBond travels to Crab Key with Quarrel (a local fisherman secretly working for MI6) and Felix leiter (an American spy). Felix goes back to Jamaica when they reach the island, and Bond and Quarrel meet a beautiful shell collector called Honey Rider. After a gunfight with Dr. No's men, Quarrel is killed and Bond and Honey are captured. They finally meet Dr. No who explains to them that he works for the evil organisation SPECTRE(SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) and has been hired to \"topple\" American rockets (making them crash using radio beams). Honey is tied up and sent to be drowned, whereas James is put in a cell with electrified bars.

A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age.\n\nMany planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by \"diffraction\", the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness.

This started a reign which lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius.\n\nAs emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. \n\nSignificant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus. \n\nDomitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate. \n\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. \n\nModern history has rejected these views.

The more powerful entity in the suzerainty relationship, or the head of state of that more powerful entity, is called a suzerain. The term suzerainty was originally used to describe the relationship between the Ottoman Empire and its surrounding regions. It differs from sovereignty in that the tributary has some (limited) self-rule. A suzerain can also mean a feudal lord, to whom vassals must pay tribute.\n\nThe word is often spelled \"suzerainity\", though this has come to be considered incorrect.\n\nFollowing India's independence in 1947, a treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave India suzerainty over Sikkim in exchange for it retaining its independence. This continued until 1975, when the Sikkimese monarchy was abrogated in favour of a merger into India. Sikkim is now one of the states of India.\n\nIndia no longer looks after the external, defence, communications, and foreign affairs of Bhutan. However India provides substantial support to the Royal Bhutan Army and guarantees its support against external aggression.

During the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the South African Republic was annexed as the Colony of the Transvaal, which existed until 1910, when it became the Province of Transvaal in the Union of South Africa.\n\nDespite being occupied by the Axis powers, several Western and Asian countries were allowed to exercise self-rule. Several states were created in order to facilitate their occupation, including Vichy France, Manchukuo, the Empire of Vietnam, the Independent State of Croatia in Croatia and the Lokot Autonomy in Central Russia.\n\nIn modern geopolitics, it is common for larger countries to look after the defense and foreign relations of nearby smaller countries.

This also included branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green (where a depot was built to house the electric units), and links to what was to become the London Underground network. For this reason, the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630V DC system, the electricity being generated at the LNWR's own power station in Stonebridge Park. The first electric passenger trains ran in 1914, limited to the West London Line route (Willesden to Earls Court), and full services over the whole network did not commence until 1922, work having been delayed by the First World War.

It is found in the region Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in the Northwest of France.\n\nThe town is famous for its tapestry. It is one of the oldest complete tapestries in the world.\n\nThe inhabitants are called \"Bajocasses\" ou \"Bayeusains\". Bayeux is a \"sous-préfecture\" of the Calvados department.\n\nBayeux is the capital of \"the Bessin\" which was called Bajocasses before. Bessin was a province of France before the French Revolution. The name of the city comes from the Celtic tribe which lived in the Bajocasses region.\n\nThe Vikings distroyed the town in 890, but it was rebuilt by Bothon at the beginning of the 10th century. The bishop Hugues II, and his successor, Odon de Conteville (Guillaume le Conquérant's half brother) insisted the town needed a new cathedral. In 1077, a new one was built. However it is around that time that the town lost a lot of influence. Guillaume le Conquérant decided to make Caen his capital, in 1050. The Bayeux Tapestry was made around that time\n\nThe Renaissance didn't really mark the town. The most notable building from that period is the Saint-Patrice Church. It was built between 1544 and 1548.\n\nBayeux was the first city in France to be liberated after the Battle of Normandy. On 16 June 1944, General Charles de Gaulle made his first major speech in Bayeux. The buildings weren't damaged much during the Battle of Normandy as the German forces were defending Caen at the same time.\n\nThe Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4648 graves: 3935 are British and 466 are German.\n\nBayeux is seven kilometres from the English Channel and the D-Day Landing Beaches. It is about 30 kilometres northwest of Caen. The town's elevation varies from 32 to 67 metres (with an average of 46 metres). The river Aure passes through it. \n\nThe table below gives the temperatures and precipitation for 2007 (Recorded at the \"station Caen-Carpiquet\") :\n\nThe table below gives the minimum and maximum temperatures for each month :\n\nLa Bayeux Train station is on the \"Paris-Saint-Lazare>Cherbourg\" line. The TER line is from Caen to Rennes.\n\nThe \"Bybus\" goes around the town and to the communes of Saint-Martin-des-Entrées and Saint-Vigor-le-Grand. There is one main line (\"Chojnice / St-Martin-des-Entrées\") and three minor one's toward the different districts. The \"Bus verts\" invented by the \"Conseil général\" is a way to get to the surrounding communes (lines 30, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74). 3000 parking spaces in the town center make it an easy place to park. Furthermore, most car parks are free. The \"By-pass\" is Bayeux's ring road. The first part was built after the Battle of Normandy by British soldiers. The roads in the town center were too narrow for the Tanks to get through. The \"By-pass\" used to be the \"Route nationale 13\" until a motorway was built (A13 autoroute). \n\nThe closest airport is in Caen (21 km away) and the closest ferry to England (32 km away) leaves in Ouistreham.\n\n\nBayeux is the fourth biggest town in Calvados by population. The three biggest are Caen, Hérouville-Saint-Clair and Lisieux.\n", "id": "159643", "title": "Bayeux"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159694", "text": "Desiro\n\nDesiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.\n\nThe Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many Europen countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort.\nIn Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called \"ÖBB 5022\". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDZ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas.\n\nIn Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.\n\n Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these \"Class 642\" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.\n\nThe \"Class 642\" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the \"Müglitzbahn\", have made greater passenger numbers.\n\nAt first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the \"Class 642\" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the \"Class 643\".\n\nRight now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton.\n\nThe 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia. \n\n\nThese EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.\n\nCaile Ferate Romane (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: \"\"Regio\"\", \"\"InterRegio\"\" and \"\"InterCity\"\" inter-city services, but mostly on its \"\"InterRegio\"\" express trains. There was some of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes.\n\nIn December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia.\n\nSlovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines:\n\nSBB-CFF-FFS works double-decker (bilevel cars) EMU's. They are as class SBB RABe 514. They are used as commuter trains in Zürich, where 61 four-car sets have been working since 2006.\n\nNine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport.\n", "id": "159694", "title": "Desiro"}

There were many different lords because several different families inherited the title through marriage, until gradually the land of the Beuzeval was sold to farmers. The parish was eventually controlled by Houlgate. On the south side of the river Drochon, between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing attracted summer visitors.\n\nHoulgate is located along the English Channel in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for animal grazing. The town's area is 4.69 km² and the average altitude 5 m.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160194", "text": "Cuckoo\n\nThe cuckoos are a family of near-passerine birds. They are the main part of the order called Cuculiformes. The family is famous for its \"nest-parasite\" members, but has a range of other types of bird. The cuckoo family, in addition to those species named as such, also includes the roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis. \n\nThe family is notable for its subfamily, the Cuculinae. Many of them have a unique kind of parasitism called brood parasitism. This means it lays its eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds, who then rear the baby cuckoo instead of their own.\n\nThe common cuckoo, \"Cuculus canorus\", (usually just called “cuckoo” in countries where it lives) is a spring migrant to Europe and northern Asia. It winters in Africa and southern Asia. It is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. It looks a little bit like a small bird of prey when it flies. The male is dark grey above with a blackish brown tail, spotted and tipped with white and unevenly barred in black. The female is similar but a bit more reddish on the upper breast. It likes to eat hairy caterpillars. It is often found where woods border on to open land.\n\nThe cuckoo gets its names because the male Common Cuckoo sings two notes which sound like the word “cu – ckoo”. The female does not make this sound. She has a loud bubbling call. \n\nThe common cuckoo does not make a nest of its own, and they do not bring up their own young. Instead, the female lays her eggs in the nests of other birds. Each female cuckoo specialises in just one host species, and lays camouflaged eggs in that bird's nest. For example, a cuckoo which lays its eggs in reed warbler nests will lay eggs that look like those of a reed warbler.\n\nThe female cuckoo spends a lot of time watching the birds at the nest where she wants to lay an egg. She has to work out the exact time to go and lay her egg while the 'host' parents are not looking. If the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest before the other bird lays, the reed warbler will notice and knows it is not her egg, and so she will get rid of it. If the cuckoo lays her egg too late, when the reed warbler has finished laying, this will be noticed, too.\n\nWhen the female cuckoo thinks it is the right moment she will fly down to the reed warblers' nest, pushes one reed warbler egg out of the nest, lays her egg and flies off. This only takes about 10 seconds. The reed warbler does not notice, and carries on looking after the eggs. When the cuckoo chick hatches it soon grows very fast. It pushes the other eggs or reed warbler chicks out of the nest. At 14 days old, it is about 3 times the size of the adult reed warblers. The chick has a huge mouth which it opens very wide. It also makes a very fast “cheeping” sound which sounds like a nest full of reed warbler chicks. This makes the parents behave as if they had a nest full of their own chicks.\n\nAbout 56 of the Old World and 3 of the New World cuckoo species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that \"they only reproduce in this fashion\". The shells of the eggs of brood-parasites is thick. They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the eggs are dropped in the host nest. \n\nFemale parasitic cuckoos specialize and lay eggs which look like the eggs of their chosen host. This has been produced by natural selection, as some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own, leading to those eggs least like the host's being thrown out of the nest. \n\nHost species may take direct action to stop cuckoos laying eggs in their nest. Birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-eggs often mob cuckoos and drive them out of the area. \n\nParasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes: each gens specializes in a particular host species. This permits each gens to evolve a particular egg colouring. Thus, the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, but \"each line of females specializes in a single host species\". \n\nGenes regulating egg colour are passed down only along the maternal line, no doubt on the sex chromosome. This allows females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of their host species. \n\nFemales are thought to imprint on the host species which raised them; later they only parasitize nests of that species. Male cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, so gene flow takes place between the different maternal lines.\n\nThe detail and near-perfection of the cuckoo nest parasitism, and the defences of the host birds, are extraordinary. Many of the host species can spot and throw out almost perfect cuckoo eggs. This system is a fine example of an evolutionary arms race, a type of co-evolution. There are other birds which practise nest parasitism (such as the cowbirds) but these other systems are much less specialized.\n\nThe males and grey females in flight look a bit like a sparrowhawk. That may protect them from other birds' mobbing (Batesian mimicry). The advantage of the rufous-coloured females is not known. It may be that, being less common, they are less recognised by other bird species.\n\nThe cuckoo only stays in its summer location for about 10 weeks. In Britain, for example, it arrives in April and the adults start for Africa by the end of June or early July. They arrive in Africa (or Asia) in August.\n\nThey moult twice a year, changing feathers partially in summer, and completely in winter.\n\n", "id": "160194", "title": "Cuckoo"}

In the early 20th century and before it was a group of farms. Till few years ago, there was no road connecting the village to Pont-Farcy. So it would have been quite isolated.\n\nThe village is located 1 Kilometre from Pont-Farcy. It is located along the D307 Road. The village is a collection of farm houses. It also has a church. The total population is just 81. However this probably includes the neighbouring farms as well. Other nearby settlements are Pont-Bellanger and Beaumesnil. The nearest large towns are Villedieu-les-Poeles and Vire.\n\nThe village is located close to the Calvados tourist spot \"Grotte de Bion\".\n", "id": "160247", "title": "Sainte-Marie-Outre-l'Eau"}

It was built in 1903 by Hurst Nelson. At first it had a three window saloon, before being rebuilt by Southampton Corporation Tramways with a four window one. The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton. A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch.\n\nThe tramcar operated from 1903 until the Southampton system closed in 1949. At an enthusiasts' tour of the system the Museum Committee of the Light Railway Transport League bought the tram for £10. This price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint. This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways.\n\nAfter it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram. By 1955 the tram was being stored at Marton depot in Blackpool. It was soon given to the Tramway Museum Society (TMS) and moved to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. It was placed next to Newcastle 102, another preserved tramcar. Both of the trams were in an open-air display.\n\nThe tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October 1960, and has been there ever since. It is in regular use during the summer months and is the museum's only operational open-top tramcar.\n", "id": "160439", "title": "Southampton Corporation Tramways 45"}

They may be called known as \"acanthocephales\", \"thorny-headed worms\", or \"spiny-headed worms\". They have an evertable proboscis, armed with spines, which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of the host. Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the host’s gut. \n\nAcanthocephalans have complex life cycles, with various hosts, including invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects. Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fish. About 1150 species have been described.\n\nThe Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers. Since all parasites are derived from free-living forms, the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers. This is an example of molecular phylogenetics. In due course, spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum, such as sub-phylum or class.\n", "id": "160442", "title": "Acanthocephala"}

It is the only member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma. It usually lives in limestone caves along rivers.\n\nThis is the smallest species of bat and one of the world's smallest mammals. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies vary in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Female bat have only one offspring each year.\n\nThe bumblebee bat is about 29–33 millimetres (1.14–1.30 in) in length and 2 grams (0.07 oz) in mass). This is the reason for its common name \"bumblebee bat\". It is the smallest species of bat. The Etruscan shrew is lighter (1.2–2.7 g) (0.042-0.095 oz).\n\nThe bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat.\n\nThe wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs which may help in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones to help control it in flight.\n\nIn Thailand, the bat is in a small region of Kanchanaburi Province, in the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River.\n\nSince the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma, at least nine separate sites have been identified. The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.\n\nThe bumblebee bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills, along rivers, within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.\n\nThe bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens do include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies.\n\nLate in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.\n\nThe bumblebee bat was discovered in 1974. It is the only living species in the family Craseonycteridae.\n\nAs of the species' most recent review in 1996, the bat is listed by the IUCN as endangered, with a downward population trend.\n\nCurrently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Burmese population are not well known.\n\nIn 2007, the bat was identified by the EDGE project (evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered) as one of its top 10 \"focal species\".\n", "id": "160603", "title": "Bumblebee bat"}

The Western Freeway goes past the town.\n\nThe first people to live in the Ballan area were the Aborigines, the Wautharong people. The area was rich in animals with kangaroos, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two sorts of native cat. Many of these animals had gone by the end of the 1800s, with Europen settlement. \n\nThe first European settlers came from Tasmania, landing near Geelong, Victoria, and working their way up the Moorabool River with their sheep flocks. Robert Von Steiglitz first came to the area in 1838. He named it after Ballan in Ireland. Other early settler names included Covvie, Stead, Wallace and Egerton. \n\nThere were fights between the Wautharong people and white farmers during settlement. Robert Von Steiglitz said stated in his diary:\n... it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether we had the right to take the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it. These creatures did neither ...\n\nGold was found in the area in 1851. A lot of people came to look for gold. This was part of the Victorian Gold Rush. The Ballan Hotel dates from the gold rush period in 1851. The town was an important staging point for coaches going to the Ballarat goldfields. The Post Office opened in September 1853 although there were two earlier offices in the area named Ballan. \nBallan’s first primary school started on 8 January 1855. \n\nThe first Mechanics' Institute in Ballan was built in 1861. The current Mechanics' Institute built on land bought in 1881. The facade (front) of the building was taken down and rebuilt in 1922. The building houses the library for the town town and a hall. \n\nSt. Paul’s Presbyterian Church in Ballan was opened in July 1866. \n\nOn 15 November 2003 a Sprinter train going to Ballarat was derailed (came off the tracks) between Ballan and Gordon hurting 61 people when it crashed into a car on a country railway crossing.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules Football team playing in the Central Highlands Football League.\nIt also has two senior and three junior cricket teams in the Ballarat Cricket Association.\n\n\n", "id": "160667", "title": "Ballan, Victoria"}

It was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The Apostle Paul is said to have addressed an epistle to the Christians of the city., and it is now known as the Epistle to the Ephesians in the New Testament. The site still possesses many well preserved Roman ruins side by side with rich history. \n\nMost significant are the odeon, used as a concert hall and city council with the capacity of 1.500 people, Temple of Hadrian dating back to the second century where one of the best sculpture craftsmanship can be seen, Curettes Street hosting many monuments and countless colums on the sides of its marble paved ground, a fountain dedicated to Emperor Trajan where a part of a remaining statue shows us that Romans knew the round shape of the world in the first century AD, and latrines (toilets) where it can be seen how they cared about public sanity. \n\nTwo other of Ephesus's outstanding monuments hold importance not just for their home city also for world's cultural and architectural heritage. The first one is the library of Celsus which is located at the end of the Curettes Street. The library looks like a two storeyed building seen from the facade but as we know it former had three stories inside. The facade shows a rare found craftsmanship. Also the library was the third biggest library of the ancient world, after the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamon. Anyone who stands in front of this monumental building can understand why did it take twenty years (115 AD to 135 AD) to complete it. \n\nThe second one is Ephesus' grand theatre which had the capacity of 25.000 spectators. It was not just a place of art also as we know it was used for animal and gladiator fights. With its great dimensions it makes one think about how small my moment in time really is. It's one of the sacred ruins of Ephesus, according to the Acts of the Apostles (19:23-41), the theater was the site of the \"riot of the silversmiths\" in which those who made silver figures of Artemis the pagan godess of the city rioted because Paul's preaching was bad for business. In the 1st century AD, the Apostle Paul spent over three years in Ephesus and he sermonized many times, disapproving pagan worship, in this theater.\n\n", "id": "160718", "title": "Ephesus"}

It was a pro-Ming Dynasty kingdom. It was started by Koxinga, after the destruction of Ming government by the Manchu. Koxinga was son of a pirate who was a supporter of the Ming Dynasty. He hoped to get his soldiers together on Taiwan and use it as a base to get back mainland China for the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning is also sometimes known as:\n\nAdmiral Koxinga called Taiwan Tungtu/Dongdu. In western history books it is known as the Kingdom of Taiwan.\n\nIn 1661, Koxinga forced a landing at Luerhmen, Taiwan. In less than a year, he took Fort Zeelandia and made an agreement with Frederick Coyett, the Dutch governor. The Dutch gave him the fort and left all the goods and property of the Dutch East India Company behind. All the Dutch people, officials and soldiers were able take their \"personal\" things and supplies back to Batavia in safety. This ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule on Taiwan. Koxinga kept himself busy making Taiwan into a useful base for anti-Qing Dynasty supporters who hoped to get the Ming Dynasty back to power.\n\nIn 1662, at the age of 39, Koxinga died of malaria. Some people said that he died in a sudden fit of craziness when he heard about the death of his father under the Qing. His son, Zheng Jing, took control as the ruler of Taiwan, with the name of Prince of Yanping.\n\nFor the next 19 years, Zheng Jing tried to run the country and rebuild his army in Taiwan. Contact with the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from the China through ambassadors was frequent. Zheng Jing fought the Qing to defend Xiamen, Quemoy and the Pescadores islands, which he finally lost over the years. His small army army was not big enough to defend the islands from the Qing. During Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Zheng Jing started an attack in the Fujian area. At the end of the revolt, Zheng's army was defeated. After the defeat, Zheng went back to Taiwan where he spent his time with wine and women, dying soon after of illness. After his death, his generals and ministers were split into two groups, each supporting one of his sons to take take over. After some fighting, Zheng Keshuang, his 12 year old son, became the new king.\n\nIn 1683, after the Battle of Penghu, Zheng Keshuang gave himself up to the Qing. His kingdom was added to the Qing Dynasty as part of the Fujian Province.\n\nThe Kingdom of Tungning lasted for just over 20 years. Because its history is almost the same as modern Taiwan, it has great symbolic value.\n\nAfter its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang, went to Taiwan. They left mainland China to the Communist Party who started the People's Republic of China (PRC). For many years, the ROC planned to take control of the mainland. It kept island bases close to the mainland (for example, Quemoy). This was the same as Koxinga and his sons had done. The ROC has now become a democracy and no longer wants to take over the mainland. The political and territorial arrangement has not changed. In this way, it is the same as between the Qing/Koxinga situation and the current PRC/ROC situation.\n\nThe Kuomintang of the ROC have talked a lot about the goals of Koxinga. They were going to use Taiwan as a base for returning their government to Mainland China. They see themselves as the defenders of the ROC. They see Taiwan as a base from which the ROC will take back control of the mainland. The PRC talks about the fact that Koxinga freed Taiwan from Dutch colonialism for the sake of the motherland. They do not talk about the fact that Koxinga was trying to get rid of the mainland government, to bring back an earlier dynasty.\n", "id": "160750", "title": "Kingdom of Tungning"}

The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1696 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership during the eighties years of war.

Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. The former municipality of Bredevoort was comprised of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk.

The letters used are:\nThese letters (except for \"Y\" and \"Z\") did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans (e.g. parcels vans, horse boxes, milk and fish vans).

Many of the classifications listed below are no longer used, and some did not survive until the designation \"\"Standard\"\".\n\nNote that in modern usage, composite semi-open vehicles are classified \"Cso\" – the \"s\" signifying that the Standard portion is open (implying that the First portion is compartments with corridor).\n\n", "id": "160776", "title": "British Rail coach designations"}

Cave was made to leave after it was said he stole from the headmaster. He worked at a number of different jobs, such as selling timber, writing and printing. He came up with the idea of a periodical that would cover every subject the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry. He tried to get some London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, Cave took on the job by himself. \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" was started in 1731 and soon became the most important and most copied periodical of its time. It also made Cave very rich.\n\nCave was a smart businessman. He gave all his energy to the magazine, and hardly ever left its offices at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of a lot of writers, the most famous was Samuel Johnson, who was always thankful to Cave for having given him his main job for many years. Cave himself often sent in items to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban. \n\nHe also got permission from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, an early model of the water frame.

The rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes. It is a site of faults and earthquakes.\n\nBasically, the western part of Africa is rifting away from the eastern part body. This causes all the geological activity at the Valley. Far in the future, a sea will run between these two parts of Africa. The Arabian peninsula is already almost separated. The whole process is part of plate tectonics. In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley. \n\nThere are about 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the Great Rift Valley.\n\nThe Western Rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area is inside national parks.\n\nLake Victoria, the second largest area freshwater lake in the world, is between the two branches. All of the African Great Lakes were formed as the result of the rift, and most lie within its rift valley.\n\nThe African Great Lakes are a series of lakes formed by the action of the tectonic East African Rift on the continent of Africa. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world in terms of surface area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest in volume as well as the second deepest. \n\nThe African Great Lakes are divided among three different catchments (river basins), and a number, such as Lake Turkana, have internal drainage systems. These are the largest, in order of size from largest to smallest:\n\nThe lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind. \n\nLake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa: the name is disputed) is the most southern of the Great Lakes, and empties into the great Zambezi River via the Shire River.\n\n", "id": "160947", "title": "Great Rift Valley"}

The Parliament is sometimes called \"Holyrood\". \n\nThe original Parliament of Scotland (or \"Estates of Scotland\") was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland. It existed from the early 13th century until 1707. This was when the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. Because of this, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the \"Parliament of Great Britain\", which sat at Westminster in London.\n\nIn 1997 there was a referendum where the Scottish people voted for Scotland to have a Parliament again. The current Parliament was established by the Scotland Act 1998. The first meeting was on 12 May 1999.\n\nThe Parliament is a devolved assembly, which means that some powers have been kept by the UK Parliament. The issues which the Scottish Parliament can make laws about are called \"devolved matters\". The issues which the UK Parliament must make laws about are called \"reserved matters\".\nSome examples of devolved matters are health and social services, education and housing. Examples of reserved matters are foreign policy, immigration and the constitution of the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThere are 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who are democratically elected. Members are elected for four-year terms. Most of the MSPs belong to political parties.

This cave is near Mosselbaai/Mossel Bay on the south coast South Africa. Discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces, and used ochre to paint their bodies. The discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45,000 years ago. It also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a \"large cultural leap\".\n\nBecause the African climate became cool and dry, the food resources were reduced dramatically. This was the reason why the Pinnacle Point man moved to the shores. There, they could eat marine creatures like mussels, snails and crabs. These men also used amazingly subtle tools. Microliths were mounted on wood shafts\n\nThe startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team, including the palaeoanthropologist Curtis Marean from the \"Institute of Human Origins\" of the Arizona State University and three graduate students of the \"School of Human Evolution and Social Change\". They came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods. They added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet. The cause for this evolution was the climate change. It is the first evidence that mankind was able to this. The report in the magazine Nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found. This is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings give rise to the assumption that living near the coast has caused the changes.\n\nThe evidence shows that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. At that time, the world was in an ice age, and Africa was a desert. But as archaeologica sites dating to that time period are rare in Africa, palaeonthologist Curtis Marean looked at different information. He studied geologic formations, the sea currents, climate data and much more. As a result, he was able to pinpoint his research to destinations like the Pinnacle Point cave, where the findings have been made.\n\n", "id": "161103", "title": "Pinnacle Point Man"}

He joined the National Youth Theatre and studied Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. Smith became an actor in 2003. He performed in plays like \"Murder in the Cathedral\", \"Fresh Kills\", \"The History Boys\" and \"On the Shore of the Wide World\" in London theatres. On West End, he has performed in \"Swimming with Sharks\" with Christian Slater, and \"That Face\".\n\nSmith's first television role was in 2006. He played Jim Taylor in the BBC version of Phillip Pullman's \"The Ruby in the Smoke\" and \"The Shadow in the North\". His his first major role in television came as Danny in the 2007 BBC series \"Party Animals\". Smith is the youngest person to play the character in the British television series.\n\nSmith was born and brought up in Northampton. He attended Northampton School for Boys. He planned to be a professional football player. Smith had played for the youth teams of Northampton Town F.C., Nottingham Forest F.C. and Leicester City F.C. After an injury, he began to study acting. After school, Smith studied Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia. \n\nWhile acting in \"On the Shore of the Wide World\", the play moved to the Royal National Theatre in London. After finishing, he took on the role of Lockwood in the Alan Bennett play \"The History Boys\". After \"The History Boys\", he acted in \"Burn/Chatroom/Citizenship\" and \"Swimming with Sharks\". \"\"Swimming with Sharks was his first West End play. His first television role was as Jim Taylor in the BBC version of the \"Sally Lockhart\" series of books \"The Ruby in the Smoke\" and \"The Shadow in the North\". He acted along with Billie Piper in the series. He acted with Piper a third time in an episode of \"Secret Diary of a Call Girl\". Piper is well known for playing the part of Rose Tyler on Doctor Who. \n\nSmith was revealed as the Eleventh Doctor in the British science-fiction television series \"Doctor Who\" in January 2009 to replace David Tennant, who announced his departure in October 2008. Smith was not as well known as many of the actors who were thought to be likely to get the part. These included Paterson Joseph, David Morrissey, Sean Pertwee, James Nesbitt, Russell Tovey, Catherine Zeta Jones, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Robert Carlyle and Billie Piper. \nSmith was one of the first actors to audition for the role. Producer Steven Moffat and BBC Wales Head of Drama and executive producer, Piers Wenger immediately liked him for the part. Smith had auditioned for the role of John Watson in the Moffat-created \"Sherlock\" at the same time. He did not get the part of Watson because Moffat believed his acting style was closer to Sherlock Holmes but they had already cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes. At 26 years old, Smith was three years younger than Peter Davison was at the time of his casting as the Doctor in 1981. He was younger than any other actor suggested for the role. After three weeks of auditions, Moffat and Wenger agreed that it had \"always been Matt\". The BBC were was not certain that a 26-year-old could not play the Doctor correctly. Some fans of the show believed that Smith was too young for the role. Others supported him based on what he had shows of his acting ability. For his work in his first series he was nominated in the \"Outstanding Drama Performance\nCategory\" of the National Television Awards.\n\nIn June 2010, he appeared on stage with Orbital. They performed a version of the \"Doctor Who\" theme at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the \"Doctor Who\" Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010.

Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service.\n\nMore recently, RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity, particularly with Internet companies.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161369", "text": "History of Curitiba\n\nThe history of Curitiba has many different periods.\n\nIn the past, the region where today is the city of Curitiba was a region of exuberant forest, where the parana-pine was dominant. The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous tribe Tingüi, by the Tupi-Guarani nation.\n\nAt the beginning of the Christian Era, the Plateau Curitibano (also known as First Plateau of Paraná) was inhabited by peoples potters. Subterranean houses, found at archaeological sites on the outskirts of Curitiba, show the adaptation of native to the adverse conditions of climate, as the cold wind, frost and snow.\n\nIn time of arrival of the Portuguese to Brazil, the Plateau Curitibano was occupied by groups of linguistic families Jê and Tupi-Guarani.\n\nThe first ten years of the 16th century marked the beginning of a war of conquest of Europeans against the indigenous peoples who inhabited the plateaus of southeastern and southern Brazil. Were Portuguese and Spanish expeditions in search of precious metals and stones, and Indians to enslave. \n\nThe region of Curitiba began to be populated by non-Indians around 1630, by people from Paranaguá, where the alluvium gold had been discovered, forming the village of \"Our Lady of Light and Good Jesus of Pine Forest\", which was became in town in 1693. The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of \"Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\" (\"Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest\"). The name was changed to \"Curitiba\" in 1721. \n\nThere is a legend telling that around 1648 a group of pioneers founded a small village near the Atuba River while searching for gold. These pioneers venerated \"Nossa Senhor da Luz\" and made a special place there for her statue. The legend tells that every morning the image turned her eyes to a pine tree forest, which the pioneers knew was a sacred place of the Indians. The explorers took this as a sign that \"Nossa Senhora\" was showing them a special place for their village. Even though they knew that the Indians took them as enemies, the pioneers took the risk and went in to the forest to find this special place. When the pioneers got close to the tribe, a miracle happened: the Indians were peaceful and expecting them to come. Done contact with the leader of the Tingüi tribe, the cacique Tindiqüera would have said the new location and put a stick in the ground, saying \"Coré Etuba\" (\"many pines\"). By this stick would have grown a great tree, where today is the \"zero mark\" of Curitiba. At that place the pioneers built a chapel in honor of the saint, now called \"Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\" (\"Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest\").\nCuritiba officially became a town in 1812, orthography its name as \"Curityba\". An alternative orthography also came up: \"Coritiba\". This orthography looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents, but a state decree in 1919 decided the dispute by orthography the city name \"Curitiba\". Growth was based on the cattle trade, being a way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North. Developing effective started from the beginning of the 19th century, with the exploitation and exportation of Yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\"), and the elevation to the condition that city in 1842.\n\nWaves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. In 1853, the south and southwest of the province of São Paulo are separated, forming the new province of Paraná, and Curitiba has become capital. The \"Universidade Federal do Paraná\" (Federal University of Paraná), the first in Brazil, was established in Curitiba in 1913, the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed.\n\nAs most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by Brazilians of European descent. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.\n\nIn the 19th century, the influx of immigrants from Europe increased. In 1828, the first German immigrants settled in Paraná. However, large numbers of immigrants from Germany only arrived in Curitiba during the 1870s, most of them was Volga Germans from Russia.\nImmigrants from Poland first arrived in 1871, settling in rural areas near to Curitiba. They largely influenced the agriculture of the region. Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world, second only to Chicago, and is the only Brazilian city to have orthography in Polish language: \"Kurytyba\".\n\nItalian immigrants started arriving in Curitiba in 1878. They came mostly from the Veneto and Trento regions, in Northern Italy and settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still today the center of the large Italian community of Curitiba.\n\nLarge numbers of Ukrainian immigrants settled in Curitiba, mostly between 1895 and 1897, when 20 thousands arrived. They were peasants from Galicia, who immigrated to Brazil to become small farmers. Nowadays there are 300 thousand Ukrainian-Brazilians living in Paraná.\n\nJapanese immigrants starting arriving in the region in 1915. Curitiba received significant numbers of immigrants from Japan. Nowadays, there are about 40 thousand Japanese-Brazilians living in the city. \n\nOther immigrants, such as jewishes, Arabs from Lebanon and Syria, English, French, Russians and other Eastern Europeans also settled in Curitiba.\n\nDuring the 20th century, especially after the middle, the city is going through a large increase in population and is consolidating as regional hub for trade and services, becoming one of the richest cities in Brazil and pioneer in urban solutions. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a \"star\" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed when possible, but was too expensive to complete.\n\nBy the 1960s, Curitiba's population had increased to 430,000, and some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to drastically change the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner - who later became mayor - led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paraná that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, a reduction of traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector, and a convenient and affordable public transit system. This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed the XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had very high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This uses two one-way streets moving in opposite directions which surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have their exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges to the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density developments, to reduce traffic away from the main roads. A number of areas subject to floods were condemned and became parks.\n\nCurrently, the immigration of foreigners is small - is common only immigrants from China, some Middle Eastern and South American countries -, has been replaced by migration of Brazilians from other regions of the country (it is estimated that nowadays about half the population of Curitiba is composed of migrants).\n", "id": "161369", "title": "History of Curitiba"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161382", "text": "Ratite\n\nThe ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of which are flightless. Most of them, including the largest (moas and elephant birds) are now extinct. \n\nUnlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum. In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles. \n\nMost parts of the former super-continent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America.\n\nThe classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes, but not the tinamous. This may change in future.\n\nIt was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nHowever, modern gene analysis conflicts with this. DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that rheas (South America) and the living Australasian/Oceanian ratites \"are\" monophyletic. \n\nRecent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage. The timamids are the sister group of the Australo-Pacific ratites.\n\nIf so, this would make 'ratites', as a whole, paraphyletic rather than monophyletic. Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. If timamous are inside the ratite lineage, then ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times. Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but that has no precedent in bird evolution, while loss of flight is commonplace.\n\nTinamous are ratites. Therefore, ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of whom are flightless, with the exception of the tinamous. The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once. The similarities between Ostriches and the Australo-Pacific ratites is due to convergent evolution.\n", "id": "161382", "title": "Ratite"}

Even though Luis was strong it was still only the second strongest storm in 1995, the strongest was Hurricane Opal. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. From August 22 to September 1 Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Luis, and Karen were active at the same time. Most of the places damaged by Luis were damaged only a week earlier by Hurricane Iris, except for the United States and Newfoundland (Canada) and most of the islands would be damaged again less than two weeks later by Hurricane Marilyn.\n\nThe early stages of Luis's formation is track back to a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on August 26. The next day it became Tropical Depression Thirteen near Cape Verde. It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th and was named Luis. It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2. The next day Luis reached it's highest winds of 140 mph making it a Category 4. Luis continued west and crossed over Barbuda late on September 4. At this time Luis came very close to Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Luis turned northwest and while it was 150 miles to the north of Puerto Rico Luis weakened to a category 2 hurricane, after being a major hurricane for a week. Luis kept slowly weakening and headed to the northeast. While Luis was offshore of Newfoundland he caused a wave more than 98 feet tall. Luis made landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 while a category 1. That same day Luis became extratropical and died near Greenland.\n\nThese were the places impacted by Hurricane Luis. Many of the Island Countries were affected by Hurricane Iris a week before; many would also be affected by Hurricane Marilyn only ten days later.\nLuis caused a lot of damage in Antigua and Barbuda because it made landfall in that country. In Antigua about 50% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. In Barbuda nearly 70% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. The government of the country spent about $350 million in U.S. Dollars to fix the damage.\n\nIn Bermuda winds were reported up to 46 mph. However, there was no damage or people killed in Bermuda. On September 11 a ship called Queen Elizabeth 2 got caught in the 98 foot wave that Luis caused. The ship was not damaged but it arrived late in New York.\n\nThe only Providence in Canada affected by Luis was Newfoundland.\nIn Newfoundland, Luis killed one person and caused about $500,000 in damage. Luis dropped 2.4 to 4.7 inches of rain while it passed over Newfoundland on September 11.\n\nIn Dominica, larges waves from Hurricane Luis caused one fisherman to get killed. Hurricane Luis caused about $47 million in damage to the island nation.\n\nSt. Martin, a small island was hurt most by Luis. Luis did not strike St. Martin, but it was hurt most by Luis because he caused 9 people to get killed and $1.8 billion in damage.\n\nIn North Carolina, a U.S. state, a wave caused one person to get killed. Also, in New York, a wave washed under a house and later destroyed causing $1.9 million in damage.\n\nIn Guadeloupe, Luis killed one. In Saint Barthelemy, winds were recorded up to 155 mph. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, damages from Luis were at $197 million.\n\nAfter Hurricane Luis many organizations and Governments donated money to help fix the damage on the affect islands. The largest donation was the Government of the Netherlands, which donated $15.2 million. \nWhen Tropical Depression Thirteen became Tropical Storm Luis on August 29, it marked the earliest date of a seasons 12th named storm. While Luis was becoming extratropical it sped up to nearly 65 mph, making it the third fastest traveling Atlantic hurricane. On September 11 when Luis caused that 98 foot wave it was the highest wave recorded from an Atlantic hurricane. Until 2004, when Hurricane Ivan may have caused a wave up to 130 feet.\n\nThe name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996. Luis was the first name retired since Andrew in 1992. Luis was also the first named storm starting with L to get its name retired. Luis is now only one of two L names to get retired, the other was Lili in 2002.

It is a fungal infection (mycosis). The disease is caused by any of the \"Candida\" species of yeast. \"Candida albicans\" is the most common species.\n\n\"Candida\" yeasts are common in most people. The yeast is usually controlled in the body. When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.\n\nA weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.\n\nAntibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast. Antibiotic kills some bacteria, and changes the balance of microorganisms in the body. This may allow the yeast to multiply.\n\nEsophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by \"Candida albicans\". The disease happens in unhealthy people. Sometimes people will get the infection when they are treated with chemotherapy. People with AIDS can also get this infection more often.\n\nOne sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing. Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time.\n\nOral candidiasis is a yeast infection of the mouth. It is located on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is caused by \"Candida albicans\", \"Candida glabrata\" or \"Candida tropicalis\".\n\nCandida may appear as thick white or cream-coloured areas on mucosal membranes. The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed. In babies the condition is called thrush. For babies, it is usually painless and causes no pain. Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation.\n\nIn healthy persons, candidiasis is usually a very small infection of the skin or mucous membranes. These areas include:\n\nCandidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation, or vaginitis. It can also occur on the penis or scrotum. In unhealthy patients, the \"Candida\" infection can affect the esophagus. It could get everywhere in the body. This would cause a much more serious health condition, a state called candidemia.\n", "id": "161473", "title": "Candidiasis"}

It is mostly used in computers and video game systems. The GPU can be put on the motherboard or on separate video cards.\n\nToday, there are generally two types of images which GPU has to calculate, which is also called rendering. Most applications like the operating system’s desktop (except e.g. Windows Vista’s Aero Desktop) or office applications the GPU has to render two dimensional (2D) pictures. Modern GPUs are so powerful that there is no difference in 2D performance between low-cost and expensive GPUs.\nThe minor part of today’s applications use 3D pictures to simulate three-dimensionality. Examples for such applications are computer and video games or applications for design and technical construction (CAD). The 3D acceleration performance of GPUs differs greatly. Generally, more expensive GPUs can render faster than low-cost ones.\nToday’s market leaders for GPUs are AMD (under the label of ATi), Intel and nVidia. There are some smaller manufacturers whose market share is rather small, e.g. Matrox and S3 Graphics. They are concentrating on niche products. Some of them have focused on research only instead of producing real products, e.g. PowerVR and XGI Technology Inc.\nThere were several manufacturers who were bought by larger competitors, like 3Dfx and 3Dlabs, or stopped their efforts, as research costs are very high. Examples are Cyrix, Tseng Labs, Trident Microsystems and OAK Technologies.\nOther early pioneers, like Hercules, who were once one of the market leaders, concentrate to produce video boards based on GPUs from AMD or nVidia, nowadays.\n\nThe term GPU computing combines all tasks a GPU can calculate that go beyond simple calculation and output of pictures. It is also known under the term General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Unit. Tasks are calculation of physics, Artificial Intelligence or even acceleration of video and picture editing. One of the first applications to support GPU computing is Adobe’s Photoshop CS4. \nnVidia calls their attempt at GPU Computing CUDA. This is nVidia's interface for using their GPUs for general computing tasks. CUDA is based on the C programming language.\nATi is calling their attempt Stream. There were some earlier attempts under a different name prior to Stream’s release with ATi’s graphics driver “Catalyst 8.12” in December 2008.\nS3 Graphics showed a first application for video editing which is accelerated by their latest GPUs. Yet, there is no information whether S3 Graphics will continue to increase their efforts in GPU computing.\n\nThe latest milestone in GPU computing was AMD’s announcement of a Super-Computer based on GPUs at the CES in January 2009. It will be built of more than a thousand GPUs and will have a computing power of one petaflop.\n\nEarly GPUs used Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface to communicate with the motherboard of a computer, a type of slot which is still used today for simple motherboard add-ons such as extra audio-processing cards or USB ports. As graphics cards became more powerful and graphics applications more demanding, a faster kind of interface called Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) was created and then PCIe x16 (PCI Express 16-lane) after it, the current overall standard. In 2008 PCIe 2.0 was introduced, doubling the speed of PCIe 1.0 and still working with older PCI Express interfaces.\n\nPCI graphics cards will only work in PCI slots; AGP will only work in AGP slots. PCIe graphics cards will not function in PCI slots and PCI graphics cards will not function in PCIe slots. However, PCI Express 2.0 graphics cards will work in PCI Express x16 1.0 motherboard slots and vice-versa.\n\nMulti-GPU Systems are computers which use more than one GPU. Generally this is used in high-end home computers to accelerate computer games, but there is also the ability to have one GPU rendering normal game scenes and one GPU calculating physics. This is currently supported by nVidia’s GPUs only and called PhysX. ATi and Intel have developed their own physics engine named Havok.\nThe first attempts in Multi-GPU Systems were done by 3Dfx, which was bought by nVidia later. Their Voodoo video cards, which were 3D only accelerators, could be hooked up to a second Voodoo video card to gain more performance. This was called SLi. Theoretically the performance would double, practically it increased far less, depending on the video game, which is still a problem in today’s Multi-GPU Systems. Later, 3Dfx built more than one GPU on one video card. It’s latest video card, the Voodoo 6, was based on four GPUs, but it was never released. However there exist several engineering samples of the Voodoo 6, mostly owned by collectors.\nAfter nVidia bought 3Dfx, Multi-GPU Systems were dead for several years until nVidia came up with this idea again in 2004. As nVidia had bought all technologies and market names from 3Dfx, too, they simply used the name SLi again. Today’s SLi works with up to three video cards, which is called 3-way-SLi. There were also attempts with four cards, but this failed due to limitations in the DirectX9 API. Today’s DirectX10 API however would support this.\nDespite the video cards, a SLi compatible motherboard is needed to build a SLi-System. Such motherboards have several PEG Slots (the successor to AGP, based on PCI-Express Technology) for more than one video card.\n\nnVidia offers various Multi-GPU video cards, where two GPUs are built on one video card. These are often called Dual-GPU video cards and do not need a SLi compatible motherboard.\nATi’s Multi-GPU Technology is called Cross Fire. It works quite the same way, though there are fewer limitations for video card combinations. CrossFire was renamed as CrossFire X in 2007 to represent the possibility to combine more than two cards. Today, it is possible to have a CrossFire X system based on four video cards or two Dual-GPU cards.\n\nJust like with SLi, there is the necessity for a CrossFire compatible motherboard in order to build a CrossFire System. One Dual-GPU video card from ATi does not necessarily need such a Crossfire compatible motherboard, however for two of them, it is needed.\n", "id": "161484", "title": "Graphics Processing Unit"}

Tropical Cyclones can and have formed outside these dates but not in 1996, because Hurricane Marco ended on November 24. The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season was very active, but not as active as 1995, but it was more active then 1997.\n\nTropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 1996 season. It started on June 17 in the Bahamas as Tropical Depression One. One became Tropical Storm Arthur late on June 19. Tropical Storm Arthur made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina was a weak tropical storm. It moved to the east and went back into the Atlantic Ocean and died on June 21. Arthur killed no one and caused only $1 million in damage.\n\nHurricane Bertha was the first hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on July 5 near the Cape Verde Islands. On that same day it became Tropical Storm Bertha. By July 7 it became a hurricane, during that day it struck Antigua, and Sint Maarten. Bertha moved along the edges of the islands in the Bahamas. Hurricane Bertha made landfall in North Carolina on July 12 as a category 2 hurricane. It quickly got weaker and died on July 14 as it entered Canada. Bertha killed 9 people and caused $335 million in damage. \nHurricane Cesar started off the coast of Venezuela on July 24, it was a tropical depression at this time. It slowly got stronger, becoming a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane by July 27. On July 28 it made landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua. Cesar weakened to a tropical storm over land, but it reached the Pacific Ocean and later on it became Hurricane Douglas. Hurricane Cesar killed 77 people and caused $206 million in damage.\n\nHurricane Dolly started as Tropical Depression Four near Jamaica. It got stronger and it became Tropical Storm Dolly soon after. Tropical Storm Dolly became Hurricane Dolly just before it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on August 20. It weakened over land and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression. Dolly quickly got stronger again and became a tropical storm. Just before it made another landfall in Mexico, it became Hurricane Dolly again on August 23. The storm weakened a lot over Mexico and it died on August 26. It killed about 14 in Mexico.\n\nHurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started as Tropical Depression Five near Cape Verde on August 19. Tropical Depression Five did not become Tropical Storm Edouard until August 22. By the next day it had gotten stronger and it was Hurricane Edouard at this point. \n\nHurricane Edouard strengthened fast, peaking as a category 4 hurricane on from August 24 - 28. After this, it weakened slightly, back to a category 3 hurricane. It turned to the north and repeated this but did not again re-strengthen into a category 4 hurricane. On September 2, Hurricane Edouard passed only 90 miles to the south of Massachusetts. By the next day Hurricane Edouard had died. \n\nEdouard killed 2 people and caused around $3.5 million in damage.\n\nFran started on August 23 as Tropical Depression Six. It slowly got stronger because Hurricane Edouard was near it. The depression became Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. Fran became a hurricane on August 29, weakened back to a tropical storm on August 30, and became a hurricane again on August 31. Hurricane Fran did not get much stronger until it began on a track more to the north. By September 5, it made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina as a category 3 hurricane. It died on September 8. Fran caused the deaths of 26 people and caused $3.2 billion in damage.\nOn August 26, Tropical Depression Seven started. It slowly grew and became Tropical Storm Gustav. It headed northwest and did not get any stronger because of the large size of Hurricane Fran and wind shear. Wind shear also caused in to die on September 2.\n\nHortense started on September 3 as the eighth tropical depression in 1996 in the Atlantic. It slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7, four days later. As a tropical storm, it passed into the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea. Continuing to slowly strengthen, it became Hurricane Hortense on September 9. Hurricane Hortense made landfall on the southwestern part of Puerto Rico. This resulted in $155 million in damage and the deaths of 18 people. It also moved along the coast of Dominican Republic, which killed 3 people. \n\nIt soon re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and it quickly strengthened. By September 13, it had become a 140 miles per hour, category 4 hurricane. Hortense started moving faster, but weakened at the same time. Finally, by September 15 it had made another landfall in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, there was $3 million in damage. Hurricane Hortense died on later on September 15.\n\nIsidore started on September 24 a few hundred miles south of Cape Verde. It headed westward and later peaked as a category 3 hurricane.

It made landfall on Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast, reaching top wind speeds of 60 mph (95 km/h). It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5, it was taken over by a bigger storm.\n\nRain from Barry in the province of Pinar del Río, Cuba, hurt three people and damaged 55 houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight bad wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.\n\nOn May 29, a weather system in the Yucatán Peninsula created a small area of thunderstorms over the Yucatán Channel. The thunderstorms got stronger near the weather system. By May 30, clouds from the area reached from Nicaragua to the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Another weather system, called a tropical wave, created a storm on May 30. The next day, a cyclone formed inside the system. The storm moved towards the north-northeast, and slowly gained strength. More thunderstorms formed near the center, and the system became a tropical depression. A tropical depression is a type of storm.\n\nThe depression developed an area of squalls (sudden, violent storms with wind and rain). A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone. At the beginning, the tropical depression looked to be both a tropical and subtropical cyclone. On June 1, the National Hurricane Center named the storm \"Tropical Storm Barry\". Barry was now 235 miles (375 km) to the west of Key West, Florida. Barry moved quickly towards the north. On June 2, it reached its strongest with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h).\n\nAfter Barry reached its highest strength, strong wind shear removed most of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone. The center of the system then increased in length, and it began to weaken. At 1400 UTC on June 2, Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida while it was at tropical depression status. As Barry moved inland, it weakened more. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center said that Barry had died out over northeastern Florida. What was left of Barry continued to move northeast. On June 3, it moved onto shore again, this time in South Carolina. Late on June 4, the extratropical system entered New England. Late on June 5, what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system, near the border of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.\n\nWhen Barry was named as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach. Also, a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach, northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also sent out for inland parts of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The storm increased the risk of rip currents, so officials told swimmers to stay out of the water until the storm left the area. A tornado watch was sent out for the southern part of the state, but it was removed after the storm lost strength.\n\nAfter becoming an extratropical cyclone, National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of: South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.\nFlood watches were also sent out for: southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, southern New England. \nA wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia.\n\nBarry caused heavy rain in Florida, the most rain being 6.99 inches (178 mm) at Palm Beach International Airport. Other areas reported over 3 inches (75 mm) of rain. The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions. It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rain caused a large sinkhole, a hole in the ground, to open in the middle of a road. Other roads were flooded. On Interstate 95, near Lake Worth, another sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet slippery roads caused many traffic accidents in the state. In Brevard and Volusia counties, drivers were killed in traffic accidents. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer crashed into a guardrail because of the weather.\n\nThe storm caused stormy seas along the coastline of Florida, with a storm surge of 4.78 feet (1.46 m) at Clearwater Beach. The waves caused minor beach erosion. The high surge also caused minor flooding on many roads near Tampa Bay. At Indian Shores, a woman died after being injured by the high seas.\n\nBarry caused high winds in Florida, which reached 47 mph (76 km/h), near the southeastern coastline of the state. The winds knocked down trees and caused power failures. In Carrolwood, one person was injured when a tree crashed onto their house. The storm created at least two tornadoes, including some that damaged fences and power lines. One possible tornado in Goulds, Florida left about 2,000 people without power.\n\nThe storm also caused heavy rain in Georgia of up to 8 inches (203 mm). The rain helped put out wildfires. It also caused some minor flooding, and in Savannah, there were a few minor car accidents. Winds blew down some trees and power lines. Heavy rain from the storm moved across much of the East Coast of the United States. High winds also occurred in South Carolina.\n\nThe remains of Barry caused strong winds along the Atlantic coast. They reached 60 mph (97 km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200 houses in Craven County, North Carolina lost power. In southeastern Virginia, the storm caused over 60 traffic accidents. Ten people were injured in them. High seas off Cape Fear left a sailboat with three people needing rescue from the Coast Guard.\n\nRain went north into the Mid-Atlantic States and New England, with 4.50 inches (113 mm) at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91 inches (99 mm) near Central Park, New York, and 3.19 inches (81 mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. Several roads and driveways were damaged by flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Flash floods were seen in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused some damage to trees. In New Jersey, winds pushing over land caused high tides and minor coastal flooding.\n\n", "id": "161512", "title": "Tropical Storm Barry (2007)"}

The season started on June 1, 2009 and it ended on November 30, 2009. In this season Tropical Depression One formed early, on May 28. In June and July there were no storms. The most recent occurrence of no storms in June or July was in 1992. In total there were 2 tropical depressions, 7 tropical storms, 3 hurricanes, and two of the three were major hurricanes.\n\nOn May 28, a small storm formed off the coast of North Carolina and became a tropical depression, called \"One\" by the National Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center said that Tropical Depression One might strengthen into a tropical storm, but it did not because the water was cold and did not give enough energy to the storm. It weakened and stopped being a depression the next day.\nTropical Depression Two formed on August 11 south of Cape Verde. The system moved west and dissipated on August 13. On August 15 the remains of Tropical Depression Two reformed. Tropical Depression Two quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. The storm continued west towards the Leeward Islands. A few days later as the storm was still headed for the Leeward Islands it weakened to a tropical depression. Ana struck Dominica on August 16 and dissipated the next day.\nOn August 15, Tropical Depression Three formed and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill. On August 17 Tropical Storm Bill became Hurricane Bill. On August 18 Hurricane Bill became a major hurricane (Category 3+). Hurricane Bill quickly strengthened into a category 4 hurricane on August 19, but weakened back on to a category 3 on August 20. Hurricane Bill weakened to a category 2 on August 21, it again weakened the next day to a category 1 hurricane. As a category one hurricane Bill came close to a landfall in Nova Scotia. Near midnight (Eastern Time Zone) on August 23, Bill made landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical the next day. The remains affected United Kingdom.\n\nTropical Storm Claudette formed in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Depression Four early on August 16. At 12:15 p.m. EDT the same day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette. Early the next morning Claudette struck Santa Rosa Island, Florida. Tropical Storm Claudette weakened and dissipated on August 18.\nTropical Storm Danny formed north of Puerto Rico on August 26. Danny top winds were at 60 mph. Danny did not become a hurricane. Danny instead, moved toward North Carolina as a weak tropical storm. On August 29 Danny weaken into a depression and lost it clouds to an extratropical storm. Danny did not reach North Carolina before losing its cloud. Danny killed a boy in North Carolina due to rip currents.\nTropical Storm Erika formed on September 1 as Tropical Storm Erika, meaning it was never a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Erika moved mostly west for most of the lifespan of it. On September 2 Tropical Storm Erika made landfall in Guadeloupe. Tropical Storm Erika weaken to a tropical depression and a remnant low on September 3. The remnant low caused some rain to some of the northern islands of the Caribbean Sea.\n\nTropical Depression Seven formed on September 7 south of the Cape Verde Islands. Later on September 7 it became a tropical storm and was named Fred. Early the next day, Tropical Storm Fred became Hurricane Fred, the second hurricane of the season. Hurricane Fred became a major hurricane (Cat 3+). Fred slowly weakened after becoming a category 3 hurricane. On September 12 while a tropical storm, Fred became a remnant low and is no longer a tropical storm.\nTropical Depression Eight formed near Cape Verde on September 25. Tropical Depression Eight was said that it would become a tropical storm, this did not happen. Tropical Depression Eight instead became a tropical wave on September 26. It is no longer a tropical depression.\n\nTropical Storm Grace became a tropical storm late on October 4, it was also never a tropical depression while it was forming. Tropical Storm Grace moved towards Ireland, but went into a frontal system on October 5, Grace was not a tropical storm anymore. The remains affect Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nTropical Storm Henri was a weak storm that stayed out in the ocean for most of its life. It formed from a tropical wave on October 6 while moving northwest across the Atlantic. On the next day, wind shear around the storm caused it to weaken into a remnant low. Its remains were last seen near Cuba. The storm did not come close to any land and did not cause any damage to property.\nOn November 4, Tropical Depression Eleven started in the Caribbean Sea. Later that same day it became a tropical storm and was given the name \"Ida\". Ida became a hurricane just before landfall on November 5. Ida weakened fast over land and was a depression before the end of the day. On November 6, Ida came back into the Caribbean Sea just north of Honduras. Ida became a tropical storm again on November 7. Ida later on became a hurricane again and weakened back to a tropical storm on November 9. Ida made landfall in Alabama on November 10. The storm died only about 4 hours later. The remains of Ida became a nor'easter that killed 9 people. Hurricane Ida also caused about $5.6 million in damage.\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2009. This is the same list that was used in the 2003 season, except for \"Fred\", \"Ida\", and \"Joaquin\". In 2003 those three names were Fabian, Isabel, and Juan, because they were bad storms in 2003, their names were retired from the list of names.\n\n\n", "id": "161518", "title": "2009 Atlantic hurricane season"}

It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system. It was a small and disorganized depression, and it never became a tropical storm, which is stronger than a tropical depression. The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and it quickly weakened. Because the storm was weak, the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nA tropical wave, which had also created Tropical Depression Six, combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23, 2003. A mid- to lower-level circulation started to form inside the storm as it moved mostly in a north-northwest direction. According to surface and satellite observations, it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles (95 km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures.\n\nAt first, the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph (20 km/h), and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center. However, the cloud pattern became organized, and was made up of a number of curved banding features. The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life, from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough.\n\nMoving through an area of cool water temperatures, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds, the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph (55 km/h), and as a result did not gain tropical storm status. Before landfall, the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation, where a well-defined group of clouds persisted. Early on July 26, it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and after slowly weakening over land, it died out on July 27.\n\nThe depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status. Because of this, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued. However, flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina. At Georgetown County, South Carolina, officials watched the storm closely. \n\nThe depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina. The highest rain was 5.17 inches (131 mm) in Savannah, Georgia. Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in (50 to 75 mm) were common. There were no damages or casualties because of this depression.\n\n", "id": "161520", "title": "Tropical Depression Seven (2003)"}

A \"major hurricane\" is a storm that is above Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The season officially started on June 1, 2001, and it ended on November 30, 2001. This time period is when tropical cyclones usually form in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTropical Storm Allison was the costliest tropical storm in United States history. Allison caused so much damage because she moved very slow over Texas. It took Allison about 4 days to move from Lufkin, Texas to the Gulf of Mexico. Allison left $5.5 billion in damage and killed 55 people. \nTropical Depression Two formed on July 11. Forecasters said that it might become a tropical storm. This did not happen.

It moved quickly to the west, and broke down to a tropical wave the next day. By September 10, the wave had reorganized, and it was again named Tropical Depression Seven. The depression continued to strengthen, and became Hurricane Felix by September 13. Now moving north, Felix intensified rapidly, reaching Category 3 status. Felix turned to the northeast and started to weaken. By September 17, Felix had dropped to tropical storm strength, and it died on the 19th.

The water molecules completely surround the methane. Methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine (ocean) geosphere. In 1971, it was first discovered in Black Sea.\n\nMethane hydrate is often described as “methane gas surrounded by ice.” Although this description is easy to understand, it's not completely accurate. A more accurate description would be that methane hydrate consists of \"methane gas trapped inside cage-like crystal structures made up of water molecules.\" These “cages” have a size of atoms and molecules, far too small to see with the naked eye. Under normal temperature and pressure, one litre methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres methane gas.\n\nMethane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earth's layers, and then broken down by microorganisms and the earth's heat. The process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth, except that it occurs deep below the earth's surface. The organisms which produce methane by a process of fermentation are the methanogen Archaea.\n\nAreas where natural methane hydrate is thought to exist are generally areas under the ocean where continental plates meet.

He traveled a lot in South America, Africa and Asia. He spoke many languages, including Esperanto, the made up international language. He was member of the Academy of Esperanto and honorary member of the Universal Association of Esperanto (UEA). He wrote books in Esperanto. He came from a Jewish family.\n\nSekelj was born in Spišská Sobota, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is now called Poprad, in Slovakia. His father was a veterinarian (animal doctor), and the family moved around extensively. They moved to Cheney, now in Romania. In 1922 they moved to Kikinda, Serbia. He went to elementary school in Kikinda. The family moved to Nikšić, in Montenegro where he finished high school. He went to Zagreb where he studied in law at university.\n\nDisinterested in practicing law, he began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1939 he went to Argentina to write about former Croates who had left Yugoslavia to settle in South America. He stayed there for the next 15 years as a journalist and explorer. In 1944 he was part of a trekking party that climbed to the top of highest mountain in the western hemisphere Aconcagua , near Argentina. He used this experience to write a novel (story) in Spanish about Aconcagua, which became a best seller there. In 1946 he undertook the first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, the first of which produced a popular book, (Por Tierra De Indios}. His companion from that expedition, Mary Reznik--whom he later married--was the first white woman to have penetrated that deeply into the Brazilian jungle. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948, after which he penned \"Where Civilization Ends\" (Donde La Civilizacion Termina). The marriage produced a son, Diego. In 1954 Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia and settled in Belgrade, although he still traveled extensively. In 1962 he traveled through Africa. He married Erzsebet Sekelj, a young woman he met on a trip through Hungary. From 1972 he lived in Subotica (Vojvodina), now in Serbia. He was in charge of a museum in Subotica. He died in Subotica, and is buried there.\n\n\n\n\nDuring his travels in South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Sekelj collected many important items from other cultures. He gave these to the Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb.\n\nHis main book on other cultures is \" Tirez the arrow: oral poetry of the world \", Rotterdam: UEA, 1983, 187 pages, ISBN 92-9017-025-5. He translated into Esperanto, the poetry he had collected during his travels.\n\nSekelj worked with many other writers on a dictionary of museums, called the \"Dictionarium Museologicum\", 1986.\n", "id": "161704", "title": "Tibor Sekelj"}

The 'blueprints' on cardboard (also known as 'tapestry cartoons') were made by artists, while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by craftsmen.\n\nThe success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability (Le Corbusier once called tapestries \"nomadic murals\").

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161772", "text": "Peppered moth evolution\n\nThe evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last 150 years. At first, almost all of the moths were light coloured. This gave them camouflage against the light-coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day. As pollution increased during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out. The trees became blackened by soot, and most of the light-coloured moths, or typica, became rare. At the same time, the dark-coloured, or \"melanic\", moths, carbonaria, flourished. This change took place because it was the best camouflaged moths which survived better. The term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutants. \n\nSince then, with an improved environment, light-coloured peppered moths have again become common. As a result of the relatively simple and easy-to-understand circumstances of the adaptation, the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection.\n\nMelanism has appeared in the European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the initial rise in melanic frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, because it was measured with moth traps.\n\nA black peppered moth was found in 1811, a rareity, no doubt caused by a gene mutation. By 1864 the darker 'carbonaria' form was the more common morph in Manchester. By 1895, it reached a frequency of 98% in Manchester.\n\nFrom around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of \"carbonaria\" has steadily fallen. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, because of better scientific studies. Bernard Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996, and L.M. Cook in 2003.\n\nSimilar results were found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. This may be because peppered moths in Japan do not live in industrialised regions.\n\nIn 1896 J. W. Tutt suggested that the increased proportion of \"carbonaria\" was caused by differential bird predation. This meant birds took more light-coloured moths in dark areas, and more dark-coloured moths in light areas. Various experiments have been performed on predation of the peppered moth, and each has supported this hypothesis.\n\nThe most famous experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell under the supervision of E.B. Ford. In one of Kettlewell's experiments, moths were released into a large (18 m by 6 m) aviary, where they were fed on by Great Tits (\"Parus major\"). In 1953, Kettlewell experimented at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham. He marked, released and recaptured the marked moths. He found, in polluted woodland, more \"typica\" morphs were taken. This showed that the melanistic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in an unpolluted woodland in Dorset, and again in polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Niko Tinbergen, and they made a film of this. Further studies by others found similar results. Finally, in 1996, work on both sides of the Atlantic found a correlation between changes in melanic frequencies and pollution levels.\n\nA field experiment in biology will always have some artificiality, but that has to be balanced against practicality and costs. The most important aspect is that an experiment gives useful information. The only previous experiments of this type were R.A. Fisher and E.B. Ford's with the Scarlet tiger moth.\n\nIn 2000 Majerus developed plans for further experiments. In the main experiment in Cambridge from 20012007 Majerus added an experiment to find if bat predation might have skewed the results – this found that bats preyed equally on both forms of the moth. He observed a number bird species preying on the moths. The overall data led him to conclude that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in \"carbonaria\" frequency compared to \"typica\" in Cambridge during the study period. He described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story, and said \"If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution\". Majerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, but the work was carried on by others. The paper said that \"These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths\". The new data, coupled with the weight of previous data show that \"industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action\".\n\n\"Biston betularia\" caterpillars also occur in two forms, each adapted to a different situation. They develop body colours which match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. This is done by a mechanism called polyphenism. Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused by the same genome. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism of the adults, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.\n\nPolyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. In this case, researchers discovered that visual experience triggered precise color matching. \n\n", "id": "161772", "title": "Peppered moth evolution"}

As a child he was one of the most amazing violin prodigies there has ever been. He was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. In later life he also performed a lot as conductor. He was a very influential teacher who started a school, the Yehudi Menuhin School, near London, for musically gifted children. He was born an American citizen, but then became Swiss in 1970, and then took on British nationality in 1985.\n\nYehudi Menuhin was born in New York City, New York. His parents were Russian Jews who came from what is now Belarus. His sisters were Hephzibah Menuhin who became a pianist, and Yaltah Menuhin who became a pianist, painter and poet. His father, Moshe Menuhin, had been a rabbinical student and anti-Zionist writer.\n\nMenuhin had his first violin lessons just after the age of four in San Francisco with the violin teacher Sigmund Anker. He immediately showed extraordinary talent. He continued to study with Louis Persinger, and performed with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1924. and in New York in 1926. He performed in Paris in February 1927, after which he studied with the Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu. When he played Beethoven’s Violin Concerto with the conductor Fritz Busch in New York in November 1927 he immediately became world famous. He not only had the most amazing technique but he also understood the music just as well as any grown up musician. As a child he made many recordings. One of the most remarkable was a recording made in 1932 of Elgar’s Violin concerto. Elgar, who was then 75 years old, was conducting the orchestra.\n\nDuring World War II Menuhin gave more than 500 performances for American and allied soldiers. He was the first person to perform in the Paris Opéra after the war and he went with the composer Benjamin Britten to perform for the people who were prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, after they were made free in April 1945. He returned to Germany in 1947 to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler. Many Jews said he should not have done this, because they said that Furtwängler had played for the Nazis who had killed so many Jews, but Menuhin said it was the right thing to do.\n\nMenuhin continued to give many performances, but there were times when he did not play so well. He may have worked too hard. He had to give himself time off performing and he practised very carefully and studied meditation and yoga to help him get over his problems.\n\nMenuhin continued to perform until he was quite old. He did not just play classical music but explored other kinds of music such as jazz which he often played with the famous jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli, and he explored Indian music and played with the sitarist Ravi Shankar. He also conducted some of the world’s greatest orchestras and founded his own chamber orchestra.\n\nIn 1959 Menuhin made his home in London. He performed a lot in England, including at the Bath Festival, but also continued to travel all over the world.\n\nIn 1962 he started a school for children who had special musical talent. It was called the Yehudi Menuhin School. The school is in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey, just south of London.\n\nIn 1983 he founded together with Robert Masters the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists. Many of today’s famous violinists won prizes at this competition, including Tasmin Little and Nikolaj Znaider.\n\nIn 1991 he was given the Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave a speech in which he criticised Israel's occupation of the West Bank. He said that it was not right for the Jews, who have lived by strict moral behaviour for 5000 years, not to let others (meaning the Palestinians) live their lives there too.\n\nMenuhin had many pupils who became famous, including Nigel Kennedy. \n\nYehudi Menuhin was married twice. He first married Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist, and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin's first husband. They had two children. After their divorce, he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould. They had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy, who became a pianist. \n\nThe name \"Yehudi\" means 'Jew' in Hebrew. It means \"Thanks to God\".\n\nYehudi Menuhin was given many honours from all over the world. These include the Commander of the Legion d’honneur, a Knight of the Dutch Order of Oranje Nassau, an Hon. KBE, and the Nehru Award for International Understanding. In 1993 he was made a life peer and became Lord Menuhin.\n\nLord Menuhin died in Berlin, Germany, from bronchitis. \n\nSoon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music was given the Yehudi Menuhin Archive, a very large collection of musical books, letters etc. that had belonged to Yehudi Menuhin.\n\nOfficial website for Yehudi Menuhin\n", "id": "161819", "title": "Yehudi Menuhin"}

The ancient Egyptians painted hieroglyphics showing the preparation of food. Many recipes are known from ancient Greece. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost. Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Roman recipes are known with some of them starting in the 2nd century B.C with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many other authors of this period explained eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and Latin.\n\nKing Richard II of England asked someone to make a recipe book called \"Forme of Cury\" in 1390. Around the same time another book was published entitled \"Curye on Inglish\". Both books give an idea of how food was made and served in the noble classes of England at that time. \n\nBy the 1400s, manuscripts appeared, describing the recipes of that time. Many of these give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary. Many of these herbs and spices had been brought back from the Crusades.\n\nDuring the 1500s and 1600s, printed books appeared. The large houses tried to be better than each other, and books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland, and England, the noble families competed to see who could make the most splendid foods. \n\nBy the 1660s cooks published their own books explaining their recipes, in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have now been translated and can be found online.\n\nIn Europe, none had such influence as the top French chefs. They built the haute cuisine which others copied. La Varenne (1615–1678), Carême (1784–1833) and Escoffier (1846–1935) were the great innovators.\n\nBy the 1800s, cooking had become a hobby throughout the world. Using the newest technology and using a new publishing idea, Mrs Beeton (1836–1865) published her famous ‘Book of Household Management’, in 24 parts between 1857 and 1861. Around that same time the American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) devoted herself to cooking. She published the book ‘The Boston Cooking School Cookbook’ in 1896 which had 1849 recipes.\n\nThe next revolution in popular culture came with introduction of the media cooks. The first was Philip Harben who was first on radio, with newspaper columns and books. Then he was first on British television, before Fanny Craddock.\n\nTV cooking programs brought the recipes of cooks to a new audience who wanted to try out new ways of cooking. In the early days, the recipes were available by post from the BBC and later with the introduction of the CEEFAX text on screen system, they became available on the television. The new companies of Channel 4 and S4C also brought recipes to the television with their own text system called ORACLE. Today the television is still a major source of recipe information, with world-wide cooks and chefs such as Julia Child, Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having TV shows and websites giving the details of all their recipes.\n", "id": "161836", "title": "Recipe"}

The teacher treated both groups the same, but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others; Simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students.\n\nThe Pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory. It makes managers be aware, that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification, personal qualities or working environment. Manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results. In such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work.\n", "id": "161851", "title": "Pygmalion effect"}

It happens because of the time difference between two places. Some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do.\n\nIf the departure time (the original body clock) is not the same as the destination time, jet lag can occur. Traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west. That is because a cycle of the human's biological time is usually more than 24 hours, and going east makes the day shorter, which is a more difficult adjustment.\nJet lag can have several symptoms. It usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia. Also, headache, depression, even nausea may strike people. Sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment. Using caffeine (such as in tea or coffee) is helpful, either in the morning when going westward or in the afternoon when going eastward. The hormone melatonin is said to help people sleep. Also, doing things like changing sleeping patterns several days before departure may help people adjust to the new time zone.\n", "id": "161852", "title": "Jet lag"}

Estimates of its weight have varied greatly. \n\nIt was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees. It had a long, low, hornless skull and long frontal and nasal bones. Its front teeth had a single pair of incisors in either jaw. They were round, pointed, and so large that they looked like small tusks. The upper incisors pointed straight downwards, while the lower ones jutted outwards. The upper lip was evidently extremely mobile. The neck was very long, the body big and strong, and the limbs long and thick, column-like.\n\nIts exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements. However, the known bone elements are from individuals of different sizes. All skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations. This resulted in weight estimates from 11 to 20 tonnes. Its maximum height has been estimated as at the shoulders.

It is one of the greatest orchestras in the world. The conductor of the orchestra is Sir Simon Rattle.\n\nThe Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in Berlin in the spring of 1882. By 1887 they were known by their present name. Hans von Bülow became their conductor that year and made them into a world class orchestra. Other great conductors were also invited to conduct as guests: Hans Richter, Felix von Weingartner, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg. \n\nIn 1895, Arthur Nikisch became chief conductor, and was followed in 1923 by Wilhelm Furtwängler. The orchestra continued to perform throughout World War II. After Furtwängler fled to Switzerland in 1945, Leo Borchard became chief conductor, but a few months later he was accidentally shot and killed by American forces occupying Berlin. Sergiu Celibidache then took over as chief conductor for seven years, from 1945 to1952. Furtwängler returned in 1952 and conducted the orchestra until his death in 1954.\n\nHerbert von Karajan led the orchestra from 1955 until he resigned in April 1989. He was a very strict conductor who had to be obeyed in everything he did. The orchestra made lots of great recordings with him. \n\nAfter Karajan, Claudio Abbado became principal conductor. He helped the orchestra to learn new works, not just the well known classical and romantic works but also the more modern 20th century works. He stopped conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002. At the time Germany was being reunited the orchestra had financial problems.\n\nIn June 1999, the musicians chose Sir Simon Rattle as their next chief conductor. Rattle made the orchestra into a self-governing body. This meant that they made their own financial decisions and chose the works they would perform and who would be invited to perform with them. \n\nThe first concert hall of the orchestra was destroyed during WWII in 1944. Since 1963, the orchestra has had a new concert hall called the Philharmonie. On 20 May 2008, a fire broke out at the Philharmonie. A quarter of the roof was damaged and the orchestra could not play there for some time.\n\nThe orchestra have won many awards for their playing.\n\nUNICEF appointed the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007.\n\nOn 18 December 2008 the Orchestra announced that a Digital Concert Hall would be built.

In humans, well-known RNA viruses are those that cause SARS, Influenza or Hepatitis C.\n\nViruses that are not RNA viruses use DNA for their genome and are called DNA viruses.\n\nViruses have a classification system, invented by David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner. The RNA viruses in the Baltimore system are classified as:\n\"Sense\" in RNA means \"ready to make proteins, as messenger RNA does\". \"Antisense\" in RNA means \"complementary to messenger RNA\". In complete complementarity each nucleotide is across from its opposite number, so antisense RNA can produce sense RNA. \n\nAnother system is run by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It uses terms from the familiar Linnaean taxonomy, like orders and families.\n\nRNA viruses have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses. This is because viral RNA polymerases lack the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases. This explains why it is difficult to make effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by RNA viruses.\n\nSome genes of RNA virus are important to the viral replication cycles and mutations are not tolerated. For example, the bit of the hepatitis C virus genome which encodes the core protein is highly conserved, because it is essential to start translation.\n\n", "id": "162455", "title": "RNA virus"}

They are all single-celled, they are all parasites of animals, and they all form spores.\n\nThey have a unique organelle, a plastid called an apicoplast, and an apical complex structure which gets them into a host's cell. They do not have structures such as flagella or pseudopods except in certain gamete stages. Body movement is by flexing or gliding.\n\nThe group were once called the Sporozoa, but this name is now discouraged.\n\nApicomplexans have complex life cycles, and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups. Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. Cell nuclei are haploid.\n\nThis is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia, gregarines, piroplasms, haemogregarines, and malarias. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include:\n\n\nMost members have a complex life-cycle, with both asexual and sexual reproduction. A host is infected by an active invasion by the parasites. The parasites divide to produce \"sporozoites\" which enter its cells. Eventually, the cells burst, releasing \"merozoites\", which infect new cells. Eventually, gametes are produced, and they fuse to create new cysts. There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.\n\nThe apical complex includes vesicles which open at the front of the cell. They secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells. The tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules, called the \"polar ring\", and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the \"conoid\". \n\nThe presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the alveolates. Several related flagellates, such as \"Perkinsus\" and \"Colpodella\", have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates. They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.\n\nAnother similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single plastid, called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes. Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and haem biosynthesis. It appears to be necessary for survival. The plastids are thought to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from red algae rather than green.\n", "id": "162833", "title": "Apicomplexa"}

Rosenhan was an expert on psychology and law. \n\nIn 1973 Rosenhan published \"On Being Sane in Insane Places\". This was one of the most-read pieces of writing in psychology. The article talks about the Rosenhan experiment. The experiment was that eight people with no history of psychopathology would try to get into twelve psychiatric hospitals. All of these people were allowed in, and were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then tried to cure the people using psychiatric medicines. All eight were allowed to leave within 7 to 52 days, but only when they had said that they accepted the illness they had been diagnosed with. Later in the study, a research and teaching hospital challenged Rosenhan to run a similar experiment with its own diagnoses and rules for letting people in to the hospital. Psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their hospital. At least one staff member thought that 83 out of the 193 new patients were actors. In fact, Rosenhan sent no actors. The study showed that the ways diagnosis was done was very inaccurate in telling people with mental disorders and people without mental disorders apart. The paper made a lot of controversy. Some people are not sure of how valid and credible the study was, but say that psychiatric diagnoses need to be improved.\n\nProfessor Rosenhan worked with the Stanford University Department of Psychology.

It is used to read and write information in hard drives.\n\nThe GMR effect can be measured when a magnet is used to change the flow of electricity. The 2007 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grünberg for the discovery of GMR.\n\nGMR was discovered in layers iron, chrome and ferrite by Peter Grünbergs research team of the Jülich Research Centre (Germany) in 1988. Peter Grünberg owns a patent for the technology. It was also discovered by Albert Ferts research group of the University of Paris-Sud (France) in layers ferrite and chrome. The Fert group were first to see what they thought of as a \"large\" effect which is why they gave the name \"Giant\". The Fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of GMR. The discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics. Grünberg and Fert have been given prizes and awards, including the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics, for this discovery and other spintronics work.\n\nIn multilayer GMR, two or more magnetic layers are separated by a very thin (about 1 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. Ferrite, a form of iron, is a magnetic layer and chrome is an insulating layer. At certain thickness, the strength of magnetism between the layers becomes easy to measure and adjust. The strength of electrical current between the layers can change by up to 10%.\n\nThe GMR effect was first observed in stacks of 10 or more layers.\n\nIn spin valve GMR, two magnetic layers are separated by a thin (~3 nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. It is possible to measure and adjust the strength of magnetism between these layers.\n\nIt is hoped that research into spinning electrons will improve spin valves. \n\nMaterials used in spin valves are copper and an alloy of nickel and iron. \n\nSpin valve GMR is the most useful sort for hard drives and is tested carefully to meet industry standards.\n\nGranular GMR is an effect found in copper containing grains of cobalt. It is not possible to control the strength of granular GMR in the same manner as Multilayer GMR.\n\nGMR is used in modern hard drives and magnetic sensors. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). GMR has begun a new science of electronics called spintronics.\n\n\n", "id": "162936", "title": "Giant magnetoresistance"}

His family name is “Ma”, so his full Chinese name is “Ma Yo-yo”. Yo-Yo Ma is one of the world’s greatest cellists. He plays many kinds of music, not just classical, and he has performed for three presidents of the United States.\n\nYo-Yo Ma was born in Paris. His parents were Chinese. His mother, Marina Lu, was a singer, and his father, Hiao-Tsiun Ma, was a professor of music. His family moved to New York when he was four years old. \n\nMa began studying violin when he was very small. He also played the viola for a short while, then, at the age of four, he started the cello. He was a child prodigy and began performing to audiences at the age of five. When he was seven he performed to President John F. Kennedy . At the age of eight he appeared on American television in a concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein. By the time he was fifteen, Ma had graduated from Trinity School in New York and appeared as a soloist with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky’s 'Variations on a Rococo Theme\".\n\nMa studied at the Juilliard School of Music. His teacher was Leonard Rose. He went to Columbia University and then Harvard University. At one time he had doubts about whether he should continue his studies, but in the 1970s he was inspired by the recordings of Pablo Casals.\n\nBy this time he had played with several of the world's great orchestras. His recordings and performances of the \"Johann Sebastian Bach: Cello Suites\" recorded in 1983 and again in 1994-1997 have been particularly praised. He has also played lots of chamber music, often with the pianist Emanuel Ax whom he had met at the Julliard School of Music.\n\nMa married in 1977. The couple have two children. They live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nMa is interested in music from different cultures. He has a group called Silk Road Ensemble which tries to bring together musicians from different countries which are historically linked by the Silk Road. H records on the Sony Classical label.\n\nYo-Yo Ma has owned several beautiful cellos. The cello called \"Domenico Montagnana 1733\" cello (nicknamed \"Petunia\") was made in 1733 in Venice. It is worth more than US$2.5 million. In 1999 he accidentally left it in a taxi but fortunately it was found again. Another of Ma's cellos, the \"Davidov Stradivarius\", was once owned by Jacqueline du Pré who left it to him when she died.\nHe also owns a cello made of carbon fiber by the Luis and Clark company of Boston.\n\nYo-Yo Ma has played for the soundtracks of many famous movies. He also has made over 75 albums, 15 of which are Grammy Award winners.\n\nMa has appeared in an episode of the animated children's television series, \"Arthur\" (in which D.W. kept calling him \"Yo Ma-Ma\") as well as several other television programmes including \"The Simpsons\". Ma performed a duet with Condoleezza Rice at the presentation of the 2001 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal Awards. He made a programme about \"Bach: Six Suites for Unaccompanied Cello\". \n\nOn 11 September, 2002, a year after the attack on the World Trade Center, he played his cello on the site of the building while the first of the names of the dead were read in remembrance. Ma was named Peace Ambassador by the United Nations in January 2006. \n\nHe performed John Williams' \"Air and Simple Gifts\" at the inauguration ceremony for Barack Obama on January 20, 2009 together with the violinist Itzhak Perlman, the pianist Gabriela Montero and the clarinettist Anthony McGill.\n\n", "id": "162990", "title": "Yo-Yo Ma"}

He wrote for the show, and also appeared on camera in different roles. He began a series of mock editorials, that became very popular, by both poking fun at extremist opinions, and giving people reasons to think and talk about important issues (the First Amendment, gun control, drugs, and other matters). Hundreds of viewers wrote to CBS, who broadcast the \"Comedy Hour\", to ask for copies of the editorials.\n\nDuring 1968 (an election year in the United States), Paulsen began a pretend \"campaign\" for President, and used the campaign to show the humor and irony in American politics.

It became a subtropical \"storm\", which is stronger than a subtropical \"depression\". The storm gained a bit more strength later that day. It then moved across the Azores, and began to weaken. The storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. The storm died out on October 5. What was left of the storm later became Subtropical Storm Vince.\n\nHigh winds were reported in parts of the Azores because of the storm. The strongest winds were on Santa Maria Island, where there was a gust of 59 mph (94 km/h). Ponta Delgada also saw 52 mph (85 km/h) wind gusts. There was no damage and there were no deaths. The storm was not said to be a subtropical storm until the National Hurricane Center found it on April 10, 2006. Every year, the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season. If the storm was found when it was active, it would have been named \"Tammy\".\n\n\n", "id": "163133", "title": "2005 Azores subtropical storm"}

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the 20th Disney animated movie. The movie is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe. It is about a family of aristocratic cats, and how an alley cat helps them after a butler has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was meant to go to them. The movie features the voices of Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby. \n\nIn 1962, \"The Aristocats\" began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated movie, and placed the project in turnaround as \"The Jungle Book\" advanced into production. When \"The Jungle Book\" was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on \"The Aristocats\". It would mark the last movie project to be approved by Disney before his death in December 1966.\n\n\"The Aristocats\" was released on December 11, 1970, to positive reception, and was a box office success.\n\nThe movie takes place in Paris in 1910. A mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse, are going to receive a fortune when their owner dies. But Edgar, their butler, does not like this and plans to send the cats away.\n\nHe places sleeping tablets in their dinner. At night, he plans on dropping them off in the countryside. Two hound dogs, Napoleon and Lafayette, attack him, and the cats are now stranded.\n\nIn the morning, they meet an alley cat named Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley (called just Thomas O'Malley). He helps them on their way back home. He even lets them stay at his \"pad\" (the place where he and his \"gang\", or friends, stay).\n\nThey finally get back home, but Edgar recatches them in a sack and plans to send them to Timbuktu, Africa. O'Malley, Scat Cat and his gang, Roquefort and Frou-Frou all fight Edgar, while Roquefort rescues Duchess and kittens. In the end, Edgar is kicked into the trunk, locked inside, and sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to not include Edgar and include O'Malley, and she starts a charity foundation which gives a home to all the cats in Paris.\n\n\nThe movie was released on VHS in Europe on January 1, 1990. It was first released on VHS in North America in the Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996.\n\nIn January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, with \"The Aristocats\" re-released on VHS and DVD on April 4, 2000.

Wallace was a longtime supporter of segregation; a policy that did not allow African-Americans to attend the same schools, or go to many of the same public places, as white people. In 1963 he stood in a schoolhouse door to prevent black students from attending the school (which would have integrated the school). In a speech, he said he would support \"segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\". He was a controversial figure. Some people saw him as a man who spoke up for the poor and was an outspoken populist. Others viewed him as a terrible person, a white supremacist who encouraged violence.\n\nIn time, he changed his views, and said that he was sorry to African-Americans, and other people hurt by segregation. He promoted black equality in his last term as Governor. Despite this, he remains an icon of racism today and many people think of him as one of the most evil figures in American history.\n\nDuring the 1972 presidential campaign, Wallace was shot five times by a would-be assassin, Arthur Bremer. He suffered permanent injury to his spine. He could no longer walk, and spent the rest of his life using a wheelchair.\n\nAfter his last term as governor, he began speaking in public places (including churches), to promote tolerance and friendship between people of different races.\n\nWallace was married to Laurleen Wallace until her death. Then he was married to Corelia Wallace until they divorced. Then he was married to Lisa Taylor until they divored. He had four children.\n\nThe Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Sweet Home Alabama\" has the line \"In Birmingham they love the Governor / Boo Boo Boo / Now we all did what we could do / if watergate does not bother me / does your conscience bother you now tell me true.\" Even though Wallace is not mentioned by name, the line clearly refers to him, and members of the band have confirmed this and have said they disliked Wallace.\n\nGary Sinise played him in the film \"George Wallace\".\n\nA tunnel on Interstate 10 in Alabama has been named the George Wallace Memorial Tunnel.\nWallace died on September 13, 1998 in Montgomery, Alabama from a spinal infection, aged 79.

It stayed away from land for most of its life. However, when it died out, what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda. It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island. No severe damage happened.\n\nA cyclone formed on August 5. At that time, it was located about 175 miles (280 km/h) to the east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina. The storm then moved towards the southeast. On August 6, the rain and clouds around the storm began to get weaker. However, the storm gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6.\n\nThe tropical storm was still moving towards the southeast when it became Cristobal. On August 7, it turned to the east. Cristobal then reached its highest strength. It began to weaken after that. Early on August 9, Tropical Storm Cristobal merged with another weather system, when it was located about 350 miles (560 km) to the southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. What was left of the storm passed near Newfoundland on August 10. It fully died near Greenland on August 14.\n\nCristobal stayed mostly away from land while it was a tropical cyclone. However, what was left of it after it died out brought rain and wind to Bermuda. A wind gust of 45 mph (72 km/h) happened at the Bermuda International Airport. 2.78 inches (71 mm) of rain fell in 24 hours. This rain was partly because of Cristobal. Cristobal also caused rip currents and 4 foot (1.2 m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York. Three people drowned in the rip currents. Two ships in the ocean reported high winds because of the storm.\n", "id": "163333", "title": "Tropical Storm Cristobal (2002)"}

He lived in Victoria and was different from other bushrangers. There are a lot of stories and legends told about Captain Moonlight.\n\nScott was born in Rathfriland, County Down, Ireland, in 1842. His father was an Anglican clergyman. Scott had a good education, good manners, and had read the Bible. He left Ireland and went to London. After hearing about the gold rushes in Australia he made his way to Victoria. He went to New Zealand and took part in the Maori Wars in 1861. He was speared in the leg, which left him with a limp. At the end of the war, he went back to Melbourne and began to train as a clergyman in the Church of England.\n\nHe began work with the church in the Bacchus Marsh area. He lived at the small town of Mount Egerton. From there he went travelled around, visiting people, and doing church work.\n\nAt 1.00 am, Andrew came to the bank with his face covered, and armed with a gun, went into the house of the Mount Egerton bank manager, Mr. Brunn. The robber forced Brunn to walk down to the school and write a note, which said, “Captain Moonlite has stuck me up and robbed the bank.” They went back to the bank where Moonlight tied Brunn up before taking all the money. In the morning, the teacher, Mr. Simpson, found the note. He ran to the bank and untied Brunn. Brunn told the police that the man was the preacher, Andrew Scott. Scott said it was a lie, and told the police it was a plan by Brunn and Simpson to steal money from the bank. Everyone believed the preacher, and the police arrested Brunn and Simpson for robbing the bank.\n\nScott left Mount Egerton and told people he was going to go to the South Pacific. He was the main witness in the bank robbery. When he left, the police had to drop the charges against Brunn and Simpson. He bought a boat, the \"Swallow\", and sailed out of Sydney with a group of rich young men. He just passed through the Sydney Heads when a police steam launch caught up with him and made him go back. He had paid for the boat with a bad cheque. He was sent to gaol (jail) for 18 months.\n\nAs soon as he was let out of gaol in Sydney, he was arrested for the Mount Egerton robbery. The police put him in the new Ballarat Gaol to wait for his trial. He was able to make a hole into the next cell. With help from another prisoner, Dermoodie, they overpowered the guard and locked him in the cell. They let all the other prisoners out of their cells. They stood on each other's backs and shoulders to get to the top of the gaol wall. Using a rope made from blankets tied together, the prisoners climbed the wall and escaped. Within one week, the police got back all the prisoners. The court gave Scott ten years in gaol for the bank robbery and one year for escaping from Ballarat. He was locked up in Pentridge Gaol. Scott behaved in gaol. After he was let out of gaol, he spoke at meetings about prison reform.\n\nOn November 18, 1879, a group of bushrangers led by Captain Moonlight, held up the Wantabadgery station (farm), east of Wagga Wagga. They stayed there for three days and held up all the people travelling along the road. They held about 30 people prisoner. One person was able to escape and tell the police. Two groups of police from Wagga Wagga and Gundagai went to the farm. After a lot of shooting, the bushrangers left and the police chased them through the bush. A bushranger, Gus Wernicke, aged 15, was shot and died in great pain. A policeman, Constable Bowen was badly hurt, and died a few days later. Captain Moonlight gave himself up to the police. The police captured the rest of the gang a few days later.\n\nThe police charged the bushrangers with the murder of Bowen. In court at Darlinghurst, Sydney, Scott tried to take the blame for the crime. He wanted the lives of his friends saved. Captain Moonlight, and gang member, Rogan, were hanged on January 20, 1880. In a letter from prison, Scott asked to buried next to his friend, James Nesbitt. In 1995 he was reburied at Gundagai next to gang members Gus Wernicke and James Nesbitt. A death mask was made of Scott by Walter McGill. This mask is now in the Justice and Police Museum, New South Wales.\n\nThe State Library of Victoria has a drawing of Scott made in November, 1879, in its collection. This can be seen on line. Artist Patrick William Marony painted a picture in 1894 of the gang (Scott, Bennett, Rogan, Nesbit and Williams), which he called \"The Moonliters\". It is kept in the National Library of Australia and can be seen online.\n", "id": "163337", "title": "Captain Moonlite"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163339", "text": "Barrel organ\n\nA barrel organ plays music by using turning a barrel, with notes decided by an arrangement of pins. It is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp. With a barrel organ, the pins in the barrel lift \"keys\" that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes. \nThe barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy, which is a string instrument. Barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer. Usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it, and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position. Even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes. Stationary barrel organs, built into large houses or churches, were larger pipe organs, and could play longer, and more serious music. Some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers, which meant they did not need an organist to play them, and had a larger selection of music. Organs built in a church, allowed people to sing, accompanied by organ. Some of the only organ music composed by Mozart, was supposedly written for a barrel organ built into a clock.\n", "id": "163339", "title": "Barrel organ"}
