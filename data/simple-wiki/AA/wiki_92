These types of movies are often made on a low budget. They are made to be released direct-to-video at the same time that the original movie is released in theaters or on video.\n\nMockbusters are often made to make customers mistakenly buy the movie instead of the one that they wanted. For example, someone may think that they are buying \"Transformers\", but they are actually buying \"Transmorphers\", a mockbuster that was released in 2007. Because of this, a mockbuster will often use a title similar to the original movie.\n\nMany mockbusters are made in a different country than the one that the original movie was made in.

It aired on NBC from September 9 to September 19, 2013. It follows a group of contestants who compete for up to $2 million in a game show that lasts for 1,000,000 seconds (or 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds). NBC aired the show for one hour each day (except for Sunday the 15th, and the final episode was two hours), while the rest of the show aired on the \"Million Dollar Quiz\" internet application and NBC.com. It is hosted by Ryan Seacrest.\n\nThe show takes place in a large hourglass-shaped structure in Midtown Manhattan near the Lincoln Tunnel. Contestants play for 24 hours a day for 1,000,000 seconds, or around eleven and a half days. At any given time, a contestant is sitting in the \"Money Chair\" and earning money, while defending his/her position in the chair in bouts against another contestant. Contestants earn $10 a second they are in the chair, even when bouts are not being played and during commercial breaks. Only the four contestants with the highest amount of money keep their winnings when the million seconds are up.\n\nEach bout lasts for a set amount of seconds. All questions are multiple choice with four possible answers. Contestants use keypads to lock in their answers. The players cannot see each other's answers. They have five seconds to do so when the question is asked.\n\nDuring the episodes that are seen on television, there are three bouts: the \"Challenger\" bout (300 seconds, or 5 minutes), the \"Line Jumper\" bout (300 seconds in the first episode, 400 seconds, or 6 minutes 40 seconds, from the second episode on), and the Winner's Defense\" bout (400 seconds in the first through ninth episodes, 500 seconds, or 8 minutes 20 seconds, in the 10th episode). Questions start at one point each. Every 100 seconds, the value of the questions increase by one point.\n\nAt any time, a contestant may choose to \"double\" instead of answering the question. If the contestant does so, the question's value is doubled, and the opponent has to either answer the question or \"double back\", which quadruples the point value and forces the person who the question was given to to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or does not answer in five seconds, the opponent gets the points. Contestants can choose to double as often as they want during a bout.\n\nAt the end of a bout, the contestant with the higher score wins and either stays in the \"Money Chair\" or replaces the current contestant in it. If both contestants have the same amount of points at the end of a bout, a question is asked, and the contestant who answers correctly first wins the bout. If both contestants answer incorrectly, the contestant with the higher amount of money wins.\n\nThe \"Challenger\" bout has a contestant who has successfully gone through an on-site tryout process. The \"Line Jumper\" bout has a contestant who has gotten a high enough score on the \"Million Second Quiz\" internet application, allowing them to skip the tryout and go on the show.\n\nThe four contestants with the most amount of money live in the \"Winners' Row\". This is a living area that is set up next to the hourglass. They are at risk of being replaced if another contestant gets a higher score than them. During a \"Winner's Defense\" bout, the current \"Power Player\" (the contestant who had the highest amount of correct answers playing along in \"Winners' Row\" that day) chooses one of the four \"Winners' Row\" contestants, who can be him/herself, to play against the contestant who is currently in the \"Money Chair\". The winner gets all of the loser's winnings in addition to their own winnings, while the loser is out of the game.\n\nBouts that are not shown on television last for 500 seconds. Every question is worth one point. Contestants cannot double in these bouts. Four bouts are played in an hour; with a five-minute pause after each of the first three. The fourth bout is followed by an 11-minute break. During this time, a contestant may eat, drink, or use the bathroom. Contestants earn money during the five-minute pauses, but not during the 11-minute break.\n\nAfter 1,000,000 seconds, the four contestants with the most amount of money keep all of the winnings they have earned. They face in a series of three bouts, which are as follows:\n\n\nThe winner of the third bout wins $2,000,000.\n", "id": "419339", "title": "The Million Second Quiz"}

Sir Geoffroi was born of an important French family. Throughout his life he fought many battles for France. He fought in the Crusades and many times throughout the war with England. He was always loyal to his King, Jean II, King of France and died at the Battle of Poitiers protecting him. Throughout his lifetime he was well known and well respected by both the French and the English kings and nobles. At Poitiers he was chosen to carry the Oriflamme into battle. The Oriflamme was the Kings banner and this was a great honor given to a knight by the King. He was also one of the Knights chosen to fight close to and protect the King. De Charny was said to be a \"true and perfect Knight\".\n\nJean de Joinville was de Charny's grandfather's. He was a close friend of King Louis IX and author of his biography. In the same tradition, Sir Geoffroi wrote three books in his time. His most famous book was \"A Knight's Own Book of Chivalry\". In this book he shared his great skill and knowledge of combat. The second book written by de Charny is entitled, \"Requests (or Questions) for jousting tournaments and war\". It was written about 1352 to the Knights of the Order of the Star which Sir Geoffroi founded. This book was written in the form of questions. His third book was the book \"Charny\", describes the life of a knight and lists the qualities a good knight must possess.\n\nCharny fought in Flanders and Tournay. He was taken prisoner but was ransomed because the King considered him so important. He fought in many major battles during the Hundred Years' War such as the battles of Calais, Crecy and Poitiers.\n\nSir John Chandos was a close friend and biographer of Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son of King Edward III of England. Chandos was a famous knight himself. He was an educated man and wrote down the events of a great meeting of both sides before the Battle of Poitiers. He wrote that at that meeting Sir Geoffroi tried to avoid a great bloodshed by proposing a smaller battle where 100 knights on each side would do battle with each other and the outcome would decide the battle. Chandos writes that Charny was trying to find an honorable solution to avoid a great many more deaths. The Black Prince refused that offer. Charny’s predictions turned out to be true and indeed a great many nobles on both sides lost their life that day, including de Charny himself.\n\nCharny died at the Battle of Poitiers while protecting the King.\n\nHistorical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man (represented in the Pilgrim Badge shown here) existed in the small town of Lirey in France around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of Geoffroi de Charny. The cloth itself is controversial. Some believe it is a fake, while others believe the shroud to be the true burial cloth of Jesus Christ.\n", "id": "419386", "title": "Geoffroi de Charny"}

In this way it is different from a plow, which cuts deeper into the soil. A plow also lifts up the soil and tips it over, but a harrow works mostly by cutting into the soil and breaking it up. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough surface left by plowing. \n\nThe purpose of this harrowing is generally to break up clods (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is good for planting seeds. It may also be used to remove weeds and to cover up seed after sowing. \n\nHarrows differ from cultivators in that they disturb the whole surface of the soil, instead of disturbing only narrow trails that avoid crop rows (to kill weeds).\n\nThere are four general types of harrows: disc harrow, tine harrow, chain harrow and chain disk harrows. Harrows were originally pulled by draft animals, such as horses, mules, or oxen, or in some times and places by people. In modern practice they are almost always pulled by tractors, either from a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.\n\nHarrows may be of several types and weights, depending on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and chain harrows are often only supported by a bar at the front of the set.\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on the type of soil and the crop being planted, one or more types of harrows may be used to get the soil ready for planting. If the soil is very light so that it might easily be wind-blown, a roller can be used at the end to settle it.\n\nA \"drag\" is a name for a heavy harrow, often a chain type.\n", "id": "419418", "title": "Harrow (tool)"}

They reportedly killed three kings, Coinmail, Condidan, and Farinmail. Ceawlin and Cuthwine captured Gloucester, Cirencester and Bath. West Saxons then colonized the lower Severn valley.

The university's football team are the Fighting Irish. The stadium is located on the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana, just north of the city of South Bend. It was opened in 1930. The stadium can seat over 80,000 people.\n\nThe stadium opened in 1930. It replaced the old stadium Cartier Field. It cost more than US$750,000 to build. The head coach of the Fighting Irish, Knute Rockne, played an important role in the design of the stadium. The design was based on Michigan Stadium. The stadium originally held 54,000 people. It measured a half-mile (0.8 kilometres) in circumference and stood high. It was built by the Sollitt Construction Company of South Bend. They began building in April 1930, and took six months to build. The Irish played their first game in the new stadium on 4 October 1930. They beat the SMU Mustangs 20–14. The official dedication was on October 11 against Navy.\n\nOver the years, the stadium's seating capacity was gradually increased to 59,075. This was mainly done by making most of the seats smaller. In 1997, 21,000 new seats were added to the stadium, bringing the seating capacity to the present 80,795. Permanent lights were also installed. The lights were paid for by NBC, which has held the exclusive television rights to all home games since 1991.\n\nThe playing surface was natural grass throughout the stadium's history until FieldTurf, an advanced artificial surface, was installed before the 2014 football season.\n\nThe stadium is known for its view of \"Touchdown Jesus\" (actually titled \"The Word of Life\"), a large mural of the resurrected Jesus. The mural is painted on the southern exterior wall of the Hesburgh Library. It is high and wide. It can be seen over the northern end zone of the stadium.

Singapore’s original tropical primary rainforest ecosystem makes up half of the reserve. At the summit of the hill, there is a rock showing the height, latitude and longtitude.\n\nBTNR is located just beside the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, separated by the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE). BTNR the only remaining primary forest in Singapore, and covers a total area of 163 hectares, occupying just 0.2% of Singapore's land.\n\nBTNR is easily accessible from Dairy Farm Nature Park, as well as the MacRitchie Reservoir in the neighbouring Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Dairy Farm Nature Reserve is connected to the Yellow Trail via the Dairy Farm Loop, while the MacRitchie Reservoir is connected to BTNR by the Kampong Trail.\n\nIn 1825, one of Singapore's first colonial administrators, John Crawfurd, climbed the hill. He commented that the surrounding forest was so dense that sailing to Calcutta was almost as easy as reaching Bukit Timah. In 1843, the access road to the summit was built. 40 years later, BTNR became the first forest reserve in Singapore to be conserved. The reserve has been protected by law since 1939, when the reserve was threatened by nearby granite quarrying at Hindhede Quarry. Till the late 1980s, BTNR was still part of the CCNR. Then, the government decided to build the BKE through the CCNR, thus splitting the CCNR and forming the BTNR. In 1991, the newly formed NParks, which manage Singapore's parks, nature reserves, and roadside trees, conducted a visitor survey. After gathering all the feedback, they began to develop facilities to improve visitors' experience at the reserve. and at the same time, reduce the damage that visitors might cause to the reserve. Over time, trails started to penetrate parts of the forest which were richer in biodiversity, causing plant and animal numbers to decrease. The ground surface was also damaged and soil erosion occurred. As a result, those trails were closed, and the main trails were upgraded.\n\nDuring the 2 decades that followed the separation of BTNR from CCNR, nature lovers lamented about the separation of biodiversity in the BTNR and CCNR. They said that animals from each nature reserve could not cross over to the other reserve, and wanted a link to connect the two reserves, so as to allow animals to move about from one reserve to the other. In 2005, some nature lovers and government authorities agreed to build a bridge to link the two reserves. The location to build the bridge was confirmed after some debates and feasibility studies, and issues like design, budget, effectiveness, and environmental impact were studied and solved. Work to build the Eco Link began on 30 July 2011 and was completed in the 3rd quarter of 2013. Trees to create a natural environment were planted on the bridge after it was completed.\n\nBeing home to more than 840 flowering plants and 500 species of animals, it contains 40% of Singapore's flora and fauna. A common tree there is the Seraya (\"Shorea curtisii\"), which dominates the forest canopy of BTNR. Rare plants such as the Mock Durian (\"Neesia synandra\") can also be found there. The Mock Durian, as its name mentions, produces fruit that look like durians, but they are inedible. Forest Praying Mantis and the Singapore Freshwater Crab are some of the rare animals found there. Pangolins, Horsfield's Flying Squirrel, Plaintain Squirrel, Malayan Colugo, also known as the Malayan Flying Lemur, as well as the Giant Forest Ant all live at BTNR. There are also many Long-tailed Macaques, which is the most common monkey in Singapore. Other than that, BTNR also has rich bird and insect life. Cicadas can be heard everywhere. Many species of birds and butterflies can also be spotted there. However, the birds, like the cicada, are more often heard than seen. Some of the birds spotted there are the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo, Asian Fairy Bluebird, Red-crowned Barbet and Emerald Dove. In March 2011, a Dot-Dash Sergeant (\"Athyma kanwa\"), which is a rare butterfly in Singapore, was spotted along the Red Trail. Some of the other butterflies spotted there include the Common Faun (\"Faunis canens\"), Common Caerulean (\"Jamides celeno\") etc. One species of monkey, the crab-eating macaque is common in the park.\n\nBTNR consists of 4 trails, namely the Red Trail, Blue Trail, Green Trail and Yellow Trail. The starting point of all the trails is the same, and at 40m above sea level. There are poles lining the various trails, with the colours of the trail(s) pasted on them.\n\nThe Red Trail is the main trail that brings people from the foot of the hill to the summit. To get to the rest of the trails, one has to walk up a part of the Red Trail first. The Green and Yellow Trails are basically detours into the forest, as they will still lead back to the Red Trail when reaching the summit. The 1.2km-long Red Trail, which is made of tarmac, is the one of the two easiest trails to climb. A trip up to the summit takes about 30 minutes while a return trip takes about 25 minutes.\n\nThe Blue Trail is the shortest of all trails, and is the second of two easiest trails to climb. The 0.7km-long Blue Trail starts off on the Red Trail itself, before breaking away halfway to lead to the Hindhede Quarry, at a height of 140m. An ascending trip takes about 20 minutes while a trip back to the foot of the hill takes about 18 minutes.\n\nThe Green Trail is 1.1km long. An ascend takes 30 minutes while a descend takes 25 minutes.\n\nThe Yellow Trail is the toughest of all trails. It surrounds the Jungle Fall Valley. Hikers start by walking up the Red Trail, then walking into the forest. The Yellow Trail cuts into the Jungle Fall Path in the dense forest near the summit, at a height of 150m, and hikers have to descend and ascend many steps along the way. Generally, the trail descends sharply until reaching the Singapore Quarry, before ascending sharply again. When it reaches the Singapore Quarry, it is only 100-110m above sea level. After that, the trail ascends until it joins back the Red Trail. By then, it is almost reaching the summit already. The trail is 1.8km long, and a summit-bound hike takes about 1 hour 10 minutes to 2 hours, while a return trip takes at least 55 minutes or more.\n\nOther than the 4 main trails, there are also other trails that are not part of the main trails. There are a few of this \"paths\".\n\nBTNR is a popular place for many Singaporeans. Everyday, many people go there to jog, hike, or for a stroll. There is also a 6km long Mountain Biking Trail for mountain bikers to cycle. The mountain biking trail goes around the reserve, going along the green corridor where the old KTM trains used to pass by, then passing by the Singapore Quarry, followed by Dairy Farm Nature Park and the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE), then near Rifle Range Road before back to the carpark where the trail starts.\n\nBTNR is the second ASEAN Heritage Park in Singapore, after Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. BTNR was granted this status on 18 October 2011.\n\nBy the 1990s, Singaporeans had started to get interested in nature. Visitor numbers have rose sharply since then, with 88,000 visitors in 1990, and 400,000 just 8 years later.\n", "id": "419661", "title": "Bukit Timah Nature Reserve"}

Cenwalh, the king, was impressed by his background he offered Agilbert the of Dorchester. This was the seat originally given to Bishop Birinus who founded a church at Dorchester on Thames. Birinus had died in 650 and Cenwalh was looking for a replacement. But after some time Cenwalh grew tired of not being able to understand the bishop, who apparently did not speak the Anglo-Saxon language. Cenwalh created a new diocese at Winchester in 660 and made Wine the first bishop. Agribert took offense at not being consulted and left his see.\n\nAgilbert did not leave England immediately but visited Northumbria. \nA controversy had occurred in the Northumbrian church over the date of Easter. The king Oswiu of Northumbria and his son Eahlfrith each backed a different church position. Why Agilbert came to Northumbria at this time or who sent him is not recorded. But kings Osiwu and Cenwalh were friends. They both supported the Roman position that Easter should be celebrated the same throughout the Christian world. A synod was called at Whitby to settle the issue. Bishop Agilbert was the senior there who supported the Roman position. As he did not speak the language well, he asked Wilfrid to speak for him. Their argument was why did only the remote parts of Britain celebrate Easter differently than the remainder of the Christian world? Osiwu made a decision to celebrate Easter with the rest of the Christian churches.\n\nAgilbert wandered in Gaul (later France) for a time before accepting the position of Bishop of Paris.

These help drivers to navigate their way between places in the state. Each route is given its own route number. The number consists of a letter] (M, A or B) and a one- or two-digit number. \"M\" routes are motorways, \"A\" routes are national routes, and \"B\" routes are state routes. The route system includes highways, motorways, and other important roads that have not been declared highways.\n\nRoute numbers have been allocated to roads in New South Wales since 1955. To supplement the national route number system, three \"ring roads\" were built in Sydney in 1964. These were numbered 1, 3 and 5. In 1973, a system of numbering freeways was introduced to New South Wales to complement the national routes and ring roads. In 1974, the National Highway network was defined, which in New South Wales included the Hume Highway, Federal Highway, Barton Highway, Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway) and New England Highway. In 1993, Sydney's Metroad system was introduced.\n\nIn 2013, the state replaced its entire system of State Routes, National Routes, National Highways and Metroads with a new route numbering system of letters and numbers.

This causes an increase an increase in the number of CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of \"FMR1\". \n\nIn unaffected individuals, the \"FMR1\" gene contains 5–44 repeats of the CGG codon, most commonly 29 or 30 repeats. Between 45 and 54 repeats is considered a \"grey zone\". Between 55 and 200 repeats in length is described as a premutation allele. Individuals with fragile X syndrome have a full mutation of the \"FMR1\" allele, with over 200 repeats of the CGG codon. \n\nIn these individuals with a repeat expansion greater than 200, there is methylation of the CGG repeat expansion and \"FMR1\" promoter.

The property of reducing friction is known as \"lubricity\" (slipperiness).\n\nA good lubricant possesses the following characteristics:\n\n\nThe most often used lubricant is motor oil, which is used in engines of cars and motorcycles.\n\nSometimes, chemicals are added to normal oil to give it special properties. A lubricant, like motor oil, can also help in reducing heat. Simply put, cooling depends on surface area in contact. So, if something normally has a small surface area, you can put that thing into a bigger pot, and put oil in the pot. This way, oil comes in contact with small surface area of the small object, and transfers that heat to the big surface area of the big vessel. As a rule, liquids can transfer heat better than gases.\n\nIn manufacturing, sometimes oil is used to cool the item being made. This also helps in removing metal that was just chipped off. This chipped-off metal normally flows with the oil until it is filtered. Then the oil is reused. The filtered metal chips are normally scrapped.\n\nSometimes, lubricants are used for hydraulic machines.

He was prince between 1401 and 1416. He started the Welsh Revolt against Henry IV of England's rule of Wales. In the late 19th century the Young Wales (Cymru Fydd) movement decided that he was the father of Welsh nationalism. Since then he has been seen as a hero by the Welsh. There is a university in Wales that is called Glyndŵr University after him.\n\nGlyndŵr was born into an Anglo-Welsh family in about 1355. His family were reasonably rich and had large properties in the north east of Wales. He was educated in England, and later joined the English army. He took part in an attack on Scotland, and then later went back to Wales. After Richard II was overthrown by Henry IV there was a period of confusion, and Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn took the opportunity to take some of Glyndŵr's lands. Grey was a supporter of Henry IV, while Glyndŵr had supported Richard II.\n\nGlyndŵr sought help from Henry IV to deal with his land being taken, but Henry refused to take action against his supporters. Glyndŵr also failed to supply soldiers to the king for another attack on Scotland. Grey called him a traitor. Glyndŵr decided to take action against Henry IV. He gave himself the title of Prince of Wales in September 1400, and began a series of attacks against Grey and towns along the borders with England. Henry IV sent his army to Wales to fight Glyndŵr and regain control, but it had the opposite effect. It became a widespread rebellion against England.\n\nIn April 1401 Glyndŵr's army captured Conwy Castle. The next year, at the Battle of Bryn Glas, also known as the Battle of Pillethl, Glyndŵr defeated the English army, and captured its leader, Edmund Mortimer. By 1404 a French army had landed, and together with the Welsh army they attacked Worcester.\n\nBy 1408 the English forces were able to defeat the Welsh, and support for the rebellion collapsed. Glyndŵr still kept up attacks and raids on the English, but this was more of a guerrilla campaign than a full scale revolt. The last mention of Glyndŵr is when the English offered terms if he surrendered in 1416. It is believed that he was already dead.\n\nOwain married Margaret Hanmer (). Her father was Sir David Hanmer. Margaret had five sons and four daughters with Owain. These children were:\n\n\nAll of Owain's sons either died while fighting in war, taken prisoner and died as prisoners, or died with no children of their own. Owain also had children from other women who were not his wife. They were named: David, Gwenllian, Ieuan, and Myfanwy.\n\nAfter Owain died, most people did not care if the English people ruled the country anymore. During the time of the Tudor's, men from Wales, called Welshmen, started to become more famous in English society.\n\nMany people forgot about how important Owain was until the 1800's, when people started to celebrate his life. The \"Young Wales\" group made him the symbol of Welsh nationalism. Things that were owned by Owain were found in the National Library of France during this time period. They found his \"Great Seal\" and letters he had written to French people. A statue of him was made and put at Cardiff City Hall during World War I. Postcards were sold Owain on them. The postcards were sold to make money to help soldiers who were injured in war. \n\nIn 1808, the Royal Navy named a Fifth-rate frigate after Owain. It was called the HMS \"Owen Glendower\". The boat served in the Gunboat War. It helped take over island of Anholt. During the years 1822 and 1824, the boat was in the West Africa Squadron, where it chased slave ships. It captured two ships. \n\nNationally, Owain is as famous as King Arthur. Organizations use his name and drawings of him as their symbols to celebrate Wales as a country and Welsh culture. In the 1980s, a group of people called \"Meibion Glyndŵr\" burned down vacation homes owned by English people. They used Owain as their logo. In the year 2000, parties were held across Wales to celebrate the 600th anniversary of Owain's revolt. In 1974 and 2008, stamps were made with Owain on them. There is an award that is given every year for arts and writing called the Glyndŵr Award. The band Manic Street Preachers wrote a song about Owain in 2007 called \"1404\". There are many statues throughout Wales of Owain. \n\nThere is a building at the University of Cape Town, called Glendower Residence, that is named after Owain.

It existed from the 9th century to the 11th century. For most of its history, it was independent in practice, but officially under the suzerainty of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires.\n\nCapua was originally a gastaldate within the Principality of Benevento, and then a county within the Principality of Salerno. The rulers of Capua were Lombards until 1058, when it was conquered by Normans.\n\nOld Capua was an ancient Etruscan city. It was the one of the most important cities in southern Italy during the Roman Empire. When the Lombards invaded Italy in the second half of the 6th century, Capua was sacked. Later, it was made a part of the Duchy of Benevento, and ruled by a Lombard official with the title of \"gastald\". Little is known of this part of its history.\nCapua first became a state of its own under Landulf I. In 839, the duke of Benevento, Sicard, was killed by Radelchis, who took the throne for himself. This caused a civil war that divided the country. Sicard's brother Siconulf declared Salerno independent and himself prince of Salerno. Landulf and his sons had also been allies to Sicard, so the gastald declared Capua independent too. In 841, Capua was sacked and completely destroyed by mercenaries hired by Radelchis. In early 849, Landulf's eldest son Lando I asked the Holy Roman Emperor to settle the dispute and end the war. The emperor divided Benevento and Salerno into two separate principalities. Capua was made a county of the Principality of Salerno. Since Old Capua had been destroyed, Lando I had a new city built around a nearby fort in 856. This new city was the Capua that still exists today.\n\nLando did not submit to Siconulf or Salerno for very long. Capua was invaded by Salerno and Naples in 859, but defeated them. Pando (ruled 861–862) declared Capua independent of Salerno in 862. On his death in the same year, a dispute arose over who should be the next count. Pando's son Pandenulf was deposed by his uncle Landulf II. Landulf was also the bishop of Capua, so he governed both politics and religion in the county. When he died in 879, a civil war started over the throne. The two claimants were Pandenulf, the previous count who had been deposed, and Lando III, another grandson of Landulf I. Salerno allied with Lando III and Benevento with Pandenulf. They both ruled in different parts of the county, and they both made their sons Bishop of Capua. Pandenulf successfully held the throne in Capua during the civil war, until Lando III captured the city in 882.\n\nLando III and his brother Landenulf I spent their reigns defending Capua against Naples. Their other brother, Atenulf, had joined with Naples against them. By early January 887, Atenulf established himself as the Prince of Capua. He then turned his attention to conquering Benevento.\n\nIn 899, Atenulf I defeated Radelchis II and conquered Benevento. He was proclaimed Prince of Benevento in January 900. He united the principalities of Capua and Benevento and declared them to be inseparable. He also introduced a diarchy-style system for the throne. Under this system, the sons and brothers of the prince would have equal status, and would rule alongside the prince. By doing this, Atenulf hoped to prevent future disputes over succession.\n\nAtenulf made his son, Landulf III, co-prince. Together they made alliances with the local Greek states, such as Naples and Gaeta. After Atenulf died, Landulf mostly continued the policies of his father. He is best known for his involvement at the Battle of Garigliano, in which the Fatimid Saracens were defeated. He spent most of his reign after Garigliano trying to weaken the Byzantine authority in Apulia and the Campania. His son, Landulf IV, allied against Salerno. Like his father, he attacked Byzantine territories, but was defeated. Capua was forced to become a vassal of the Byzantine Empire, at least officially.\n\nUnder Landulf IV's sons, the union of Capua and Benevento broke down. Although they remained united by law, Pandulf ruled in Capua and Landulf V ruled in Benevento. However, all of the Lombard states in Italy were eventually unified under Pandulf, who was called \"Ironhead\". The Emperor Otto I gave the Duchy of Spoleto and Camerino to Pandulf in 967. When Landulf V died in 969, Pandulf seized Benevento from his nephew, Pandulf II. He then became Prince of Salerno in 978, when the reigning prince died without any children. Before Pandulf died, he split the country between his sons; Benevento–Capua was given to his eldest son, Landulf VI.\n\nSoon, Benevento and Capua were divided by the Emperor Otto I. Landulf VI kept Capua, while Benevento was given back to his cousin, Landulf V's son Pandulf II. In the 990s, Capua experienced a period of instability. Landenulf II was murdered by his brother Laidulf, who took the throne for himself. When the Emperor Otto III found out, he had Laidulf removed. His replacement was then overthrown by the citizens of Capua. The old dynasty was reinstalled in 1000 under Landulf VII, the second son of Landulf V. He made his brother, Pandulf II of Benevento, regent for his son and heir. Pandulf reigned alongside his nephew as Pandulf III of Capua. Thus, Capua and Benevento were briefly united for the last time.\n\nCapua regained some of its earlier power under Pandulf IV. He was deposed twice between his succession in 1016 and his death in 1050. He was originally an ally of the Byzantines and remained allied with them against all his neighbours until the end. He was constantly in dispute with the church, and with the coastal duchies of Naples, Gaeta and Amalfi. For all this, he was nicknamed the \"Wolf of the Abruzzi\". He wanted to give Capua a seaport. He deposed the dukes of Naples and Gaeta, and went to war against Guaimar IV, the Prince of Salerno. The Emperor Henry II had him removed and imprisoned, but he eventually won back his throne.\n\nThe city became less important under Pandulf's successors. It was eventually taken by the Norman allies of Guaimar IV.\n\nThe Norman count Richard of Aversa conquered Capua in 1058. He left the city itself in the control of Landulf VIII for another four years, until 12 May 1062. Richard became an ally of the Popes, but was later excommunicated. His son and successor, Jordan I, captured an area of Papal territory for the principality. He was also excommunicated. When Richard died, his family was very powerful, with strong influence over central Italy.\nWhen Jordan I died in 1091, the Capua's power declined quickly. From 1091 to 1098, the city of Capua itself was controlled by Lando IV. Lando was a Lombard who was put on the throne by the citizens in opposition to the young Richard II. Richard II was only reinstalled with the help of his fellow Normans from Sicily and Apulia. Capua became dependent on Sicily. The princes continued to try and influence papal elections and act as papal protectors. When Jordan II died in 1127, the principality became a target for Roger II of Sicily, who had united Sicily, Apulia and Calabria. For 20 years from 1135 to 1155, Capua and Sicily were at war with each other until Capua was finally annexed into the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nBelow are listed the rulers of Capua from 840 to 1172.\n\n\nThe gastalds (or counts) of Capua were originally vassals of the Dukes of Benevento. In the early 840s, Gastald Landulf I declared independence from Benevento after Salerno had done the same. That caused a civil war in Benevento, which lasted for more than 10 years. At the end of it, Capua was made a vassal of Salerno by the Holy Roman Emperor Louis II. However, this did not last, and by the end of the 9th century Capua was effectively independent.\n\n\nIn 899, the principalities of Benevento and Capua were united by Atenulf I. Until 982, all of the rulers below were Prince of both Capua and Benevento. Atenulf also developed a new system for the throne where fathers would rule with their sons or brothers.\n\n\nIn 982, the principalities were finally separated by Pandulf Ironhead and the Emperor Otto I.\n\n\nThese princes were of the Drengot line.\n\n\n\n", "id": "419905", "title": "Principality of Capua"}

It was fought between the German Empire on one side, and the French and British on the other. The battle ended with a tactical retreat of the German army. It was one of the first signs that the Schlieffen Plan did not work. The battle cost the lives of over one million French and British soldiers. It also cost the lives of over 750,000 soldiers on the German side. The battle was fought from 5 - 12 September 1914. The battle marked the end of the German advance into France. It marked the beginning of trench warfare that World War I became famous for. \n\nThe Schlieffen Plan called for an attack through Belgium. The Germans were to avoid the main French fortifications, on the German frontier. They invaded Belgium on August 3rd 1914. The Germans pushed through the Belgium army with little difficulty. After destroying the main fortifications in Liege and Namur, the German First Army and Second Army under the command of Alexander von Kluck and Karl von Bülow, moved toward Paris. At the Battle of Mons the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) halted the German forces temporarily. They inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. But the French army and the BEF finally retreated towards the River Marne where they waited for the Germans. With no real opposition the Germans moved as quickly as possible and prepared to face the French and British at the Marne River. \n\nThis was first major battle of what would become the Western Front. The Germans moved to within of Paris. The French government fled the capital for the safety of Bordeaux. The Germans were so close that they could fire their massive railway guns (massive cannons mounted on railroad cars) right into Paris.\n\nDuring the battle there was not any way to move French troops fast enough to the front. But there was a solution. General Gallieni called for every taxi and driver to report for duty. Paris had about 10,000 taxis but because of the war only had about 7,000 drivers. Gallieni's plan was to move the troops by taxi, which at the time was a very new invention. The taxis moved through the night and day to carry soldiers. The drivers received 0.20 francs (₣) per kilometer. But by September 8, the taxis had only brought about 5,000 soldier from Paris. In a battle with over a million men, 5,000 could not make a great difference. Also, most of the soldiers that came by taxi were held in reserve. \n\nThe German Second Army led by Bülow decided to move south to destroy the French Fifth Army. General Von Kluck did not know about this so he continued to move up and engage the French. With this movement a large gap was created between the two German armies. The British and French counterattacked into the gap and by September 10 the Germans retreated. Paris was saved. \n\nThe Germans retreated forty miles from the Marne. Since their plan had failed they did not know what to do. They had not been trained in trench warfare but their only recourse was to dig in and wait for the allies. Eventually the trenches they dug reached 300 miles in length.\n\n", "id": "419948", "title": "First Battle of the Marne"}

After completing primary school in 1947, self-taught, he began playing the clarinet. In 1950 he came to Belgrade, where he started studying the English language at the Faculty of Philology. At the same time, he worked at the National Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade, which was then led by the famous Vlastimir Pavlović Carevac. Since that year, he has launched into a successful music career. The same 1950 he passed I preparatory class at the School of Music Josip Slavenski in Belgrade, under professor Franjo Partlić, and automatically entered the second grade. He became a member of the sextet Duško Radetić in Radio Belgrade from its founding in 1951.\n\nIn 1951 music editor of Radio Belgrade, Djordje Karaklajić, formed the Great National Orchestra RTB and was its principal conductor. He arranged the Yugoslav folk melodies in a serious way. The Orchestra was also conducted by Dušan Skovran, a rector of the Music Academy in Belgrade, and Djura Jakšić, a headmaster of the Music School \"Slavenski\" in Belgrade. Božidar Milošević regularly performed in this Orchestra.\nFrom 1952 to 1956 he continued musical education in the High Music School Slavenski under the mentorship of professor Franjo Partlić. During the period of 1955–1958, he used to play in the String Orchestra RTB under the direction of Ilija Genić – Baćka.\n\nAfter the death of Carevac in 1956, the violinist Rade Jašarević Rade Jašarević was appointed as the new head of the National Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade. Božidar Boki Milošević was still playing in the Orchestra as a soloist on the clarinet.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1960 he studied at the Music Academy in Belgrade with the first generation of clarinetists (Ernest Ačkun, Mihailo Živanović, Milenko Stefanovic and Božidar Milošević) in the class of the renowned professor Bruno Brun. Then, under the mentorship of professor Bruno Brun, entered postgraduate studies (1960–1963). From 1960 to 1966 he was engaged in teaching, working as a professor of clarinet at the Music School \"Slavenski\" which was a part of the Music Academy in Belgrade. In 1966 he moved to Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra and became its member and soloist.\nAfter the death of the violinist Rade Jašareviđ in a car accident, Bozidar Milošević had become 1976 the head of the famous National Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade and worked there until his retirement in 1980. He had been an instrumental soloist of the orchestra for 30 years.\n\nAs a soloist performer, he had tours and concerts all over the world. In the 1950s in Israel, London, Vienna, Berlin, across the United States, Colombia, Guatemala, Canada, Mexico and ... Touring the Soviet Union in 1971, he visited more than half of the Soviet Union. There he composed his first composition Vlaska storm.\n\nWith the sextet Duško Radetić, the Orchestra of Radio Television Belgrade, the Grand National Orchestra RTB and others, he made many lasting and valuable recordings of the Yugoslav national heritage.\n\nAs an instrumental soloist, he made countless shows in radio and television programs in many European countries as well as in the New York NBC television. Here, in the country, in addition to regular appearances, his two special TV shows in which he presented himself as a complete musician performing at a high level classical, jazz, evergreen, and folk music are still remembered.\nHe has made a lot of records and CDs, mostly for record label PGP RTB.\n\nBoth domestic and foreign music critics gave very high ratings and opinions about Milosevic's music-making.\nBy all means, with his genuine skilful work, great talent, originality of ideas and distinctive-original style of playing the clarinet, Božidar Milošević is a longtime active participant in the development of folk music and setting of its standards, criteria, and evaluation. He is a part of the Serbian and Yugoslav folk music and folklore, whose musical tradition he spread to all five continents making sure to preserve its originality and authenticity.\n\nHe is a role model and measure of value for many young generations of clarinetist.

These isotopes form naturally in nature. Protium and deuterium are stable. Tritium is radioactive and has a half-life of about 12 years. Scientists have created four other hydrogen isotopes (H to H), but these isotopes are very unstable and do not exist naturally.\n\nThe main isotopes of hydrogen are unique because they are the only isotopes that has a name. These names are still in use today. Deuterium and tritium sometimes get their own symbols, D and T. However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry does not like these names very much, even though they are often used. There are other isotopes that had their own names when scientists studied radioactivity. But, their names are no longer used today.\n\nProtium is the most common isotope of hydrogen. It makes up more than 99.98% of all the hydrogen in the universe. It is named \"protium\" because its nucleus only has one proton. Protium has an atomic mass of 1.00782504(7) u. The symbol for protium is H.\n\nThe proton of protium never decayed. So, scientists believe that protium is a stable isotope. New theories of particle physics predict that a proton can decay, but this decay is very slow. Proton is said to have a half-life of 10 years. If proton decay is true, then all other nuclei that are said to be stable are actually only \"observationally stable\", i.e. they look like they are stable. Until this day, experiments had shown that if proton decay happens, it would have a half-life of 6.6 × 10 years.\n\nDeuterium, or H or sometimes D, is another stable isotope of hydrogen. The isotope has one proton and one neutron. It makes up about 0.0026 – 0.0184% of all atoms of hydrogen on Earth. Deuterium is less in hydrogen gas on Earth and is more in sea water (0.015% or 150 ppm). Deuterium is not radioactive, and it will not harm living things. Deuterium can also form water molecules. Water that has deuterium instead of protium is named heavy water.\n\nTritium (H) is the most stable radioisotope of hydrogen. That is, of all radioactive isotopes of hydrogen, tritium is the least radioactive. It has a proton and 2 neutrons in its nucleus. Tritium decays through beta minus decay and changes to helium-3. It has a half-life of 12.32 years.\n\nTritium is formed naturally by the interaction between the gases in the upper atmosphere and cosmic rays. It is also created during nuclear weapons tests. Tritium and deuterium is used in D-T nuclear fusion in stars to give out a lot of energy.\n", "id": "419989", "title": "Isotopes of hydrogen"}

It lived in what is now China. \"Aurornis xui\" may be the most basal (\"primitive\") bird species known to date. Aurornis was discovered in 2013. The animal may predate the famous \"Archaeopteryx lithographica\", the earliest bird, by about 10 million years.\n\n\"Aurornis\" was described from a sedimentary rock fossil in 2013. The fossil was purchased from a local dealer who said it had been unearthed in Yaoluguo in western Liaoning, China. At first, analysis confirmed it came from the Tiaojishan Formation, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. The fossil features traces of downy feathers along the animal's tail, chest, and neck. It was only partly prepared at the time of purchase; the feathers were not showing, and the fossil bore no signs of forgery. \n\nOn 7th June 2013 Science (journal) said that Pascal Godefroit, the paleontologist who led the team that described \"Aurornis\", is uncertain if the fossil material came from Liaoning province's 160-million-year-old Tiaojishan Formation as claimed by the fossil dealer. It may be from the province's 125-million-year-old Yixian Formation, which is known to have produced several ancient bird fossils. The failure to secure rigorous provenance casts doubt on the claim that \"Aurornis\" is 160 million years old and predates \"Archaeopteryx\". Godefroit's team will try to confirm the specimen's age by mineralogical and botanical analysis on the shale slab. \n\n\"Aurornis\" was roughly the size of a modern pheasant – in length from beak to tail tip. It had claws and a long tail. Its leg bones are similar to those of \"Archaeopteryx\", but overall its bone structure is more primitive. The absence of larger feathers suggests \"A. xui\" was unable to fly. If \"Aurornis\" lived roughly 160 million years ago, this is about ten million years before \"Archaeopteryx\", which often has been described as the first bird.\n\nA phylogenetic analysis of \"Aurornis\" published in 2013 found that it belongs in the bird lineage, in a more basal position than \"Archaeopteryx\". The analysis was based on \"almost 1,500 [anatomical] characteristics.\"\n\nThe classification of \"A. xui\" as a bird is somewhat contentious, however, due to the various differing definitions of the word \"bird\". Recent discoveries \"[emphasize] how grey the dividing line is between birds and [non-avian] dinosaurs\", says Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, in London. \"There's such a gradation in features between them that it's very difficult to tell them apart ... [\"Aurornis xui\"] is certainly an older member of the bird lineage than \"Archaeopteryx\", and it's fair to call it a very primitive bird.

In medical terms, it is called a paracusia. A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking. This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania. It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.\n\nPeople may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.\n\nThere are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity. \n\nThe main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur.\n\n\n", "id": "420252", "title": "Auditory hallucination"}

Satellite images from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about 239 cubic kilometres (57.3 cubic miles) each year. If all of it melted, it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2 metres. The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very quickly. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet.\n", "id": "420596", "title": "Ice sheet"}

He is thought to have been the first to land on Antarctica. He is one of four explorers who share this claim. In February 1821 he may have landed a boat at Hughes Bay. The Davis Strait which separates Baffin Bay from the Labrador Sea was named by William Baffin in 1916. He probably named it after John Davis. \n\nOn March 20, 1820, Davis left New Haven, Connecticut for a trip to the Pacific Ocean. He had received news of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands while he was anchored at the Falkland Islands. Learning there were large numbers of seals there, he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to Greenwich Island. But it was too late in the season and other were there before them. So Davis took his ship, named \"Cecilia\", in search of seals further south. Finding many seals at Low Island he continued southwards. He probably came upon Hughes Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula. His ship's log records he found \"a large body of land.\" He sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none. He also wrote \"I think this southern land to be a continent\". He also wrote in the log the latitude was 64°01'S (sixty-four degrees, one minute, south). Davis continued his journey back to Greenwich Island arriving there on 10 February, 1821. He wintered at the Falkland Islands and returned to seal hunting the following season. It remains impossible, however, to prove he was the first to reach Antarctica.\n", "id": "420601", "title": "John Davis (sealer)"}

He was Regent of England for a time during the childhood of Edward III. In his day he may have been one of the most important persons in the monarchy next to the Royal family itself. He was noted for his superior combat skills, his continuing loyalty to his Kings and his great ability in diplomacy. Marshal began his life as a “landless” knight to become the Earl of Pembroke and one of the wealthiest men in the country.\n\nShortly after his death in 1219, his oldest son, William Marshal II, commissioned a biography of the life of his father. Though biographers often embellish their subjects, many of the events of William's life stated there are clearly recorded elsewhere in historical records. \n\nWilliam Marshal’s father, was John Marshal, called John the Marshal. He was the Lord of Newbury Castle located in County Berkshire in England. When William was a young boy, there was a fierce civil war in England between King Stephen, grandson of William I, also called William the Conqueror and Henry I's daughter, Empress Matilda. When William I died, both Stephen and Matilda believed they were the true successor to the Crown. This period in history was known as the time of The Anarchy because there was much lawlessness and violence in the Kingdom. Many barons and Earls would \"change sides\" when it benefited them to do so and John Marshal was no exception. At first he pledged his fealty or loyalty to King Stephen but later changed it to Empress Matilda. This act helped to turn the tide in the civil war. \n\nAt an early age, William was sent to William de Tancarville to learn the skills of knighthood. He was knighted in 1166. He then crossed the channel to Normandy and went to serve under his uncle, Patrick, the Earl of Salisbury. He fought in Ponthieu in 1168 when greatly outnumbered, his uncle was killed and William was taken prisoner. Marshal's great skill and bravery was noticed and he was ransomed by Queen Eleanor of England. \nAs a young adult, Marshal went to many tournaments. These were contests and mock (imitation) wars where Knights competed for great prizes. Tournaments were an opportunity for a knight to acquire valuable possessions such as money, a horse, armor and weapons. They were dangerous and it was not unusual for a knight to be killed during a tournament.\n\nWilliam had become a very skilled knight and after his ramsom he became part of Henry II’s household, teaching men to fight. He became tutor, guardian, protector and friend to the son of Henry II, known historically as Henry the Young King. When young Henry was coronated, Marshal was assigned to serve him as captain of the guard and chief of the knights. It was Marshal who would knight the young King Henry. Marshal also accompanied young Henry on many tournaments. In 1173 young Henry argued with his father. He wanted to assume the throne of England even though his father was still alive. He left England and took his brother Richard with him to his mother's lands in Aquitaine. In 1174, Henry II and his son made peace. William continued on to win fame in tournaments. The young king became ill and died of a sudden disease at Martel on 11 June 1183.\n\nOn his deathbed young Henry ordered Marshal to go on Crusade on his behalf. With Henry II's permission, William went on Crusade for two years and his superior fighting skill was recognized by the Knights Templar. When he returned, Henry II at once took him into high favor, and made him a member of his household. Marshal then fought for Henry II against the French King Louis VII of France and in skirmishs against Henry's other sons now in rebellion.\n\nRichard (called Lionhearted) was Henry II’s second son and he also wanted to be King of England and did not want to wait until his father died. After a skirmish, Marshal came upon Richard and instead of killing him, killed his horse. Shortly thereafter, Henry II became ill and retreated to Chinon where he died in 1189.\n\nRichard did not forget Marshal’s act of bravery and loyalty and when he became King, he took Marshal to fight against the King of France. After a time, Richard decided to go on Crusade and left Marshal in England as the Justiciar of England who acted for the king in his absence and presided over the king's courts during his absence.\n\nRichard I reaffirmed his father's promise to William and gave him the heiress of the Earldom of Pembroke, Striguil and the lands that came with her as was promised to him by Henry II shortly before Henry's death. Marshal at once became one of the richest men in the Kingdom. He acquired property in four countries.\n\nMarshal fought valiantly for Richard against the King of France and was there when the peace treaty was made. In 1199 King Richard was wounded and died of his wounds. At that point there was another dispute about who would next be King of England, Arthur or John.\n\nGeoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, was another son of Henry II and would have been the next in line to be King but he died on either the 19 or 21 August 1186, at the age of 27. The more common version is that he was trampled to death in a jousting tournament. Geoffrey had a son Arthur I, who became the next Duke of Brittany. Arthur felt that he was also heir to the throne of England. Marshal believed that as a brother to King Richard, and in accordance with Norman custom, John, Geoffrey’s brother, should become the next King. It was resolved in John’s favor and he became the next King of England.\n\nWilliam fought alongside King John and after a time, John made William the Marshal of England.\nKing John was a man who was disliked by many of his barons and Earls. He knew this and distrusted them. When Marshal went over to protect his lands in Ireland the King made him give one of his sons as hostage to make sure that Marshal was not disloyal to him. King John sometimes took lands away from Marshal and at other times gave them back. There was strife all during the reign of King John but Marshal remained loyal to the King throughout.\n\nKing John died on 18 October, 1216. At that time his son, Henry III was too young to rule the kingdom. Marshal was appointed as Regent to Henry III to make decisions on Henry’s behalf until he came of age.\n\nMarshal was quite old by then but managed the affairs of Henry III as Regent and even fought in combat at the Battle of Lincoln. He was approximately 70 years of age. On 14 May 1219 Marshal died at Caversham.\n\nWhen he knew he was dying he took on the robe of a Knights Templar and after his death he was buried in the Temple Church in London. William Marshal’s effigy can still be seen at the Temple Church, London, with his son next to him.\n", "id": "421000", "title": "William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke"}

It is different from consanguinity (blood relationship). Affinity is the relationship which each party to a marriage has to the relatives of the other partner to the marriage. But affinity does not cover the marital relationship of the parties to the marriage themselves. \n\nUnder the law, such relatives by marriage are known as affines.

It may also be relevant in preventing some couples from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited varys from country to country, and from time to time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws. In earlier laws, affinity was used in the same degrees as consanguinity in prohibiting marriages.\n\nThough laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced. It does not always end with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage, \"affinity\" can sometimes also include kinship by adoption and step relationship.\n\n\n", "id": "421156", "title": "Affinity"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421157", "text": "Consanguinity\n\nConsanguinity (\"blood relation\", from the Latin \"consanguinitas\") means being of the same kinship as another person. Consanguinity also means being descended from the same ancestor as another person. The laws of many jurisdictions set up degrees of consanguinity when prohibiting sexual relations and marriage. Rules of Consanguinity are also used to determine heirs of an estate. These are according to laws that govern intestate succession. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nMost cultures have prohibited marriages between individuals who are closely related by blood (consanguinity). There were some exceptions. Brothers and sisters, as well as fathers and daughters, often married in ancient Egypt. These were primarily limited to the royal family from the earliest times. Some theories hold that it strengthened a King's claim to the throne. In biblical history, Abraham married his (half-)sister Sarah.\n\nMost early societies had rules or laws that limited consanguineous marriages. So the dangers of inbreeding must have been known to them. \n\nIn ancient Rome, marriage was governed by civil laws. Under Roman civil law couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. The Germanic peoples also had rules against such marriages but were not as strict. \n\nIn the 5th century, after the Roman empire collapsed, the church took over regulating marriage. At first they did not have a great deal of influence. The Church's power over marriage grew gradually. At first the Church followed Roman civil law. In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven. They also changed the method by which they were calculated. The nobility of Europe usually married from within their own social class. Eventually they became too interrelated to marry by the Church's rules. Many found it necessary to defy the Church. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council reduced the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four. The pope had the power to waive the rules for particular couples. Frequently, papal dispensations were given allowing closely related couples to marry. These were almost always reserved for the royalty and nobility. Sometimes the Church used consanguinity to block marriage as in the case of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. In 1049 Pope Leo IX refused to allow the marriage. He did not give a reason but the two were cousins. They married anyway. Ten years later, in 1059, Pope, Nicholas II finally granted a dispensation for their marriage. Despite restrictions and laws, up to the 20th century consanguineous marriages were not uncommon in Europe.\n\nThe degree of consanguinity can be illustrated with a consanguinity table. Each level of lineal consanguinity (\"i.e.\", generation or meiosis) appears as a row. Individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row. Consanguinity (blood relationship) is different from Affinity (relationship through marriage) but have been prohibited in the same degrees in the past.\n\n\n<br>\n", "id": "421157", "title": "Consanguinity"}

The book covers an area known as strategic bargaining, about how the United States could deal with the Soviet Union after World War II. It is thought to be one of the hundred books that have been most influential in the West since 1945. Many studies at the RAND Corporation and Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute were along similar lines. All these people knew each other and gave advice and seminars at the Pentagon and other U.S. government departments.\n\nSchelling's theories about war were extended in \"Arms and Influence\". The blurb states that it \"carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier \"The Strategy of Conflict\"... and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and diplomacy\". \n\nIn 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with what he called \"a general theory of tipping\". In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture \"up to some limit\", could lead to total segregation. This explained the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. \nOnce a cycle of such changes has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum.\n\nSchelling has been involved in the global warming debate since chairing a commission for President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He believes climate change poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States has been exaggerated. Drawing on his experience with the Marshall Plan after World War II, he has argued that addressing global warming is a bargaining problem; if the world is able to reduce emissions, poor countries will receive most of the benefits but rich countries will bear most of the costs.\n\n\n", "id": "421198", "title": "Thomas Schelling"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421199", "text": "Great Heathen Army\n\nThe Great Heathen Army, also called the Great Danish Army or The Great Viking Army, was a large force of Danish Vikings that attacked Anglo-Saxon England. This army appeared in East Anglia in 865. Unlike earlier Vikings who made brief raids on England, the Great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of England. \n\nThe first recorded Viking attack in England was in 793 at Lindisfarne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported \" the of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne.\" There were many reasons that Vikings began attacking England. The populations of Norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries. The Vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons. These young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship's crews to go on adventures. The beginning of trade between Europe and England had opened up great trading centers. Vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them. This was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected. \n\nThe peoples of Norway, Sweden and Denmark were different from each other. The first raiders from the north who set foot in England were from Norway. They sacked and killed monks at Lindisfarne and at Jarrow the following year. The Norwegian Vikings then established colonies in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They also settled in Ireland. The Vikings from Norway only came back to England in the 10th century and from their settlements in Ireland. The Swedes, called the Rus, were to later expand eastwards into Russia. In 835 there was a raid at the mouth of the River Thames by Danish Vikings. For the next thirty years these attacks on England continued. In 850 Canterbury and London were attacked by a Danish band led by Rorik. He was defeated and killed the next year by Athelwulf of Wessex. Only twice had a Danish army spent the winter in England: in 850 and 854.\n\nIn 865 the Danish Vikings changed their tactics. A large army made up of many smaller bands landed in East Anglia. For over a decade they remained in England destroying entire kingdoms as they went. The Danes spent the winter in East Anglia. The local people bought peace with the Vikings by supplying them with horses. After a year they moved northwards to Northumbria now a mounted army. They captured York and defeated two Northumbrian kings, Aella and Osbert, who joined forces to attack the Danes. Both kings were killed. In 867 they appointed a client-king named Ecgberht over the Northumbrians. In the fall of that year they moved south into Mercia. The Danes made their winter camp at Nottingham. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred for their help against the Danes. The Danes did not fight but allowed the Mercians to pay them for peace. \n\nThe Vikings later withdrew to York. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. After twelve months in York, the great army moved south again into East Anglia. Setting up winter quarters at Thetford they defeated King Edmund of East Anglia. Next, in the fall of 870 they moved to Reading. Athelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, Athelred died. At this point Wessex was the last remaining kingdom that hadn't been destroyed by the Vikings. Within a month, Alfred, who replaced his brother as king, was defeated at Wilton. There were nine more battles between the West Saxons and the Danes in the next year. Wessex finally paid the Vikings for peace which ended the fighting. Alfred remained on the throne. Of the two known leaders of the Danes, Ivar the Boneless disappeared from the records after 871. His brother Halfdan Ragnarsson was still the leader when the Danes withdrew from Wessex to winter in London the same year.\n\nIn 872 the Northumbrians rebelled against the Danes and ejected King Ecgberht. They placed King Ricsige on the throne. Ecgberht took refuge in Mercia. The Danes came north to put down the rebellion, but succeeded only in subduing Deira. Within a few weeks the Danes set up their winter camp at Torksey in Mercia. The Danes had operated as a single army for nine years. But in 874 it divided into two armies. They never reunited.\n\nIn 874 Halfdan took his followers north to camp at the mouth of the River Tyne. They raided the Picts and Britons in Strathclyde for the next year. But there was little gain in raiding these poorer areas. The Danes had plundered the wealth of most of England and little was left. Halfdan began settling his men in the area of York. The other army led by Gutheram, Oscytel and Arnuld was still fighting against Wessex at the time. By 876 they had concluded a peace with Wessex. In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester in Mercia. In 879 they moved to East Anglia. The leader Guthrum, known by his Christian name Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 'they occupied the land and shared it out.' In 878 a new Danish army was camped at Fulham. But by 879 they had left England for the Low Countries.\n\nThe settling of a large part of conquered England by the Danes became known as the Danelaw. It became the part of England where the laws and customs were Danish not English. At this point England became divided into three parts. These were Wessex, English Mercia and the Danelaw. The Danelaw was a mixture of the native populations and the members of the great army who settled there. Many placenames were Danish. Many of the words in the English vocabulary have Danish origins. As late as the 11th century when a came to England he did not feel out of place. The languages was the same and the customs were the same. This was true until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 when French was introduced into England.\n\n", "id": "421199", "title": "Great Heathen Army"}

It meant that a monarch was given the right to rule by God alone. His authority could not be questioned because he ruled in God's name. It gave a king absolute rule over his subjects.\n\nPharaohs and some other ancient Kings were thought to actually be gods or descendants of gods. That concept went away when monotheism spread. A medieval principle held that God gave the right in to rule in secular matters to political rulers. God gave the right to rule over spiritual matters to the Pope as head of the Church. This has been called the 'doctrine of the two swords'. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. From that time on the Emperor was the secular power while the Pope was the power. This concept began to break down prior to the First Crusade. Rather than have the Emperor provide the manpower for the crusade, the Pope called on the nobility of Europe directly.\n\nIn England, Henry VIII broke free of the Catholic church and the authority of the Pope. By the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 Henry was both king and the head of the Church of England. Following the Protestant Reformation the theory of divine right gave the king absolute authority as God's representative on earth in both political and spiritual matters. It made him accountable to no one but God. James I of England in his speech to Parliament in 1609 said:\nIn France the theory had been considered from the 13th century. While France remained Catholic, her kings gradually pulled away from papal rule. By the 16th century the king replaced the pope as supreme authority over the French church. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 the divine rights theory was no longer popular in England. In France, kings including Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) continued the divine rights doctrine. That was until the French revolution in 1789. By the 19th century it no longer had any . \n\nThe Chinese culture had a similar but older concept called the 'Mandate of Heaven'. A good ruler had the blessings of heaven. But one who ruled badly would cause the mandate to be removed. When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, they claimed the Mandate of Heaven from the people.\n\n", "id": "421350", "title": "Divine right of kings"}

In 1839, he coined the term 'protoplasm' for the fluid substance of a cell. \n\nPurkyně was born in Bohemia, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now it is in the Czech Republic. In 1818, he graduated with a degree in medicine, and was appointed Professor of Physiology. He published two volumes which contributed to experimental psychology. He created the world's first Department of Physiology at the University of Breslau in Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), and the world's first official physiology laboratory.\n\nHe is best known for his discoveries of Purkinje cells and Purkinje fibres. Purkinje cells are large neurons with many branching dendrites found in the cerebellum. Purkinje fibres conduct electrical impulses to all parts of the ventricle of the heart. Other discoveries include Purkinje images, reflections of objects from structures of the eye, and the Purkinje shift, the change in the brightness of red and blue colours as light intensity decreases gradually at dusk. Purkyně also introduced the scientific terms plasma (for the component of blood left when the suspended cells have been removed) and protoplasm (the substance found inside cells.)\n\nPurkyně was the first to use a microtome to make wafer thin slices of tissue for microscopic examination and was among the first to use an improved version of the compound microscope. He described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpentine on humans in 1829. He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he \"washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days\", which remain a good description of today's average nutmeg binge. Purkyně discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised nine principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823.\n\nPurkyně was, in the opinion of Henry Harris, the true father of the cell theory. The work of Purkyně and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810–1883) was \"unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans.

But if everyone saves money, then the economy can slow down even more, reducing peoples' income as a result. It is often linked with John Maynard Keynes. It is a main theory of Keynesian economics.\n\nIt is a kind of prisoner's dilemma: saving benefits each individual but damages the general population. This is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition. Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a \"rainy day\", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.\n\nThere is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy. Modern economies are huge, and much affected by other national economies. \n", "id": "421529", "title": "Paradox of thrift"}

It served as his personal ship between England and Normandy afterwards. It was the largest and fastest ship in his invasion fleet. The Mora was a gift to William by his wife Matilda of Flanders.\n\nThe \"Mora\" was built at Barfleur in Normandy. It was a gift from Matilda of Flanders to her husband Duke William of Normandy. It was completed in the summer of 1066. Mora was a larger ship that could carry ten to twelve knights with their , weapons and . It would also have a crew to sail it. The captain of the ship was Stephen, the son of Airard. Stephen was the captain of the Mora for over twenty years. Orderic Vitalis described the ship: \"it had for its the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory. \"Mora\" carried sails and at the top of the was the papal banner (Pope's flag), consecrated and sent to William from Rome. The banner was described as \"a square white banner charged with a gold cross within a blue border.\"\n\nBefore sunset on September 27th, according to William of Poitiers, Duke William's invasion fleet left for England. The Mora led the fleet. Mora carried a lantern on her mast so she could be seen in the dark. A horn also let the other ships know where the Mora was. The Mora was much faster than the other ships. By dawn William found himself in mid-channel, alone, with no other ships in sight. While he waited his servants served him breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex. According to Elisabeth van Houts, the meaning of the name is not known although there have been several suggestions. It might be named for the \"Morini\", ancient inhabitants of Flanders. This is where Matilda was from. The Latin word \"mora\" has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that \"Mora\" was an anagram of \"Amor\".\n", "id": "421556", "title": "Mora (ship)"}

Then Marcello Malpighi, Hooke, Nehemiah Grew and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek had a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations. \n\nWorking on frogs and extrapolating to humans, Malpighi demonstrated the structure of the lungs, previously thought to be a homogeneous mass of flesh, and he offered an explanation for how air and blood mixed in the lungs. Malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin, kidneys, and liver. For example, after he dissected the body of a black man, Malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the origin of black skin. He found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin.\n\nHe was the first to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins.

There \nArchbishop Asterius of Milan consecrated Birinus as a bishop. Birinus arrived in southern Britain . He had planned to go to the midlands of England to preach there. But when he found the Gewisse in Wessex were completely pagan, he decided to stay with them. He began to convert the Gewisse (West Saxons) to Christianity. In 635 King Cynegils of Wessex was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria agreed to be his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. \nIn Birinus founded a church at Winchester which later became Winchester Cathedral. Birinus died in 650. He was buried at Dorchester. \n\nAfter 660 there were no more West Saxon Bishops at Dorchester. Along with part of Berkshire it was taken over by Mercia. The new see for Wessex was now at Winchester. Some time around 690–700 Bishop Hedda of Winchester had the relics (bones) of St. Birinus moved from Dorchester to Winchester.

The body was dressed in the garments and tunic of a bishop so they believed it was St. Birinus. At the time of the discovery miracles were claimed. One claim was that a dumb child could suddenly speak English and French. The monks sent their findings to Rome. The pope wrote to Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury asking him to manage the translation. But a problem caused the ceremony to be delayed. Archbishop Langton discovered the body had already been moved to Winchester . Both Dorchester and Winchester claimed to have the relics of Bishop Birinus.

His work on insects showed that the stages an insect life – egg, larva, pupa, and adult – are different forms of the same animal. He did experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years.\n\nKnowledge of insects in the 17th century was to a great extent inherited from Aristotle. Swammerdam dissected insects and studied them under microscopes.\n\nSwammerdam showed that insects develop in the same gradual manner as do other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) were different individuals. \n\nHe got evidence from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, he noticed that the wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist before their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations in his 1669 publication, \"Historia Insectorum Generalis\" (The Natural History of Insects). This work included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the \"king\" bee has ovaries. \"Biblia natura\" published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony.

John Rosbrugh (c. 1714–1777) (also spelled Rosborough and Rosburgh) was a graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He was ordained a Presbyterian minister. In 1776 he organized and commanded the 3rd Northampton County, Pennsylvania . He then then accepted a commission as company chaplain. He was killed at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Rosbrugh was the first U.S. chaplain ever killed in battle.\n\nJohn Rosbrugh was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He to the United States along with his older brother, William. The family was originally from Craigie, County Ayrshire, Scotland. His ancestors went to Ireland during the settling of the Ulster Plantation. In 1733 his young wife Sarah died in childbirth along with their only child. He was a tradesman but well enough educated to prepare himself for college.\n\nHe attended the College of New Jersey where he graduated in 1761. He was licensed to preach in August of 1763. In October 1764 he was sent to the congregations of Greenwich, Oxford, and Mansfield Woodhouse, all in western New Jersey. In December 1764 he became a Presbyterian minister. By 1765, he was asked to serve neighboring congregations in Upper and Lower Hardwick in Warren County, New Jersey. In 1766, Rev. Rosbrugh married Jane Ralston. She was the daughter of James Ralston of East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. It was then called 'the Irish Settlement.' In 1769 Rev. Rosbrugh was called to serve at the church at Allen Township. This was the same congregation his wife was from. He became their permanent minister. For seven years, he led his congregation in Allen township.\n\nAt the start of the American Revolutionary War, news was often read to congregations in their churches. It was one of the main forms of communication at the time. On December 10, 1776, General George Washington called out the militia of Pennsylvania. He wrote to the colonels of the militias of Northampton and Bucks counties asking them and their men to join him as quickly as possible. Rev. Rosebrugh read General Washington's letter to his congregation. The men of the congregation formed a company of militia and agreed to go to war \"if\" Rev. Rosbrugh would lead them. He had expected to accompany them as their chaplain but reluctantly agreed to lead them. John Rosbrugh took his place at the head of the company and slinging his musket over his shoulder led the company to join General Washington and the Continental Army in Philadelphia.\n\nWhile in Philadelphia, Rev. Rosbrugh was given a commission as a Chaplain. Captain John Hays took his place as company commander. A chaplain at that time held the rank of major and pay of thirty-three and a half dollars per month. Presbyterian ministers, however, were particularly hated by the British and if captured suffered cruel treatment. Rev. Rosbrugh’s company joined the rest of the Northampton county militia in camp. Rosbrugh also met with his brother-in-law, John Ralston, a member of the Second Continental Congress. The 3rd Battalion was under the command of General Israel Putnam. He had orders to cross the Delaware on the 25th of December in support of Washington’s surprise attack on Trenton. However General Putnam decided not to cross due to weather conditions. So Rev. Rosbrugh’s battalion remained in Philadelphia. After General Washington crossed back to Pennsylvania he decided to take Trenton a second time. This time the 3rd Northampton militia was included. The battle was called the second battle of Trenton or the battle of Assinpink creek.\n\nOn the afternoon of January 2nd the Americans were preparing their positions for the upcoming battle. Rev. John Rosbrugh was dining at a public house when a warning was shouted that Hessians were coming. Going outside he found his horse had been taken. He tried to get back to the American lines which were on the other side of Assunpink Creek. But he was suddenly confronted by a company of Hessians under the command of a British officer. He surrendered but they recognized him as a Presbyterian minister. The Hessians him to death. They took his watch and money then left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, the company commander, recovered the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain moved Rev. Rosbrugh's body to the nearby graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today. His widow, Jane (née Ralston) survived him by 32 years. She was buried in the East Allen Township cemetery, the inscription on her tombstone indicating her husband John is buried beside her.\n\nAbout 1766, John Rosbrugh married secondly, Jane Ralston (1739–1809). She was the daughter of James Ralston of the Irish Settlement or Allen Township, PA. John and Jane had five children:<br>\n\n\n", "id": "421776", "title": "John Rosbrugh"}

It is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. In other words, a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12. The word \"relative\" in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. Relative atomic mass values are ratios; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity. Relative atomic mass is the same as \"atomic weight\", which is the older term.\n\nThe number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. However, most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons. An atom of an element with a certain number of neutrons is called an isotope. For example, the element thallium has two common isotopes: thallium-203 and thallium-205. Both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons, but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons, 2 more than thallium-203, which has 122. Each isotope has its own mass, called its isotopic mass. A relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Like relative atomic mass values, relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units.\n\nWe can find the relative atomic mass of a sample of an element by working out the abundance-weighted mean of the relative isotopic masses. For example, if a sample of thallium is made up of 30% thallium-203 and 70% thallium-205,\n\nTwo samples of an element that consists of more than one isotope, collected from two widely spaced sources on Earth, are expected to have slightly different relative atomic masses. This is because the proportions of each isotope are slightly different at different locations.\n\nA standard atomic weight is the mean value of relative atomic masses of a number of normal samples of the element. Standard atomic weight values are published at regular intervals by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The standard atomic weight for each element is on the periodic table.\n\nOften, the term relative atomic mass is used to mean standard atomic weight. This is not quite correct, because relative atomic mass is a less specific term that refers to individual samples. Individual samples of an element could have a relative atomic mass different to the standard atomic weight for the element. For example, a sample from another planet could have a relative atomic mass very different to the standard Earth-based value.\n\nRelative atomic mass is not the same as:\n", "id": "421839", "title": "Relative atomic mass"}

The hotel is ranked highly among the most prestigious and luxurious hotels in the world and is a member of \"The Leading Hotels of the World\".\n\nThe hotel has 159 rooms. It was founded by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in collaboration with the chef Auguste Escoffier in 1898. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of a Town house from the 18th-century. It overlooks one of the central squares in Paris.\n\nIt was one of the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom \"en suite\", a telephone and electricity for each room. It established a reputation for luxury. The clients have included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, for example Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, \"Bar Hemingway\", is devoted to Hemingway.\n\nThe Ritz has the reputation of being the most expensive hotel in Paris. The rooms as of May 2011 started at €850 a night. Suites start at €3,600 and cost up to €13,900 a night for the most expensive ones (the \"Suite Impériale\" is the most expensive). The Ritz employs more than 600 people.\n\n\"L'Espadon\" is a world-renowned restaurant. It attracts aspiring chefs from all over the world who come to learn at the nearby Ritz-Escoffier School. The cuisine is run by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel. The restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the German Luftwaffe used the hotel as local headquarters in Paris. The son of César Ritz, Charles, died in 1976. The last members of the Ritz family who owned the hotel sold it to the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1979. In August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Al-Fayed's son, Dodi, dined in the hotel's Imperial Suite before their fatal car crash.\n\nThe hotel is being entirely renovated. It has been closed since 1 August 2012 and will open its doors in March 2016, after a delay of nearly two years. Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel has featured in many novels (for example F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"Tender Is The Night\" and Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\"),\na play (Noël Coward's \"Semi-Monde\"), and films (such as Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy \"Love in the Afternoon\" and William Wyler's 1966 comedy \"How to Steal a Million\").\n", "id": "421905", "title": "Hôtel Ritz Paris"}

In 1829 he accompanied Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which then were not much studied.\n\nFor nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as Euglena, ciliates such as \"Paramecium aurelia\" and \"Paramecium caudatum\", and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria, foraminifera and dinoflagellates.\n\nThese researches built up our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.\n\nHe was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1836 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London from 1837.

FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision. It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual, not for medical reasons. \n\nFGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan. However, it also happens in other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and around the world. Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital. It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia. \n\nDifferent ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages. Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old. Others do it when girls reach puberty, or are older. In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.\n\nFGM can cause serious health problems, like infections, chronic pain, trouble getting pregnant and giving birth, bleeding so bad that it can kill. FGM does not make a person's health better in any way.\n\nFGM is illegal in most of the countries where it happens. However, these laws are often ignored. Since the 1970s, many countries have tried to stop FGM. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly said that FGM is a human rights problem, and voted to try harder to stop it. The World Health Organization and the \"Maputo Protocol\" to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights also say that FGM must be stopped.\n\nThere are many different types of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created four basic categories of FGM, called Types 1-IV.\n\nIn Type I FGM, part or all of the clitoris is cut off. The clitoris is the organ that makes sex feel good for women. Without it, a woman usually cannot have an orgasm.\nThere are a few forms of Type II FGM. All of them involve cutting off part or all of the inner labia, the two flaps of skin on the sides of the vagina. The forms of Type II FGM are:\n\nType III FGM is usually called infibulation. It is the most severe form of FGM. The genitals outside a woman's body are cut off and the wound is sewn shut with thread and thorns. The different types of infibulation are:\n\nWhen the labia are sewn shut, one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate. The hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound.To help the wound close, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle, for up to six weeks.\n\nAfter the woman gets married, her vagina is cut open so she can have sex. A midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife, or the woman's husband might tear it open with his penis. If the woman gets pregnant, the vagina is opened more for childbirth, and then often sewn back up afterward (this is called re-infibulation).\n\nType IV FGM is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals, like scraping, burning, scarring, or cutting the genitals without cutting them off.\n\nIn many countries where FGM is common, almost every woman and girl in the country has had FGM. In other countries, millions of women and girls have had FGM over many years.\n\nIn 25 countries in Africa and the Middle East, over 125 million women and girls have had FGM. This includes:\nIn some of these same 25 countries, FGM is very common. It is most common in these countries:\n\nHowever, in other countries, FGM is not as common. For example, of the 25 countries where FGM happens most often, it is least common in these countries:\n\nFGM can hurt women's physical and mental health throughout their lives.\n\nThe type of complications that people might have from FGM depend on many things, like:\n\n\"Short-term complications\" are problems caused by FGM soon after the FGM happened. Common short-term complications include:\n\nMore serious short-term complications can cause symptoms that can kill a woman. They include:\n\nNobody knows how many girls and women die from FGM. \n\nLate complications happen later on after FGM is done. For example:\n\nPainful periods are common because it is very difficult for blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation. Blood can fill the vagina and uterus, and stay there without moving. If the vagina gets completely blocked, the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood. Because women with this problem do not menstruate, and blood builds up in their abdomen (making it swell), it can be confused with pregnancy.\n\nFGM may increase a woman's risk of having problems during pregnancy and childbirth. For example, women who had infibulations are more likely to:\n\nFGM also raises the risk that a woman's baby will die soon after it is born. In 2008, the WHO estimated that 10–20 babies out of every 1,000 die because their mothers had FGM. All types of FGM were found to raise babies' risk of death, which was:\n\nThere is not much information about the effects of FGM on women's and girls' mental health. However, a few small studies have found that women with FGM often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nStudies on how FGM affects women's ability to have sex have also been small. In total, in 2013, there had been 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries.

He gave his name to the Hôtel Ritz Paris and The Ritz Hotel in London. His motto was \"king of hoteliers, and hotelier to kings\". His name is the origin of the word \"ritzy\".\n\nAt fifteen Ritz was apprenticed as a \"somelier\" (wine waiter) at a hotel in Brig. Dismissed after a year as an unsuitable candidate for the hotel trade, he went to Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.\n\nRitz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a \"maître d'hôtel\", manager, and eventually hotelier. \n\nIn 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the Hôtel Splendide in Paris, meeting many rich, self-made Americans as guests. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition. In the winter of that year his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand Hôtel in Nice. Regular moves then followed. He followed the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer.\n\nIn 1878, he became the manager of the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand Hôtel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and got a reputation for good taste and elegance. He was the first to say that \"the customer is never wrong\". His code was \"See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked\".\n\nIn 1888, he opened a restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as \"a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London\". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now \"seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms\".\n\nIn 1898, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy. Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over £3,400 of wine and spirits, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The following report is from the London \"Daily Telegraph\":\n\nLater in 1898, he opened the celebrated Hôtel Ritz in the Place Vendôme, Paris. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1906, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era, for the rich and famous. The Hotel Ritz Madrid in Madrid, opened in 1910, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.\n\nRitz himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.\n\nBy 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake Küssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at Küssnacht on 26 October 1918. Although from a humble Swiss background, César Ritz and his luxurious hotels became legendary, and his name entered the English language as an epitome of high-class cuisine and accommodation. He is buried in the village of his birth.\n\n\n", "id": "422146", "title": "César Ritz"}

It can live as a saprophyte, or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot. It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been accidentally introduced to South Africa. \n\n\"Armillaria gallica\" is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange. \n\nThe fungus develops an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called rhizomorphs which help it to decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research. Its ability to bioluminesce and its ability to form large and long-lived colonies are especially interesting.\n\nResearchers reported finding \"Armillaria gallica\" in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s. In one forest stand, \"Armillaria\"-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus \"A. gallica\" (then known as \"A. bulbosa\"). \n\nUsing sequence analysis, they found that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis examined genetic samples collected in the forest from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs. Samples from the 15-hectare area had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA fragments. This showed the samples were all from a single genetic individual, or clone, which reached its size through vegetative growth. The authors noted: \"This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth\". After the \"Nature\" paper was published, media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found. As a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the common name \"humongous fungus\".

With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates\".\n\nThe book is a fictional autobiography of the title character, Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe leaves the safety of his comfortable middle-class home in England and goes to sea. He is shipwrecked and becomes a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad. He meets cannibals, captives and mutineers, and is eventually rescued.\n\nFor the first edition, Defoe pretended that the novel was a true story. He said the fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe was the author and he pretended to be the editor of Crusoe's autobiography. This led many readers to believe that Crusoe was a real person and the book a true account of his life.\n\nMany people think the story was influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk was a Scottish castaway who lived for over four years on a Pacific island belonging to Chile called Más a Tierra. (In 1966, the island was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island.) However, there are other possible sources. For example, Ibn Tufail's earlier novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\", also set on a desert island, may have inspired Defoe.\n\nCritical response to \"Robinson Crusoe\" has been diverse and argumentative. There has been widespread disagreement about the novel's nature and origin, values, structure, and meaning. Literary historians have not agreed on Defoe's sincerity, exact intentions, and achievement in the book.\n\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" was very popular as soon as it was published. Before the end of 1719, it had already run through four editions. The novel's popularity has continued and it has become one of the most widely published books in history.

It happened on the night of February 26, 2012. Martin was shot by George Zimmerman. The case has been given a lot of coverage by the media. Zimmerman was declared not guilty of manslaughter. However, many people believe Zimmerman racially discriminated Martin.\n\nTrayvon Martin was African American. He was a 17-year-old high school student at the time. Martin had been walking to his father's girlfriend's house, where he was staying. He had gone to the 7-Eleven to buy a packet of Skittles. The house was in a gated community. The shooter, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of the neighborhood watch in this community. Zimmerman is a mixed race Hispanic man. He shot Martin in the chest, killing the teenager.\n\nWhen he was shot, Martin had been talking on his mobile phone to his girlfriend. He was wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman had thought Martin looked suspicious. He called the emergency telephone number (911) and the operator told him that he did not need to follow Martin. Zimmerman did this anyway. People are not sure what happened after this. When police arrived at the location of the shooting, Zimmerman said that Martin had punched him in the nose and knocked him onto the pavement. Martin had not been carrying a weapon when he was shot. \n\nPolice did not arrest Zimmerman until six weeks later. This was because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows people to shoot others in order to defend themselves. Zimmerman was put on trial. On July 13, 2013, a jury decided that he was not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Protests were held in more than 100 cities in the United States by people who thought that decision was unfair. President Barack Obama made spoke in response to public anger about the trial verdict on July 19. He said, \"Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago\". Maddy, a juror for the trial, told ABC News that Zimmerman \"got away with murder\".\n\nThe media coverage about this case has continued even after Zimmerman was declared not guilty.\n\nGeraldo Rivera said on \"Fox and Friends\", \"I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as much as George Zimmerman was.\" This made a lot of people angry. They said it was victim blaming.\n\nAn episode of the cartoon comedy \"South Park\", \"World War Zimmerman\", was shown in October 2013. It parodied Zimmerman's trial. Jack Cashill wrote a book about the case called \"'If I had a Son': Race, Guns, and the Railroading of George Zimmerman\". It was published in October 2013.\n\nZimmerman was arrested on November 18, 2013. Police said that he was going to be put in prison. TMZ said that Zimmerman attacked his pregnant girlfriend. He has been charged with aggravated assault, domestic violence battery, and criminal mischief. Zimmerman was released on bail.\n\nIn October 2013, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, demanded changes to the Stand Your Ground law. She said the law \"creates many opportunities for people to commit terrible acts of violence and evade justice\". She and Martin's father, Tracy Fulton, started the Trayvon Martin Foundation in 2012 to help victims of injustice.\n\nNeighborhood watchers in Sanford are now banned from carrying guns and following people. This is to avoid another event like Martin's killing and to make the neighborhood watch's reputation better.\n\n", "id": "422479", "title": "Shooting of Trayvon Martin"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=422590", "text": "Roman food\n\nRoman food was mainly obtained from the Mediterranean area and Gaul (now Spain). Romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the Roman Republic and Empire. Keeping up the food supply to the city of Rome was a major political issue in the late Republic. It became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the Roman people.\n\nThree meals a day was normal in ancient Rome, as today. In the morning, a breakfast called the \"ientaculum\" was served at dawn. Later, around 11:00 am, Romans ate a small lunch, and in the evening, they ate the \"cena\", the main meal of the day. In the Empire period, the \"cena\" increased in size and diversity. It was now eaten in the afternoon. The \"vesperna\", a light supper in the evening, was abandoned, and a second breakfast was introduced around noon, the \"prandium\".\n\nIn the lower strata of society, the old routine was kept: it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor.\n\nOriginally flat, round loaves made of emmer (a cereal related to wheat) with a bit of salt were eaten; among the upper classes, eggs, cheese, and honey, along with milk and fruit were also consumed. In the Empire period, around the beginning of the Christian era, bread made of wheat was introduced. Later, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread. Poor romans ate bread, vegetable, soup and porridge. Meat and shellfish were a luxury, unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing.\n\nThe bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives, cheese and grapes. They also ate wild boar, beef, sausages, pork, lamb, duck, goose, chickens, small birds and fish. Romans liked to make mealtimes fun by roasting hare with wings stuck on them to look like a flying horse. \n\nAt dinner slaves gave guests small hot bread rolls to wipe their plates clean. Roman flour contained a lot of dust and bits and this made bread so coarse that it wore down people's teeth. \nThe wealthier Romans liked to eat snails flattened on milk, peacock's brains and flamingos tongues. \n\nAmong the upper classes, who did not do manual labor, all business was done in the morning. After the \"prandium\", a visit would be made to the baths. Around 2 p.m., the \"cena\" would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by a round of drinks.\n\nIn the period of the kings and the early republic, but also in later periods (for the working classes), the \"cena\" essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the \"puls\". The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. The more sophisticated kind was made with olive oil, with an accompaniment of assorted vegetables when available. The richer classes ate their \"puls\" with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish.\n\nOver the course of the Republican period, the \"cena\" developed into two courses: a main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in 3 parts: 1 course (\"gustatio\"), main course (\"primae mensae\"), and dessert (\"secundae mensae\").\n\nIn contrast to the fine banquets, poor people ate the cheapest foods, so they had for breakfast grain made into twice-baked bread and porridge, and for lunch a vegetable and meat stew. The vegetables available included millet, onions, turnips, and olives with bread and oil on the side.\nAt dinner they had thin soup or meat with cheese, and a pudding of honey.\n\nThe Romans mainly drank wine, the main drink of the Empire, and water. The wine could be laced with spices and honey to improve the taste. Slaves poured wine and honeyed water in flasks. Slaves filled goblets with wine from large dishes. However, drinks such as milk were considered uncivilised and hence were only used for children, medical purposes and making cheese. The wine drunk across the empire was produced in Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain and Greece. Beer was also drunk by Romans in Britain.\n\nRoman kitchens were usually small rooms, simply equipped with built-in clay ovens and wooden cupboards. A charcoal fire heated a brick hearth, where the cook fried or cooked food in earthenware or bronze pots for baking or roasting. They placed meats in the ashes. The Roman kitchens were small compared to the one we have today. The kitchen would also have large jars of olive oil, wine, vinegar and fish sauces, as well as a mortar for grinding up spices. Only richer people had kitchens, although they didn't cook because their slaves did it. Despite the simple facilities, the cooks and slaves produced spicy dishes of shellfish, wild boar, fruits and sweets.\n", "id": "422590", "title": "Roman food"}

He was a noble of the royal house of Mercia and a pagan his entire life. Penda was the central figure in English history from 632 until his death. Penda treated every Northumbrian king as his enemy, especially if that king had any influence in southern England.\n\nPenda was a son of Pybba of Mercia. At his father's death in Penda was still an infant. Ceorl ruled Mercia following Penda's father. There are indications Penda was an underking in Mercia probably in charge of Western Mercia. This would have included the territory of the Hwicce. Later Penda had close ties to the Hwicce when he was king of Mercia.\n\nIn 626, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \"This year Penda succeeded to the kingdom [of Mercia] and reigned thirty winters.\" As king of Mercia Penda's first victory came in 628. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. It's likely Penda also got the territory of the Hwicce at this time. The agreement or treaty also seems to have been a marriage alliance. Penda married Cynewise, probably a sister of Cynegils. He formed an alliance with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. Cadwallon was known to have been very hostile towards the Northumbrians. In 633 Penda joined him in invading Northumbria. At Battle of Hatfield Chase their combined armies defeated and killed King Edwin of Northumbria. Cadwallon remained in Northumbria for a year destroying everything he could. Penda left and returned to Mercia. He brought with him Eadfrith, the son of Edwin, as a prisoner possibly to set up as a puppet ruler in Northumbria under Penda. But Penda had him murdered a few years later. \n\nSometime after 633 Penda killed two East Anglian kings, Sigebert and Egric, in battle. He set up a vassal king in East Anglia. About 635 Penda's brother Eowa became a king in Mercia along with Penda. Possibly he ruled northern Mercia while Penda ruled in the south. In Cadwallon, Penda's ally, was defeated and killed by King Oswald of Northumbria. The armies of Oswald and Penda met in 641 at Maserfelth (later called Oswestry in Shropshire). What events led to the battle is not recorded. Penda defeated and killed Oswald. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Nothing indicates that Penda claimed to be overlord however. In 643 Cenwalh succeeded Cynegils as king of Wessex. Cenwalh married a sister of Penda of Mercia. But in 645 when Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex. Cenwalh returned to his kingdom . In 650, possibly to teach him a lesson for sheltering Cenwalh, Penda drove King Anna of East Anglia out of his kingdom. Penda killed Anna in battle in .\n\nAfter King Oswald's death, Northumbria divided back into the two previous kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Each had their own king. Oswiu of Northumbria became king of Bernicia. He was Oswald's brother and Penda had a particular contempt for him. In 653 Deira came under Mercian control. In 654, hoping to put an end to Oswiu, Penda gathered all his allies and invaded Bernicia. Called the battle of the Winwaed he marched against Oswiu with 'thirty legions'. On Sunday, 15 November 655 the two armies met in battle near Leads. Although he had the larger army Penda was killed. This established Oswiu as king of all Northumbria and as overlord of all the English south of the River Humber. Penda was succeeded by his son Peada.\n\nPenda married Cynewise, his only known wife.

It was created by Yamaha, a company that sells musical instruments, as well as other products. The user can type in lyrics and a melody and it will synthesize singing. Voicebanks for Vocaloid are made by recording samples of singers.\n\nVocaloid was developed partially through a research project led by Kenmochi Hideki. The people involved in this project later created the company Voctro Labs. Vocaloid was originally not supposed to be a commercial product, but with the help of Yamaha, became the program we know today.\n\nVocaloid originally only had an English version available, with two English voicebanks, Leon and Lola, being released for it. This changed later on with the release of Kaito and Meiko, which were both Japanese voicebanks.\n\nVocaloid is meant both for professional and amateur music makers, since Vocaloid is easy to use, so the only limit is the user's skill. Music groups like Livetune and Supercell have made music using Vocaloid voicebanks.\n\nVocaloid works by taking samples of singers and separating them into parts. These parts are used to form words. Vocaloid voices can be made to sound more realistic by using vibrato and changing things like how breathy a voice sounds.\n\nYamaha started working on Vocaloid in 2000. They announced it at a German music festival. Vocaloid was originally nicknamed \"Daisy\" as a reference to the song \"Daisy Bell\", but eventually they got rid of that name and decided to use \"Vocaloid\" instead.\n\nVocaloid 2 was announced in 2007. The way vocals were synthesized was changed, and so was the way the program looked.\n\nVocaloid 3 was released on October 21st, 2011. A lot of companies that made voicebanks for Vocaloid 2 upgraded their voicebanks to Vocaloid 3 because it sounded better.\n\nVocaloid 4 was released in 2015, and added a feature which let voicebanks made specifically for Vocaloid 4 sound like they were growling.\n\n", "id": "422737", "title": "Vocaloid"}

Women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara and Sparta could own land, which was the most prestigious form of private property at the time.\n\nIn ancient Athens, women were not citizens. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. After marriage, their husband (\"kyrios\") acted for the wife in all legal matters. Athenian women had limited property rights. Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a “medimnos of barley” (a measure of grain). This allowed women to engage in petty trading. \n\nSlaves, like free women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, but sometimes, rarely, they could become citizens if freed. Women, on the other hand, could never get full civil rights. No women ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens, and so they were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy.\n\nBy contrast, Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. \n\nAfter many years of war in the 4th century BC, Spartan women owned between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20: this was unusual in the ancient world. Girls as well as boys received an education, and young women as well as young men may have joined in the \"Gymnopaedia\" (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").\n\nSome philosophers were in favour of equality for women, but not Plato and Aristotle. Contrary to them, the Stoic philosophers argued for the equality of the sexes. In their view, sexual inequality was contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and get the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity. The Cynics practiced these views in their lives as well as in their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature, thus putting their sexual egalitarianism on a strong footing.\n", "id": "422853", "title": "Women in Ancient Greece"}

The peacock's tail is long and heavy and actually diminishes its chances to survive. So why did it evolutionarily survive? According to the principle, one day, a mutant peahen that likes peacocks with longer tail, looked for a male with this characteristic. The mature male she found was strong enough to survive even though it had a long tail and therefore it is probably stronger than the average peacock. Therefore, its predecessor males are going to be stronger and also to have a long tail while the newborn females are going to like long tails, passing the ideals of the principle to the next generations.\n\nThis principle comes in addition to the well-known adaptation part of evolution theory claiming that the one who fits best to its environment survives.\n", "id": "422977", "title": "Handicap principle"}

They destroy the artifact to save themselves, just after Spock (played by Todd Haberkorn) detects two life forms on it.

It was built by his race to live in forever. It had malfunctioned and killed all the others of his race. He says he no longer wishes to have people worship him again. After a brief stay in the sick-bay, He starts to want people to idolize him for his singing and storytelling. Captain Kirk (played by Vic Mignogna) demands to speak with him about his behaviors. Apollo uses his telekinetic powers on the captain and others to make them worship him. Meanwhile, the remains of the Realm are still causing difficulties. A crew member dies while he and Sulu (played by Grant Imahara of \"Mythbusters\") are removing debris from the hull of the Enterprise.\n\nUnlike other Star Trek fan productions, \"Pilgrim\" had a lead crew made up of film industry professionals. The creators attempted to recreate the style of the original series, in its sets, cinematography, costumes, and acting and storytelling style. They duplicated the dramatic pauses as used in the original, prior to commercial breaks. They primarily used the original series' incidental music, as well as the original theme song and iconic credit typography. They filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio to duplicate the original series' TV format.\n\nActor Michael Forest, in his 80's during filming, was written into the story as having been artificially aged, as he was supposed to have last encountered the crew of the Enterprise only a few years prior, according to the original series timeline.\n\nAs with all such Star Trek fan productions, permission to use copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original series are allowed so long as the production is not-for-profit.\n\nThe episode was first shown to the public at the Phoenix Comicon comic book convention on May 26, 2013, and was at the same time released onto the internet, on various streaming services.\n\nFunds for continuation of the series are being raised in part from a Kickstarter campaign, held from Oct 7, 2013 - Nov 6, 2013, which has raised the set goal of $100,000.

His theories helped to develop the nuclear strategy of the United States.\n\nKahn, a man of \"captivating personality and large intellectual gifts\", worked for the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California, as a military strategist (19481958). He was a founder of the Hudson Institute think tank. This gives ideas and consultations for the U.S. government and military chiefs, and for business clients. \n\nHe was known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability. His key idea was that the threat of nuclear war could be controlled by the use of carefully graded deterrence. In order to get his ideas across he ran two-day seminars which included role-playing in various scenarios. His ideas, when published in \"On Thermonuclear War\", caused a sensation. \n\nHowever, responses must be proportionate, because if one threatened all-out war as a response for some rather modest misbehaviour, then the threat was simply not believable, and would not work. The need to think things through in detail was the topic of his second book, \"Thinking about the Unthinkable\".\n\nKahn was less successful later in his career when he turned his attention to general economics and politics. His ideas on Japan seemed good at the time, but now seem to be quite wrong. He predicted that Japan would become the world's third superstate and a military superpower. This he based on Japan's record after 1946, which was spectacular, based mainly on quality production and undercutting markets in the older economies. As it turned out, Japan's economy stalled in the 1980s, and has never recovered its previous growth rate. The role he predicted for Japan is now filled by China, a country with a huge reserve of poorly-paid workers and significant military forces.\n\nWorks written by Kahn include:\n", "id": "423102", "title": "Herman Kahn"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423197", "text": "Enhanced geothermal system\n\nAn enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is a geothermal energy system that can make electrical energy when natural underground water is not there. For a long time, geothermal energy could only be produced when there were hot rocks, underground water, and cracks in rocks all together in one area. Now, new ways of getting this power source are being created. Areas that can possibly be used for energy need to be altered by people to make the energy usable. These areas may need either underground water and/or cracks, or fracture network, in rocks. Enhanced geothermal systems allow for geothermal energy to be outside normal geothermal areas like active plate boundaries to less active areas like the western United States.\n\n\nGeothermal systems can also be enhanced by recycling old oil and gas wells for geothermal use. It is cheaper to change these wells for heat mining than to drill new holes. These wells do not allow for physical contact between the water and the heat source. These wells are made out of two cylinders: a bigger one and a smaller one. The smaller one fits inside the bigger one and is where the heated water is pumped out from. Water in inserted between the lining of the inner pipe and the outer one. Due to the lack in direct contact with the hot rocks as well as some heat loss from lack of a good insulating material, the energy output is not as high as in ordinary geothermal systems.\n\nSome say that this form of energy is one of the “greenest” alternative energies out there. Studies that say two of the three ways of geothermal energy production is flash-steam and dry-steam give off less than 7% of the green house gasses that fossil fuels give off. The third method, known as a closed binary-cycle system, gives off nearly zero green house gasses.) The most emission heavy part of EGS is when the drills are powered by diesel fuel. Research on EGS Life Cycle Analysis has shown that a good correction for this would be to hook the drill up to the power grid decreasing the already minimal impact GEP power plants has on human health, climate change, and ecosystem quality. Supporters also claim that because geothermal energy systems don’t rely on the changing weather, it is a more reliable energy with a constant energy output.\n\nThe US has the largest potential geothermal energy reserve in the world yet only 4% of its total energy usage (15 billion kWh) is from GEP. California has the highest number of geothermal heat pumps out of a total of the nine states that use geothermal energy. Hawaii gets 20% of its power from geothermal power plants. Knowledge about geothermal energy is not well known. This makes getting money for research and development very hard. Developers have also been known to have trouble getting permits to drill on public land and get funding from both the federal government and outside interests. There are, however, two projects that were approved by the Senate to help get EGS out of the pilot stage.\n\nIn 1990, legislation took to creating incentives to develop the industry. It was attempted with the Energy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 with issued tax credits and the creation of Senate supported research and development programs.\n", "id": "423197", "title": "Enhanced geothermal system"}

His older brother Peada ruled Mercia south of the River Thames under Oswiu of Northumbria. When Peada was murdered Oswiu held Mercia until the ealdormen of Mercia rebelled and placed Wulfhere on the throne. Wulfhere ruled Mercia from 658 until his death. He was the first Mercian (overlord) of England. \n\nWulfhere was a younger son of King Penda. His older brother Peada accepted Christianity to marry the daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria. After their father was killed by Oswiu, Peada was set up as a king of southern Mercia. Peada's wife murdered him within five months. Oswiu then took control of all Mercia and ruled it three years. The Mercian ealdormen Immin, Eafa and Eadbert rose up in rebellion against king Oswiu. Wulfhere, who had been kept hidden, was then proclaimed king. Wulfhere had little opposition from Oswiu as he was dealing with a rebellion in Northumbria. Wulfhere began building alliances with other kings in the south of England. His first may have been in about 660 when he married Ermenilda, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent and his wife Seaxburh. About this same time he expanded Mercia to the west. He brought Shropshire and Herfordshire under his control. The kings of Essex submitted to his rule by 665.\n\nBy the time Oswiu died in 670 Wulfhere was the overlord of most of southern England. He installed Bishop Wine in London after he was expelled from Wessex by king Cenwalh. While Wulfhere did not directly control East Anglia he controlled Lindsey and Essex. By controlling all the surrounding lands, he probably forced East Anglia into a treaty. Wulfhere then made Athelwalh recognize his overlordship in Sussex. He expelled the West Saxons from Sussex and eastern Hampshire. Expanding to the east he made his Frithuwold King of Surrey in 670. When King Ecgberht of Kent died in 673 Wulfhere became the guardian of his two sons Eadric and Wihtred. He then ruled Kent through them. With Wulfhere's support, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the Synod of Hertford in 673. In 674 Wulfhere decided to attack Northumbria. Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria had put down a rebellion by the Picts when he became king. Wulfhere formed an alliance of most of the southern kings with the exception of Wessex. The southern alliance under Wulfhere was defeated by Ecgfrith in battle. While Wulfhere survived he was forced to pay to Ecgfrith. He soon lost his authority in Kent. Possibly in revenge for not joining him in fighting Northumbria, Wulfhere attacked Wessex. He was defeated by King Aescwine of Wessex in 674. Wulfhere died in early 675.

It is also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights. The battle which was fought on August 27, 1776, was a major victory for the British and defeat for the Americans under General George Washington. It was the start of a successful British campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence in July, 1776. In terms of soldiers, it was the largest battle of the entire conflict.\n\nGeneral George Washington, Commander-in-Chief had defeated the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776. Washington then used the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York. At that time, New York City was only at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. For this reason, he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack.\n\nThe British were commanded by General William Howe. In July, his force landed a few miles across the harbor on sparsely-populated Staten Island. Over the next few months, new ships slowly reinforced their position in Lower New York Bay. In August there were 32,000 soldiers, and the British controlled the entrance of the harbor at The Narrows. Washington knew that it would be difficult to hold the city against such a force. He believed Manhattan would be the first target and he moved most of his forces there.\n\nOn August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than 12 miles (20 km) south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army fled to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of materiel or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.\n", "id": "423447", "title": "Battle of Long Island"}

They later performed together again in 2002 for a tour. They released 11 studio albums between 1978 and 1995. Their most popular song in the UK was \"Dear Prudence\", a Beatles cover. It reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They were less popular in the United States, but their 1991 single \"Kiss Them For Me\" reached 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. They were also the second headliners for the first Lollapalooza. \n\nThe group played their first concert at the 100 Club Punk Festival. Sid Vicious played drums. Marco Pirroni played guitar. Without practising beforehand, they did a twenty-minute improvised version of the Lord's Prayer. The band had no name and was going to break up after the concert, but they were asked to play again. \n\nTwo months later Kenny Morris joined as a drummer and Peter Fenton as a guitarist. After a few performances, the band realized that Fenton didn't fit in and John McKay took his place. \n\nIn 1978, the band were signed to Polydor Records. They released their first single \"Hong Kong Garden\". It reached 7 on the UK Singles Chart. They released their first album, \"The Scream\", in November. It reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It got mostly good reviews. \"Sounds\" said it was \"the best debut album of the year\".\n\nRobert Smith was guitarist in the band's 1979 tour for \"Join Hands\". He joined the group again in 1982 to replace John McGeoch. He left in 1984 because he said that being in two bands at once was too much stress. He was replaced by John \"Valentine\" Carruthers. Before he left he wanted his time with the band to be documented, so the band released a cover of the Beatles' \"Dear Prudence\" with Smith on guitar. \n\nPeter Edward Clark, known as Budgie, also joined the band for the \"Join Hands\" tour. He stayed a member until the band broke up. In 1987 Carruthers left and was replaced with Jon Klein. Martin McCarrick became the band's full time keyboard player. \n\nIn 1987, the band released \"Through the Looking Glass\", an album of covers of songs by other musicians.\n\nBetween January and June 1988, the band recorded their ninth album, \"Peepshow\". It was released on 5 September 1988. It had a more pop sound than their previous albums. It got very good reviews. \"Q\" gave it 5 stars. \n\nIn 1991, \"Superstition\", the Banshees' tenth album, was released. The single \"Kiss Them for Me\" became their biggest US hit. \n\nIn 1995, they released their last album, \"The Rapture\". A few weeks later, Polydor dropped them from their label.

Selfishness is the opposite of selflessness. It is also different, though related, to self-centredness and self-affirmation. Many psychologists approve of a healthy level of selfishness, in order for some people to stay happy.\n\nIn the study of ethics and morality, selfishness is usually considered bad. In contrast, acts of selflessness are praised. Wider debate about it, however, such as in philosophy, psychology and economics, has shown that scholars have had many different opinions about its value and consequences. In most major religions, selfishness is considered an immoral or bad habit. In Christianity, it is associated with pride, often considered the worst of the Seven deadly sins. Aristotle condemned men who would only try to profit themselves; but he approved of those who would try to gain the praise from others that he deserved.\n\nIn the context of modern-day economics, there is a much wider opinion.

The name was taken from R&D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. \n\nIt is currently financed by the U.S. government and private endowment, corporations, the healthcare industry, universities, and private individuals. \n\nThe organization now works with other governments, private foundations, international organizations, and commercial organizations on a host of non-defence issues. RAND techniques were based on operations research (O.R). which started in World War II. O.R. is the interdisciplinary application of scientific thinking to problem-solving. It relies mostly on the hard sciences like physics and mathematics, and economics. However, some famous biologists and social scientists have worked with RAND at times, and the importance of social ideas and thinking is more important than ever today.\n\nRAND has about 1,700 employees and three principal North American locations: Santa Monica, California (headquarters); Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. RAND Europe is located in Cambridge, England, and Brussels, Belgium. The RAND-Qatar Policy Institute is in Doha, Qatar. RAND's newest office is in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nRAND is also home to the Pardee RAND School, which is the world's largest Ph.D.-granting program in policy analysis. Unlike many other universities, all PARDEE RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships in order to cover their education costs. RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff members.\n\nRAND publishes the \"RAND Journal of Economics\", a peer-reviewed journal of economics.\n\nTo date, 32 recipients of the Nobel Prize, primarily in the fields of economics and physics, have been involved or associated with RAND at some point in their career.\n", "id": "423541", "title": "RAND Corporation"}

It shows the form of a muscular anthropomorphic lioness-woman.\n\nThe sculpture sold for $57.2 million at Sotheby's auction house on December 5, 2007. The sculpture was on loan to the Brooklyn Museum of Art until it was purchased at auction by an English collector. \n\nThe limestone sculpture is just over 8 cm (3.25 in) tall. It was described by Sotheby's as \"one of the last known masterworks from the dawn of civilization remaining in private hands\". One day before the auction, experts had been estimating that the highest bid would be between $14 million and $18 million.\n\nAt the time of its 2007 sale, the price paid at auction for the Guennol Lioness was the highest paid for a sculpture to that date.

Its historical significance is that it was made about the same time as the first known use of the wheel, the development of cuneiform writing, and the emergence of the first cities.\n\nMany ancient Near East deities were represented as anthropomorphic figures. Such images evoked the Mesopotamian belief in attaining power over the physical world by combining the superior physical attributes of various species. It is possible that the nearby Sumerians borrowed this powerful artistic hybrid from the Proto-Elamites. The lioness was the frequent subject of veneration among cultures familiar with the well-coordinated hunting of female lions.\n", "id": "423582", "title": "Guennol Lioness"}

He succeeded his brother Wulfhere when he died in 675. Like his brother, Wulfhere, he was considered an overlord over other English kings. But he never reached the same political status as Wulfhere. His importance was in his contributions to the church. Aethelred ruled Mercia until his in 704. He stepped down to retire to the monastery at Bardney.\n\nAethelred was a son of King Penda. At about the same time he succeeded his brother to the throne he married Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. Aethelred attacked Kent in 676 to get Hlothhere of Kent back in line as a vassal of Mercia. He destroyed much of that kingdom as well as sacked Rochester. In 679 Aethelred continued the struggle his father and brother had with Northumbria. He found Ecgfrith of Northumbria waiting for him on the River Trent which divided north and south Mercia. In the battle, Aelfwine, the younger brother of King Ecgfrith was killed and the Northumbrians were defeated. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. For the rest of his reign Aethelred was respected as overlord of England even though Bede never listed him among the seven .\n\nAethelred was very involved in the church. He and his wife Osthryth founded Bardney abbey in Lindsey. Queen Osthryth had the bones of her uncle, Oswald of Northumbria, brought to Bardney to be buried there. This caused some resentment by the monks who at first refused to accept his bones. But they were accepted and buried in the church with all the honors due a saint. Aethelred was a close friend of Wilfrid of York. In 691 Aethelred gave the bishop sanctuary in Mercia after his exile from Northumbria. While welcomed by Aethelred he was not by Queen Osthryth. Wilfred was an old enemy of her brother king Ecgfrith of Northumbria. But Ostryth was not completely accepted in Mercia. She created the cult of Saint Oswald in Mercia which did little to help Mercians forget old feuds with Northumbria. In 697, Queen Osthryth was murdered by Mercian noblemen. She was suspected of having some part in the murder of Peada forty years earlier. By this time she had become a nun and had given up married life. In 704 Aethelred stepped down as king to become a monk. His nephew Cenred became King after him. Aethelred retired to the monastery of Bardney where his wife Osthryth had been buried. He became the abbot of Bardney although he remained aware of Mercian politics. Two years after giving up the throne he called his nephew, King Cenred, to Bardsley to ask him to remain on good terms with his old friend Bishop Wilfrid. Aethelred died in 716.\n\nAthelred married Ostryth of Northumbria. Athelred may have married a second time.

He brought Mercia back to a position of power not seen since the days of Penda and Wulfhere. Because of his authority and his use of the title \"king of the \"gens Anglorum\"\" his people began calling themselves English instead of Saxons, Jutes or Angles. But Aethelbald was not a supporter of the Church. He claimed to be Christian but he led a scandalous and wicked lifestyle. \n\nAethelbald the son of Alweo and the grandson of Penda's brother Eowa. As an and possible competitor for the throne, he was forced to leave Mercia by his cousin Ceolred. Aethelbald found refuge with his kinsman, (Saint) Guthlac of Crowland. St. Guthlac died in 714 but predicted Aethelbald would be king of Mercia. Two years later at the death of Ceolred, Aethelbald became king. One of his first acts was to begin construction of Crowland Abbey which he promised to build for Guthlac if his prediction came true. At the start of his reign Aethelbald found himself dealing with two strong kings on his borders. Ine of Wessex and Wihtred of Kent had influence in southern England. Aethelbald had influence with other southern kings. Wihtred died in 725 and Ine abdicated his throne in 726. He supported Athelheard of Wessex to become king in 726. \n\nAethelbald began taking over parts of Wessex. He obtained Berkshire in 730. Three years later he took Somerton from Wessex. Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). By 731 as Bede was finishing his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Aethelbald was overlord of all the English kingdoms south of the River Humber. In 740 Aethelbald burned York and destroyed much of Northumbria. The same year Athelheard of Wessex died and was replaced on the throne by Cuthred. Cuthred made it known he was not as weak a ruler as Athelheard and struggled against Aethelbald being his overlord. In the first three years of Cuthred's rule he warred with Mercia but made few gains. In 743 Cuthred joined Aethelbald in fighting the Welsh. In 748 Cuthred's son, Cynric, tried to his father and died in the rebellion. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the rebellion was encouraged by Aethelbald. In 752, Cuthred tried to break free of King Aethelbald. This led to a battle at Burford where Cuthred battled against Aethelbald. The battle ended up with Aethelbald fleeing the battlefield. From that time on Cuthred maintained independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign.\n\nHe influenced the selections of three succeeding Archbishops of Canterbury (in Kent). These were Tatwine in 731, Nothhelm in 734 and Cuthbert in 740. \nMercia was by this time a very wealthy kingdom and Aethelbald himself was very rich. He apparently used church funds for his own purposes. He forced monks to work on his building projects. Aethelbald not only forced himself on nuns but he promoted the same wicked behavior among monks. Saint Boniface complained to King Aethelbald of his evil ways in a letter dated . He pointed out Aethelbald had not taken a lawful wife nor had he observed chastity. He said the king had ruined his good name before men. Finally that the crimes Aethelbald had committed in convents with nuns and virgins doubled his offense. He warned the king to change his ways before he met a terrible death. This had no effect on Aethelbald. He grew impatient with and interfered with their privileges. Only in his later years did he develop a less high-handed way of dealing with the Church. \n\nIn 757 Aethelbald was murdered at night by one of his own . The throne was by Beornred temporarily until Offa came to power the same year Aethelbald died. Aethelbald maintained his overlordship of all the south English kingdoms for longer than any other . He did this partially by force; Aethelbald was a great war leader. He did this partly through his great wealth through tributes paid to him by other kings. He could afford a large labor force as well as a large army. He also attempted to use the great wealth of the Church to his own advantage. But he also gave grants to the church for building monasteries. He attended great church councils that would not have taken place without his support. He was a powerful king but a less than an ideal Christian.\n", "id": "423831", "title": "Aethelbald of Mercia"}

All the same, it does strangely make a kind of sense.\n\nIn an early scene Alice in wonderland finds the verse \"Jabberwocky\". She says (p24)\n\"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly I don't exactly know what they are\".\nThis is now thought to be one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has given us nonsense words and neologisms such as \"galumphing\" and \"chortle\".\n\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll. Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or \"lügenmärchen\". \nJohn Tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871, and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem.\n\nThe illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology. The works of Darwin and the models of dinosaurs at the Crystal Palace Exhibition helped feed the interest. Perhaps it is not so surprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long scaly neck and tail of a sauropod\".\n\nJabberwocky\n\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n\"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\"\n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the Manxome foe he sought—\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\nAnd as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\n\nOne, two! One, two! and through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n\n\"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nMany of the words in the poem are playful words of Carroll's own invention, without special meaning. When Alice has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions: \n\n'It seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's rather hard to understand!' (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate'\nIn \"Through the Looking-Glass\", the character of Humpty Dumpty explains to her the nonsense words from the first stanza of the poem. However, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. An analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book \"The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner.\n", "id": "423921", "title": "Jabberwocky"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424116", "text": "Thomas Wyatt\n\nSir Thomas Wyatt (1503–1542) was an English poet and diplomat. He gets credit for bringing the into the English language. A sonnet is a special type of poem with 14 lines. He was \"the Renaissance ideal—soldier, statesman, courtier, lover, scholar, and poet.”\n\nWyatt was born at Allington near Maidstone, Kent, England in 1503. His father was Henry Wyatt and his mother was named Ann Skinner. Henry Wyatt was loyal to King Henry VII of England. This allowed Henry to have many high-ranking positions in the King's court. Thomas Wyatt went to St John's College, Cambridge, from 1515 to 1522. He was twelve when he first entered the college. At age 17 in 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke. His wife was the daughter of Lord Cobham. They had two children, Thomas and Bess. However, the marriage was unhappy. Wyatt once wrote a letter to his son that put blame in both parents for the bad marriage, \"but chiefly [mostly] in her.\" Both Thomas Wyatt and his wife Elizabeth cheated on each other. After his wife had two children, the couple was separated.\n\nWyatt got his first position at court in 1516. In this year he was \"sewer extraordinary,\" an attendant or page at the christening of Princess Mary. He was probably able to get this position so young because his father Henry had such a good reputation with the King. In 1524, Wyatt was named keeper of the King's jewels. In these early years at court, Wyatt met Anne Boleyn. Many thought they were lovers at this time, but there is no proof. In 1526, Wyatt began his career as a diplomat. Wyatt was sent to Paris, France with Sir Thomas Cheney. Cheney was one of the many people who liked Wyatt. In a letter, Cheney said Wyatt had \"as much wit...as any young man hath in England.\"\n\nA year later, Wyatt was sent to the Vatican in Rome and Venice, Italy with Sir John Russell. It was probably during these trips that Wyatt became interested in French and Italian poetry. While Wyatt was in Venice, he was taken prisoner by Spanish troops. They wanted England to pay 3,000 ducats to set him free. Today that is close to 300,000 USD. Wyatt escaped before the money was paid.\n\nFrom 1528 to 1530, Wyatt was High Marshal of the town of Calais. During these years, Wyatt continued to have interest in French and Italian poetry. Two important poets he read were Petrarch and Ludovico Ariosto. From 1530 to 1536, King Henry VIII sent him on many shorter diplomatic missions. In 1533, Wyatt represented his father in a position called \"chief sewer\" at Anne Boleyn's (when she was made queen).\n\nIn May of 1534, Wyatt was imprisoned in Fleet Prison for killing one of the guard in London in a fight. This was a minor offense, so he was released quickly. But in 1536, Anne Boleyn was arrested and beheaded. She had been accused of having other lovers while married to King Henry. Around this time, Wyatt was also arrested and locked up in the Tower of London. No reason was given for Wyatt's arrest, but there were rumors that it had something to do with Anne Boleyn. It is still unclear today whether Anne Boleyn and Thomas Wyatt ever had an affair. Some of Wyatt's poems make this seem true. Nicholas Sanders, a Catholic poet, thought that Wyatt told King Henry VIII not to marry her because she was impure. He thought that Wyatt told the King about their affair to convince the King not to marry Anne. Sanders said that Wyatt was released because he had tried to warn the King that Anne would be a bad wife. Wyatt's grandson, George Wyatt, disagreed. George Wyatt said that his grandfather never had an affair with Boleyn because she rejected him. Whether or not Wyatt had a relationship with Boleyn, he was released from prison after a month. He was soon given several promotions. The promotions show that either the King forgave Wyatt or that he wasn't very mad at Wyatt in the first place. Soon, Wyatt became the Sheriff of Kent.\n\nIn 1537, Wyatt became a knight. He also began an affair with Elizabeth Darell, who had a son. Afterwards, he was sent to Spain to live in an embassy. His mission in Spain was to improve the relationship between the Holy Roman Emperor, Emperor Charles V, and King Henry VIII of England. Emperor Charles V was unhappy with the King of England because he divorced the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. This was especially bad because the King had originally asked the Pope for special permission to marry Catherine, who was the widow of the King's older brother Arthur. The embassy was a disaster. Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other ambassadors, Edmund Bonner and Simon Heynes, were all unsuccessful. Also, Bonner disliked Wyatt. Bonner accused Wyatt of treason (and of liking papists, or Catholics). These accusations were cleared by Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell was the chief minister to Henry VIII and often protected Wyatt.\n\nIn May 1539, Wyatt returned to London. In 1540, Cromwell was arrested and beheaded. Without Cromwell's protection, Bonner got Wyatt arrested for treason. King Henry VIII, who liked Wyatt, released him with a condition: Wyatt had to leave Darell and return to his wife. Even though Wyatt was forced to separate from Darell in 1541, she and their son were still in Wyatt's will when he died.\n\nAfter Wyatt again had the King's favor, he was sent on more missions to France and Flanders. In 1542, he was elected a member of Parliament from Kent. On the 3rd of October of the same year, Wyatt was sent to take an ambassador from Spain from Dorset to London. He rode for days with the ambassador but then Wyatt got sick from the journey. He fought a fever for three days and then died at Sherborne, Dorset. On October 11, 1542 he was laid to rest in the Horsely family vault in the church at Sherborne. Some poets wrote elegies (poems of mourning) for Wyatt. One of the most famous was by Wyatt's friend Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He wrote: \"Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest.\" Surrey also thought that Wyatt \"reft Chaucer the glory of his wit\" (i.e. he stole Chaucer's title as the wittiest writer).\n\nWyatt wrote in many forms. These forms include sonnets, songs, lyric poems, and rondeaux. A rondeau is a strict poem with 13 lines and two rhymes. It also involves a repeat of the beginning of the first line. The repeat usually comes at lines 8 and 13. Sonnets are poems with 14 lines. Today we usually divide sonnets into English or Shakespearean sonnets and Italian or Petrarchan sonnets. Petrarchan sonnets are named for the Italian poet Petrarch. Petrarchan sonnets are grouped into an octave (a set of 8 lines) and a sestet (a set of 6 lines). It has the rhyme pattern abba abba cddece. Wyatt translated many of Petrarch's poems into English. Wyatt was the first to use the form we now call the Shakespearean sonnet. It is a poem of 14 lines grouped into three quatrains (a set of four lines) and a couplet (a set of two lines). It has the rhyme pattern abab cdcd efef gg. William Shakespeare came after Wyatt, but he often used the type of sonnet Wyatt invented. In fact, Shakespeare used it so often that the sonnet form was named after Shakespeare instead of Wyatt.\n\nWyatt's songs, sonnets, lyric poems and rondeaux were usually about love. Few of his works were published while he was alive. Those that were published during his lifetime were usually published without his name attached. 96 of Wyatt's songs were published with Surrey's work in \"Songes and Sonettes, Written by the Ryght Honorable Lorde Henry Haward Late Earle of Surrey, and Other.\" This volume was published in 1557 by Richard Tottel. It is now more commonly called \"Tottel's Miscellany.\" He wrote other songs that were found in other manuscripts. The main theme of his 200 songs was how he was treated badly by his mistress. Wyatt writes about both sexual and political betrayal, and sometimes mixes the two. Wyatt wrote 31 sonnets. Ten of his sonnets were translations from Petrarch.\n\nWyatt also wrote three satires and a series of 7 penitential psalms. Both his psalms and his satires were in \"terza rima.\" Wyatt was the first to use \"terza rima\" in English. This form is where you have sets of three lines that rhyme in the following pattern: aba bcb cdc and on. He also brought \"ottava rima\" to English. \"Ottava rima\" is a set of eight lines with the rhyme pattern abababcc. For bringing so many different forms to English poetry, Wyatt was called \"one of two chief lanterns of light\" to future English poets by George Puttenham in 1598. The other lantern was the Earl of Surrey.\n\nWyatt's work was read less during the 17th Century, but was picked up again in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time, \"Tottel’s Miscellany\" was seen as a marker for the beginning of \"Italianized\" English poetry. But readers from the 18th and 19th Centuries did not think Wyatt's work was as good as Shakespeare's or Sidney's, who came after him. Also, 18th and 19th century readers liked Surrey's poetry better than Wyatt's poetry. This was true even after they discovered that Wyatt's poetry came first. In his History of English Poetry (1781), Thomas Warton wrote that Wyatt \"is confessedly inferior to Surrey... He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet.’’ This view changed in the 20th century between the two World Wars. Today, many scholars think Wyatt was the better poet.\n\n", "id": "424116", "title": "Thomas Wyatt"}

It is a non-profit, non-governmental organization. It analyses and promote the understanding of major international issues and current affairs. \n\nChatham House is one of the world's leading organizations in this area. It takes its name from its premises, a Grade I listed 18th-century house in St. James's Square, once occupied by three British prime ministers, including William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham.\n\nIn a recent report, Chatham House is ranked the second most influential think tank in the world after the Brookings Institution, and the world's most influential non-US think tank. In 2009, Chatham House was also named the top non-US think tank by \"Foreign Policy\" magazine.\n\nChatham House has distinguished presidents from each of the three main political parties at Westminster: Sir John Major, former UK Prime Minister, Lord Ashdown, former EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Baroness Scotland, the former Attorney General.\n\nThe think tank was founded in 1920 as the British Institute of International Affairs. The first chairman was Robert Cecil, a leading conservative politician. Historian Arnold Toynbee later became director. The Council on Foreign Relations, its American sister institute, was established the following year. \n\nChatham House's well-known headquarters at 10 St. James's Square, London, was donated to the institute in 1923. It had been the house of three British Prime Ministers - Pitt the Elder, Edward Stanley and William Ewart Gladstone.\n\nIn 1926, now with its royal charter, the name was changed to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. However, it is usually referred to as \"Chatham House\".\nIt is just a few metres from the former Libyan embassy building where the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege took place.\n\nThe BBC Today/Chatham House lecture series promotes debate and discussion on key international issues of the day. At the inaugural lecture in 2006, Condoleezza Rice defended the U.S. decision to go to war with Iraq.\n\nWith its members, Chatham House aims to promote debate on significant developments in international affairs and policy responses. Their independent research and analysis on global, regional and country-specific challenges is intended to offer new ideas to decision makers on how these could best be tackled from the near to the long term.\nChatham House is routinely used as a source of information for media organizations seeking background or experts upon matters involving major international issues.\n\nIt has been alleged that Chatham House reflects a pro-establishment view of the world. It does have donations from large corporations, governments and other organizations, but Chatham House is membership-based and anyone may join. Chatham House currently has international leaders from business, diplomacy, science, politics and media as its individual members.\n\nChatham House is the origin of the anonymity rule known as the Chatham House Rule. Guests attending a seminar may discuss the results of the seminar in the outside world, but may not discuss who attended or what any person said. The Chatham House Rule helps frank and honest discussion on controversial or unpopular issues by speakers. Despite this, most meetings at Chatham House are actually held on the record, and not under the Chatham House Rule.\n", "id": "424153", "title": "Chatham House"}

They have lasted over 40 years, and still perform to this day.\n\nThe name of the band was dreamt up by the band's founder Adge Cutler. It appears to be short for mangelwurzel, a type of beetroot grown to feed livestock.\n\nThe Wurzels' particular genre of music was called Scrumpy and Western after the group's first EP of the same name, issued early in 1967. Scrumpy is slang for the potent cider made in southwest England, popular amongst The Wurzels and their fans, and often referred to in their songs.\n\nThe Wurzels were formed in 1966 as a backing group for singer/songwriter Adge Cutler. With a thick Somerset accent, Adge played on his West Country roots, singing many folk songs with local themes such as cider making (and drinking), farming, dung-spreading, local villages and industrial work songs, often with a comic slant.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1960s, the band became immensely popular regionally, and the release of the single \"Drink Up Thy Zider\" in 1966 led to national fame and it reaching number 45 in the UK chart. The B-side \"Twice Daily\" was banned by the BBC for being too raunchy. A number of live albums were recorded at local pubs and clubs.\n\nAdge Cutler died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MG sports car which overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge. He was returning alone from a Wurzels show in Hereford in May 1974. He is buried in Nailsea.\n\nAdge's death marked a turning point in the history of the Wurzels. Deprived of the main song-writing talent, the remaining Wurzels recorded \"The Wurzels Are Scrumptious!\" in 1975, an album containing many favourites from the back catalogue, including a number of previously unrecorded Cutler-written songs. In order to continue the surviving band needed its own songs, and these mostly took the formula of re-written popular pop songs of the time with the lyrics changed to include the usual Wurzel themes (cider, farming, local villages, Cheddar cheese, etc.)\n\nIn 1976, the Wurzels released \"The Combine Harvester\", a re-work of the song \"Brand New Key\", by Melanie, which became a UK hit, topping the charts for 2 weeks. The band quickly followed its success with \"I Am A Cider Drinker\" (a rework of the \"Una Paloma Blanca\" melody), which got to number three in the charts, and \"Farmer Bill's Cowman\" (a reworking of the Whistling Jack Smith instrumental \"I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman\").\n\nThe Wurzels have never stopped performing. The group signed to Cumbria record label Loose Records & Music, and recorded four new new songs including the single \"I Wanna Be An Eddie Stobart Driver\" (released as a limited edition lorry-shaped disc).\n\nThe late 1990s saw the fortunes of the surviving Wurzels revive, gaining cult status among students and a resurgence in their native West Country. Under the new management of The Stranglers manager Sil Willcox a number of CD releases followed, largely featuring re-recordings of older works. \"Never Mind The Bullocks, Ere's The Wurzels\" had covers of British rock songs. The album title and cover were a spoof on \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\".\n\nTheir latest album is \"A Load More Bullocks\" (2010) for the CIA label.\n", "id": "424206", "title": "The Wurzels"}

Hearing is a biological process that can be scientifically explained, but listening is a psychological process of what happens to sounds as we interpret and use them. It is a cognitive activity.\n\nIn psychology, speech is part of pragmatics, a field which deals with signs and their interpretation. The signs in question are called \"speech acts\".\n\nTo listen means to try and understand what has been said. Listening is often one side of a conversation. Asking questions helps one understand what has been said. A subject can be better understood by asking the correct questions.\n\nListening differs from obeying. Parents often say to a disobedient child that he \"didn't listen to me\", meaning, he heard but didn't do as was suggested.\n\nListening also applies to sounds, not just language. It is \"active\" hearing. We hear a sound, and know what it means. This applies to animals as well. Cats list in the long grass for the little sounds that mice make. So perhaps a better description of listening is \"deliberate hearing to get the meaning of sounds\".\n", "id": "424364", "title": "Listening"}

He claimed to be a descendant of a Cenwalh, a brother of Penda and Eowa. The sudden death of King Ecgfrith of Mercia was suspicious and certainly benefited Coenwulf but he was never formally accused. Coenwulf proved to be a strong king who quickly restored Mercian in southern England. He was the last of the Mercian overlords or .\n\nCoenwulf was the son of Cuthbert, a Mercian nobleman. He came to the throne in 796, the same year Offa and his son Ecgfrith both died. At the same time Coenwulf became king, Eadberht Praen set himself up as king of Kent. An Eadwald set himself up as king of the East Angles and began issuing coins. When Eadberht Praen expelled Aethelheard, the Archbishop of Canterbury from Kent, Coenwulf contacted Pope Leo III and got permission to remove the new Kentish king. Eadbert attacked Kent, and captured Eadbert. He then set up his brother Cuthred as king of Kent. Coenwulf then dealt with East Anglia where Eadwald had tried to gain independence from Mercia. In 799 Coenwulf made a peace treaty with Wessex. He restored Mercian power to southern England very quickly. He then began using the style of Charlemagne calling himself king and emperor. He attacked the Welsh making raids on Gwynedd and Powys. In one of these battles Caradog ap Meirion, the king of Gwynedd was killed. In 801 King Eardwulf of Northumbria attacked Mercia. He accused Coenwulf of giving refuge to his enemies. Eventually the two made peace on equal terms. This was through the mediations of several bishops and nobles.\nCoenwulf wanted all the English churches placed under the authority of a single archbishop. But he wanted him seated in London, not Canterbury. He managed to abolish the of Lichfield in 803. Coenwulf tried to convince the pope on moving the remaining archbishopric to London. But the pope felt that Coenwulf's success in bringing Kent under his control meant the move was no longer necessary. So the archbishop remained in Canterbury, Kent. When Archbishop Aethelheard died in 805, his Wulfred was appointed the new archbishop. Wulfred witnessed charters for Coenwulf from 805 to 817 but then promptly stopped. Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf quarreled for several years. It may have started over a claim by Coenwulf to various lands held by the see of Canterbury. Wulfred in turn began minting coins without the name of King Coenwulf. Finally in 817 Coenwulf took Wulfred's monasteries of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet. Then he brought charges against Wulfred to Pope Paschal I. As a result, Wulfred was relieved of many of his duties by the pope. In 821 Coenwulf summoned the archbishop to appear before him in London. There Wulfred was fined 120 pounds and an estate of 250 hides He was then restored to his duties as archbishop. In 818 he was again attacking the Britons in Dyfed. He was planning another campaign against Wales when he died in 821. He was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf I of Mercia. Coenwulf was buried at Winchcombe abbey where his daughter Cwenthryh was later . A lead seal belonging to King Coenwulf was found during the 19th century in Italy.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424795", "text": "Machine pistol\n\nA machine pistol is a typically a -style firearm that can fire fully automatic or burst fire. Fully automatic means that the gun will continue to fire very rapidly so long as the trigger is pressed and held. Burst fire means that when you pull the trigger, a number of shots determined by the shooter will be fired (for some guns, this is three shots, fired very quickly). Machine pistols fire pistol cartridges. Machine pistols usually have the cartridges fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box which holds the cartridges.\nMachine pistols are usually self-loading, which means that the gun automatically loads a new cartridge into the chamber after a shot is fired. \n\nThe first true machine pistol was the German MP-18 introduced in 1918. It fired the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. It used a side-loading magazine that held 20 cartridges. \n\nThe Germans converted some guns, like the Luger, into machine pistols. They invented a type of Luger called the Luger P08 in World War I to German artillery crews. It had a longer barrel and a 32 round magazine shaped like a round drum. It was given to artillery crews so they could defend themselves.\n\nIn 1951 the Russian army developed the Stechkin APS, which could fire in burst fire or in fully automatic fire. When the gun was used in burst or automatic fire, users were told to use the wooden stock so that they can control the weapon better. One of the problems with machine pistols is they tend to rise up when being fired, making the bullets miss their target.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, as more soldier began wearing bulletproof vests with hard ceramic armor, the machine pistol became less useful in a military setting. The low-powered pistol ammunition was not able to penetrate ceramic-plated Kevlar military vests. As a result, armies began to issue a new gun, the personal defense weapon or PDW. The PDW fires armor-piercing, higher-powered ammunition which can go through bulletproof vests.\n\n", "id": "424795", "title": "Machine pistol"}

Although costly to both sides, King Egbert won. The battle effectively brought an end to Mercian in southern England. It gave Wessex over the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the south. A century later the kingdom of Wessex became the kingdom of England.\n\nDuring the 8th century and early 9th centuries, the kings of Mercia exercised varying degrees of overlordship over the kingdoms of south-eastern England. Some even ruled other kingdoms directly. While Wessex had at times been obliged to recognise the power of Mercian kings there was usually a strong resistance to allowing them to directly rule Wessex.\n\nBeorhtric of Wessex (786–802) had probably received help from Offa of Mercia (757–796) in becoming king of Wessex. In 789 he married Eadburh, Offa's daughter. For the remainder of his rule Wessex was subordinate to Mercia. At the time Beorhtric became king, Egbert was also a claimant. Edgar was exiled for a time from Wessex and spent most of his time at the court of Charlemagne. On the death of Beorhtric Egbert returned and succeeded to the throne. At this time Coenwulf of Mercia (796–821) was king and he concluded a peace treaty with Wessex.\n\nIn 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. \nBeginning in 825 Egbert began a series of military operations with the intent of increasing his over Wales. At the same time the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, having had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex decided to invade Wessex.\n\nEgbert was in Cornwall with his army when he received word that the Mercians had invaded Wessex. He led his army back into Wessex and met Beornwulf and his army at Ellendun (now Wroughton south of Swindon). In what Frank Stenton called \"one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history\", Egbert defeated Beornwulf. The battle was costly to both sides in loss of life. Henry of Huntingdon said the river ran red with blood. The victory over Mercia shifted the balance of power to Egbert. He was now the most accomplished king in southern England.\n\nImmediately Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king in Kent. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.\n\nIn 829 Egbert invaded, then defeated all of Mercia. Wiglaf was exiled. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London. In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839. He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine.\n", "id": "424943", "title": "Battle of Ellandun"}

It was based on the M16 rifle.\n\nThe M4 is a gas-operated, shoulder-fired weapon. The cartridges are fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box that holds the cartridges. It has a stock that can be extended or pushed in and a 14.5 in (370 mm) barrel to make it easier for soldiers to use the weapon in confined spaces. Like the other rifles in the M16 family, it fires the .223 caliber, or 5.56mm NATO round.\n\nThe M4 can be fired in two ways, either semi-automatic (which fires one bullet when the trigger is pulled) and three-round burst (which fires three bullets very quickly when the trigger is pulled). The M4A1 can fire fully automatic instead of three-round burst. The carbine can have an M203 grenade as well as the newer M320 grenade launcher mounted on it. The M4 can be fitted with many accessories, such as night vision devices, silencers, laser pointers, telescopic sights, bipods, a shotgun, and forward hand grips.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has ordered its officers (up to the rank of lieutenant colonel) and staff non-commissioned officers to carry the M4 carbine instead of the M9 pistol. The M4 is also widely used by police officers.\n\nThe plastic pistol was developed and produced for the United States government by Colt Firearms, which had an exclusive contract to produce the M4 family of weapons through 2009. Colt previously held a U.S. trademark on the term \"M4\".\n\nOther manufacturers offer M4-like firearms. Many manufacturers have production firearms that are essentially identical to a military M4, but with a 16\" barrel. Civilian models are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"M4gery\", a portmanteau word from \"M4\" and \"forgery\". \n\nColt said it held sole rights to the M4 name and design. Other manufacturers said that Colt was overstating its rights, and that \"M4\" was now a generic term for a shortened AR-15. On December 8, 2005, a District court judge ruled that \"M4\" \"was\" now a generic name, and that Colt's trademark should be revoked.\n", "id": "425059", "title": "M4 carbine"}

The author wrote it because he did not like Booker T. Washington, an African-American political leader, teacher and author, attending a dinner at the White House. Washington had been invited by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was Caucasian. Many years later, in 1929, the poem appeared again. This was after African-American congressman Oscar DePriest's wife went to a tea for congressional wives at the White House. She had been invited by First Lady Lou Hoover. Many people, especially in the Southern United States, did not like either visit. Many held the opinion then that African-American people should not be involved in government affairs.\n\nThe poem has fourteen stanzas. Each stanza has four lines. The second and fourth line of each stanza rhymes. The bad word \"nigger\" is seen many times in the poem. Nobody knows who wrote it.\n\nBooker T. Washington was an African American born into slavery. He was freed in 1865 and rose to become an educator and a national leader of African Americans. On October 16, 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt asked Washington to have dinner with his family at the White House. It was a working dinner, Roosevelt's intention was to appoint Washington to advise him on issues of race. A family friend from Colorado, Philip Stewart was also there. A reporter from the AP Wire asked the president about his appointments he was going to announce the next day. But the story that appeared in the AP wire read: \"Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Alabala, dined with the President last evening.\" This caused some shock among many people. The President of the United States had sat down to dinner with a black man, a former slave at that. African Americans had visited the White House before but had never been asked to dine there. Washington had dined with President McKinley previously which also caused an uproar at that time. This time segregationalists in the U.S. Congress were outraged. Senator \"Pitchfork\" Bill Tillman of South Carolina said, \"The action will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again.\"\n\nAfter this, somebody decided to write the poem, \"Niggers in the White House\". No one knows who the author was.\n\nMany years later, in 1929, First Lady Lou Hoover, wife of president Herbert Hoover, invited Congressional wife Jessie DePriest to join her for tea. She was a black woman married to Oscar DePriest, the first African American to be elected to Congress from Illinois. People were also upset about this. The poem appeared again because of this incident. Southern newspapers and racist critics reacted with their normal outrage and letters of protest. The White House spokesman pointed out the president and his wife were simply doing their constitutional duties. As examples President Grover Cleveland had hosted Frederick Douglass and his wife On five separate occasions president Woodrow Wilson met at the White House with the black minister from Haiti, Solon Menos. \n\nPoliticians took sides. Senator Coleman Blease from South Carolina inserted the poem in a Senate resolution. The resolution with its poem were rejected and removed from the \"Congressional Record.\" The vote was based on protests from senators Walter Edge (from New Jersey) and Hiram Bingham (from Connecticut). Senator Bingham described the poem as \"indecent, obscene doggerel verse\" which gave \"offense to hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens and an offense to the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.\" Senator Baise then agreed to withdraw the resolution he said, as a favor to Senator Bingham and not to the negro race.\n\n", "id": "425125", "title": "Niggers in the White House"}

It is designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing, bludgeoning, and penetrating attacks. \n\nIt was first used to protect soldiers, today it is used to protect riot police, private security guards and bodyguards. There are two different types of armour. There is regular non-plated personal armor used by most police, security guards and bodyguards. There is also hard-plate reinforced personal armor, which is used by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\n\nArmour is certainly very ancient, but it was little used in infantry warfare for quite a long time, with the exception of helmets. From about the 18th century to the Vietnam war, men fought relatively unprotected. The weight and cost of effective armour meant it was no longer practical to have infantrymen armoured.\n\nThe invention of carbon fibre, modern hard ceramics and various plastic compounds are suitable for light armour which is effective in many circumstances. Kevlar, Technora and Nomex are Aramids, which are long-chain aromatic polyamides. They are used to make bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a main component, as do their replacements. Most of these items have padding on the inside to act as shock-absorbers, and to increase comfort during while being worn.\n\nSo, with the lighter weight and increased stopping-power of personal armour, the modern soldier is once again protected against most of the weapons of the day.\n\nIn December 2009, during the War in Afghanistan, a British soldier in southern Helmand Province, survived a shot to the back during an operation to clear insurgents from a village, protected by the body armor kit he was wearing.\n", "id": "425169", "title": "Body armour"}

The resistance wanted to free Warsaw from Nazi Germany.\n\nThe attack happened at the same time as the Soviet Union's Red Army got close to the east of the city and the German forces retreated. However, the Soviets stopped moving forward. This allowed the Germans to destroy the city and defeat the Polish resistance.\n\nThe resistance fought for 63 days with little help from other Allied armies. The Uprising was the largest attack done by any European resistance movement of World War II.\n\nThe uprising began on 1 August 1944. It was part of a big plan, Operation \"Tempest\", which started when the Soviet Army got near Warsaw. The goals of the Polish resistance were to push the German troops out of the city. They also wanted to free Warsaw before the Soviets arrived. This would help the Polish Underground State to take control of the city.\n\nAt the start of the battle, the Polish resistance got control over most of central Warsaw. The Soviets did not move into the city to help the resistance troops.\n\nBy 14 September, Polish forces under Soviet command captured the east bank of the Vistula river. The Soviet army did not help the Poles. The Soviets did not use their military planes to help the Poles.\n\nWinston Churchill asked Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help the Polish troops, but the Soviets would not help the Poles. Churchill sent over 200 drops of supplies by air. The US Army Air Force sent one drop of supplies by air.\n\nAbout 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 were badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians were executed. Jews being hidden by Poles were found by the Germans.\n\nThe Germans had over 8,000 soldiers killed and missing, and 9,000 wounded. During the fighting in the city approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops destroyed 35% of the city.\n\nBy July 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi German troops for almost five years. The Polish Home Army was loyal to the Polish government in London. It had planned to attack the Germans. Germany was fighting a group of Allied powers, led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe initial plan of the Home Army was to join with the invading forces of the Western Allies as they freed Europe from the Nazis. However, in 1943, the Soviets were about to reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the Allied invasion of Europe got very far.\n\nThe Soviets and the Poles were both enemies of Nazi Germany. But they had different goals. The Home Army wanted a democratic capitalist Poland that was allied with the West. The Soviet leader Stalin wanted to make Poland a communist country that was allied to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Soviets and the Poles did not trust each other. Soviet partisans in Poland often had disagreements with Polish resistance troops that were allied to the Home Army.\n\nStalin stopped all Polish-Soviet relations on 25 April 1943 after the Germans told the world about the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers. Stalin refused to admit that he ordered the killings.\n\nThe Home Army commander, Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski made a plan on 20 November, called Operation \"Tempest\". On the Eastern Front, local units of the Home Army were to attack the German \"Wehrmacht\" and help Soviet troops.\n\nOn 13 July 1944 as the Soviet attack crossed the old Polish border, the Poles had to make a decision. They could either start to attack the Germans, which might not be supported by the Soviets, or do no attacks and be criticized by the Soviets.\n\nThe Poles were worried that if Poland was freed from German occupation by the Red Army, then the Allies would not accept the Polish government in London after the war.\n\nWhen the Poles saw the actions of the Soviet forces, they realized they needed to make a decision. In Operation \"Ostra Brama\", Soviet security forces shot or arrested Polish officers and forced lower ranks to join the Soviet-controlled forces.\n\nOn 21 July, the Home Army decided to launch Operation \"Tempest\" in Warsaw soon. The plan was intended as a way of showing Poland was its own country and as an attack against the German occupiers. On 25 July, the Polish government-in-exile (against the views of Polish Commander-in-Chief General Kazimierz Sosnkowski) approved the plan for an uprising in Warsaw.\n\nIn the early summer of 1944, German plans required Warsaw to be the defensive centre of the area. The Germans wanted to hold onto Warsaw no matter how many losses they had. The Germans had build fortifications and sent many new troops to the area. This slowed after the failed 20 July plot to kill the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The German troops in Warsaw were weak and they did not feel confident.\n\nHowever, by the end of July, German forces in the area had new troops sent to them. On 27 July, the Governor of the Warsaw District, Ludwig Fischer, called for 100,000 Polish men and women to build fortifications around the city. The inhabitants of Warsaw did not follow his demand.\n\nThe Home Army became worried about possible revenge actions by the Germans or mass arrests, which would make it hard for the Poles to start an attack. The Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw, and Soviet-controlled radio stations called for the Polish people to attack the Germans.\n\nOn 25 July, the Union of Polish Patriots made a radio broadcast from Moscow. It told Poles to attack the Germans. On 29 July, the first Soviet tanks reached the edges of Warsaw. They were counter-attacked by two German Panzer Corps: the 39th and 4th SS. On 29 July 1944 Radio Station Kosciuszko located in Moscow told Poles to \"Fight The Germans!\". \n\nBór-Komorowski and several senior officers held a meeting on that day. Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, who had arrived from London, said support from the Allies would be weak. On 31 July, the Polish commanders General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski and Colonel Antoni Chruściel ordered the Home Army forces for to be ready by 17:00 the following day.\n\nThe Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered between 20,000\n\nOther partisan groups joined under Home Army command, and many volunteers joined during the fighting, including Jews freed from the Gęsiówka concentration camp in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nColonel Antoni Chruściel (codename \"Monter\") commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas. \n\nOn 20 September, they were changed to match the three areas of the city held by Polish forces. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps () and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel—promoted from Colonel on 14 September—formed into three infantry divisions (Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów).\n\nDuring the fighting, the Poles obtained additional supplies through airdrops and by capture from the enemy (including several armoured vehicles, two Panther tanks and two Sd.Kfz. 251 APCs). Also, the insurgents' workshops produced weapons throughout the fighting, including submachine guns, K pattern flamethrowers, grenades, mortars, and even an armoured car ().\n\nIn late July 1944 the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first was the garrison of Warsaw. As of 31 July, it had 11,000 troops under General Rainer Stahel.\n\nThese German forces had good weapons. They had prepared for the defence of the city for many months. Several hundred concrete bunkers and barbed wire protected the Germans.\n\nApart from the garrison troops, German army units were on both banks of the Vistula and in the city. The second category was formed by police and SS under Col. Paul Otto Geibel, numbering initially 5,710 men, including \"Schutzpolizei\" and \"Waffen-SS\". The third category was formed by auxiliary units, including detachments of the \"Bahnschutz\" (rail guard), \"Werkschutz\" (factory guard), \"Sonderdienst\" and \"Sonderabteilungen\" (military Nazi party units).\n\nDuring the uprising, the German side received new troops every day. Stahel was replaced as overall commander by SS-General Erich von dem Bach in early August. As of 20 August 1944, the Germans fighting in Warsaw included 17,000 men arranged in two battle groups:\n\nBattle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr), which included Bronislav Kaminski's brigade and Battle Group Reinefarth (commanded by SS-\"Gruppenführer\" Heinz Reinefarth) consisted of Attack Group Dirlewanger (commanded by Oskar Dirlewanger), Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck), Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt) and various support units.\n\nAt 17:00 on 31 July, the Polish army decided to start the uprising at 17:00 on the following day. The decision was a mistake because the poorly-equipped Polish forces were only prepared for night attacks. Attacking during daylight meant that Poles were shot by German machine gun fire.\n\nAlthough many partisan groups were waiting throughout the city, the movement of thousands of young men and women was hard to hide. Some fighting started before the official attack time, notably in Żoliborz, and around Napoleon Square and Dąbrowski Square.\n\nThe Germans had realized that the Poles might attack them. However, they did not realize the Poles could do such a large attack. At 16:30, the German troops were told to be ready for an attack.\nThat evening the Poles captured a major German weapons building, the main post office and power station, Praga railway station and the tallest building in Warsaw, the Prudential building. However, Castle Square, the police district, and the airport were held by the Germans.\n\nThe Poles were most successful in the City Centre, Old Town, and Wola districts. However, several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola the Poles had to retreat.\n\nIn other areas such as Mokotów, the Poles controlled only the residential areas. In Praga, on the east bank of the Vistula, the Poles were sent back into hiding by a large number of German forces.\n\nThe Polish groups had trouble getting in contact with other Polish fighting groups. By 4 August most of the city was held by Polish forces.\n\nThe uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived;however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside help. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:\n\nThe Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or \"Kedyw\" was to guard the headquarters. These units secured parts of Śródmieście and Wola; along with the units of \"Area I\", they were the most successful during the first few hours.\n\nAmong the most important targets that were not taken during the start of the uprising were the airfields of Okęcie and Mokotów Field, as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city centre and the Gdańsk railway station guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of Żoliborz.\n\nOn 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost areas of Wola and Ochota. The German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving new troops. On the same day SS General Erich von dem Bach was appointed commander of all the forces used against the Uprising.\nGerman attacks aimed to join up with the remaining German groups of troops and then block the Uprising troops from the Vistula river. Among the new units were forces under the command of Heinz Reinefarth.\nOn 5 August Reinefarth's three attack groups started their advance westward along \"Wolska\" and \"Górczewska\" streets toward the main East-West Jerusalem Avenue. Their advance was halted, but the regiments began carrying out Heinrich Himmler's orders to kill civilians. Special SS, police and \"Wehrmacht\" groups went from house to house, shooting the people and burning their bodies. \nEstimates of civilians killed in Wola and Ochota range from 20,000 to 50,000, 40,000 by 8 August in Wola alone, or as high as 100,000. The leaders of the killings were Oskar Dirlewanger and Bronislav Kaminski.\n\nThe killings of civilians were intended to stop the Poles from wanting to fight and end the uprising without having to do heavy city fighting. With time, the Germans realized that killing civilians only made the Poles' resistance stronger.\n\nThe Germans began to try to think of a political solution, because the thousands of men under the German commander were unable to win against the insurgents in an urban guerrilla setting.\n\nThey aimed to gain a significant victory to show the Home Army that further fighting had no use. They wanted the Home Army to surrender. This did not succeed. Until mid-September, the Germans shot all captured insurgents, but from the end of September, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as POWs.\n\nDespite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance got stronger. \"Zośka\" and \"Wacek\" troops captured the Warsaw Ghetto and liberate the Gęsiówka concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews.\nThe area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On 7 August German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks. The Germans put Polish civilians in front of the tanks to act as human shields.\nAfter two days of heavy fighting they managed to get through Wola and reach Bankowy Square. However, by then the barricades, street fortifications, and tank obstacles were well-prepared. Both sides reached a stalemate (a situation in which no side could win), with violent house-to-house fighting.\n\nBetween 9 and 18 August, violent battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square. The Germans and the Poles both made successful attacks. The Germans bombed the Poles with heavy artillery and bombers. The Poles could not defend themselves against the bombers, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons. Even clearly marked hospitals were dive-bombed by Stukas.\n\nAlthough the Battle of Stalingrad had already shown the danger of fighting in a city, the Warsaw Uprising showed that an under-equipped force supported by the civilian population could fight better-equipped professional soldiers.\n\nThe Poles held the Old Town until a decision to withdraw was made at the end of August. Until 2 September, the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers.\n\nSoviet attacks on the 4th SS Panzer Corps east of Warsaw were renewed on 26 August, and the Germans were forced to retreat into Praga. The Soviet army under the command of Konstantin Rokossovsky captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September.\n\nBy 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula. In the Praga area Polish units under the command of General Zygmunt Berling (thus sometimes known as \"berlingowcy\" – \"the Berling men\") fought on the Soviet side. Three patrols of his First Polish Army () landed in the Czerniaków and Powiśle areas and joined with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September.\n\nThe artillery and air bombing provided by the Soviets did not stop enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops had heavy losses. Only part of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).\nThe landings by the 1st Polish Army were the only outside ground force which arrived to support the uprising.\n\nThe Germans attacked the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings. However, they were not able to advance for several days while Polish forces held these positions in preparation for a Soviet landings.\n\nPolish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September had heavy losses (including the destruction of all their landing boats and most of their other river crossing equipment).Red Army support was inadequate. After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the insurgents, the Soviets limited their help to occasional artillery and air bombing.\n\nConditions that prevented the Germans from removing the insurgents also prevented the Poles from removing the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were stopped \"for at least 4 months\", since fighting against the 9th Army's five panzer divisions was a problem.\n\nThe commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was removed from his job by his Soviet superiors. On the night of 19 September,b no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the\nevacuation of wounded did not take place. That night. Home Army soldiers and the 1st Polish Army retreated from their positions on the bank of the river.\nOut of approximately 900 men who made it ashore only a small number made it back to the eastern shore of the Vistula. Berling's Polish Army losses in the attempt to aid the Uprising were 5,660 killed, missing or wounded.\n\nFrom this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or as a fight for good terms of surrender. The Poles were heavily attacked in three areas of the city: Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów.\n\nIn 1939 Warsaw had 1,350,000 people. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising.\n\nIn Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to have a normal life. There were many cultural activities, including theatres and newspapers. Boys and girls of the Polish Scouts delivered mail.\n\nNear the end of the Uprising, lack of food, medicine, overcrowding and German air and artillery bombing on the city made the civilian life very difficult.\n\nAs the Uprising was supposed to be helped by the Soviets in a few days, the Polish underground did not realize food shortages would be a problem.\n\nHowever, as the fighting continued, the inhabitants of the city had to deal with hunger and starvation. On 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the Haberbusch i Schiele brewery at Ceglana Street, the citizens of Warsaw lived on barley from the brewery's warehouses.\n\nEvery day several thousand people went to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a soup (). The \"Sowiński\" Battalion managed to capture the brewery until the end of the fighting.\n\nAnother serious problem for civilians and soldiers was a shortage of water.\n\nBy mid-August most of the water pipes were either not working or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station was held by the Germans.\nTo prevent the spread of diseases and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered water wells to be dug in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of drinking water in the city. By the end of September, the city centre had more than 90 functioning wells. \n\nBefore the Uprising the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Home Army had set up a group of war journalists. Headed by Antoni Bohdziewicz, the group made three newsreels and over 30,000 meters of film about the Uprising. The first newsreel was shown to the public on 13 August in the Palladium cinema at Złota Street.\n\nIn addition to films, dozens of newspapers appeared. Several underground newspapers started to be distributed openly. The two main daily newspapers were the government-run \"Rzeczpospolita Polska\" and military \"Biuletyn Informacyjny\". There were also several dozen newspapers, magazines, bulletins and weeklies published by various organizations and military units.\n\nThe \"Błyskawica\" long-range radio transmitter, assembled on 7 August in the city centre, was run by the military, but was also used by the recreated Polish Radio from 9 August.\n\nIt broadcast three or four times a day, broadcasting news programmes and appeals for help in Polish, English, German and French. It also broadcast reports from the government, patriotic poems and music. It was the only insurgent radio station in German-held Europe.\n\nAmong the speakers appearing on the insurgent radio were Jan Nowak-Jeziorański, Zbigniew Świętochowski, Stefan Sojecki, Jeremi Przybora, and John Ward, a war correspondent for \"The Times\" of London.\n\nAccording to many historians, the uprising failed because of a lack of outside support and the late arrival of the support which did arrive.\n\nThe Polish government in London tried to get support from the Western Allies before the start of battle. The allies would not help without Soviet approval. The Polish government in London asked the British several times to send allied troops to Poland, however, the British troops did not arrive until December 1944. Shortly after their arrival, the Soviet authorities arrested them.\n\nFrom August 1943 to July 1944, over 200 British Royal Air Force (RAF) flights dropped 146 Polish personnel trained in Great Britain, over 4000 containers of supplies, and $16 million in banknotes and gold to the Home Army.\n\nThe only support operation which was done all through the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the RAF, other British Commonwealth air forces, and units of the Polish Air Force. They had to use airfields in Italy, reducing the amount of supplies they could carry.\n\nThe RAF made 223 flights and lost 34 aircraft. The effect of these airdrops was mostly that they gave the insurgents a feeling of hope. The airdrops delivered too few supplies for the needs of the insurgents, and many airdrops landed outside insurgent-controlled territory.\n\nFrom 4 August the Western Allies began supporting the Uprising with airdrops of ammunition and other supplies. Initially the flights were carried out by the \"1568th Polish Special Duties Flight\" of the Polish Air Force (later renamed No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron) stationed in Bari and Brindisi in Italy. They flew B-24 Liberator, Handley Page Halifax and Douglas C-47 Dakota planes.\n\nLater on, after the Polish government-in-exile asked for more help, they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing –No.31 and No. 34 Squadrons of the South African Air Force based at Foggia in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by No. 148 and No. 178 RAF Squadrons.\n\nThe drops by British, Polish and South African forces continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops varies according to source (104 tons, 230 tonsor 239 tons\n), over 200 flights were made.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not allow the Western Allies to use its airports for the airdrops, so the planes had to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy. This reduced the weight they could carry and number of flights. The Allies' request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August.\nStalin called the insurgents \"criminals\" and stated that the uprising was started by \"enemies of the Soviet Union\".\n\nBy not giving landing rights to Allied aircraft on Soviet-controlled territory the Soviets made it hard for the Allies to help the Uprising. The Soviets fired at Allied airplanes which carried supplies from Italy and went into Soviet-controlled airspace.\nAmerican support was also limited. After Stalin's objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill telegraphed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 25 August and said they should send planes. Roosevelt did not want to upset Stalin before the Yalta Conference. Roosevelt said he would not send planes.\nFinally on 18 September the Soviets allowed a USAAF flight of 107 B-17 Flying Fortresses of the Eighth Air Force's 3rd Division to land at Soviet airfields used in Operation \"Frantic\", but it was too late to help the insurgents.\n\nThe planes dropped 100 tons of supplies but only 20 tons were picked up by the insurgents due to the wide area over which they were spread.The vast majority of supplies fell into German-held areas. The USAAF lost two B-17s with a further seven damaged. The planes landed at the Operation \"Frantic\" airbases in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe next day, 100 B-17s and 61 P-51s left the USSR to bomb Szolnok in Hungary on their way back to bases in Italy. The Soviets thought that 96% of the supplies dropped by the Americans fell into German areas.\n\nThe Soviets refused permission for any further American flights until 30 September. By this time the weather was too poor to fly, and the insurgency was nearly over.\n\nBetween 13 and 30 September Soviet planes dropped arms, medicines and food supplies. Initially these supplies were dropped without parachutes which led to damage and loss of the contents – also, a large number of canisters fell into German areas.\n\nThe Soviet Air Forces flew 2535 re-supply missions with small bi-plane Polikarpov Po-2's. They delivered a total of 156 50-mm mortars, 505 anti-tank rifles, 1478 sub-machine guns, 520 rifles, 669 carbines, 41 780 hand grenades, 37 216 mortar shells, over 3 mln. cartridges, 131.2 tons of food and 515 kg of medicine.\n\nAlthough there was almost no German air defence over the Warsaw area, about 12% of the 296 planes were lost because they had to fly 1,600 km out and the same distance back over heavily defended enemy territory (112 out of 637 Polish and 133 out of 735 British and South African airmen were shot down).\n\nMost of the drops were made during night at 100–300 feet altitude. Many parachuted packages fell into German-controlled territory (only about 50 tons of supplies, less than 50% delivered, was recovered by the insurgents).\n\nThe role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising is controversial and historians still disagree about its role.\n\nThe Uprising started when the Red Army arrived near the city. The Poles in Warsaw were expecting the Soviets to capture the city in a few days.\n\nThis approach of starting an insurgent uprising against the Germans a few days before the arrival of Allied forces was done successfully in a number of European capitals, such as Paris and Prague.\n\nHowever, despite the easy capture of the area south-east of Warsaw, the Soviets did not help the insurgents. Instead, the Soviets waited as the Germans killed the soldiers from the anti-communist Polish Home Army.\n\nAt that time, the city edges were defended by the weak German 73rd Infantry Division. The weak German defence forces were not attacked by the Soviets. This allowed the German forces to send more troops to fight against uprising in the city itself.\n\nThe Red Army was fighting battles to the south of Warsaw, to capture bridges over the Vistula river. The Red Army was fighting battles to the north of the city, to capture bridges over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting in those sectors.\n\nThe Soviet 47th Army did not move into Praga (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the uprising was over). In three days the Soviets quickly captured the suburb. The weak German 73rd Division was quickly defeated.\n\nBy mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the territory held by the Poles to one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of Czerniaków. The Poles were hoping Soviet forces would help them.\n\nThough Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, they did not get much support from the Soviets and the main Soviet force did not follow them.\n\nOne of the reasons given for the failure of the uprising was that the Soviet Red Army did not help the Resistance. On August 1, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance stopped. Soon afterwards the Soviet tanks stopped receiving any oil.\nSoviets knew of the planned Uprising from their agents in Warsaw. They also knew because Polish Prime Minister Stanisław Mikołajczyk told them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans.\n\nIf the Polish Home Army had won, the Polish government in London would have been able to return to Poland.\nAlso the destruction of the main Polish resistance forces by the Germans helped the Soviet Union, since it significantly weakened any potential Polish opposition to the Soviet occupation.\n\nStopping the advance and then capturing Warsaw in January 1945 enabled the Soviets to say they \"freed\" Warsaw.\n\nThe fact that Soviet tanks were nearby Wołomin 15 kilometers to the east of Warsaw helped convince the Home Army leaders to launch the uprising. However, as a result of the battle of Radzymin in late July, these tanks from the Soviet 2nd Tank Army were pushed out of Wołomin and back about 10 km.\n\nOn 9 August, Stalin told Premier Mikołajczyk that the Soviets had originally planned to be in Warsaw by 6 August. He said an attack by four Panzer divisions had stopped them from getting to the city. By 10 August, the Germans had surrounded and badly damaged the Soviet 2nd Tank Army at Wołomin.\nWhen Stalin and Churchill met in October 1944, Stalin told Churchill that the lack of Soviet support was due to Soviet losses in the Vistula area.\n\nGermans thought that the Soviets were trying to help the insurgents. The Germans thought it was their defence of Warsaw that prevented the Soviet advance. The Germans did not think that the Soviets did not want to advance.\n\nThe Germans published propaganda which said that both the British and Soviets did not help the Poles.\nThe Soviet units which reached the edges of Warsaw in the final days of July 1944 had advanced from the 1st Belorussian Front in Western Ukraine.\nThe Soviets defeated many German troops.\nThe Germans were trying to send new troops to hold the line of the Vistula. This was the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany.\n\nThe Germans sent in many infantry units of poor quality, and 4–5 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps.\n\nOther explanations for the Soviet lack of help to the Poles are possible. The Red Army made for a major attack into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August. A lot of Soviet troops and equipment was sent in that direction, while the attacks in Poland were stopped.\n\nStalin decided to occupy Eastern Europe, rather than moving toward Germany. The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets. They had already captured bridges to the south of Warsaw, and were defending them against German attacks.\nFinally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a plan for helping Warsaw because they did not have correct information. Propaganda from the Polish Committee of National Liberation said that the Home Army was weak and said that they were allied with the Nazis. Information submitted to Stalin by Soviet agents was often wrong.\n\nAccording to David Glantz (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation’s Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army could not help the uprising, regardless of Stalin's political goals. German military strength in August and early September stopped any Soviet help to the Poles in Warsaw. Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a hard city for the Soviets to capture from the Germans. As well, Warsaw was not a good location for future Red Army attacks.\n\nBy the first week of September both German and Polish commanders realized that the Soviet army was not going to attack and break the stalemate. The Germans thought that a longer insurgency would make it hard to hold Warsaw as the frontline. The Poles were worried that continued resistance would lead to many deaths. On 7 September, General Rohr proposed to talk, which Bór-Komorowski agreed to discuss the following day.\n\nOver the 8, 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were allowed to leave the city. Rohr recognized the right of Home Army insurgents to be treated as fighters. The Poles stopped talks on the 11th, as they received news that the Soviets were advancing through Praga. A few days later, the arrival of the 1st Polish gave the resistance confidence and the talks stopped.\nHowever, by the morning of 27 September, the Germans had recaptured Mokotów. Talks restarted on 28 September. In the evening of 30 September, Żoliborz was captured by the Germans. The Poles were being pushed into a smaller area and they were at risk of being killed. On the 30th, Hitler decorated von dem Bach, Dirlewanger and Reinefarth, while in London General Sosnkowski was dismissed as Polish commander-in-chief. Bór-Komorowski was promoted to commander-in-chief, even though he was trapped in Warsaw.\n\nBór-Komorowski and Prime Minister Mikołajczyk again asked Rokossovky and Stalin for Soviet help. None came. According to Soviet Marshal Georgy Zhukov, who was by this time at the Vistula front, both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an attack because of heavy Soviet losses.\n\nThe surrender order of the remaining Polish forces was signed on 2 October. All fighting ceased that evening. According to the agreement, the \"Wehrmacht\" promised to treat Home Army soldiers in accordance with the Geneva Convention, and to treat the civilian population humanely.\n\nThe next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. They later sent 15,000 of them to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Between 5,000 and 6,000 insurgents decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later. The entire civilian population of Warsaw was removed from the city and sent to camp \"Durchgangslager\" 121 in Pruszków.\n\nOut of 350,000–550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including Ravensbrück, Auschwitz, and Mauthausen, among others). The rest were transported to various locations in the General Government and released.\n\nThe Eastern Front did not change in the Vistula sector. The Soviets made no attempt to push forward, until the Vistula–Oder Offensive began on 12 January 1945. Almost entirely destroyed, Warsaw was liberated from the Germans on 17 January 1945 by the Red Army and the First Polish Army.\n\nThe destruction of the Polish capital was planned before the start of World War II. Warsaw was to be turned into a provincial German city. The failure of the Warsaw Uprising provided an opportunity for Hitler to begin the transformation.\n\nAfter the remaining population had been removed, the Germans continued the destruction of the city. German engineers burned and demolished the remaining buildings. According to German plans, after the war Warsaw was to be turned into a military station, or even an artificial lake – the latter of which the Nazi leadership had already intended to implement for the Soviet/Russian capital of Moscow in 1941. The demolition squads used flamethrowers and explosives to destroy houses. They destroyed historical monuments, Polish national archives and places of interest.\n\nBy January 1945 85% of the buildings were destroyed: 25% as a result of the Uprising, 35% as a result of German actions after the uprising, and the rest as a result of the earlier Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and the September 1939 campaign. Material losses are estimated at 10,455 buildings, 923 historical buildings (94%), 25 churches, 14 libraries including the National Library, 81 primary schools, 64 high schools, University of Warsaw and Warsaw University of Technology, and most of the historical monuments.\n\nAlmost a million inhabitants lost all of their possessions. The exact amount of losses of private and public property as well as art, monuments of science and culture is unknown but considered enormous. Studies done in the late 1940s estimated total damage at about US$30 billion.\n\nIn 2004, President of Warsaw Lech Kaczyński, later President of Poland, established a historical commission to estimate the losses caused by German authorities. The commission estimated the losses as at least US$31.5 billion at 2004 values. Those estimates were later raised to US$45 billion 2004 US dollars and in 2005, to $54.6 billion.\n\nThe exact number of casualties on both sides is unknown. Estimates of casualties fall into roughly similar ranges. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000. Both Polish and German military personnel losses are estimated separately at under 20,000.\n\nIn addition, Germans lost valuable military equipment, including three aircraft, 310 tanks and armoured cars, 340 trucks and cars and 22 light (75 mm) artillery pieces.\n\nMost soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were captured by the NKVD or UB political police. They were asked questions under force and imprisoned on various charges, such as \"fascism\".\n\nMany of them were sent to Gulags or executed. Between 1944 and 1956, all of the former members of Battalion Zośka were put in Soviet prisons. In March 1945, a staged trial of 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State held by the Soviet Union took place in Moscow – (the Trial of the Sixteen). \n\nThe Government Delegate, together with most members of the Council of National Unity and the C-i-C of the Armia Krajowa, were invited by Soviet general Ivan Serov with agreement of Joseph Stalin to a conference on their eventual entry to the Soviet-backed Provisional Government.\n\nThey were presented with a warrant of safety, yet they were arrested in Pruszków by the NKVD on 27 and 28 March. Leopold Okulicki, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Kazimierz Pużak were arrested on the 27th with 12 more the next day. A. Zwierzynski had been arrested earlier.\n\nThey were brought to Moscow in the Lubyanka.\n\nAfter several months of violent interrogation and torture, they were presented with the forged accusations of \"collaboration with Nazi Germany\" and \"planning a military alliance with Nazi Germany\".\n\nMany insurgents, captured by the Germans and sent to POW camps in Germany, were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West. Among those were the leaders of the uprising: Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski and Antoni Chruściel.\n\nThe facts of the Warsaw Uprising were a problem for Stalin. The facts were changed in propaganda of the People's Republic of Poland, which emphasized the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile. It did not allow criticism of the Red Army or the goals of Soviet Union.\n\nIn the post-war period, the name of the Home Army was banned, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear. From the 1950s on, Polish propaganda depicted the soldiers of the Uprising as brave, but the officers as treacherous, reactionary and characterized by disregard of the losses.\n\nThe first publications on the topic taken seriously in the West were not issued until the late 1980s. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army was built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed People's Army were glorified and exaggerated.\nBy contrast, in the West the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw was told as a tale of valiant heroes fighting against a cruel and ruthless enemy. It was suggested that Stalin benefited from Soviet failure to help. The opposition to eventual Soviet control of Poland was eliminated when the Nazis killed the partisans.\n\nThe belief that the Uprising failed because of the Soviet Union contributed to anti-Soviet feelings in Poland. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement Solidarity, which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s.\n\nUntil the 1990s, there was little historical analysis of the events because of official censorship and lack of academic interest. Research into the Warsaw Uprising was boosted by the fall of communism in 1989, due to the end censorship and increased access to state archives. As of 2004, however, access to some material in British, Polish and ex-Soviet archives was still restricted.\n\nFurther complicating the matter is the British claim that the records of the Polish government-in-exile were destroyed, and material not transferred to British authorities after the war was burnt by the Poles in London in July 1945.\n\nIn Poland, 1 August is now a celebrated anniversary. On 1 August 1994, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising to which both the German and Russian presidents were invited. Though the German President Roman Herzog attended, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin declined the invitation; other notable guests included the U.S. Vice President Al Gore.\n\nHerzog, on behalf of Germany, was the first German statesman to apologize for German atrocities committed against the Polish nation during the Uprising. During the 60th anniversary of the Uprising in 2004, official delegations included: German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, UK deputy Prime Minister John Prescott and US Secretary of State Colin Powell; Pope John Paul II sent a letter to the mayor of Warsaw, Lech Kaczyński on this occasion. Russia once again did not send a representative. A day before, 31 July 2004, the Warsaw Uprising Museum opened in Warsaw.\n", "id": "425171", "title": "Warsaw Uprising"}

Bike rage is similar to other road rage.\n\nA bike rage event can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian thinks that another road user was breaking traffic rules, or in other ways because someone felt that their safety was threatened by another road user. Some people consider that the problem is city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in the same ways and may cause lots of chances for conflict. As such, cyclists feel threatened in traffic and hard done by and under attack. \n\nAn article in \"Toronto Life\" magazine argued that the source of the problem bike rage is neither the problem of drivers nor the problem of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact. A possible explanation between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city; all the cyclists and drivers know they will never meet each other again.\n\nDrivers attacking cyclists\n\nAn event from New York Times show that a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of insults. The event began when the driver overtake in front of Mr. Cooley. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the driver drove the car to him, and used car to hurted him. Mr. Cooley fell on the ground and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him. Mr. Cooley got concussion and a torn ligament when he was taken to hospital. Mr. Cooley said that the reason for anger between cyclists and drivers is the car had monopolized the road for long time, however, bicyclists become more and more popular to save gas in this time. No one knows how to share the road.\n\nCyclists attacking drivers\n\nIn 2004 Chicago had an event that a cyclist attacked a driver. A Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, when he drove past the cyclist, the man on the bike made obscene gesture to him. Not only for this, but also he drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was \"charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses.\"\n\nIn Toronto in January 2006, a driver threw his lunch out the window of his car. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier. Then the driver attacked the woman and her bike.\n\nA cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. Police charged the driver with an offence.\n\nIn Toronto in 2007, a cyclist got angry at a driver. The cyclist then stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver.\n", "id": "425214", "title": "Bike rage"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425307", "text": "Applied behavior analysis\n\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA) is a way to help some people change their behavior. ABA may also be used to find out why some behaviors have changed. ABA is based on the approach to psychology known as behaviorism. ABA is used as a treatment for some psychological disorders and developmental disabilities. ABA is based on behavior principles that were discovered using experiments.\n\nScientific experiments and articles about ABA are published in the \"Journal for Applied Behavior Analysis\" (JABA.) This journal was founded in 1968. In the first issue of JABA, three people wrote an article explaining what Applied behavior analysis is.\n\nPsychologists who study the way the environment influences behavior are called behaviorists. They study the external causes of behavior instead of a person's feelings. A person's feelings are internal so behaviorists think they cannot be studied scientifically.\n\nPsychologist John B. Watson founded Behaviorism in 1913 and he is regarded as one of the first psychologists to study the applied science of behavior. He thought that internal feelings should not be studied at all. He also thought that behavior is shaped by the environment over time due to the outcome of a person's actions. He believed all behavior is learned and can be changed. If a person gets something good as a result of doing a behavior they are more likely to repeat that behavior. If something bad happens as a result of a behavior a person is less likely to do that thing again. This is an idea that is used a lot in ABA.\n\nOne of the most famous behaviorists was the psychologist B.F. Skinner. Skinner first published his ideas about behaviorism in 1938. He wrote a lot about behaviorism throughout his career. He made some of the behavior principles that ABA uses.\n\nABA emerged when experimental behavior principles were applied to social behavior. There are various people that began the process of applying these principles to social behavior. One of the most famous was Ole Ivar Lovaas. In the 1960s, Lovaas became one of the first people to use applied behavior analysis as a treatment for autism. When Lovaas began using ABA to treat children with autism he changed the way developmental disorders were treated. Lovaas also thought that treatments would be more successful if they are started early in a child's life. The idea of starting treatment with a child as soon as possible is called 'early intervention'. Early intervention is still thought to be very important in ABA.\n\nOne of the more recent developments in Applied Behavior Analysis is the founding of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB). The BACB is a non-profit corporation that was started in 1998. The BACB certifies behavior analysts. In order to become a behavior analyst a person must go to a special school and then pass an exam. Once they pass this exam they will be board certified behavior analysts. The BACB sets standards to make sure board certified behavior analysts (BCBAs) are good at their jobs. The BACB makes sure that the BCBAs are using ethical, legal, and professional practices when they work.\n\nThere are seven characteristics of ABA A treatment that is based on ABA must have all of these things.\n\n\nThe following terms and ideas are used in Applied Behavior Analysis. It is important to understand these ideas when using ABA based interventions.\n\nIn ABA, a behavior that is bad is called a problem behavior. Problem behavior is something that hurts the person doing it or hurts other people around them. A problem behavior makes it harder for a person to learn new things.\n\n\nPositive reinforcement (SR+) is when the \"addition\" of a stimulus leads to an increase in responding. There are four different types of positive reinforcement:\n\n\nNegative reinforcement (SR-) happens when the \"removal\" of a stimulus increases the likelihood a person will do a behavior in the future. In this case the term negative does not mean bad. The stimulus that is removed from the environment is something aversive. This means that the person does not like it. People will want to do a behavior if they know that something they do not like will be taken away.\n\nReinforcements are given based on schedules of reinforcement. The schedule will explain the ways reinforcement is earned. Behavior analysts decide which reinforcement schedule is best. Different schedules are useful for different things. The schedule used depends on the person. It also depends on the behavior that is being reinforced.\n\nContinuous reinforcement schedules (CRF) reinforce a person every time they do the target behavior. There are a few problems with CRF schedules though. The rates of behavior are not long-lasting. If the person stops being reinforced they may stop doing the target behavior. Another issue is satiation. If the person becomes satiated it means that they do not want the reinforcer anymore.\n\nThese schedules of reinforcement only reinforce the target behavior sometimes. The four most common types of intermittent schedules are:\n\n\nA discriminative stimulus (SD) is something that tells a person that reinforcement is available. The presentation of a SD should cause a response. Differential reinforcement teaches a person the difference between a SD and a non-discriminative stimulus (S-delta). A SD signals that reinforcement is available. A S-delta does not tell the person anything about the availability of reinforcement. A S-delta is not likely to produce responses because there is reinforcement is not given.\n\nIt is also used to decrease problem behavior. There are four types of differential reinforcement that can be used to decrease a problem behavior.\n\n\nExtinction is a way to decrease rates of problem behavior. A DRA program should be used at the same time as an extinction program. This will make the extinction program more effective.\n\nReinforcement is always the first thing that is tried when trying to change a behavior. Reinforcement produces long-lasting results and is better for the person. However reinforcement does not always reduce problem behavior. If reinforcement does not work it may be necessary to try punishment. Punishment is effective but it can have bad consequences. It can cause emotional harm if it is not used correctly.\n\nPunishment is any response to a behavior that \"decreases\" the likelihood of a behavior happening in the future. Punishment of a problem behavior should be used with reinforcement of the appropriate behavior. Appropriate behavior should always be reinforced even when using punishment for problem behavior. Just like reinforcement, punishment can be both positive and negative. Positive punishment is the \"addition\" of an stimulus that decreases the chances of future responses. This stimulus that is added is something aversive. Negative punishment is the \"removal\" of a stimulus that decreases the chance of future behaviors happening. The stimulus that is removed is something that the person likes.\n\nPrompting increases the likelihood that a behavior will be done the right way. Using prompts will make the learning process easier and quicker. Someone that is teaching a new behavior can use prompts to help the person that is learning the behavior. The two broad categories of prompts are stimulus and response.\n\nExamples of stimulus prompts would be: lists or pictures that help the learner remember what the correct response is.\n\nResponse prompts do not involve a change in the antecedent. There are three types of response prompts.\n\n\nFading prompts is a way to increase the independence of the learner. Once the learner can do the behavior on their own they will not need the help of the teacher. However, if a teacher stops using prompts quickly it may confuse the learner. So prompts should be decreased slowly. The process of gradually decreasing prompting is called 'fading'.\n\nShaping is a way to teach new behaviors or improve behaviors that have already been taught. It involves reinforcing steps towards a target behavior.\n\nComplex behaviors are made up of smaller simple behaviors. This is what the concept of behavior chains is based on. A behavior chain is when smaller behaviors are combined to form a complex behavior. These smaller behaviors are done in a certain order. Each of the smaller behaviors is a step in the behavior chain. Each step in a behavior chain is a response on its own. There are three different ways to teach a behavior chain:\n\n\nABA relies on data to make decisions about behavior. Behavior analysts are always collecting data about a person's behavior.\n\nDirect observation is when behavior is watched and recorded. Indirect measures compare one person's behavior to other people's behavior. An example would be an intelligence test. One person's score is compared to the scores that other people got.\n\nThere are three common methods of data collection. They are frequency, interval, and time sampling. These methods are used for direct observation.\n\n\nA functional analysis (FA) is done to find the reason for problem behavior. The reason for problem behavior must be known before a behavioral intervention can be done. Behavior analysts came up with the idea of a functional analysis in 1982. Since then it has become an important part of ABA. The behavior analyst is tries to find the situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior. The situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior tell the behavior analyst the reason for the behavior. Once the reasons for problem behavior are known treatment can begin.\n\nTreatments based on the results of a FA are more effective than without a FA.\n\nApplied behavior analysis is commonly associated with autism. This is because ABA is the only treatment for autism that has been scientifically proven to be effective.\n", "id": "425307", "title": "Applied behavior analysis"}

The siege continued for 240 days up to 27 November 1941. On that date, the Allied 8th Army took control of Tobruk.\n\nThe reason that the Allies wanted to have control of Tobruk was so that they could defend Egypt and the Suez Canal. The Allies also wanted to control Tobruk because it had a harbour that the Axis armies wanted to use. When the Axis armies could no longer use the port at Tobruk, they had to bring in supplies at the port of Tripoli. This required the Axis armies to bring the supplies by truck through of desert. Even though the Allies won Tobruk, the Axis armies kept trying to fight to take it back. The Axis armies fired many artillery shells at Tobruk and dropped many bombs on the town.\n\nThe reason that both sides wanted to control Tobruk is that it had a deep protected harbour. This made it a good place for ships to seek shelter. As well, the Italians had built a lot of fortifications.

It was a major naval battle in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. The battle was between the Japanese Navy and Allied naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first battle between aircraft carriers. It was also the first naval battle in which the warships of neither side actually saw the warships of the other side. Instead, each side sent planes to attack the ships of the other side.\n\nJapanese forces made a plan to invade and occupy Port Moresby in New Guinea and Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. When the U.S. discovered this plan, it sent two Navy aircraft carrier groups and a combined Australian–American cruiser force.\n\nOn 3–4 May, Japanese forces invaded and occupied Tulagi. The Japanese aircraft carriers entered the Coral Sea to try to destroy the Allied naval forces.\n\nOn 7 May, the carrier forces from the two sides sent planes to attack the ships of the other side. The first day, the U.S. sank the Japanese light carrier \"Shōhō\", while the Japanese sank a U.S. destroyer. The next day, the Japanese carrier \"Shōkaku\" was badly damaged, and the U.S. carriers \"Lexington\" and the \"Yorktown\" were damaged. Since both sides suffered heavy losses in aircraft and carriers, the two fleets stopped the battle.\n\nThe Japanese sank more ships than the U.S. However, the battle was considered a victory for the Allies because the Japanese forces were not able to capture the locations they were hoping to occupy. As well, the Japanese carriers \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" were not able to fight in the Battle of Midway, which helped the U.S. to win there. Japan's losses of carriers meant that they could not invade Port Moresby. Two months later, the Allies launched the Guadalcanal Campaign.\n\nOn 7 December 1941, using aircraft carriers, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack destroyed most of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's battleships. It also started a state of war between the two nations. The Japanese wanted to destroy American navy ships, capture land with natural resources, and obtain military bases to defend their empire.\n\nAt the same time that they were attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked Malaya. This caused the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to join the United States as Allies in the war against Japan (Australia had joined World War 2 in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland). The goals of the Japanese battles in the war were to remove British and Americans from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines.\nIn the first few months of 1942, Japanese forces attacked and captured the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands East Indies, Wake Island, New Britain, the Gilbert Islands, and Guam. They also destroyed a lot of Allied land, naval, and air forces. Japan planned to use these lands to defend its empire.\n\nShortly after the war began, Japan's Naval General Staff wanted to invade Northern Australia. The goal was to prevent Australia from being used as a base to threaten Japan's defenses in the South Pacific.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) said it did not have the forces or ships to invade Australia. Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, commander of the IJN's 4th Fleet (also called the South Seas Force) had the idea of capturing Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands and Port Moresby in New Guinea.\n\nThis would put northern Australia within range of Japanese land-based aircraft. Japan decided to capture New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa. This would make it hard for the United States to supply Australia.\n\nIn April 1942, the army and navy developed a plan called Operation \"MO\". The plan was to invade Port Moresby by 10 May. The plan also included capturing Tulagi on 2–3 May. This would give the navy a base for attacks against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific.\n\nWhen \"MO\" was done, the navy planned to do Operation \"RY\". This was a plan to capture Nauru and Ocean Island for their phosphate deposits on 15 May.\n\nFurther attacks against Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia were planned. There was a damaging air attack by Allied aircraft on Japanese naval forces invading the Lae-Salamaua area in New Guinea in March. Inoue requested carriers to provide airplanes. Inoue was worried about Allied bombers at air bases in Townsville and Cooktown, Australia.\nAdmiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of Japan's Combined Fleet, was planning an attack for June. He wanted to try to destroy the U.S. Navy's carriers. None were damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nUnknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy had decoded Japanese secret codes. By March 1942, the U.S. was able to figure out up to 15% of the IJN's code. By the end of April the Americans were reading up to 85% of the messages in code.\n\nIn March 1942, the U.S. first noticed the \"MO\" operation in messages. On 13 April, the British decoded an IJN message telling Inoue that the Fifth Carrier Division, consisting of the fleet carriers and , was being sent. The British sent the message to the Americans. They also said that Port Moresby would probably be attacked in the \"MO\" plan.\nAdmiral Chester Nimitz, the new commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, and his staff thought the Japanese were planning an attack in early May on Port Moresby. The Allies saw Port Moresby as an important base for attacking the Japanese. Nimitz's staff also thought that the Japanese might attack Allied bases in Samoa and at Suva.\n\nNimitz sent all four of the Pacific fleet's aircraft carriers to the Coral Sea. By 27 April, Japanese messages helped the allies to know most targets of the \"MO\" and \"RY\" plans.\n\nOn 29 April, Nimitz sent his four carriers and their supporting warships towards the Coral Sea. Task Force 17 consisted of the carrier , three cruisers and four destroyers. It was supported by two oilers and two destroyers.\n\nTask Force 11 consisted of the carrier with two cruisers. TF 16 included the carriers and the USS Hornet, but they were too far away.\n\nNimitz put Fletcher in command of Allied naval forces in the South Pacific area until Halsey arrived Halsey was told to command all three task forces once TF 16 arrived in the Coral Sea area (Lundstrom, \"Pearl Harbor to Midway\", p. 167).\n\nThe Japanese thought that all but one of the U.S. Navy's carriers were in the central Pacific. The Japanese did not know the location of the other carrier, but they did not expect an American carrier response to \"MO\" until the attacks had begun.\n\nDuring late April, the Japanese submarines and searched the area where landings were planned. The submarines explored Rossel Island and the Deboyne Group area and the route to Port Moresby. They did not see any Allied ships and returned to Rabaul on 23 and 24 April.\n\nThe Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Force, commanded by Rear Admiral Kōsō Abe, included 11 transport ships carrying about 5,000 soldiers from the IJA's South Seas Detachment plus 500 more troops.\n\nThis included one light cruiser and six destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka. Abe's ships departed Rabaul for the trip to Port Moresby on 4 May and were joined by Kajioka's force the next day. The ships, planned to arrive at Port Moresby by 10 May.\n\nThe Allied forces at Port Moresby had 5,333 men, but only half of these were infantry and all had poor equipment and little training.\nLeading the invasion of Tulagi was the Tulagi Invasion Force. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Kiyohide Shima. It consisted of two minelayers, two destroyers, six minesweepers, two subchasers, and a transport ship carrying about 400 troops. Supporting the Tulagi force was the light carrier , four heavy cruisers, and one destroyer, commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō.\n\nThere was a separate force commanded by Rear Admiral Kuninori Marumo. It consisted of two light cruisers, the seaplane tender , and three gunboats. Inoue directed \"MO\" from the cruiser . He arrived on 4 May.\n\nGotō's force left Truk on 28 April and stayed near New Georgia Island. Marumo's support group left New Ireland to establish a seaplane base on 2 May to support the Tulagi attack. Shima's invasion force left Rabaul on 30 April.\n\nThe Carrier Strike Force with carriers \"Zuikaku\" and \"Shōkaku\", two heavy cruisers, and six destroyers left from Truk on 1 May. The strike force was commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi (flag on cruiser ). Rear Admiral Chūichi Hara, on \"Zuikaku\", commanded the carrier air forces.\n\nThe Carrier Strike Force was to enter the Coral Sea south of Guadalcanal. Once in the Coral Sea, the carriers were to provide airplanes for the invasion forces, destroy Allied airplanes at Port Moresby, and destroy any Allied naval forces in the Coral Sea.\n\nTakagi's carriers were to deliver nine Zero fighter aircraft to Rabaul. Bad weather during two attempts to make the delivery made the aircraft to return to the carriers. One of the Zeros crashed in the ocean.\n\nTo find out if any Allied naval forces were coming, the Japanese sent submarines to wait southwest of Guadalcanal. Fletcher's forces got into the Coral Sea area before the submarines arrived and the Japanese did not see them. Another sub was sent to explore around Nouméa. It was attacked by \"Yorktown\" aircraft on 2 May.\nOn the morning of 1 May, Fletcher sent TF11 to refuel. TF 17 completed refueling the next day. Fletcher took TF 17 northwest towards the Louisiades and ordered TF 11 to meet TF 44 on 4 May. TF 44 was a joint Australia–U.S. warship force under MacArthur's command. It was led by Australian Rear Admiral John Crace. It was made up of the cruisers , , and .\n\nEarly on 3 May, Shima's force arrived off Tulagi and the naval troops began to occupy the island. Tulagi was undefended. The small guard of Australian commandos and a Royal Australian Air Force group left before Shima's arrival. The Japanese forces built a seaplane and communications base.\n\nAt 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was told that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been seen. TF 17 went towards Guadalcanal to launch air attacks against the Japanese forces at Tulagi.\n\nOn 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), 60 aircraft from TF 17 launched three attacks against Shima's forces off Tulagi. \"Yorktown\"s aircraft sank the destroyer \"Kikuzuki\" () and three of the minesweepers, damaged four other ships, and destroyed four seaplanes. The Americans lost one dive bomber and two fighters. Even though the Japanese forces were harmed by the carrier strikes, they kept building the seaplane base. They began flying from Tulagi by 6 May.\n\nTakagi's Carrier Striking Force was north of Tulagi when it learned of Fletcher's strike on 4 May. Takagi sent planes to search for the American carriers, but the planes found nothing.\n\nAt 08:16 on 5 May, TF 17 met up with TF 11 and TF 44 south of Guadalcanal. At the same time, four F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft from \"Yorktown\" shot down a Kawanishi Type 97 aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group.\n\nA message from Pearl Harbor told Fletcher that Japanese planned to land their troops at Port Moresby on 10 May and their carriers would be close to the invasion group. Fletcher planned to take his forces north towards the Louisiades.\nTakagi's carrier force entered the Coral Sea in the early morning hours of 6 May.\n\nOn 6 May, Fletcher joined TF 11 and TF 44 into TF 17. He thought the Japanese carriers were still well to the north. American planes did not find the Japanese naval forces, because they were located beyond the planes' range.\n\nAt 10:00, a Kawanishi flying boat from Tulagi saw TF 17 and sent a message to its headquarters. Takagi received the report at 10:50. At that time, Takagi's force was about north of Fletcher. Takagi's ships were still refueling, so he was not yet ready to battle. Takagi sent his two carriers with two destroyers under Hara's command to head towards TF 17 at so that they could attack the next day.\n\nAmerican B-17 bombers based in Australia attacked the Port Moresby invasion forces, including Gotō's warships, several timeson 6 May without success. MacArthur's headquarters told Fletcher about the locations of the Japanese invasion forces. MacArthur's planes saw a carrier (\"Shōhō\") about northwest of TF17.\nAt 18:00, TF 17 completed fueling and Fletcher sent \"Neosho\" with a destroyer, , to wait further south. TF 17 then turned to head northwest towards Rossel Island. At 20:00 (), Hara met Takagi who completed refueling.\n\nLate on 6 May or early on 7 May, \"Kamikawa Maru\" set up a seaplane base in the Deboyne Islands to help the invasion forces as they approached Port Moresby. The rest of Marumo's Cover Force waited near the D'Entrecasteaux Islands.\n\nAt 06:25 on 7 May, TF 17 was south of Rossel Island (). At this time, Fletcher sent Crace's cruiser and destroyer force out. When Crace's warships left, this reduced the anti-aircraft defenses for Fletcher's carriers. Fletcher wanted to make sure the Japanese invasion forces could not sneak through to Port Moresby while he was fighting with the Japanese carriers.\n\nFletcher thought Takagi's carrier force was north of his location. Fletcher told \"Yorktown\" to send 10 SBD dive bombers to search that area. Takagi launched 12 Type 97 carrier bombers at 06:00 to search for TF 17. Hara thought that Fletcher's ships were to the south. Gotō's cruisers and launched four Kawanishi E7K2 Type 94 floatplanes to search for the Americans. Each side got its carrier attack aircraft ready to launch once the enemy was located.\nAt 07:22 one of Takagi's carrier planes, from \"Shōkaku\" located American ships. At 07:45, the Japanese pilot located \"one carrier, one cruiser, and three destroyers\". Hara thought that he had found the American carriers. Hara launched all of his available aircraft. A total of 78 aircraft—18 Zero fighters, 36 Type 99 dive bombers, and 24 torpedo aircraft—began flying from \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" at 08:00.\n\nAt 08:20, one aircraft found Fletcher's carriers. Takagi and Hara continued with the attack on the ships to their south. They also turned their carriers towards the northwest to get closer to the Americans. Takagi and Hara thought that the U.S. carrier forces might be operating in two groups.\n\nAt 08:15, a \"Yorktown\" plane saw Gotō's force. He reported two carriers and four heavy cruisers\" at , northwest of TF17. Fletcher thought he had found the Japanese main carrier force. He ordered all available carrier aircraft to attack. By 10:13, the American force of 93 aircraft – 18 F4F Wildcats, 53 SBD dive bombers, and 22 TBD Devastator torpedo bombers were flying. At 10:12, however, Fletcher received a report from three United States Army B-17s of an aircraft carrier, ten transports, and 16 warships.\n\nBelieving that this was the main Japanese carrier force, Fletcher directed the airplanes towards this target.\nAt 09:15, Takagi's force sighted \"Neosho\" and \"Sims\". Takagi now realized the American carriers were between him and the invasion forces. Takagi ordered his aircraft to attack \"Neosho\" and \"Sims\". At 11:15, the 36 dive bombers attacked the two American ships.\n\nFour dive bombers attacked \"Sims\" and the rest attacked \"Neosho\". The destroyer was hit by three bombs, broke in half, and sank, killing all but 14 of her 192-man crew. \"Neosho\" was hit by seven bombs. Heavily damaged and without power, \"Neosho\" was sinking. \"Neosho\" told Fletcher by radio that she was under attack.\n\nThe American aircraft sighted \"Shōhō\" at 10:40 and attacked. The Japanese carrier was protected by six Zeros and two Type 96 'Claude' fighters flying combat air patrol (CAP). Gotō's cruisers surrounded the carrier.\nAttacking first, \"Lexington\"s air group hit \"Shōhō\" with two bombs and five torpedoes, causing severe damage. At 11:00, \"Yorktown\"s air group attacked the burning carrier with 11 more bombs and two torpedoes. Torn apart, \"Shōhō\" sank at 11:35 (). Gotō sent his warships to the north, but sent the destroyer to rescue survivors. Only 203 of the carrier's 834-man crew were rescued. Three American aircraft were lost in the attack. All of \"Shōhō\"s aircraft were lost. At 12:10, a pilot told TF 17 that the attack was successful.\n\nThe American aircraft returned and landed on their carriers by 13:38. By 14:20, the aircraft ready to launch against the Port Moresby Invasion Force or Gotō's cruisers. Fletcher was worried that he did not know where the other Japanese fleet carriers were. Allied forces thought that up to four Japanese carriers might be nearby. Fletcher turned TF17 southwest.\n\nWhen Inoue was told that \"Shōhō\" had been sunk, he ordered the invasion convoy to pull back to the north. He ordered Takagi to destroy the American carrier forces. As the invasion convoy pulled back, it was bombed by eight U.S. Army B-17s, but was not damaged. Gotō and Kajioka were told to place their ships south of Rossel Island for a night battle if the American ships got close enough.\n\nAt 12:40, a seaplane saw Crace's force. At 13:15, an aircraft from Rabaul saw Crace's force. Takagi turned his carriers west at 13:30 and told Inoue at 15:00 that the US carriers were too far away to attack them that day.\nInoue's men sent attack aircraft from Rabaul towards Crace. The first group included 12 torpedo-armed Type 1 bombers and the second group was 19 Mitsubishi Type 96 aircraft armed with bombs. Both groups found and attacked Crace's ships at 14:30. Crace's ships were undamaged and shot down four Type 1s. A short time later, three U.S. Army B-17s bombed Crace by accident, but caused no damage.\n\nCrace radioed Fletcher that he could not complete his mission without airplanes. Crace moved southward. Crace's ships were low on fuel.\n\nTakagi's staff thought that the Allied ships would be close enough to attack before nightfall. Takagi and Hara decided to attack with aircraft, even though they would have to return after dark.\n\nTo try to confirm the location of the American carriers, at 15:15 Hara eight torpedo bombers to look westward. The dive bombers returned from their attack on \"Neosho\" and landed. At 16:15 Hara launched 12 dive bombers and 15 torpedo planes with orders to try to find the American ships.\n\nAt 17:47, TF 17 detected the Japanese forces on radar heading in their direction. The Americans sent 11 CAP Wildcats to attack the Japanese planes. The Wildcats shot down seven torpedo bombers and one dive bomber, and heavily damaged another torpedo bomber. Three Wildcats were lost.\n\nThe Japanese leaders canceled the mission and returned to their carriers. The sun set at 18:30. Several of the Japanese dive bombers found the American carriers in the darkness and tried to land on them. Anti-aircraft fire from TF 17's destroyers sent them away. By 20:00, TF 17 and Takagi were about apart. Takagi turned on his ships' searchlights to help the 18 surviving aircraft get back.\n\nAt 15:18 and 17:18 \"Neosho\" radioed TF 17 that she was sinking. Fletcher knew his only nearby fuel supply was gone.\n\nAs nightfall ended aircraft flights for the day, Fletcher ordered TF 17 to head west. Crace also turned west. Inoue told Takagi to destroy the U.S. carriers the next day. He delayed the Port Moresby landings to 12 May. Takagi took his carriers north during the night to protect the invasion convoy. Gotō and Kajioka were unable to attack the Allied warships at night.\n\nBoth sides spent the night preparing their aircraft for the battle. In 1972, U.S. Vice Admiral H. S. Duckworth said Coral Sea was the most confused battle area in world history.\" Hara said he was so frustrated with the \"poor luck\" the Japanese hac on 7 May that he felt like quitting the navy.\n\nAt 06:15 on 8 May, Hara launched seven torpedo bombers to search the area south from the Japanese carriers. Three Kawanishi Type 97s from Tulagi and four Type 1 bombers from Rabaul also helped in the search. At 07:00, the carrier force turned to the southwest and was joined by two of Gotō's cruisers, and . The invasion convoy, Gotō, and Kajioka moved east of Woodlark Island.\n\nAt 06:35, TF 17 launched 18 SBDs to search for Japanese ships. The skies over the American carriers were mostly clear.\nAt 08:20, a \"Lexington\" SBD spotted the Japanese carriers and told TF 17. Two minutes later, a \"Shōkaku\" plane saw TF 17 and told Hara. The two forces were about away from each other. Both sides got ready to launch their aircraft.\nAt 09:15, the Japanese carriers launched 18 fighters, 33 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo planes. The American carriers each launched a separate attack. \"Yorktown\"s group consisted of six fighters, 24 dive bombers, and nine torpedo planes. \"Lexington\"s group was made up of nine fighters, 15 dive bombers, and 12 torpedo planes. Both the American and Japanese carrier forces turned to head directly for each other.\n\n\"Yorktown\"s dive bombers reached the Japanese carriers at 10:32. At this time, \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" were about apart, with \"Zuikaku\" hidden under clouds. The two carriers were protected by 16 CAP Zero fighters. The \"Yorktown\" dive bombers attacked at 10:57 on \"Shōkaku\" and hit the carrier with two bombs, causing heavy damage to the carrier's flight and hangar decks. The \"Yorktown\" torpedo planes missed with all of their torpedoes. Two U.S. dive bombers and two CAP Zeros were shot down during the attack.\n\"Lexington\"s aircraft arrived and attacked at 11:30. Two dive bombers attacked \"Shōkaku\", hitting the carrier with one bomb, causing further damage. Two other dive bombers attacked \"Zuikaku\", missing with their bombs. The rest of \"Lexington\"s dive bombers were unable to find the Japanese carriers in the heavy clouds. \"Lexington\"s TBDs missed \"Shōkaku\" with all 11 of their torpedoes. The 13 CAP Zeros on patrol shot down three Wildcats.\n\nWith her flight deck heavily damaged and 223 of her crew killed or wounded, \"Shōkaku\" was unable to launch any more planes. At 12:10, \"Shōkaku\" and two destroyers pulled back to the northeast.\n\nAt 10:55, \"Lexington\"s radar detected the Japanese aircraft and sent nine Wildcats to attack the planes. Six of the Wildcats were too low, and they missed the Japanese aircraft as they passed by overhead. Because of the heavy losses in aircraft the night before, the Japanese could not do a full torpedo attack on both carriers. The Japanese sent 14 torpedo planes to attack \"Lexington\" and four to attack \"Yorktown\". A Wildcat shot down one and 8 \"Yorktown\" SBDs destroyed three. Four SBDs were shot down by Zeros escorting the torpedo planes.\nThe Japanese attack began at 11:13 as the carriers, stationed apart, fired with anti-aircraft guns. The four torpedo planes which attacked \"Yorktown\" all missed. The remaining torpedo planes hit \"Lexington\" with two Type 91 torpedoes. The first torpedo broke the aviation gasoline tanks. The second torpedo caused several of the boilers to stop working. Four of the Japanese torpedo planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.\n\nThe 33 Japanese dive bombers attacked after the torpedo attacks. The 19 \"Shōkaku\" dive bombers attacked \"Lexington\" while the remaining 14, attacked \"Yorktown\". Zeros protected the dive bombers from four \"Lexington\" CAP Wildcats. Takahashi's bombers damaged \"Lexington\" with two bomb hits, causing fires which were put out by 12:33. At 11:27, \"Yorktown\" was hit in the center of her flight deck by a single , semi-armor-piercing bomb which penetrated four decks before exploding, causing severe damage and killing or seriously wounding 66 men. Up to 12 near misses damaged \"Yorktown\"s hull below the waterline. Two of the dive bombers were shot down by a CAP Wildcat during the attack.\nAs the Japanese aircraft completed their attacks and began to fly back, they were attacked by US planes.\n\nThe planes, with many damaged aircraft, landed on their carriers between 12:50 and 14:30. \"Yorktown\" and \"Lexington\" were both able to land planes. Forty-six of the original 69 aircraft from the Japanese force returned. Three more Zeros, four dive bombers, and five torpedo planes were damaged beyond repair and were pushed into the ocean.\n\nAs TF 17 got its aircraft back, Fletcher thought about the situation. Fletcher knew both his carriers were hurt and that he had lost a lot of fighters. Fuel was also a problem due to the loss of \"Neosho\". At 14:22, Fitch told Fletcher that there were two undamaged Japanese carriers. Fletcher pulled TF17 out from the battle. Fletcher radioed MacArthur the position of the Japanese carriers and suggested that he attack them with bombers.\n\nAround 14:30, Hara informed Takagi that only 24 Zeros, eight dive bombers, and four torpedo planes from the carriers were working. Takagi was worried about his ships' fuel levels; his cruisers were at 50% and some of his destroyers were as low as 20%. At 15:00 Takagi said he had sunk two American carriers – \"Yorktown\" and a \"-class\". Inoue called the invasion convoy to Rabaul, postponed \"MO\" to 3 July, and ordered his forces to gather northeast of the Solomons to begin the \"RY\" operation.\n\n\"Zuikaku\" and her escorts turned towards Rabaul while \"Shōkaku\" headed for Japan.\nAboard \"Lexington\", an explosion killed 25 men and started a large fire. Around 14:42, another large explosion occurred, starting a second fire. A third explosion occurred at 15:25. \"Lexington\"s crew began abandoning ship at 17:07. After the carrier's survivors were rescued, including Fitch and the carrier's captain, Frederick C. Sherman, at 19:15 the destroyer fired five torpedoes into the burning ship, which sank in 2,400 fathoms at 19:52 ().\n\nTwo hundred and sixteen of the carrier's 2,951-man crew sunk with the ship, along with 36 aircraft. \"Phelps\" and the other warships left to rejoin \"Yorktown\", which departed at 16:01, and TF17 moved to the southwest. Later that evening, MacArthur informed Fletcher that eight of his B-17s had attacked the invasion convoy and that it was moving to the northwest.\n\nThat evening, Crace sent \"Hobart\", which was low on fuel, and the destroyer , which was having engine trouble, to Townsville. Crace remained on patrol in the Coral Sea in case the Japanese invasion force tried to go towards Port Moresby.\n\nThe battle was the first naval battle in history in which the ships never saw or fired directly at each other. Instead, aircraft were used to attack each other.\n\nThis was a carrier-versus-carrier battle. Neither commander had experience with this. The commanders had poor communications. This was hard, because the battle took place over a large area. The planes flew so fast that it meant there was not much time to make decisions.\n\nThe Japanese had problems because Inoue was too far away at Rabaul to direct his naval forces. Fletcher was on a carrier, so it was easier for him to direct his forces. The Japanese admirals did not share information quickly.\n\nThe experienced Japanese carrier aircrews did better than those of the U.S. The Japanese aircrews did more damage with the same number of aircraft. The Japanese attack on the American carriers on 8 May was better organized than the U.S. attack on the Japanese carriers.\n\nThe Japanese had much higher losses to their carrier aircrews. They lost ninety aircrew killed in the battle compared with thirty-five for the Americans. Japan's highly skilled carrier aircrews could not be replaced because the training programs could not produce enough new aircrew. There were not training programs to produce skilled pilots. Coral Sea was the start of Japan losing its experienced aircrews.\n\nThe Americans did learn from their mistakes in the battle. They made improvements to their carrier fighting approach. The Americans improved their anti-aircraft defences. Radar gave the Americans an advantage in this battle.\n\nFollowing the loss of \"Lexington\", improved methods for carrying airplane fuel and better ways of dealing with damage were developed by the Americans. Coordination between the Allied land-based air forces and the U.S. Navy was poor during this battle.\nJapanese and U.S. carriers would fight again in the battles of Midway, the Eastern Solomons, and the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942, and the Philippine Sea in 1944. Each of these battles had an impact on what would happen in the Pacific War.\n\nBoth sides claimed victory after the battle. In terms of ships lost, the Japanese won a victory by sinking an American fleet carrier, an oiler, and a destroyer – . The Americans sunk a light carrier, a destroyer, and several smaller warships – . \"Lexington\" was one quarter of U.S. carrier strength in the Pacific. The Japanese public was told it was a victory.\n\nThe Allies won because the sea invasion of Port Moresby was stopped. This meant that supply lines between the U.S. and Australia were protected. Although pulling \"Yorktown\" away from the Coral Sea was like giving the sea area to the Japanese, the Japanese stopped their invasion plans.\n\nThe battle was the first time that a Japanese invasion force was stopped. This improved the morale of the Allies. The Allies had been defeated by the Japanese during the first six months of the Pacific War.\n\nPort Moresby was important to the Allies. The US Navy said that the damage it did to the Japanese was greater than what it really did.\n\nThe battle affected the planning of both sides. Without in New Guinea, the Allied advance would have been more difficult. For the Japanese, the battle was seen as a problem. The battle showed the Japanese that American were not that good in battle. The Japanese thought that future carrier attacks against the U.S. would be successful.\n\nOne of the most important effects of the Coral Sea battle was the loss of and .\n\nYamamoto wanted to use these carriers to battle American carriers at Midway (\"Shōhō\" was supposed to support the Japanese invasion ground forces). The Japanese thought that they sank two carriers in the Coral Sea, but this still left at least two more U.S. Navy carriers, \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\", which could fight at Midway.\n\nAmerican carriers had more planes than Japanese carriers. The US also had land-based aircraft at Midway. This meant that the Japanese did not have more planes at Midway. The Americans would have three carriers at Midway, because \"Yorktown\" could still sail, even with the damage from Coral Sea. The U.S. Navy was able to repair Yorktown at Pearl Harbor between 27 and 30 May so that she could fight in the battle.\n\nAt Midway, 's aircraft were important in sinking two Japanese carriers. \"Yorktown\" also took a lot of the Japanese air attacks at Midway which would have been directed at the other American carriers.\nThe Americans worked hard to get the maximum number of forces for Midway. The Japanese did not try to include \"Zuikaku\" in the operation. The Japanese did not try to put the \"Shōkaku\" aircrews with \"Zuikaku\"s air groups or provide \"Zuikaku\" with new aircraft. \"Shōkaku\" had a damaged flight deck which required three months of repair in Japan.\n\nHistorians H. P. Willmott, Jonathan Parshall, and Anthony Tully think Yamamoto made an error in deciding support the \"MO\". Since Yamamoto thought the big battle with the Americans would be at Midway, he should not have sent fleet carriers to less important battle like \"MO\". Japanese naval forces were weakened at both the Coral Sea and Midway battles, which allowed the Allies to defeat them.\n\nYamamoto did not notice another thing about the Coral Sea battle. The Americans put their carriers the right place and time to fight the Japanese. U.S. Navy carrier aircrews showed skill and tried to do major damage to the Japanese carrier forces. Japan lost four fleet carriers at Midway, which made Japan start to lose the Pacific War.\n\nThe Australians and U.S. forces in Australia were disappointed with the the Battle of the Coral Sea. They thought that the \"MO\" operation was going to lead to an invasion of the Australian mainland. In a meeting held in late May, the Australian Advisory War Council said the battle was disappointing since the Allies knew about the Japanese plans.\n\nGeneral MacArthur told Australian Prime Minister John Curtin that Japanese forces could attack anywhere if supported by the IJN.\nBecause of the losses in carriers at Midway, the Japanese were unable to invade Port Moresby from the sea. Japan tried to capture Port Moresby by land. Japan began its attack towards Port Moresby along the Kokoda Track on 21 July from Buna and Gona.\n\nBy then, the Allies sent more troops to New Guinea. The added forces slowed and stopped the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby in September 1942. They also stopped the Japanese from capturing an Allied base at Milne Bay.\n\nThe Allies tried their to use their victories at Coral Sea and Midway to try to win the war against Japan. The Allies chose Tulagi and Guadalcanal as their first attacks.\n\nThe failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby, and their defeat at Midway, meant Tulagi was not protected by other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base.\n\nOn 7 August 1942, 11,000 U.S. Marines landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands killed in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. The U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured an airfield under construction by the Japanese.\n\nThis started the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands Campaigns. These resulted in a number of battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next year. Along with the New Guinea campaign, this destroyed Japanese defences, caused huge losses for the Japanese military—especially the Navy. This helped the Allies to win the war against Japan.\n\nThe delay in the advance of Japanese forces also allowed the United States Marine Corps to land on Funafuti on October 2, 1942. The US built airfields from which USAAF B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers could fly. The atolls of Tuvalu were places the Allies could use to get ready for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that started on 20 November 1943.\n", "id": "425453", "title": "Battle of the Coral Sea"}

Fictional works about Svalbard often make reference to its Arctic climate, the isolation of the archipelago and the natural beauty of its vast glaciers, mountains and fjords.\n\n\"North of Danger\", by Dale Hollerbach Fife, is a World War II story about a 12-year-old boy living in Svalbard who has to hide in a coal mine to avoid being captured by the Nazi invaders. The Commonwealth Club of California called \"North of Danger\" the best juvenile book of 1978. \"Bear Island\" is a 1971 thriller novel by Scottish author Alistair MacLean. It is about a movie crew who travels to Svalbard. When the group arrives in Svalbard, members of the crew start to get killed. \n\nThe Norwegian crime writer and glacier expert Monica Kristensen has written a novel set in Svalbard entitled \"Operation Fritham\". The novel tells the story of a group of World War II veterans who meet in Svalbard to remember Operation Fritham.

His 1969 collection of essays, \"Freedom to Learn\", was influential for a young generation in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. Rebellions against college teaching methods, the deschooling movement, flower power and the alternative society often referred to Roger's ideas in their various pamphlets. Rogers is regarded as the second most influential therapist (clinical psychologist) of the 20th century (behind Freud).\n\nRogers was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His parents were Walter Rogers and Julia Cushing. He was the fourth of six children. Rogers was educated in a strict, religious environment. He was first interested in studying agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a focus on history and religion. His interest changed from agriculture to religion. He received a bachelor's degree in 1924. After that, he entered a liberal Protestant seminary in New York City. That went against the views of his conservative father. Rogers spent two years in seminary. He later transferred to Columbia University Teachers College, where he worked with John Dewey. Rogers received his master's degree in 1928. In 1931, he received a PhD in clinical psychology from Columbia University.\n\nAfter receiving his PhD, Rogers worked at Ohio State University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin. During that time, he developed what was later known as client-centered therapy. After his work at the University of Wisconsin, Rogers worked at the Western Behavioral Studies Institute in LaJolla, California. From there he and several other people formed the Center for Studies of the Person (CSP). He remained there until his death in 1987.\n\nDuring the last ten years of his life, Rogers used his person-centered approach in a broader field of work. He used helping relationships in the resolution of inter-group and international conflict. He and his colleagues conducted many experiments in cross cultural communication and peacemaking in the Carl Rogers Peace Project. For this work, Rogers was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The work is not widely known, but it puts Rogers' contributions into a wider social and political context.\n\n", "id": "425681", "title": "Carl Rogers"}

One thing to do is stop people who are about to attempt suicide. Another way to stop people from attempting suicide is to treat the symptoms of depression, help people to cope during a time of crisis, reduce the issues that put people at risk of attempting suicide, and give people hope for a better future. \n\nSuicide is not just a medical or mental health issue. Making sure people have friends and family to help them and taking away dangerous items can also stop people from attempting suicide.\n\nIn the U.S., there is a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. It was created by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2001. Suicide prevention activities include messages aimed at people and messages for everyone in the community.\n\nIn 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services created a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. The document looks at how suicide can be stopped in the community. The strategy does not say how to help individual people. The document has the following goals:\n\n\nTo help stop people from attempting suicide, many methods have been used:\nIt has also been suggested that news media can help prevent suicide by linking suicide with negative results, such as pain for the pain felt by the family.\n\nMany methods of stopping suicide exist. These include talking to the person, looking for risks, and making it harder for people to get dangerous items.\n\nThe World Health Organization says a good way to help people who are suicidal is to talk to them. The person can also be asked about depression, and if they plan to attempt suicide. Talking with people about suicide does not create suicidal thoughts.The doctor has to show concern and compassion. Doctors should try to reduce sadness and let the person know that people care. The WHO says not to not say everything will be all right. However, some people who have talked about suicide have attempted it. This means that doctors need to make sure the person is comfortable talking about his or her feelings.\n\nThe U.S. Surgeon General says there are ways to find out which people are at risk of suicide. This may be the best way to stop children and adolescents from attempting suicide.\nThere are tools like questionnaires to help doctors to know who is at risk. One example is the Beck Hopelessness Scale. These questionnaires are good for finding adolescents and young adults who might want to attempt suicide. Doctors should interview people who seem to be at risk. Questionnaires may not always tell doctors which person will attempt suicide Asking about suicide does not increase the risk.\n\nIn approximately 75 percent of suicides, the people had seen a doctor in the last year. About 45 to 66 percent of people saw a doctor the month they committed suicide. About 33 to 41 percent of those who committed suicide had used mental health services in the prior year. About 20 percent used mental health services in the month before they committed suicide. This shows that doctors need to get better at knowing which people will attempt suicide.\n\nAn important part of suicide prevention is making it hard for people to get dangerous items. Making it hard for people to get dangerous items can lead to less suicides. Putting up fences at bridges and cliffs reduces suicides. Putting up signs or increasing patrols is not so helpful One example of making dangerous items less available is coal gas in the United Kingdom. Until the 1950s, the most common way of committing suicide in the UK was poisoning by inhaling coal gas. In 1958, natural gas was used instead. Natural gas is much less dangerous. So less people committed suicide.\nIn the United States,studies show that firearms increase suicide risk. Because guns are quick and more dangerous than other suicide method, they lead to more suicides.\n\nTreatments to reduce the risk of suicide can include medical approaches, prescription medicine, and talk therapy.\n\nAbout 10% of people with psychiatric problems may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is causing their symptoms. About 50% may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is making their symptoms worse. Illegal drugs and prescribed medications may also cause problems. Treating medical conditions may reduce the risk of suicidal ideas. \n\nRecent research shows that lithium lowers the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder.\n\nTalk therapy can reduce suicidal ideas such as Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Benefits include a reduction in self-harm behaviour and suicidal ideas. Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) helps adolescents at high risk of suicide attempts.\n\nThe World Health Organization states that \"worldwide, suicide is among the top five causes of mortality in the 15- to 19-year age group. In many countries it ranks first or second as a cause of death among both boys and girls in this age group\". The organization says teens need help with difficult and stressful life situations.\" It also says that teachers need to prevent bullying and violence at schools.\n\nMany non-profit organizations exist that try to prevent suicide. Examples include the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the United States, which provide crisis hotlines. In addition, some groups such as To Write Love on Her Arms use social media to reach more people.\n\n\n", "id": "425739", "title": "Suicide prevention"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425789", "text": "Lindsey (kingdom)\n\nThe kingdom of Lindsey was in approximately what is now Lincolnshire. At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, it was a part of the territory of the Corieltauvi tribe. Lindsey appears in the 7th century list called the Tribal Hidage, where it is shown to be the same size as Essex and Sussex, all of which were set at 7,000 hides. It was a lesser Anglo-Saxon kingdom which was disputed over by Northumbria and Mercia. It ceased to exist as an independent kingdom during the reign of Offa of Mercia.\n\nLindsey was between the River Humber on the north and the Witham on the south. To the east lay the North Sea and the west border was the River Trent. The Roman canal called Foss Dyke connected the Witham with the Trent on the southwestern border. Also to the west was Hatfield Chase, a low lying area of marshes. This meant Lindsey was completely surrounded by water. This led to the popular belief that Lindsey was an Island.\n\nThe name Lindsey comes from the word \"Lindissi\" (also spelled \"Lindesse\" and \"Lindesig\"). Lindsey is a British name and not an Old English (or the Anglo-Saxon language) name. Lindsey was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom but it had a strong Celtic population. Lindsey seems to have been an independent kingdom with its own Celtic rulers for a time. It came under the control of Northumbria from –658. Then it was subject to Mercia from –. It returned to Northumbrian control again from –679. In 679 it was taken over by Mercia. Its kings were reduced in rank to Ealdormen.\n\nThe conversion to Christianity in Lindsey began by Paulinus. Bishop Wilfrid was appointed the bishop of Northumbria, which included Lindsey, in 665. After a delay, he was installed as bishop in 669. When he was expelled from Northumbria in 678, his diocese was divided up. Archbishop Theodore formed Lindsey into a separate diocese with its own bishop. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the year 678 Eadhed was the first bishop of Lindsey. In the 9th century, the Danes (Vikings) colonized Lindsey. This marked the end of the diocese of Lindsey.\n\n\"Haethfieldlande\" or Hatfield was another minor Anglo-Saxon kingdom listed in the Tribal Hidage. Very little is known about Hatfield and nothing of its kings. Unlike other petty kingdoms in this area of Britain, the name here is of Anglo-Saxon origin and not British. According to the Tribal Hidage, 'Hatfield-land' was merged with Lindsey into a single kingdom. Afterwards it became known simply as Hatfield Chase, an area on the west part of Lindsey, later part of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Hatfield was the site of a synod held by Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury . It was a royal residence of several kings of Northumbria. Edwin of Northumbria was killed here at the Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633. Later, Hatfield became a part of the East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nThe Anglian collection is a collection of royal genealogies and regnal lists. It was put together during the reign of Alhred of Northumbria (765-774). It records the kings of Deira and Bernicia (which became Northumberland), Mercia, Lindsey, Kent, East Anglia and Wessex. These genealogies all trace back to Woden. The most trustworthy name in the Lindsey genealogy is Caedbaed, according to most modern historians. The family of Aldfrið is also considered fairly certain. The other names are simply from the list with little or no additional information. The list of kings of Lindsey begins with:\n\n\nNone of dates are certain. With regard to Aldfrith, the witness list for an Anglo-Saxon charter includes an \"Ealfrid rex\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425809", "text": "Social cognitive theory\n\nSocial cognitive theory emphasizes how cognitive, behavioral, personal, and environmental factors interact to determine motivation and behavior. Social cognitive theory was presented by Albert Bandura in response to his dissatisfaction with the principles of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. His research is primarily focused on self-efficacy, the beliefs regarding one's capabilities of completing tasks or goals successfully.\n\nAlbert Bandura (born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who did work on social learning. He is credited for \"social learning theory\". This theory was renamed \"social cognitive theory\".\n\nHis theory defines human behavior as a three-way, dynamic, and reciprocal interaction of personal factors, behavior, and the environment. According to this theory, the behavior of an individual is determined by three factors with more emphasis on the cognitive processes that mediate learning. Response consequences of a behavior are used as expectations of behavioral outcomes. It is the ability to form these expectations that give humans the capacity to predict the outcomes of their behavior, before the behavior is performed. In addition, the social cognitive theory posits that most behavior is learned vicariously. Bandura's social cognitive theory suggests that humans can learn through observation without imitating the observed behavior. Bandura is also credited with the theoretical construct of self-efficacy and is responsible for the research in the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.\n\nSocial cognitive theory explains psychosocial functioning in terms of triadic reciprocal causation. In this causal model, behavior, personal factors and the environment operate as interacting determinants that influence each other bi-directionally. Bandura deemed that individuals can learn through observing others without the need for imitating such behavior. With vicarious learning capabilities, an individual could learn through observing others' behaviors and the rewards or consequences of those behaviors. The bi-directional influences of this causal model results in the remarkable intercultural and intracultural diversity evident in our planet. Social cognitive theory calls to mind that learning occurs when an individual takes the observed behavior and incorporates it into their own knowledge.\n\nSocial cognitive theory suggests people are neither driven by global traits nor automatically shaped and controlled by the environment. They serve as contributors to their own motivation, behavior, and development within a network of reciprocally interacting influences.\n\nThe social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of a three-way interaction between the environment, personal factors, and behavior. It does not imply that one factor may be stronger than others. They do not all occur simultaneously. Bandura states that the interaction between the three factors will differ based on the individual, the particular behavior being examined, and the specific situation in which the behavior occurs.\n\nThe person-behavior interaction involves the bi-directional influences of one's thoughts, emotions, and biological properties and one's actions. A person's expectations, beliefs, self-perceptions, goals, and intentions give shape and direction to behavior. The behavior expressed will affect one's thoughts and emotions. The social cognitive theory accounts for biological personal factors, such as sex, ethnicity, temperament, and genetic predisposition and the influences they have on behavior.\n\nIn addition, a two-way interaction occurs between the environment and personal characteristics. Human expectations, beliefs, and cognitive competencies are developed and modified by social influences and physical structures within the environment. The social factors can express information and trigger emotional reactions through modeling, instruction, and social persuasion. Humans evoke different reactions from their social environment as a result of their physical characteristics, such as age, size, race, sex, physical attractiveness.\n\nThe final interplay takes place between behavior and the environment. Bandura argues that people are both products and producers of their environment. A person's behavior will determine the aspects of their environment to which they are exposed. The behavior is modified by that environment. An individual's behavior can affect the way in which they experience the environment through selective attention. Selective attention refers to the vast range of possibilities of how humans select whom they interact with and the activities they participate in. The environment partly determines which forms of one's behavior are developed and activated.\n\nObservational or \"social\" learning is regulated by four component process, which results in a person translating a modeled event into a performance that is matched with the model. According to Bandura, a model can be either an actual person or symbolic, such as a book, a picture, or a set of instructions. The process consists of four variables: \"attention\", \"retention\", \"behavior production\", and \"motivation\". Each of these components has a function to engage either in the attainment of information about events or in the decision to put this information to use in guiding behavior.\n\nPsychologists use the term \"self-efficacy\" to describe beliefs about one's ability to accomplish particular tasks. Individuals with higher self-efficacy are more confident in their abilities to accomplish a given task. It is often associated with greater decision making strategies, quick recovery from a setback, and a stronger sense of commitment to their interests and activities. According to Bandura, there are four major sources of self-efficacy:\n\n\nBandura explains that the most effective way of developing a strong sense of self-efficacy is through \"mastery experiences\". Successfully completing a task strengthens our sense of self-efficacy. However, failing to adequately complete a challenge can undermine and weaken self-efficacy. \"Social modeling\" is the act of witnessing other people successfully completing a task. The second influential way of creating and strengthening self-efficacy beliefs is through \"vicarious experiences\" provided by social models. Bandura suggests that watching people similar to oneself succeed with sustained effort raises the observers' beliefs that they also have the ability to master similar activities to succeed.\n\nIn addition, research shows that social comparison of one's own performance to the performance of others, especially peers or siblings, serve as a strong source of self-efficacy. Schools are also considered a strong source of self-efficacy. It is good to note that schools are based on the evaluation of students by comparing individual performance to the group's performance. However, this type of evaluation can result in severe problems in self-efficacy for those who lag behind or have trouble with academics.\n\nTelevision reality shows can manipulate abstract portrayals of human nature, social relations, and the norms and the structure of society. Social cognitive theory states that humans can learn by observing how other people behave. In research about mass media, the social cognitive theory is referenced as a framework that might explain certain behaviors and influences from media effects. Bandura suggests that television influences the viewers' beliefs about reality. It is not because people watch too much television but rather the content of the televised show. To see the world as the televised messages portray it is to harbor some misconceptions. New behaviors and their potential consequences can be represented, observed and imitated because of the influences of television or the internet.\n\nIn one study, researchers argued that the positive correlation between television viewing and the initiation of youth smoking was a result of the rarity with which television portrays the negative consequences of smoking. In another study, researchers theorized that the positive relationship between exposure to women's magazine and women's drive for thinness is a function of the tendency for women's magazines to link thinness to positive consequences, thus engendering extrinsic motivation for dietary behavior. There are also studies that reference social cognitive theory to explain the possible effects of mass media regarding race and gender. Though these studies did not test social cognitive theory directly, but instead drew from its concepts to assume how it would explain the effect acknowledged in their study.\n\nSocial cognitive theory suggests goals influence people's cognitive and emotional reactions to performance outcomes because goals indicate the requirements for personal success. People have created guides and motivators for activities that lead to their desired outcome. Bandura found that goal systems gain motivating power through self-evaluative and self-efficacy mechanisms that are activated by cognitive comparison. It can improve an individual's cognitive well-being and accomplishments in several ways.\n\nGoals have strong motivational effects. They provide an individual with a sense of direction and purpose. They also help to build an individual's self-efficacy. Successfully completing a goal increases an individual's self-beliefs in their capabilities. Bandura links this effect with the increase interest in what an individual is doing and the increase in self-satisfaction. Motivation through goals provide an ongoing source of self-efficacy, interest, and satisfaction. Those without these characteristics are often unmotivated and uncertain about their abilities.\n", "id": "425809", "title": "Social cognitive theory"}

Many of Assad's supporters are Shia while the majority of the government opposition is Sunni.\n\nIn April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators across the country. After months of military battles, the protests turned into an armed rebellion. Opposition forces were soldiers who had left the Syrian army and civilian volunteers. Opposition fighters had no central leadership. Battles took place in many towns and cities across the country. In late 2011 the Islamist group al-Nusra Front began to have a bigger role in the opposition forces. In 2013 Hezbollah entered the war in support of the Syrian army.\n\nThe Syrian government received military support from Russia and Iran. Qatar and Saudi Arabia gave weapons to the rebels. By July 2013, the Syrian government controlled approximately 30–40 percent of the country's territory and 60 percent of the Syrian population. A 2012 UN report said the battles were between different sects or groups. The battles were between Shia groups against Sunni rebel groups.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, over 100,000 people were killed by June 2013. A total of 120,000 were killed by September 2013. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters were put in jail. There were reports that the Syrian government was torturing prisoners. International organizations accused both government and opposition forces of breaching human rights. The UN said most of the abuses were carried out by the Syrian government. More than 4 million Syrians were forced to relocate because of the battles and more than 2 million refugees left their country. Millions of citizens are still short of electricity, food and drinking water.\n\nIn 2013 the Syrian regime used Chemical weapons against the rebels. This drew attention from the international community. The government reportedly surrendered their chemical weapons in 2014 but continued the war using other weapons. Later in 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant became the most powerful opposing army, controlling more territory than the Syrian government itself.\n", "id": "425867", "title": "Syrian civil war"}

Other terms for it are serious music, and legitimate music.\n\nThe need for such terms came with the modern movement in the arts. Clearly the music of, say, Schonberg was serious, bur not classical in the sense of Bach and Beethoven. Stravinsky's music was a bridge between the two genres. It was classical music in part, and touched with African-influenced syncopations and dischords. So terms like \"art music\" and \"modern music\" were used by art critics and academics in their writing.\n\nIt is an umbrella term for serious music with a written musical tradition. The notion of art music is a frequent and well defined term, referred to by musicologist Philip Tagg as one of an \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. In this regard, it is frequently used as a contrasting term to popular music and traditional or folk music.\n", "id": "425902", "title": "Art music"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425917", "text": "Dutch resistance\n\nThe Dutch resistance was a movement of Dutch people who fought against the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. They fought the Nazis in many different ways, mostly without using violence. The resistance helped to hide 300,000 people in the autumn of 1944.\n\nDutch resistance developed slowly. In 1941, Dutch people organized a strike, called the February strike, to protest against the Nazis deporting over 400 Jews. This encouraged the resistance. The Dutch communists set up a system of cells (small groups of resistance members). Some other very amateur groups also formed, like De Geuzen, set up by Bernard IJzerdraat. Some military groups started, such as the Ordedienst ('order service'). Most groups were discovered by the Nazis during the first two years of the war.\n\nDutch resistance groups gathered counterintelligence (information about the Nazis), committed sabotage, and formed communications networks. This helped the Allied forces, beginning in 1944 and continuing until the Netherlands was liberated. About 75% (105,000 out of 140,000) of Dutch Jews were killed in the Holocaust, most of them murdered in Nazi death camps. A number of resistance groups specialized in saving Jewish children. Somewhere between 215 and 500 Dutch Romanis were also killed by the Nazis.\n\nThe Dutch defined several types of resistance. They did not think of these things as resistance:\nOnly active resistance in the form of spying, sabotage, or fighting with weapons was considered resistance.\n\nThousands were arrested by the Nazis and jailed for months, tortured, sent to concentration camps, or killed.\n\nThe Dutch February Strike of 1941, protesting deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, was the only such strike in Nazi-occupied Europe. It was not defined as resistance by the Dutch. \n\nAfter the war, the Dutch created and awarded a Resistance Cross to only 95 people.\n\nBefore the Germans invaded, the Netherlands were neutral. The Dutch had not fought in a war with any European nation since 1830. During World War I, the Netherlands were not invaded by Germany. The German ex-Kaiser even fled to the Netherlands in 1918. Because of this, the German invasion in World War II was a great shock. The Netherlands ordered its army to get ready in September 1939.\n\nEven thought Netherlands was still neutral, and had not gotten involved with any side during World War II, the country's large merchant fleet was attacked by the Germans after the beginning of World War II. The Nazis sank the Dutch passenger ship SS \"Simon Bolivar\" in November 1939, killing 84 people. This shocked the Netherlands. This was not the only Dutch ship that was destroyed.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, German troops started to attack the Netherlands. The Germans invaded with about 750,000 men. This was three times the size of the Dutch army. The Germans invaded with 1,100 planes (the Dutch army had 125) and six armoured trains. They destroyed 80% of the Dutch military aircraft by bombing, although the Germans did lose over 500 planes in the attack. \n\nThe Nazis tried the first large-scale paratroop attack in history, which failed. The Dutch retook control of the three airfields the Germans had captured. The Dutch army owned only one tank.\n\nMajor areas of military resistance were in: \n\nAfter four days, the Germans had invaded 70% of the country. Adolf Hitler ordered Rotterdam to be destroyed. Nazi bombing left about 85,000 Dutch civilians homeless. The Dutch surrendered.\n\nAbout 2,000 Dutch soldiers died fighting the Nazi invasion. So did at least 800 civilians, who died in Rotterdam.\n\nThe Nazis' goal was to make the Dutch into Nazis. The country's wide-open areas made it difficult to hide illegal activities - unlike, for example, the \"Maquis\" in France, who had many hiding places.\nThe first German round-up of Jews in February 1941 led to the first general strike against the Germans.\n\nDutch social democrats, Catholics, and communists started the resistance movement. At first, if the Germans discovered people were involved in the resistance, they put them in jail. However, if a person was a member of an armed or military group, the Nazis could send them to concentration camps. After mid-1944, Hitler ordered his soldiers to shoot all resistance members. The Nazis also did revenge attacks against civilians, where they killed innocent civilians after resistance activities happened.\nThe Nazis deported the Dutch Jews to concentration and extermination camps. They started building fortifications along the coast and constructed 30 airfields. They forced adult males between 18 and 45 to work in German factories or on public work projects. In 1944, most trains were sent to Germany and 550,000 Dutch people were sent to Germany as laborers. Resistance became better organized and more forceful. The resistance killed high-ranking Dutch officials, such as General Seyffardt.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Germans managed to kill many Jews.\n\nOn 25 February 1941, the Communist Party of the Netherlands called for a general strike, the 'February Strike'. German troops reacted by fired on unarmed crowds, and taking many prisoners. However, the strike was important because resistance against the Nazi occupation got stronger afterward. \n\nDutch resistance was usually secret. Resistance in the Netherlands included sabotage (like cutting phone lines, distributing anti-German leaflets, or tearing down posters). Some small groups collected intelligence and published underground papers such as \"De Waarheid\", \"Trouw\", \"Vrij Nederland\", and \"Het Parool.\" They also sabotaged phone lines.\n\nAnother important resistance activity was hiding Jewish families like Anne Frank's, resistance fighters, men and Allied aircrew. The resistance hid over 300,000 people from the Nazis.\n\n\n\n", "id": "425917", "title": "Dutch resistance"}

Its capital is Tagbilaran.\n\nThe province is a popular place among tourists with its beaches and resorts. The Chocolate Hills, many small hills of limestone formations, is the most popular attraction. There are many hotels in the southern beaches.\n\nIt is the home province of Carlos P. Garcia, the eighth president of the Republic of the Philippines (1957–1961) who was born in Talibon.\n\nThe people of Bohol are said to be the descendants of a group of inhabitants who settled in the Philippines called \"pintados\" or \"tattooed ones\".\nThe earliest significant contact of the island with Spain occurred in 1565. In that year, a Spanish explorer named Miguel López de Legazpi came to Bohol looking for spices and gold. He made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna in a place called Bool. This pact was signed with a blood pact between the two men. This event, called the \"Sandugo\" (\"one blood\"), is celebrated in Bohol every year during the Sandugo Festival. The \"Sandugo\" or blood compact is also depicted on Bohol's provincial flag and the Bohol provincial seal.\n\nBohol was administered as a \"residencia\" of Cebu. It became a separate politico-military province on July 22, 1854 together with Siquijor. A census in 1879 found Bohol with a population of 253,103 distributed among 34 municipalities.\n\nThe Bohol province was created on March 10, 1917.\n\nThe Bohol island has many small hills. There are two mountain ranges that run roughly parallel on the northwest and the southeast. The main mountain range of the island is \"Sierra Bullones\" on the southeast, along the south coast. It begins near Loboc, goes to the east and then to the northeast to end near Candijay. The highest point of this range and in the entire province is Mount Mayana, high.\n\nA plateau in the interior plateau of the island has many limestone hills. In Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan, these hills form near perfect cones in great numbers and are known as the Chocolate Hills.\n\nThe are many white sandy beaches along the coast of the main island and in other islands of the province. The most well known of these beaches are in Panglao Island, and there, numerous islets have similar, yet untouched and beautiful beaches.\n\nThe Panglao island is relatively flat with two hills. The island is known for its beautiful beaches, and the most famous of these is \"Alona Beach\" on the south side of the island.\n\nThe Lapinig island is to the northeast of the Bohol island, in front of the municipality of Pres. Carlos P. Garcia. The island is flat with hills in the middle to a height of .\n\nThere are four main rivers that flow through Bohol:\n\nNumerous waterfalls and caves are scattered across the island, including the beautiful \"Mag-Aso\" falls in Antequera.\n\nThe islands surrounding mainland Bohol that are part of the province of Bohol are:\nBohol has, like the rest of the Philippines, a tropical climate. The average temperature is high and the humidity is also high. The dry and the wet seasons are very similar. The province is in the path of typhoons; it can be affected by them but is somewhat protected by the mountains of surrounding islands, as Leyte, Samar and Mindanao. The northeast monsoon (\"Amihan\") is from November to April and the average temperatures are slightly lower than the temperatures during the southwest monsoon (\"Habagat\"), from August to October.\n\nThe main language spoken in Bohol is Boholano, a dialect of Cebuano. In addition, Tagalog and English are also spoken by many people.\n\nThe majority of the population of Bohol is Roman Catholic. Protestants and Iglesia ni Cristo form a large part of the remainder.\n\nThe Bohol province had a population, in 2010, of 1,255,128, for a population density of inhabitants/km.\n\nThe municipality with more people living in is the capital, Tagbilaran (96,792), followed by Ubay (68,578) and Talibon (61,373).\n\nThe province of Bohol is divided into 47 municipalities and 1 city.It has 1,109 barangays.\n\n", "id": "426066", "title": "Bohol (province)"}
