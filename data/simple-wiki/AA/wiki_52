This is different from the soft and sweet banana (which is often called \"dessert banana\"). \"Dessert bananas\" are more common to import in countries in the European Union or the United States.\n\nThe way certain species are called often show how they are used: \"cooking plantain\", \"banana plantain\", \"beer banana\", \"bocadillo plantain\" (the little one), etc. All members of the genus \"Musa\" are indigenous to the tropical region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia.\n\nPlantains are often firmer than dessert bananas; they also have less sugar. Dessert bananas are often eaten raw; plantains are usually cooked or otherwise processed before they are eaten. Plantains are a staple food in tropical regions, treated similarly to potatoes. They also have a similar taste.\n\nRegions with Plantain crops include the Southern United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Southern Brazil, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, Okinawa, Kerala and Taiwan. Farmers grow plantains as far north as Northern California and as far south as KwaZulu-Natal.\nEach pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once. All the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch made of multiple \"hands\" with individual \"fingers\" (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits. In Vietnam the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used to make salad. \nIn Laos, the plantain flower is often eaten raw; it is added to a special kind of soup. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called \"Koompu\" in Malayalam). It is said to be very healthy. You can fry it or boil it \n\nPlantain leaves are used like plates in several dishes, including Hallaca from Venezuela, or south Indian Thali. In southern India, meals are traditionally served on a plantain leaf. The position of the different food items on the leaf is important, also for Hindu rituals.\n\nThe plantain leaves often add an aroma to the dish. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called \"Ada\" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making \"Karimeen Pollichathu\" in Kerala.\n\nThe leaves are usually easy to find in Venezuela. They are sold at grocery stores, and they can be bought on the open-air markets there . Leaves can be very big, over in length. They are also used to stimulate appetite, as they have a distinctive smell when hot food is placed on them.\n\nIn Nicaragua, leaves are used to wrap different kinds of food, such as Nacatamales,Vigoron and Vaho. In Peru they are often used to wrap the famous Tamale (Tamales). In Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, these are usually used to wrap tamales before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. The plantain is the main food source of the Dominican Republic, and is used just as much as, if not more than, rice. Mangu and Sancocho are two dishes for which the plantain is very important.\n\nThe leaves are also dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make Fanti kenkey, a fine Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.\n\nThe plantain will only fruit once. After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled (like an onion) to get a cylinder shaped soft shoot. This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make an excellent dish. This dish is called \"Posola\" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. \n", "id": "191527", "title": "Plantain"}

It is in the Palerang Shire. In 2006 there were 1,108 people living in Braidwood. It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969.\n\nBraidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast. It is about south west of Sydney. It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.\n\nEuropen explorers, Kearns, Marsh and Packer, reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after. The town was surveyed in 1839. Gold was discovered in 1851, and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10,000.\n\nThe town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first given land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825. He was also given of land in the 'new country' on Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilson's land for a future village. They gave him more land at the eastern land in return. Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader. He built the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney. Wilson and Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm. Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned most of the land on the south, east and north of the town. Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843.\n\nA memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave. The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists.\n\nBushrangers, Thomas and John Clarke, killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867. There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery.\n\nAustralia's first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867. It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area. The Commission found the police were lazy, and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers. They found that the superintendent of police did not have 'strict and proper control over his men.'\n\nBecause of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last. It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town. Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming, and timber growing.\n\nBraidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of the Palerang council. The eastern office of the council is in the town. The local paper is now called the \"Braidwood Times\".\n\nAfter the gold rush, Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town. Because of this, very little new building work was carried out, and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There were arguments between those who wanted to save the town's old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it.\n\nThe town has several times been used for movie making locations:\n\nLocal stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making Ned Kelly; but there is no agreement as to which one.\n\n\n", "id": "191533", "title": "Braidwood, New South Wales"}

Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with mainly Australian actors.\n\nThere were many problems in getting the movie made.

Many people were upset that the movie would be made in New South Wales, not Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.\n\nJagger's girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role of Ned's sister, Maggie. Their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after she got to Sydney. She was in a coma, but soon got better and went back to England. She was replaced by an unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig. During filming, Jagger was hurt by a pistol misfiring.

This is a deuterocanonical (or apocryphal) book of the Old Testament. The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon. It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch. It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book.\n\nMost learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria. Whoever the starter, the work was written with a purpose: to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians. Instead, to worship only the Lord.\n\nThe letter (epistle) is part of the Septuagint. There is no evidence of it ever having been rule bearing in the Jewish tradition.\n\nThe earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his Church History. Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among \"the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down\". \n\nJerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, as the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.\n\nDespite Jerome's reservations, the epistle is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The Authorized King James Version follows the same practice, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the \"Rest of Jeremiah\", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the \"Paraleipomena of Jeremiah\").\n\nThe epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (see Tanakh at Qumran). (The other two are Ben Sira and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not preclude the possibility of the text being based on a prior Hebrew or Aramaic text. However, the only text available to us has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew, hence introductions of a Greek editor, not required for minimalist translation.\n\n", "id": "191585", "title": "Letter of Jeremiah"}

Events such as the Investiture Controversy in medieval Europe led to people wanting \"free\" elections, with a medieval understanding of free.

He served as both National Security Advisor and later as Secretary of State in the Nixon Administration and the Ford Administration. Kissinger was born in Germany in 1923. As a German Jew, it was not safe for him to stay in Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power, and he left for the United States in 1933. He fought for the US against the Nazis in World War Two.\n\nA controversial figure, Kissinger was Richard Nixon's most trusted advisor on foreign affairs. He was in government during the Cold War and promoted what he called \"realpolitik\" in dealing with the Soviet Union and Communist China. He was a major force behind the 1973 ceasefire in the Vietnam War. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for the ceasefire, but the agreement fell apart in 1975. Under Kissinger, the US opened up relations to China, which is considered one of his biggest successes. He also supported détente, an easing of the rivalry with the Soviets.\n\nIn his later years, Kissinger — along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz — called upon governments to reduce nuclear weapons, and in three \"Wall Street Journal\" articles proposed a program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this cause. His legacy is often debated by historians. Some people criticize him, even calling him a criminal, for his tactics during the cold war, notably supporting a military junta in Chile and backing Pakistan during the Bangladesh War. Many people, however, consider Kissinger a great figure in modern American history who ended the Vietnam War, opened up China, and supported peace in the Cold War. \n\n", "id": "191663", "title": "Henry Kissinger"}

Cub Scouts are scouts ages 6–10 and belong to packs. Cub Scouts include Tigers, Wolfs, Bears, and Webelos. Older Scouts can be Venturer Scouts.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America were founded by American writer W. D. Boyce, in 1910, but were similar to Scouting groups in Great Britain and other early scout movements. James E. West helped out the BSA in its early years, but also made the BSA more religious than scouts were in Europe. Scouting grew in the 1910s and 20s due to the rise of “boy’s books” devoted to Scouting and the First World War. Scouting had many members during the 1960s, but has declined since the 1970s, despite an attempt to make scouting modern by changing requirements and adding more merit badges.\n\nOver the years, the BSA has taken some stands that many Americans did not like. These included being against unions (organized workers) in the 1920s, requiring Scouts to believe in God, and not allowing gays to join Scouting.\n\nWhen a scout joins a troop, he gets the \"Scout Badge\". After that, he can earn rank. There are six ranks in the Boy Scouts: Tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class, Star, Life and Eagle. The first three focus on learning basic scout skills, including camping, cooking, swimming, first aid (basic medical care), citizenship, orienteering (use of a map and compass), and pioneering (tying knots). The final three focus on earning merit badges, serving the troop and serving the community. Eagle Scouts must plan and finish a project that benefits something other than Scouting, and earn 21 merit badges. Only about 2 or 3% of Scouts earn Eagle, but some of the ones that have include Gerald Ford and Neil Armstrong.\n\nScouts must learn, know and follow the Scout Oath and Scout Law:\n\nOn my honor I will do my best, to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\nA scout is:\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America match holder was first introduced in the 1800s.

Unlike the pitcher in a game of baseball, a bowler delivers with a straight arm (see photo). A ball bowled with the elbow bent is a throw, and that is illegal.\n\nA bowler who can also bat well, is called an all rounder. There are different types of bowler, and a cricket team will usually have a mix of different types.\n\nA fast bowler uses simple speed to defeat a batsman. They can send the ball to the batsman at a speed of 145 km/h. They take a long run up before bowling each ball to build speed. Shoaib Akhtar of Pakistan was the first to bowl at a speed of 160 km/h. Another famous fast bowler is Australian Brett Lee.\n\nA medium pace bowler bowls more slowly. They often use other tricks to defeat the batsman. They can get the ball able to curve in the air or change the speed or length (where the ball hits the ground) to fool the batsman. Some are very accurate so they can repeatedly send the ball to a place which forces the batsman to defend rather than scoring runs. Others grip the ball so that it lands on its seam; this makes the path of the ball unpredictable.\n\nA spin bowler usually bowls quite slowly and puts a lot of spin on the ball which makes it bounce at an angle off the ground. This makes the batsman play each ball carefully. Generally spin bowlers give up the most runs but they all have \"tricks\" that they use to fool the batsman and get him or her out. These tricks are given names such as the arm ball, googly, flipper, topspinner or doosra. Spin bowling is very much about fooling the batsman rather than speed. A fast off spin is the normal off spin action but with more pace. Off spin is when the cricket ball spins towards a right-handed batsmen's bat (bowler's left to right). With more pace, there usually is less turn (amount of spin). Off-spin is also called an off-break or finger spin. A famous spin bowler was the Australian Shane Warne, but his type was the leg break, which uses the wrist to spin the ball from the bowler's right to left.

The classic example of this is seen in the family life of mammals, or in colonial insects such as ants. \n\nMany mammals and birds raise alarms to warn others of danger. Others cooperate in tasks, such as scrub jays help each other with to build nests. In all these cases where animals cooperate, the question is whether there is any biological benefit to themselves. It is now clear that there is benefit if the animals are closely related. This is because related organisms have (to a degree) a shared genetic inheritance.\n\nThe first to write about the concept were by R.A. Fisher in 1930, and J.B.S. Haldane in 1955, but it was W.D. Hamilton who truly formalized the concept. The actual term \"kin selection\" was probably coined by John Maynard Smith, when he wrote: \n\nBy cooperating, relatives influence each other's fitness. Under natural selection, a gene which improves the fitness of individuals will increase in frequency. A gene which lowers the fitness of individuals will become rare. \n\nHowever, behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the actor, may nonetheless increase in frequency. Relatives do, by definition, carry many of the same genes. This is the fundamental principle behind the theory of kin selection. According to the theory, the enhanced fitness of relatives may more than compensate for the fitness loss of the helpers (individuals displaying the behaviour). \n\nThis is a special case of a more general model, called inclusive fitness.\n\nHamilton's equation describes whether or not a gene for helping behaviour will spread in a population.

It refers to the northwestern corner of the United States and the southwestern part of Canada. The U.S. states of Washington, Idaho, western Montana, Oregon and northern California are in the southern part of the Pacific Northwest. The Canadian province of British Columbia and the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska is in the northern part. The entire region is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west.\n\nHistorically, the Pacific Northwest had many Native Americans. Starting from about 15,000 years ago, Native Americans settled along the coastline and along the major rivers. From the 1500s to the 1700s, Europeans explored the region, beginning with the discovery of Oregon and Washington. In the early 1800s, the famous Lewis and Clark expedition arrived in Washington State. From the 19th century to present day, the region began to become settled. Today, the largest cities in the Northwest include Vancouver, Seattle and Portland.\n\nThe rugged mountains of the Northwest consist of the Coast Range, which is nearer the coast, and the Cascade Range. In northern Washington, the Cascade Range is called the North Cascades. In British Columbia, it is called the Canadian Cascades. The many rivers of the Northwest result from its wet climate - the mountains trap wet Pacific air, leaving little rain for inland states like Idaho. The rivers once supported large salmon runs, but large power dams have been built on many rivers.\n\nThe main language of the Pacific Northwest is English in the United States and French in Canada; among the Native Americans Chinook Jargon is common. Among the many Asian immigrants, Chinese is being used more in the Northwest.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest basically extends from southeastern Alaska to Northern California. Along this entire length, is a large mountain range, the Cascade Range, that forms the geographic spine of the Pacific Northwest. The highest mountain in the Northwest is Mount Rainier. Rainier is high. Other notable mountains include Mount Shasta, at , and Mount Baker, at . East of the Cascades, there is the Columbia Plateau, a high area of land that stretches east to the Rocky Mountains in Idaho and Montana. In the west, the Coast Range borders the coast more closely. The Olympic Mountains are on the Olympic Peninsula, an extension of Washington State. Puget Sound is a large system of bays and straits in northwestern Washington and southeastern British Columbia.\n\nThe main rivers of the Pacific Northwest are the Fraser River, the Columbia River, and the Snake River. The Fraser River is mainly in British Columbia; it flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Vancouver. The Fraser drains most of the southern Canadian Cascades. The Columbia River begins in the Canadian Cascades and flows south, then turns west where it meets the Snake River. From there, it flows on to the ocean near Portland. The Snake River is mainly in inland Idaho. After a journey west from the Rocky Mountains, it meets the Columbia at Kennewick, Washington.\n\nOther rivers in the Northwest include the Finlay, the Skagit, the Umpqua, the Rogue, and the Klamath. The Finlay drains the northern Canadian Cascades and flows on to join the Mackenzie River, which flows through Canada to Hudson Bay. The Skagit also begins in the Canadian Cascades, and crosses into Washington; it turns west and flows into the sea north of Everett, Washington. The Umpqua River begins in the Southern Oregon Cascades, and flows west to the Pacific Ocean near Reedsport, Oregon. The Rogue parallels the Umpqua and dumps into the sea at Gold Beach, Oregon. The Klamath flows south from a valley in inland Oregon, then turns west through northern California, cutting through the Cascade Range to its mouth near Klamath, California.\n\n", "id": "191816", "title": "Pacific Northwest"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191821", "text": "Adaptation\n\nAdaptation is the evolutionary process where an organism becomes better suited to its habitat. This process takes place over many generations. It is one of the basic phenomena of biology.\n\nWhen people speak about adaptation, they often mean a 'feature' (a trait) which helps an animal or plant survive. An example is the adaptation of horses' teeth to grinding grass. Grass is their usual food; it wears the teeth down, but horses' teeth continue to grow during life. Horses also have adapted to run fast, which helps them to escape their predators, such as lions. These features are the \"product\" of the process of adaptation.\n\nThe illustration of bird beaks shows an obvious sign of their different ways of life. However, eating a different food also means having a different digestive system, gut, claws, wings and above all, different inherited behaviour. For the major adaptations, what changes is not a single trait, but a whole group of features.\n\nAdaptation occurs because the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive, and to reproduce successfully. This process is known as natural selection; it is the basic cause of evolutionary change.\n\nAdaptation is, first of all, a \"process\", rather than a physical part of a body. \nAdaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past, and became instead a continuing dynamic process. \"Ernst Mayr\".\n\nAn internal parasite (such as a fluke) is a good example: it has a very simple bodily structure, but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment. From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits: in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle, which is often quite complex.\n\nHowever, as a practical term, adaptation is often used for the \"product\": those features of a species which result from the process. Many aspects of an animal or plant can be correctly called adaptations, though there are always some features whose function is in doubt. By using the term \"adaptation\" for the evolutionary \"process\", and \"adaptive trait\" for the bodily part or function (the product), the two senses of the word may be distinguished.\n\nAdaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology. The other is speciation (species-splitting or cladogenesis). A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African lakes.\n\nAn organism must be viable at all stages of its development and at all stages of its evolution. This places \"constraints\" on the evolution of development, behaviour and structure of organisms.\n\nThe general idea is that each genetic and phenotypic change during evolution should be relatively small, because developmental systems are so complex and interlinked. But polyploidy in plants is a fairly common large genetic change. The origin of the eukaryota by the symbiosis of micro-organisms is a more exotic example.\n\nAll adaptations help organisms survive in their ecological niches. This implies an increase in biological fitness.\n\nThese adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. Structural adaptations are physical features of an organism (shape, body covering, armament; and also the internal organization).\n\nBehavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains and/or the ability to learn: behaviours may be inherited in detail (instincts), or a tendency for learning may be inherited (see neuropsychology). Examples: searching for food, sex, vocalizations.\n\nPhysiological adaptations permit the organism to perform special functions (for instance, making venom, secreting slime, phototropism); but also more general functions such as growth and development, temperature regulation, ionic balance and other aspects of homeostasis. Adaptation, then, affects all aspects of the life of an organism.\n\nImportant adaptations do not come singly. They come in groups, which work together to make the animal or plant successful in its particular niche or life-style.\n\nWoodpecker adaptations are a good example of how a whole suite of features are needed for a successful way of life.\n\nAncestral woodpeckers, which switched to climbing on tree trunks, had ancestral foot and tail structure. This suggests that a change in behaviour, perhaps to get at a better food source, was one of the first things that happened in the chain of events. The way evolutionary novelties start is an important topic.\n\nNot all features of an organism are adaptations. It may need field investigations or experiments to find out whether it has a function in the life of the species.\n\nAdaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species. If a species has recently changed its life style, a once valuable adaptation may become a dwindling vestige. Animals which live in dark caves often lose, over a long period, their colours and eyesight.\n\nThe reasons for this may vary. The loss of structure and function may be a positive adaptation which saves energy and materials. But it may be simply a by-product of genes selected for other functions (pleiotropy). Or the structure may be linked in development, and affected by selection for some other structure.\n\nIt is a general rule that any adaptations which are no longer useful either become vestigial organs (see vermiform appendix), or may be selected and adapted to other functions (see ear ossicles).\n\nMany adaptations serve more than one function. This is often the reason some traits become so noticeable that they almost define the species concerned. The legs of a horse are also a main defence: a horse's kick is very destructive. The antlers of male deer serve a sexual function as well as a defence against predators. Man's large brain serves not only for language, but also for thinking and problem-solving. Bird feathers are not just used to fly; they are the basis of its heat conservation, temperature regulation and signalling.\n\nIt is a profound truth that Nature does not know best; that genetical evolution... is a story of waste, makeshift, compromise and blunder. \"Peter Medawar\".\n\nAdaptations are never perfect. There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body. It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces, therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations.\n\nAll adaptations have a downside: horse legs are great for running on grass, but they cannot scratch their backs; mammals' hair helps temperature regulation, but offers a niche for ectoparasites. Compromise and makeshift occur widely, not perfection. Selection pressures pull in different directions, and the adaptation that results is some kind of compromise.\n\nSince the phenotype as a whole is the target of selection, it is impossible to improve simultaneously all aspects of the phenotype to the same degree. Ernst Mayr.\n\nCamouflage to avoid detection is destroyed when vivid colours are displayed at mating time. Here the risk to life is counterbalanced by the need for reproduction. The peacock's ornamental train (grown anew in time for each mating season) is a famous adaptation. It must reduce his maneuverability and flight, and is hugely conspicuous; also, its growth costs food resources.\n\nDarwin's explanation of its advantage was in terms of sexual selection: \"it depends on the advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in relation to reproduction\". The kind of sexual selection represented by the peacock is called 'mate choice', meaning the process selects the more fit over the less fit, and so has survival value. In practice, the blue peafowl \"Pavo cristatus\" is a pretty successful species, with a big natural range in India, so the overall outcome of their mating system is quite viable.\n\nThe size of the human foetal brain at birth means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The newborn's brain cannot be larger than about 400ccs, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis. Yet the size needed for an adult brain is about 1400ccs.\n\nThe most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That is the result of the birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.\n\nThe function of a trait can, and often does, change over time. Several terms have been used to describe this: \"preadaptation\", \"exaptation\", \"cooption\". 'Preadaptation' is the most common term used when a preexisting structure or trait inherited from an ancestor evolves a different function. It was the term used by Julian Huxley and Ernst Mayr. The term 'pre-' does not mean any foresight, it just means the adaptation was already available, serving some older function. 'Exaptation' was Stephen J. Gould's word.\n\nOne example of preadaptation is in dinosaurs, which evolved feathers with the function of thermo-insulation and display long before they were used for flight by early birds. Sweat glands in mammals were later transformed into mammary glands. Another example is the long journey of the mammalian ear ossicles, which started in the gill covers of ancient fish, then became part of the lower jaw of reptiles, and then became part of the inner ear of mammals. Another example is the wings of penguins. Once used for flying, they are now used for 'flying' under water.\n\nChange of function in organs and structures is extremely common in evolution. Many of the features of tetrapods (land vertebrates) evolved from features with different functions in the ancestral lobe-finned fish (Sarcopterygii).\n\nThe following definitions are mainly due to Theodosius Dobzhansky.\n\n", "id": "191821", "title": "Adaptation"}

Isabel de Torres was a lady who lived in Puerto Plata in 1605 and had a lot of land in the mountain.\n\nThe city was called first \"Puerto de Plata\" but later it was changed to just \"Puerto Plata\", the name that is still used\n\nColumbus visited the Puerto Plata Bay on 11 January 1493. The city was founded and built by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502. Soon it became the most important port in the northern coast of the Hispaniola island and, in 1508, the king of Spain gave a coat of arms to the city.\n\nBecause there were many pirates and other British and French ships along the northern coast of the island, a fort was built here by orders of Carlos I, king of Spain; its construction took several years and it was finished in 1577. Because at that moment the Spanish's king was Felipe II, the fort was named Fuerte San Felipe (in English, \"Saint Phillip Fort\").\n\nIn 1606, those that were living in the towns of Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were ordered by the Spanish king to move to the southeast of the island and to found a new town: Monte Plata. Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi were, then, destroyed. They were founded again in the 18th century with families that came from the Canary Islands.\n\nThe municipality had, in , a total population of 128,240: 63,564 men and 64,676 women. The urban population was of the total population.\n\nSan Felipe de Puerto Plata has a total area of (without including its municipal districts), about of the total area of the province of Puerto Plata. The city is at an elevation of , and at to the north of Santo Domingo.\n\nThe \"Cordillera Septentrional\" (\"Northern mountain range\") runs along the southern half of the municipality. There are only two roads that go through this mountain range. It rains a lot in these mountains. \n\nThe mountain \"Loma Isabel de Torres\" (the \"Monte de Plata\" of Columbus) is at about to the southeast of the city of Puerto Plata. It stands alone even if it is part of the Cordillera Septentrional. On top of the mountain, there is rainforest because it gets a lot of rain there; it rains almost every day. That forest is now a national park. It is high and there are two ways for getting to the top: by road or by a cable car (a type of car that runs on cables above the car).\n\nThere are many rivers in the municipality but, because the Cordillera Septentrional is close to the coast, they are all very short. The two most important rivers are Camú del Norte and Yásica. Two small rivers that are close to the city are San Marcos and Muñoz.\n\nThere are some bays along the coast. Two of them are the \"Puerto Plata Bay\" and \"Maimón Bay\".\n\nPuerto Plata has a tropical wet climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: Af) with no dry or cold season as it is constantly moist (rainfalls during the whole year).\n\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is .

In 1970 he conducted Monteverdi's opera \"Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria\" at La Scala, Milan.\n\nIn 1971, Harnoncourt started to work with the conductor Gustav Leonhardt. They recorded all of J.S. Bach's cantatas. This project took until 1990 to finish. He also recorded Bach's \"St. Matthew Passion\". He performed with many other orchestras, including the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Often they were orchestras who used modern instruments, but he tried to make them play with an understanding of a historical style (bowing, phrasing etc). Like other musicians working with historical instruments, he gradually realized that music from later periods such as the Classical music period and even the Romantic period used to sound different from what we usually hear today. He recorded the symphonies and concertos of Beethoven. He received many awards for these recordings.\n\nHarnoncourt was married to Alice until his death. The couple had a daughter, Elisabeth von Magnus, and three sons: Philipp, Franz and Eberhard (who died in 1990). Harnoncourt retired in December 2015 because of an illness. Harnoncourt died on 5 March 2016 from the illness. He was aged 86.\n\n", "id": "192028", "title": "Nikolaus Harnoncourt"}

At the beginning of his career the harpsichord was not yet a popular instrument and music from the Renaissance and Baroque periods was usually played in the same way as music from later centuries. Gustav Leonhardt made his audiences aware of what music by Johann Sebastian Bach would have sounded like in Bach's day.\n\nGustav Leonhardt was born into a Dutch, Protestant family who lived in the countryside. His Protestantism was an important part of his life. His father was a wealthy business man. His parents were both very keen amateur musicians. When Gustav was ten they bought a harpsichord. When World War II broke out life was hard in the country and Leonhardt often had to hide under the floorboards so that he was not sent away to slave labour. When he was not hiding he spent a lot of time practising the harpsichord. \n\nGustav Leonhardt studied organ and harpsichord at the Schola Cantorum in Basel. At that time this was the only place in Europe where it was possible to study how to play early music. He went to Vienna to study conducting because his parents thought that being a conductor was a good way to earn a lot of money. However, Gustav was never very keen on conducting and he spent all his time there in the library studying music scores and copying music out. Most of this music had never been published and had not been performed since the time it was composed. \n\nIn 1952 he became professor of harpischord at the Vienna Hochschule fur Musik. He met Nikolaus Harnoncourt who had similar interests to his. He soon became professor of harpsichord at the Amsterdam Conservatorium and remained there until 1988. He was also organist at the Waalse Kerk, Amsterdam. This church has a very famous historical organ. He became well known for his harpsichord concerts and recordings. He led the Leonhardt Baroque Ensemble with the English counter-tenor Alfred Deller with whom he made one of the first recordings of some Bach cantatas. The ensemble included his wife Marie, as well as Nikolaus Harnoncourt who played the cello. Together with Harnoncourt he conducted and recorded all Bach's cantatas.\n\nLeonhardt lived in a big 16th century house facing one of the canals in the centre of Amsterdam. He looked very serious on the concert platform, but he had a sense of humour and occasionally played a bit of ragtime at the end of a recital.\n\nLeonhardt died in Amsterdam on 16 January 2012.\n\n", "id": "192043", "title": "Gustav Leonhardt"}

The two species are named \"Elettaria\" and \"Amomum\", respectively. The seeds grow in a small seedpod. This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle. There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds. Elettaria pods are light green in color, Amomum pods are larger and dark brown.\n\nElettaria is commonly known as \"cardamom\", \"green cardamom\" or \"true cardamom\". It grows from India to Malaysia. \n\nAmomum is usually called \"black cardamom\", or \"white cardamom\". It grows in Asia and Australia.\n\nBoth forms of cardamom are used to add flavor to both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. \n\"Elettaria cardamomum\" (the usual type of cardamom) is used as a spice and in medicine; it is also smoked sometimes; it is used as a food plant by the larva of the moth \"Endoclita hosei\".\n\nCardamom has a strong taste and an intense smell. Black cardamom has coolness similar to that of mint. It is commonly used in Indian cooking. In Scandinavia it is often used for baking. \n\nGreen cardamom is one of the most expensive spices by weight but little is needed to give the flavor. Cardamom is best stored in pod form. Once the seeds are exposed or ground, they quickly lose their flavor. High-quality ground cardamom powder can often be a substitute for the pods. That way, ten pods is about the same quantity as one and a half teaspoons of ground cardamom. \n\nIn the Middle East, green cardamom powder is used as a spice for sweet dishes. Traditionally, it is also added as a flavoring to coffee and tea there. In Arabic, cardamom is called \"al-Hayl\". In Persian, it is called \"hel\". In Hebrew, it is also called \"hel\" (הל). In Gujarati (a derivative of Sanskrit), it is \"Ē-lī-chē\".\nIn some Middle Eastern countries, coffee and cardamom are often ground in a wooden mortar and cooked together in a mihbaz, an oven using wood or gas, to produce mixtures that are as much as forty percent cardamom.\n\nIn South Asia, green cardamom is often used in traditional Indian sweets and in \"Masala chai (spiced tea)\". \n\nBlack cardamom is sometimes used in garam masala for curries. It is occasionally used as a garnish in basmati rice and other dishes. It is often referred to as fat cardamom due its size ('Moti Elaichi'). Individual seeds are sometimes chewed, in much the same way as chewing-gum. It has also been known to be used to make gin. Cardamom was used to make the spiced wine, claret, in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn South Asia, Green cardamom is often used to treat infections of the teeth and gums. It is also used against troubles of the throat, congestion of the lungs and pulmonary tuberculosis, inflammation of eyelids and also digestive disorders. It has been used to break up kidney and gall stones, and as an antidote against the poison of certain snake bites. \n\n\"Amomum\" is used as a spice and as an ingredient in traditional medicine in systems of the traditional Chinese medicine in China, in Ayurveda in India, Japan, Korea and Vietnam.\nAmong other species, varieties and cultivars, \"Amomum villosum\" cultivated in China, Laos and Vietnam is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stomach-aches, constipation, dysentery, and other digestion problems. \"Tsaoko\" cardamom \"Amomum tsao-ko\" is cultivated in Yunnan, China and northwest Vietnam, both for medicinal purposes and as a spice.\n\nThe demand for these herbs has increased since the 1980s. Growing cardamom has become an important source of income for many poor farmers. These people usually live in higher altitudes, sometimes in remote areas, in China, Laos and Vietnam. \n\nUntil recently, Nepal has been the world's largest producer of large cardamom. Guatemala has become the world's largest producer and exporter of cardamom, with an export total of US$137.2 million for 2007.\n", "id": "192073", "title": "Cardamom"}

The numbers most used for measuring economic growth is gross domestic product (GDP) and per capita income (average money per person). Others include the amount of industry, how much infrastructure there is, literacy, life expectancy and the basic standard of living. There is no exact way of saying what country is developed or developing. People often discuss the question of whose countries are the most developed ones,\n\nDeveloped countries have , which means that the service sector becomes more important, and the is less important. Service sector jobs are those where a person does something for another, like selling or fixing a product. Industry sector jobs are actually making a product, usually in a factory. In a developed country, industry jobs may be moved (outsourced) to less developed countries that pay workers less money. Developing countries may be in the process of industrialization (building the factories and infrastructure) and underdeveloped countries usually depend on agriculture, often subsistence farming.\n\nThe first industrialised country was the UK, followed by Belgium. Later industrialised countries were Germany, the US, France and other Western European countries. According to , the current split between the developed and developing world is mostly an event of the 20 century.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, developed countries supplied over half of the global GDP in 2010. In 2012, the \"major advanced economies\" were the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, and Canada. These are also called the G7.\n\nThe G7 has 10% of the world's population, but produces nearly 40% of the world's GDP. They also control many of the economic decisions that affect the world. The United Nations Security Council has five permanent members, four of those are in the G8 (G7 plus Russia).\n\nTerms similar to \"developed country\" include \"advanced country\", \"industrialised country\", \"more developed country (MDC), \"more economically developed country (MEDC) (compared to \"less economically developed country(LEDC)\"), \"Global North country\", \"first-world country\", and \" country\". \n\nEconomic criteria are usually seen as most important. This includes income per capita (average money for each person). Countries with high GDP per capita and mature industrialization are described as \"developed countries\". But modernization is not always seen as the only way to measure progress.\n\nRecently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines jobs, income, along with access to medicine, life expectancy, and education has become prominent. The UN HDI is measures a country's level of human development. While there is a strong connection between a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, it is not always the case. The top 47 countries by HDI have scores ranging from 0.793 in Barbados to 0.955 in Norway. Many countries having an HDI of 0.788 and over (as of 2010), are also listed by IMF or CIA as \"advanced\" (as of 2009). The country of Bhutan started the idea of Gross National Happiness (GNH), to measure how happy people actually are.

It is concerned with how information and computation are related. Most information can be represented as a String (or a sequence of characters). Algorithmic information theory studies the complexity of information represented that way (In other words, how difficult it is to get that information, or how long it takes). Unlike regular information theory, it uses Kolmogorov complexity to describe complexity, and not the measure of complexity developed by Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver. Kolmogorov complexity was developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov and Gregory Chaitin .\n\nAccording to Claude Shannon the following two binary strings have the same content in information (this is only valid for the first-order entropy):\n\nThe first was generated with a random number generator, for example by throwing a coin. The second is easier to describe (eight times \"1\", then eight times \"0\"). For this reason, the first sequence has more algorithmic information, because it is harder to shorten (\"compress\") the description on how to generate it. Shortening the description may not be possible at all. The information value of a string is higher, if it is more difficult to shorten (\"compress\") its description. Random strings and white noise do not contain patterns that occur again. For this reason they cannot be compressed, and have a higher information value. \n", "id": "192167", "title": "Algorithmic information theory"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192169", "text": "Tawhīd\n\nTawhid is the concept of God in Islam which says that only one God exists. It says that God is unique and one and He has no equal. It also says that since the God is the only creator, there is no room for lesser Gods or deities. Any lesser gods are therefore false. Tawhid is an essential part of Islam. To become a Muslim it is necessary to accept it. The concept of Tawhid has many implications. Since God is the only power, both good and bad flow from God. So, whatever good or bad occurs to an individual, both are from God and both should be accepted by the individual. Since God is the only power worth worshipping, reliance on any other source for help is not permissible.\n\nThe Qur'an explains the nature of God thus in Chapter 112:\n\nSay: He is Allah, the One and Only; Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; None is born of Him, nor is He born; And there is no one like him.\nAssociating any other thing or person as being comparable to God is called \"shirk\" in Islam. This is the only sin in Islam which cannot be forgiven by God, unless a person turns repentant on Earth. The Koran tells Muslims to not say \"trinity\" spoken by Christians. It also says that Jesus did not claim to be anything more than a human being, whom God chose as a prophet like other before him.\n", "id": "192169", "title": "Tawhīd"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192250", "text": "Asperger syndrome\n\nAsperger syndrome (often Asperger's syndrome) is a way of describing the way in which a person understands other people, talks with other people, and acts with other people. A person who has Asperger syndrome may not fit in well with other people, and may be unable to act like everyone else in different social situations. Neurotypical (or NT) is a term that was coined in the autistic community as a label for those other people who are not on the autism spectrum. Asperger syndrome is thought to manifest as a developmental disorder, and is not considered a mental illness. Most adults with Asperger syndrome can learn how to make friends, do useful work, and live successful lives. Asperger syndrome is considered to be at the highest functioning end of the Autism spectrum disorders. All genders can have Asperger syndrome, although it is more common in males.\n\nAsperger syndrome is not a disease. People who have it will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. However, they can try many solutions to help them and learn how to be able to reduce the impact in their life. One solution can be medication to restrict the different symptoms like aggression. The big problem with people affected by Asperger's is that they cannot understand emotions or how people think. Therapists attempt to help the person with that. They will do many activities like acting an emotion and let the Asperger people guess what it is.\n\nAsperger syndrome may be observed and diagnosed in early childhood. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it is thought to have a genetic cause. The part of the brain which controls a person's \"social behavior\" (understanding and communicating with other people) may grow or function differently in a person with Asperger syndrome. Another part of the brain that may be different is the part that controls some body movement such as balance. A person with this condition may walk or act in a clumsy way and have trouble doing body actions such as sports. They may also do physical actions repetitively, such as rocking, flapping their hands, or tapping their feet. The condition seems to run in families. Parents who have Asperger syndrome often have children who have it or another kind of autism.\n\nAsperger syndrome cannot be found by testing blood or looking at someone's body. A medical doctor needs to talk with the person and other people who know him or her well, to watch how the person moves and behaves, and to learn about the person's past. Sometimes a doctor believes by mistake that the person has schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, or mental retardation instead. Tourette syndrome with \"tics\" (repetitive, uncontrolled actions like twitching, blinking, and coughing) sometimes comes with Asperger syndrome. Many people with Asperger syndrome also have ADHD and/or OCD.\n\nPeople who have Asperger syndrome have normal to high intelligence. As children, they may need special help at home and school to learn social behavior. The syndrome cannot be made better by taking medicine. (People who have this condition are sometimes given medicine to help them with depression, which is often experienced by people with the syndrome.)\n\nPeople with Asperger syndrome can have a hard time \"fitting in\" with other people. Adults who have it usually learn enough \"coping skills\" to act in a way that seems normal, but often with a few differences. Most people with the syndrome can communicate clearly with friends and family. They may have more difficulty in communicating with new people.\n\nAsperger's syndrome characteristics include:\n\nAsperger syndrome is noticeable when the person acts differently in social situations. Their social disabilities can have different levels. It’s not everybody who have Asperger syndrome that have the same level. This characteristic is not the only one. Someone who dislikes people in general does not necessarily have Aspergers. Other characteristics that can be identified are that Asperger people hate any changes in their routine. They also dislike having eye contact. Most of the time they will try to avoid it. They will look away. Usually people who deal with Asperger syndrome have less facial expression than anybody else. There are many characteristics. If someone only has some of these characteristics, there is probably no problem with them.\n\nIn the 1940s, a doctor named Hans Asperger studied some children that were different from most other children that he knew, but were like each other. He called them \"little professors\" because he thought that they were interesting and wrote a book about them. Dr. Asperger thought his \"little professors\" had a different sort of personality.\n\nIn the 1980s Dr. Lorna Wing made up the name \"Asperger syndrome\" for people with high-functioning autism after research into Hans Asperger's work.\n\nIn 1994 Asperger syndrome was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\n\nIn 2013 Asperger syndrome was removed from the DSM.\n\nAsperger syndrome is much more common in males than females. Statistics say that three males are affected for every one female.\n\n", "id": "192250", "title": "Asperger syndrome"}

It was set in a home for old people. The Dutch title literally means, \"Yes, Sister; No, Sister\"; because in the Netherlands, as in Britain and many other countries, nurses of a certain rank are called \"Sister\".\n\nThe series was broadcast between 1966 and 1968 and consisted of 20 episodes. \n\nThe script was written by Annie M.G. Schmidt who was already very well known as a writer of books for children and scripts for television and radio programmes. The songs were written by Harry Bannink.\n\nDutch people today, especially those who remember the original series, are very disappointed that, apart from one programme, the whole series has been lost. This is because it was recorded on Ampex tape which was very expensive so, after the episodes had been shown on television, other television programmes were recorded on the same tape over the top of it. Some of the film that was shot outside has been preserved. 15 of the songs from the series have also been preserved. They were made into a gramophone record (LP) and later into a CD.\n\nA film with the same title, based on the series, was produced in 2002. It starred Loes Luca as Zuster (Sister) Klivia and Paul Kooij as her landlord and nextdoor neighbour, Buurman Boordeval.\n\nThe stories in the television series are about a group of people who live in “Rusthuis Klivia”. The word “rusthuis” means “resthouse”. It is usually used in Dutch to describe an old people’s home (retirement home), although some of the actors in the programme were not really old. There was always chaos in the home. The characters were very strange. One of them grew spinach in the garden, one of them was an engineer who was always doing experiments in the cellar. One of them was a burglar. The neighbour tries to get everyone evicted (thrown out), but he never succeeds. \n\nEach episode had a guest actor who was often a well-known Dutch television personality.\n\nThere were many songs in the series. The most popular ones include \"De kat van ome Willem\" (\"Uncle Williams’ Cat\"), \"Ja Zuster, Nee Zuster\" (\"Yes Nurse, No Nurse\"), \"Niet met de deuren slaan\" (\"Don’t bang the doors\") and \"M'n opa\" (\"My grandpa\").\n\nIn 1999 a book was published with reconstructions of the stories. An exhibition was opened between November 2002 and March 2003 in Hoorn, North Holland. A musical is now being made which should be ready by 2009. It will be performed in many theatres throughout the Netherlands.\n\n", "id": "192459", "title": "Ja zuster, nee zuster"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192578", "text": "Bayreuth Festival\n\nThe Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth, Germany, at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed. It was Wagner's own idea to start a festival for his operas in Bayreuth in a theatre which he designed himself because he was not satisfied with the way that theatres were usually designed.\n\nThe theatre that he designed is called the Festspielhaus (Festival House). Wagner watched the theatre being built, making sure that it was done the way he wanted it. He had some new ideas about theatre design. For example: he wanted the orchestra pit to be so low that the orchestra would not be seen by the audience.\n\nWhen the theatre was opened in 1876 his cycle of operas called the \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" was performed complete for the first time.\n\nThe festival immediately became internationally famous. Almost every serious musician in Europe wanted to go to Bayreuth to hear Wagner's music performed there. Composers usually either loved it and were strongly influenced by it, or they hated it and reacted against it.\n\nThe festival still continues now. Every August there is a festival of Wagner's operas. It is extremely difficult to get tickets because so many people want to go. People often wait for ten years before they can get a ticket.\n\nWagner wanted the festival to be in a small town where people could just concentrate on his music. Bayreuth already had a theatre, the Markgräfliches Opernhaus, but it was not suitable for modern opera. The town did not have a cultural life that would be in competition with Wagner's music. Another reason for choosing Bayreuth was that it was outside the area where the rights to perform his operas were not under his control (he had sold these rights many years earlier in order to raise money).\n\nKing Ludwig II of Bavaria gave a lot of money to Wagner to built the new opera house. Wagner also made tours across Germany to get money for it. Societies were established to raise money.\nThe architect who designed the opera house was Gottfried Semper.\n\nThe opening took place on August 13, 1876, with a performance of Das Rheingold. A lot of important people were there, including Kaiser Wilhelm, Dom Pedro II of Brazil, King Ludwig (who came in secret, perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser), and other members of the nobility, as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and the composers Anton Bruckner, Edvard Grieg, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Hans Richter was the conductor.\n\nDuring Wagner's life the festival just performed the Ring Cycle and, later, his opera \"Parsifal\". After Wagner's death, his widow Cosima continued to run the festival. She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written, so that all ten operas were in the repertoire. The operas were always performed exactly as Wagner had done. Nothing was allowed to be changed in any way.\n\nAfter Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906, Wagner's son Siegfried took over management of the festival. He did some things differently, introducing new staging and performance styles. When he died in 1930 the festival was run by his widow Winifred.\n\nIn the 1920s, some years before the rise of the Nazi party, Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Because of this, Bayreuth was able to continue getting a lot of money during the Nazi period. Wagner's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools. It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers, long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany. Winifred's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti-fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini, begging him to lead the festival. Toscanini refused.\n\nIt was during this time that the festival made its first break from tradition. They stopped using the 19th century scenery on the stage. Many people disagreed with this, including Toscanini and Richard Strauss, and even some members of the Wagner family. They thought it should stay exactly like Wagner had known it.\n\nDuring the war, the Nazi party ran the festival. Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting. These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances, even if they were not interested in music.\n\nA lot of Bayreuth was destroyed by bombing in the last days of World War II, though the theatre itself was undamaged. After the war, Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party. Ironically, it was because of Winifred that the theatre was not bombed. She had not allowed it to be used for military purposes, so it was not a military target. After the war the theatre was used for other kinds of concerts for the next few years. The festival started again in 1951, opening with a performance of Beethoven's Symphony no 9, followed by a performance of Wagner's opera, \"Parsifal\"\n\nWieland Wagner, the composer's grandson, had some very new ideas, including very abstract scenery. Some of the audience even booed. What Wieland was trying to do was to make a big break from the past with its association with Hitler. Wieland died in 1966. For a time people wondered whether the festival would continue. There were a lot of arguments within the Wagner family. Wieland's brother Wolfgang Wagner remained in charge of running the festival for the next 42 years, while the money was controlled by the Richard Wagner Foundation.\n\nWieland Wagner started a workshop in Bayreuth in which directors could meet and discuss new ideas for presenting the operas. This made it easier for new ideas to be accepted, and gave new life to the festival.\n\nThe centenary of the festival was celebrated in 1976 with a great production of the Ring directed by the French director Patrice Chereau. His production concentrated on showing how the Ring was about the 19th century working class being used by the wealthy capitalists. Some people thought it was the best opera performance they had ever seen, others hated it.\n\nThere has been a lot of uncertainty about what would happen after Wolfgang retired. Many people wanted the festival to continue to be in the hands of the Wagner family. On 1 September 2008, Wolfgang Wagner's daughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner, were named by Bavaria's culture minister to take over the Festival. They have said that they want to \"bring opera to the people\". In 2009 Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\" will be live on the web. It will only cost £12.90 to watch online. People will also be able to watch it for free on a big screen in the centre of Bayreuth.\n\n", "id": "192578", "title": "Bayreuth Festival"}

He is best known for his studies in bioacoustics, the science of hearing and communicating.\n\nRegen was born in the village of Lajše (now Slovenia). His mother encouraged his interest in insect sounds. His father lost a lot of money bring cloth into Slovenia and could not pay for Ivan to go to school. Ivan was given a scholarship so that he could go to school at the local seminary. He was able to save enough money go to study in Vienna. He studied natural history at the University of Vienna with teachers Grobben, Exner and Claus. He got his doctorate in 1897 and began to work as a school teacher in Vienna, and later in Hranice, Moravia. Exner helped him get a job back in Vienna. He worked in a secondary school there until his retirement in 1918.\n\nRegen began to study insects in great detail. He was one of the first Slovenian scientists to work in another country after World War I. He was the first scientist to study the grasshopper in a lot of detail. He studied katydid and cricket sounds, he proved that insects did react to sounds from each other. He was able to make crickets react to artificial sounds using a loudspeaker. In one experiment, he used a telephone to send sounds from one cricket to another in different rooms. Later, he showed that insects hear with their ear drum. He was the first person to work out what the ear drum does. He is the person who started the study of bioacoustics. He also studied the insects breathing, their hibernation, coloring, and how they shed their skin.\n\nRegen's largest project was his \"geobiological laboratory\", a large glass cage, called a terrarium. He used this to study the way crickets could find other crickets using sounds; this is called phonotaxis. Using up to 1600 females with normal or damaged hearing, he was able to work out how they did this.\n\nHe worked for himself after 1911, but he supported several groups and organizations in Slovenia. He started using Slovene terminology in his areas of study. In 1921, he was asked to be a professor at the University of Ljubljana, but did not take it. In 1940, he became a member of Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts and was also a member of Slovenian Society of Natural History. \n\nEven though he was a famous scientist known around the world, he was poor and lived alone. His experiments were paid for by the Austrian Academy of Sciences, but he was not allowed to be a member. He did all his work at home.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193066", "text": "Developing country\n\nDifferent people have tried to classify countries into different groups. This is usually done either by looking at how rich people are, on average, in different countries, or how well-developed the political system is. Most of the time there are two groups, namely developing countries and developed ones. Sometimes there are three groups, in which case the third group is between developing and developed countries, and is usually called emerging countries.\n\nThese definitions are problematic, because a high standard of living does not just mean that people make a lot of money. The main problem is that things cost different amounts in different countries. Just because people earn more money in one country does not necessarily mean they are better-off; they might earn more simply because the cost of living is higher.

It is one of the Line Islands. In the 19th century the island used to be called Independence Island at times. The island is uninhabited today, it has been made into a nature reserve for breeding seabirds.\n\nMalden Island is located 242 nautical miles (nmi) south of the equator, 150 nmi south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The coast of South America is more than 4,000 nautical miles (5,000 statute miles or 8,000 km) to the east.\n\nThe nearest land is uninhabited Starbuck Island, 110 nmi to the southwest. The closest inhabited place is Tongareva (Penrhyn Island),243 nmi to the southwest. The nearest airport is on Kiritimati (Christmas Island), 365 nmi to the northwest. There are other uninhabited islands nearby. They include Jarvis Island, 373 nmi to the northwest, Vostok Island, 385 nmi to the south-southeast, and Caroline (Millennium) Island, 460 nmi to the southeast.\n\nThe island has roughly the shape of an equilateral triangle, with on a side, aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast. The west and south corners are slightly truncated, shortening the north, east and southwest coasts to about , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km (–1 mi) in length. \n\nThere is a large lagoon with many small islets in the east-central part of the island. The lagoon is completely sourrounded by land. It is connected to the sea by underground channels, and is quite salty. Most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon. The total area of the island is about 39.2 square kilometers. \n\nThe island is very low, no more than above sea level at its highest point. The highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline. The inside forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level (filled by the lagoon) in the east central part. Because of this topography, the ocean cannot be seen from much of Malden's interior.\n\nThere is no standing fresh water on Malden Island, though a fresh water lens may exist.\n\nA continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast, forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach. On the west coast, the white sandy beach is bigger. On the rest of the coast there is a strip of dark gray coral rubble, forming a ridge. This makes the beach itself smaller.\n\nGeorge Anson Byron, a British captain, discovered Malden Island on 30 July 1824. He named it after Charles Robert Malden who was the first to land on the island. At the time of its discovery, the island was uninhabited, but there were ruins. Archeologists discovered that the island was inhabited by between 100 and 200 Polynesians, a few centuries earlier. \n\nThe ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges. Most of them are on the north and south sides. Overall, twenty-one sites are known. Three of them are larger than the others. They can be found on the northwest side of the island. The sites are either temples, houses or graves. The temple ruins are referred to as marae. Similar marae have also been found on other islands, such as Raivavae, one of the Austral Islands.\n\nThe inhabitants had also made wells, but later settlers found them to be dry, or too salty.\n\nIn 1828, guano was discovered on the island. In 1856, the United States wanted to get the Island, but Australian firms had already started to mine the guano deposits. Guano mining stopped about 1927. In 1956 and 1957, Great Britain tested H-bombs on the island. The tests were called Operation Grapple.\n", "id": "193067", "title": "Malden Island"}

The title \"Minster\" is given to churches which in the Anglo-Saxon period were missionary teaching churches. \n\nYork Minster is in the city of York, Yorkshire, north-east England. It is the 'seat' of the Archbishop of York, the second-ranked religious official of the Church of England. The Minster is run by a Chapter (committee) under the Dean of York, who manages the affairs of the Minster. \n\nThe architecture of the Minster is English Gothic architecture, from Early English in 1270 to Perpendicular in 1472. The Minster has a wide, Decorated Gothic nave (where the congregation sits) and Chapter house. The choir (spelled 'quire' by the church) is slightly later English Gothic architecture. The east end, and north and south transepts are in a similar style. The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338. \n\nSome of the stained glass in York Minster dates back to the twelfth century. Over the Lady Chapel in the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), one of the largest areas of mediaeval stained glass in the world. The window is known to be the work of John Thornton of Coventry a master glazier and stained glass artist who was active in England during the first half of the 15th century. \n\nIn the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, each narrow window being over high. The south transept contains the famous Rose window. About 2 million individual pieces of glass make up the cathedral's 128 stained glass windows. Much of the glass was removed before and pieced back together after the First and Second World Wars, and the windows are constantly being cleaned and restored to keep their beauty intact.\n\nA total of seven clock bells, 14 change ringing bells and 22 carillon bells are lodged in the towers. The carillon bells are played on a baton keyboard in the ringing chamber. The largest bell is Great Peter, which strikes the hour. It weighs 10.8 tons.\n\nYork has had a Christian presence from the 300s. The first church on the site was a wooden structure built hurriedly in 627 to provide a place to baptise Edwin, King of Northumbria. A stone building was completed in 637, and was dedicated to Saint Peter. Its school and library were started in the 7th century.\n\nIn 741 the church was destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt as a bigger building, with thirty altars. The church and the entire area then passed through the hands of Norse invaders. The Benedictine archbishop Ealdred travelled to Westminster to crown William in 1066. Ealdred died in 1069 and was buried in the church.\n\nThe church was damaged in 1069, but the first Norman archbishop, arriving in 1070, organised repairs. The Danes destroyed the church in 1075, but it was again rebuilt from 1080. Built in the Norman style, it was 111 m (364.173 ft) long. The new structure was damaged by fire in 1137 but was soon repaired. The choir and crypt were remodelled in 1154, and a new chapel was built, all in the Norman style.\n\nThe Gothic style in cathedrals had arrived in the mid 12th century. Walter de Gray was made archbishop in 1215 and ordered the construction of a Gothic structure to compare with Canterbury; building began in 1220. The cathedral was declared complete and consecrated in 1472.\n\nThe English Reformation led to the first Anglican archbishop. Some of the cathedral's treasures were taken by the Crown, and the church lost some of its land. Under Elizabeth I there was an effort to remove all traces of the Roman Catholic Church from the cathedral; there was much destruction of tombs, windows, and altars. In the English Civil War the city was besieged and fell to the forces of Cromwell in 1644, but Thomas Fairfax prevented any further damage to the cathedral.\n\n", "id": "193083", "title": "York Minster"}

It is a surprise attack from a hidden position against an enemy. The enemy may be moving or they may have stopped. Ambush uses the element of surprise to confuse the enemy soldiers long enough to be successful. The point of an ambush is not to gain territory. Instead it may be used to harass an enemy. It may also be used to or key assets (people, equipment, supplies, etc.).\n\nOne of the earliest recorded use of the ambush was in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. A Germanic leader Arminius ambushed three Roman legions under the command of Varus. The 20,000 Roman soldiers were strung out in a long line of march through the densely wooded forest. They fought for days but in the end the Romans were completely destroyed.

The hollow balls are fired as a single round that breaks apart upon leaving the muzzle of a black powder cannon, which were common common to the 1700 and 1800's. Grape shot is quite different from a shell or shrapnel rounds.\n\nA shell is a hollow ball packed with explosive and a fuse. The fuse is lit by the explosive charge that sends the shell towards its target. It is designed to explode when it reaches its target. Grape shot begins to spread as soon as it leaves the gun or cannon. Shrapnel, while similar to both, is different and more deadly. Invented by a British officer during the Napoleonic Wars, it is a fused explosive shell filled with many small balls or iron/lead bits. When the shell bursts the small bits scatter in a more or less spherical pattern with usually fatal force. \n\nAll three of these rounds, grape shot, shell, and shrapnel, are extremely effective against troops, horses and other livestock. They can also destroy wooden structures from their intense fragmentation impact. Shells have historically been particularly effective as incendiaries against wooden targets, which they ignite from the heat of their explosive blast. Grape shot sends out mini-missiles across a wide pattern. This is best for people targets, but it may be quite damaging against nearby wooden structures.\n", "id": "193205", "title": "Grapeshot"}

Using paratroopers is called \"paradrop operations\".\n\nThe idea of dropping soldiers from height dates back to Benjamin Franklin whose idea was to drop soldiers with parachutes from balloons. The idea was not very practical, but the development of aeroplanes in World War I meant that it was feasible (that is: a working idea) to drop soldiers with parachutes from air.\n\nItaly was the first country which founded airborne forces in the 1930s. Germany and Soviet Union soon followed. Germany was the first country to use paratroopers, called \"Fallschirmjäger\" (German language for \"parachute ranger\") in combat in World War Two. Germany dropped paratroops in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Norway in 1940. United Kingdom founded its own airborne forces in 1941. The first British paradrop operation was a guerrilla strike against an important water line in Italy. In 1941, the Germans launched a massive paradrop operation in Crete, capturing the island from the British. The British troops had fought back so bitterly and caused so heavy casualties (that is: dead and wounded) to the German paratroopers that Adolf Hitler forbade any further paradrop operations.\n\nWhen United States joined the war, it founded its own airborne forces. Americans made paradrops in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France and Germany itself. The first really large paradrop operation was the Normandy invasion, called \"Operation Overlord\" 6.6. 1944 where the British dropped one and Americans dropped two divisions of paratroopers in Normandy, France to capture important bridges and traffic junctions.\n\nThe largest paradrop operation ever was Operation Market Garden in September 1944, which led into liberation of Belgium and capture of important ports at Rhine mouth. The last paradrop operation in World War Two was Operation Varsity, which was used to secure the bridgeheads at River Rhine and to open roads to Germany itself.\n\nThe development of helicopter meant that troops could now be carried and landed quickly on the spot and there was no more need for large scale paradrop operations. The last large paradrop has been during the Suez Crisis 1951 when the British dropped a battalion of paratroops at Suez.\n\nParatroops are elite troops in all armies around the world. They work as light infantry, and receive an extremely hard and good training. They are taught to run, fight, carry weapons, move and survive in very difficult terrain and conditions. All paratroopers are always volunteers. To become a paratrooper, a soldier must be very fit, very intelligent, have a very good discipline and have enough courage to jump off an aeroplane.\n\nParatroopers are mainly used as rangers in modern warfare. A ranger is a soldier who is employed very far from home base, often behind enemy lines. Their main task is to capture important bridges, buildings, villages and other sites, do guerrilla strikes like blowing up an enemy railway line, capture enemy leaders and important soldiers and do long range reconnaissance (that is: scouting and gathering information of enemy troops, movements etc).\n\nParatroopers are dropped off an aeroplane or helicopter at a place where they are meant to operate. The place where the paratroopers jump is called \"drop zone\" (DZ). Paratroopers usually jump from heights of 100 to 400 m. They usually use round \"bell\" parachutes and they use static line deployment. (See the article Parachute on how the static line works.) They usually carry pistols and rifles with them, and their other weapons and gear are dropped on containers at the same time.\n\nOnce the paratroopers have landed, they take off their parachute rigs and gather to designated gathering areas under their leaders. The leaders then assign them orders, such as \"Capture that bridge, install there dynamite and blow the bridge up so that the enemy cannot use it\". \n\nOnce the paratroopers have carried out their mission, they usually either wait their own troops to arrive to where they are and free them from duty, or run away on foot or skis or they might steal a car and drive to the own lines.\n\nMany paratrooper units have their own names, such as British \"Red Devils\", American \"Screaming Eagles\" and \"All American\" and German \"Green Devils\".\n\n", "id": "193207", "title": "Paratrooper"}

It can attack using electricity which comes from two red pouches (called \"Denkibukuro\") on its cheeks. It can evolve into Raichu, which is bigger and stronger. A minuscule and frail Pokémon called Pichu can evolve into Pikachu. Pikachu appears in most Pokémon games in some way.\n\"Chu\" comes from the power of speech of a mouse in Japanese.\n\nPikachu is the finest known of all Pokémon because it is the authorized mascot of the series. It is also one of the principal characters of the Pokémon anime and comic books. In one of the first Pokémon games, \"Pokémon Yellow\", it is the player's starter Pokémon. It actually symbolizes Pokemon.

He has appeared in \"Super Smash Bros.\", \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" as a very fast and light playable character. In the game Pokemon Go, Pikachu can be found wearing a Santa hat at Christmas.\n\nPichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but does not have as much power as a Pikachu. It evolves to Pikachu when it is very happy. There are special forms of Pichu: a notched-ear Pichu, and a Pikachu-colored Pichu as event Pokémon in the \"Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver\" games. Pichu has appeared as an unlockable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" where it has a cloned moveset to Pikachu's but takes damage when it uses electric attacks. Pichu features in the intro of the third Pokémon movie.\n\nRaichu is the evolved form of Pikachu and has orange fur, unlike Pikachu's yellow fur. In order for a Pikachu to evolve into a Raichu, it must use a Thunderstone. It can hold much more electricity in its cheeks. In the Pokémon anime, Gym Leader Lt.

Over the years, it became one of the biggest attractions in Florida, known for its water ski shows, nice gardens, and Southern Belle models.\n\nIt became known as the \"Water Ski Capital of the World\" because many of the sport's major \"firsts\" and over 50 world records were broken there. Many movies have been filmed at the park, including parts of \"This is Cinerama,\" the first feature filmed in that wide-screen format, and several of Esther Williams films and TV specials in the 1950s and 1960s. With their addition of a custom photography boat named Miss Cover Girl in the early 1960s, the park became a popular site for the filming of television commercials.\n\nCompetition for guests increased after the Walt Disney World Resort opened nearby in 1971. In the early 1980s, the Popes retired and gave the park to their son, Dick Pope Jr.\n\nIn the 1980s, book publisher Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich bought the park along with SeaWorld, Circus World (later rebuilt as Boardwalk & Baseball) and Stars Hall of Fame, but sold most of the businesses to Anheuser-Busch in 1989. Busch continued to run Cypress Gardens until April 1, 1995, when a group of the park's managers led by Bill Reynolds bought the property.\n\nUnder President and CEO Reynolds, the park ran until April 13, 2003, when it closed after a long tourism decline following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 529 people were put out of work with only three days notice. \n\nRight away the Friends of Cypress Gardens, started and led by Burma Davis Posey, was founded. They enrolled members in all 50 states and 27 countries. Within three and a half months, this grass-roots effort raised $13,500,000 and saved the park.\n\nOn February 22, 2004, Adventure Parks Group, owned by Kent Buescher, bought the property and renamed it Cypress Gardens Adventure Park. The purchase of the amusement park portion of the Cypress Gardens property was part of a larger conservation agreement. In that agreement, the entire site was bought from its previous owner, First Gardens, L.C., by The Trust for Public Land, a nation wide conservation group . TPL then sold a conservation access over the entire property to the state of Florida, while Polk County purchased the gardens portion of the property, less the development rights conveyed in the state agreement. Adventure Parks Group purchased the balance of the property, also subject to the conservation agreement.\n\nBuescher's plan to reopen the park in September 2004 was delayed by damages created by hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Cypress Gardens Adventure Park finally opened in November 2004. One of its new rides, the Triple Hurricane roller coaster, was named for the fierce storm season. The Splash Island water park opened in 2005, along with the Galaxy Spin roller coaster.\n\nIn September 2006, Adventure Parks Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at the Florida site following approximately $30 million in damages sustained by the 2004 hurricanes.\n\nLand South Adventures, a branch of Mulberry, Florida-based Land South Holdings, bought Cypress Gardens at a bankruptcy auction on October 16, 2007 for $16.9 million, leaving Buescher as temporary manager until Baker Leisure Group of Orlando, Florida took over running the park in January 2008.\n\nMany celebrities have skied and visited at the park, including Elvis Presley, Jordan's former King Hussein and his son, King Abdullah II. It was also the site of a Johnny Carson special.\n\nOn Monday, November 10, 2008, Land South Holdings announced the temporary closure of the park, which was shut down November 17 of that year. It reopened on March 28, 2009 with an expanded water park, named Splash Island. The rides and animals, however, were gone. The reopening prices were reduced.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193297", "text": "Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion\n\nThe Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion is a musical composition by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It was written for a very unusual combination of players. Four players are needed to perform this sonata: two pianists and two percussion players. The two pianists each have a piano, and the two percussion players play seven instruments between them: three timpani, xylophone, one side drum with snares and one without, a suspended cymbal, a pair of cymbals, a bass drum, a triangle and a tam-tam.\n\nIn the introduction to the score Bartók gave very precise instructions about how the different percussion instruments should be played, the kinds of beaters to be used, and a plan of how they were to be grouped on stage.\n\nThere are three movements: a fast movement, a slow movement and a fast movement. The first movement starts with a slow introduction.\n\nThere are many interesting and unusual things to listen out for in the music. For example, in the first movement the timpani sometimes play glissandos. This means that the pitch of the notes slides up or down. The player needs to have timpani with pedals to do this. This movement is in sonata form.\n\nThe second movement sounds very creepy. Bartók quite often wrote music which sounded like insects at night. This is one of his “night pieces”. In the climax to this exciting music Piano One plays lots of glissandos.\n\nThe last movement is a big contrast to the atmosphere in the slow movement. It is like a lively dance.\n\nThe sonata was first performed in Basle in 1938 with the composer playing one piano and his wife Ditta playing the other one. Fritz Schiesser and Philipp Rühlig played the percussion. It immediately became very popular and has since been one of his best- known works. Bartók also made a version for the two pianos to play with an orchestra, but it is not normally performed like that.\n\n", "id": "193297", "title": "Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193305", "text": "Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)\n\nConcerto for Orchestra is the title of a work for orchestra by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók. It is one of the most famous orchestral pieces of the mid-20th century.\n\nSeveral composers have written works to which they gave the title “Concerto for Orchestra”. It is an unusual title because a concerto is normally a work for one solo instrument and an orchestra. The soloist is given a lot of opportunity to show off his (or her) talent. In a “Concerto for Orchestra” there is no soloist, but the composer thinks it is different from a symphony because a lot of the instruments in the orchestra are treated like soloists during the piece. This is what happens in Béla Bartók’s concerto.\n\nThe work was written in 1943 and it was first performed on 1 December 1944 in the Boston Symphony Hall by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. It was immediately a great success. Koussevitszky asked Bartók to write this piece. Bartók had just arrived in United States from Hungary. He had to flee because of World War II. Bartók had no money and so he was glad to get some work.\n\nBartók often uses ideas from the Classical music period in this work. He also uses ideas from folk music from central Europe, especially Hungarian music. Quite often the music is not in a major or minor key. He uses folk scales which have different kinds of scales called modes. Sometimes tunes sound like folk music. At other times there are drones in the horns and strings.\n\nThe orchestra needs 3 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (one doubling bass clarinet), 3 bassoons (one doubling contrabassoon), 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tamtam, 2 harps and strings\n\nThe first movement, called \"Introduzione\" by Bartók, is a slow introduction which sounds like music describing the night. This is something Bartók did several times in his works. It is in sonata form.\n\nThe second movement is called \"Giuoco delle coppie\" which means \"Game of pairs\". Pairs of instruments take it in turns to play a tune, each pair playing music which is separated by a different interval.\n\nThe third movement, called \"Elegia\" by Bartók, is another slow movement, typical of Bartók's night music.\n\nThe fourth movement, called \"Intermezzo interrotto\" by Bartók, has a flowing melody with a time signature which keeps changing. There is also a theme which pokes fun at the march tune in Dmitri Shostakovich's \"\"Leningrad\" Symphony (No. 7)\". There is a very difficult bit for the timpani where the player has to play lots of different pitches in a very short section.\n\nThe fifth movement, called \"Finale\" is a very fast movement with lots of energy and plenty of folk tunes.\n\n", "id": "193305", "title": "Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193311", "text": "Bluebird K7\n\nBluebird K7 is a boat built for Donald Campbell to break the World Water Speed Record. Bluebird was a special kind of boat, called a hydroplane, that skims over the top of the water instead of pushing through it like a normal boat. Bluebird was powered by a jet engine. It set new world water speed records seven times; the fastest was 276 mph (445 km/h). Bluebird was destroyed when Campbell tried to set an eighth record by going faster than 300 mph (480 km/h) on Coniston Water in 1967.\n\nCampbell had been using his father's boat, Bluebird K4, to try and set new records. Bluebird K4 was destroyed when its structure broke. After this, Donald had the idea for a jet powered hydroplane to take the world water speed record from the American propeller hydroplane Slo-mo-shun. Ken and Lewis Norris designed and built K7 based on Donald's ideas.\n\nK7 was a three-point hydroplane, meaning that when going quickly the boat only touched the water in three places, one point near the back of the boat and one point at the back of the two sponsons (the sponsons are the floats either side of the boat, near its front in the photos). It was built of aluminium on top of a steel frame and was at first powered by a small turbojet.\n\nThe name K7 came from the rating given to the boat by Lloyds of London\n\nCampbell set seven world water speed records in K7 between 1955 and 1964:\n\n\nIn 1966, Campbell decided he wanted to make Bluebird go faster than 300 mph (480 km/h).\n\nBluebird's old engine was not strong enough to make it go this fast, so it was replaced with a more powerful Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine taken from an old fighter jet. Many other changes were made, the tail fin from the fighter was attached to Bluebird's rear, the cover over the cockpit was changed to push through the air more easily, and the floats at the front were also changed. Bluebird was taken to Coniston Water to be tested in 1966. The tests did not go well, the weather was too bad to test the boat while moving, so it was tied down and tested without moving instead. When testing the engine it sucked in too much air and caused parts of the boat to break. The engine was broken when the broken parts were sucked into it. This meant that the entire engine had to be replaced.\n\nAt the end of November the weather was good enough for some test runs, but the speed was a lot lower than Bluebird's old records. The fuel pumps could not pump enough fuel to the engine so it could not run at full speed. The problem was fixed by fitting two fuel pumps instead of one.\n\nOn 4 January 1967, the problems had all been fixed, the weather was good and Campbell decided he wanted to try and break the speed record. For a world record to be official, a boat trying to set a record has to make two runs at full speed that are timed by people who are not part of the record breaking team. The official speed is the average speed of the two runs. On the first run Bluebird's speed was 297.6 mph (478.9 km/h) which was fast enough to be a new record, but not quite as fast as Campbell wanted to go. To set a record of more than 300 mph the second run would have to be 302.5 mph or faster.\n\nThe plan for the world record attempt was for Bluebird to stop at the far end of the lake and refuel from another boat that had been put there for that purpose. Taking time to refuel would also give the lake, which had been disturbed by the first run, time to settle down again. On the actual record attempt, Campbell decided not to refuel and instead started on his second run immediately. Why he did this is unknown.\n\nAt the start of the second run, Bluebird was going faster than 320 mph (510 km/h) and would have easily broken the 300 mph target, but as the boat travelled along the lake it started tramping (which means rocking from side to side). Bluebird hit a wave made on the lake from its own first run and the boat spun out of the water. When it hit the water again it broke into pieces and sank. Donald Campbell was killed in the crash. His teddy bear mascot was found floating in the lake later on but Campbell's body could not be found.\n\nIn 2001 a diver called Bill Smith led a salvage team which found Bluebird on the bottom of Coniston Water, and later lifted the wreck back to dry land. The wreck was taken apart carefully to keep it from rusting and is now being put back together again. There was a lot of damage caused in the crash but it can all be repaired. Bill Smith also got a new engine for Bluebird and hopes to return the boat to full working order.\n\nIn 2009 Bill Smith got permission to run Bluebird on Coniston at high speed to prove that it has been fixed properly. This will happen when his team has finished putting the boat back together again.\n\nDonald Campbell's body was also found in 2001. He was buried on 12th September 2001 in Coniston cemetery.\n", "id": "193311", "title": "Bluebird K7"}

It was the first Sun-like star, other than the Sun, found to have a planet orbiting it, this discovery was first made public in 1995.\n\nThe exoplanet's discovery was made public on October 6, 1995 by Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz. The discovery was made using the radial velocity method at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, using a tool called the ELODIE spectrograph that is used to find planets that are outside our Solar System. \n\nThe star itself has an apparent brightness of 5.49, and because of this it is able to be seen from the Earth with binoculars, or with the naked eye if it is dark outside. 51 Pegasi is a yellow dwarf star that is thought to be around 7.5 billion years old, which is somewhat older than our Sun. 51 Pegasi is also 4-6% more massive than our Sun with more metal content. However, it is running low on hydrogen. \n\nIn 1996 astronomers Baliunas, Sokoloff, and Soon calculated that it takes 51 Pegasi b 37 days to orbit 51 Pegasi.\n\nAfter the announcement, on October 12, 1995, more proof that this star did exist came from Dr. Geoffrey Marcy from San Francisco State University and Dr. R. Paul Butler from the University of California, Berkeley using the Hamilton Spectrograph at the Lick Observatory near San Jose in California.\n\n51 Pegasi b is the first discovered planet of its parent star, 51 Pegasi. If any more are discovered they will be named 51 Pegasi c, 51 Pegasi d, and so on. The planet has been informally named Bellerophon. After its discovery, many teams proved its existence and continued to find out more about its properties, including the fact that it orbits very close to the star, has estimated temperatures around 1200 Celsius, and has a minimum mass about half that of Jupiter.\n\n", "id": "193322", "title": "51 Pegasi"}

It started when people wanted to bring together what is called \"classical philosophy\" with the teachings of \nChristian theology. Classical philosophy is the philosophy developed in Ancient Greece. \nScholasticism is not a philosophy or a theology, but rather a way of teaching and learning. Scholasticism emphasises the use of dialectic. The main purpose of scholasticism is to find an answer to a question, or to show that a contradiction can be resolved. \n\nScholasticism was started by people like Saint Ambrose and St. Augustine. They tried to use philosophy to help explain the doctrine and mysteries of the church. Ambrose and Augustine were among the first Church fathers who brought Christian ideas and Greek philosophy together. \n\nThe main figures of scholasticism were Peter Abelard, Albertus Magnus, Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Bonaventure and, most importantly, Thomas Aquinas. Summa Theologica is an ambitious synthesis of Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine. \n\nIn the 13th century, the teachings of Aristotle were considered more important than those of Plato. Scholastic education was very much based on written texts, and with arguments for and against ideas in those texts. In this way it differed greatly from modern science, which is based on observations from nature. In Aristotle the scholastics chose someone who was himself quite an original investigator of the natural world. But the scholastics themselves dealt almost entirely with the world in manuscripts written in two ancient languages. One was in Latin, the language of the Vulgate Bible and the other was Ancient Greek. Greek opened the doors to the writings of the Greek philosophers in their own language, at least so far as their works survived. The motto of Boethius “As far as you are able, join faith to reason” reminds us that all scholastics were mediaeval Christians. Their main concern was to see how the Greek ideas could be fitted into their religious view of the world.\n\n", "id": "193383", "title": "Scholasticism"}

Each animated piece, either character or background, can be formed and reformed into different shapes. People making a clay animation usually use something soft, like Plasticine clay. \n\nMost animation is made the same way, whether it is cel animation or stop motion. Each frame, or still picture, is recorded on film or digital media and then played back quickly. When played back at a frame rate of more than 10–12 frames per second, the human mind sees the series of slightly changing, rapidly playing images as movement. To us it seems as if the object is moving by itself. This way of tricking the mind into seeing \"movement\" is the way that all moving images work, from zoetrope to movies to videogames. The way CGI animations are made is different from the frame by frame method.\n\nIn clay animation, each object is made in clay, usually around a wire skeleton called an armature. The object is put on the set (background) and a still picture (one frame of film) is taken. The object or character is then moved slightly by hand. Another picture is taken, and the object is moved slightly again. This is repeated over and over. To get the best results, special care is taken to make sure that each frame is the same as the one before. For example, the lighting has to be the same and the object has to be put back in exactly the right place. The only thing that should be different is the slight change the animator makes to the object.\n\nMaking a stop-motion animation using clay is hard work. Normal movies use 24 frames per second (frame/s). Animation usually uses \"doubles\" or \"twos\"; that is using two frames for each shot. This means that 12 changes are made for one second of movie. For a 30-minute movie, there would be about 21,600 stops to change the objects for the next frame. For a full-length (90-minute) movie, there would be about 64,800 stops. IF some of the parts were done with only a single, not double frame, there would be even more stops. Great care must be taken to make sure that the object is not moved by accident. For full-length movies, animators now use rubber silicone and resin-cast objects. One foam-rubber method has been called \"Foamation\" by Will Vinton.\n\nSome famous clay animation movies have been made. Examples include:\n\nThe word \"Claymation\" is a registered trademark in the United States. It was registered by Will Vinton in 1978 to describe his clay animation films.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193500", "text": "Kota Kinabalu\n\nKota Kinabalu (), formerly Jesselton, is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia. It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah. The city is on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea. The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park is on one side and Mount Kinabalu, which gave the city its name, is nearby. Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304, while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000. It is the largest urban centre in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia.\n\nKota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally. It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo. Kinabalu National Park is about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city. Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia. These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia.\n\nIn the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo (now Sabah). In 1882, the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island (Pulau Gaya), which was already inhabited by the Bajau people. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh.\n\nAfter the rebellion, the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya. A nearby fishing village named \"Api-Api\" (see \"Original names\" below), was the next settlement of the Company. This new location was then designated as the main harbour and port, as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway. It was expanded and renamed \"Jesselton\", named after Sir Charles Jessel, the then Vice Chairman of the Company.\n\nEventually, Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo, dealing in rubber, rattan, honey, and wax. The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbour. Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon, and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region.\n\nJesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese. After the Japanese takeover of Borneo, it was again renamed Api. Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api. One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas, consisting of local inhabitants. The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces, after their leader, Albert Kwok, was arrested and executed in 1944. At the later stages of the war, what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945, leaving only three buildings standing. The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10, 1945.\n\nAfter the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946. The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan, which had also been destroyed by the war.\n\nWhen North Borneo together with Sarawak, Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital. Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30, 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.\n\nKota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu, about 90 kilometres east-northeast of the city. The meaning and origin of the name \"Kinabalu\" is uncertain. One theory suggests it means \"Chinese widow\", where \"Kina\" meaning \"Chinese\" (person) in Kadazandusun language, and \"balu\" meaning \"widow\" in Malay language. This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain. While he was here, he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken. Alternatively, it is also argued that \"Kinabalu\" or \"Akinabalu\" is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself. Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name \"Aki Nabalu\" meaning the \"revered place of the dead\", in which, \"Aki\" means \"ancestors\" or \"grandfather\", and \"Nabalu\" being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language. Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from \"Ki Nabalu\", where \"Ki\" meaning \"have\" or \"exist\", and \"Nabalu\" meaning \"spirit of the dead\".\n\n\"Kota\" is a Malay word for a \"fort\", \"town\", or a \"city\". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, Kota Bahru, Kota Tinggi, and Kota Kemuning. It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Henceforth, a direct translation of the name \"Kota Kinabalu\" into English would be \"City of Kinabalu\" or \"Kinabalu City\".\n\nBesides Jesselton, there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is \"Api-Api\", or sometimes simply \"Api\", which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'. It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh, as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates. There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called \"Sungai Api-Api\". Another theory states that \"Api-Api\" is the local name of the common \"Avicennia\" tree that grows in abundance around the area. Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of \"Ya Bi\" (亚庇 yà bì), the Hakkas here too adopted this name (亚庇,\"ah-bi\" which pronounced in Hakka, Chinese dialects) and some still use this name to this day. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name was \"Deasoka\", which roughly means \"below the coconut tree\" in the Bajau language. The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was \"Singgah Mata\" which literally mean \"transit eye\", but can be loosely translated as meaning \"pleasing to the eye\". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center. Today, all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are: \"Lintasan Deasoka\", \"Api-Api Centre\", \"Jalan Singgah Mata\", and \"Jesselton Point\".\n\nBeing the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based. Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is at nearby Likas Bay. There are four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city: Sepanggar (\"P.171\"), Kota Kinabalu (\"P.172\"), Putatan (\"P.173\"), and Penampang (\"P.174\"). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.\n\nKota Kinabalu currently has five sister cities.\n\nThe internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally state roads constructed and maintained by the state Public Works Department. Most major internal roads are dual-carriageways. One of the major road here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a ring road, circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely, Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran. There is currently no freeway in the city nor in any part of Sabah. The city is linked by highways to distant towns around Sabah and these are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. Highway routes from Kota Kinabalu include:\n\nPublic transportation:\n\nRegular bus services operate around the city. Minibuses or vans are also used besides buses as an alternative public transportation. There are two main bus terminals in the central business area. The terminal along Jalan Tun Razak provides internal bus services towards different part of the city and its outskirts. Another terminal near Bandaran Berjaya provides intercity services towards destinations south of the city (Papar, Tenom, Beaufort, and others). The Kota Kinabalu (North) Bus Terminal in Inanam provides intercity buses heading towards destinations north and north-east of the city (Tuaran, Kudat, Ranau, Sandakan, Tawau, Semporna, and others). Taxicabs too are around the city.\n\nA railway system formerly known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the interior to the port in Kota Kinabalu during the British occupation. The railway line connects Kota Kinabalu with Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today the railway is known as Sabah State Railway, and it provides daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates the leisure tour also called the \"North Borneo Railway\", which caters mainly for tourists. The train station and terminus are in Tanjung Aru.\n\nKota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA) provides flights linking the city with other domestic and international destinations. It is a secondary hub for Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia and it consists of two terminals. It is the second busiest airport in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur International Airport and it is a major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. It serves international flights to Bandar Seri Begawan, Shenzhen, Seoul, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Manila, Cebu, Singapore, Taibei, Gaoxiong, and other domestic cities. It is also a secondary hub for MASWings, which serves flights to smaller towns and rural areas in East Malaysia.\n\nKota Kinabalu has two ports: Kota Kinabalu Port and Sepanggar Bay Container Port (SBCP). Kota Kinabalu Port mainly loose/bulk cargo, while SBCP operates as a naval base for the Royal Malaysian Navy, oil depot and all containerised cargo. In 2004, Kota Kinabalu Port handled about 3.6 million tonnes of freight cargo, the third highest in the state after Sandakan Port, and Tawau Port. It however handles the most number of containers in the state, with 153,793 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) of containers handled in 2006. Sepanggar Bay Port will have the capacity to handle 200,000 TEU annually when its container terminal is completed. All ports in Sabah are managed and operated by Sabah Ports Sdn Bhd.\n\nKota Kinabalu Ferry Terminal is a passenger ferry terminal at Jesselton Point near the K.K. port. It provides ferry and motorboat services to the nearby islands for tourists as well as for commuters living on the islands. There are also regular scheduled ferry services to Labuan.\n", "id": "193500", "title": "Kota Kinabalu"}

At the beginning this temple was dedicated to Jupiter alone, it was built in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being worked on - this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii was at its height and so Roman Jupiter beat out the Greek Apollo and Jupiter(, Juno, and Minerva) in towns newly taken over by the Romans. This was also true for Pompeii, where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over.\n\nPompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC. It was still allowed to mostly run itself, however, until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC.\n\nThe building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks, but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style. As opposed to the previous Samnite rulers of Pompeii, the Romans thought that the building style was very important in religious as well as everyday life. Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place. Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city. \n\nThe temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum, and it became Pompeii's main temple after Rome took over. The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple, which held the statues of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and which only the priests were allowed to enter.\n\nIn 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii, destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter. After this, the much smaller Temple of Jupiter Meilichios became the main place of worship to Jupiter and his group of three ().

It has a pointed face and it is about the size of a rabbit. Once thought to be extinct, it is listed as being critically endangered. There are only about 40 of the animals left in the world. Gilbert's potoroo is one of the world's rarest mammals.\n\nThey live in a small area, about , on the southwest coast near Albany, Western Australia. This area is in the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Gilbert's Potoroos have been released on nearby Bald Island, and are breeding successfully. \n\nGilbert’s potoroo was first discovered in 1840, and named in 1841 after the English naturalist and explorer John Gilbert. Gilbert had collected several animals at King George Sound in Australia, including this potoroo. Gilbert’s potoroo was not seen again for many years, even though many people had searched for them in the 1970s. The species was believed to be extinct for 120 years before it was re-discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve. Liz Sinclair had been studying wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps. \n\nPotoroos live under thick bushes and shrubs. They have made tunnels and paths through the bush so they can get around easily. When moving slowly they use all four legs, but to move quickly they can hop like a kangaroo. Potoroos are nocturnal and they spend their days hiding. They only come out into the open very often. They live in small groups of between three to five animals. They eat different kinds of truffles and fungi. Australia has many different kinds of truffles and potoroos like to eat many of them. Potoroos have sharp three toed claws that help them dig into the ground to find the truffles growing in the soil. After eating them, the potoroos help spread the seeds of the truffles through their wastes. Scientists have found 40 different types of fungi in the waste from a Gilbert Potoroo.\n\nThe female potoroos can have two babies in a year, but only carry one at a time. They can keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing. If the first baby does not survive, the second baby can start growing right away. It is not known how long gestation is for Gilbert’s potoroo, but it is thought to be the same as the long-nosed potoroo; about 38 days. The baby potoroo is only about long when it is born. It lives in its mother's pouch for about 4 months.\n\nWhen Gilbert’s potoroo was rediscovered, more animals were captured to start a breeding program. This would help increase the numbers of potoroos. A few young were born in the first couple of years, but then breeding just stopped. Many studies have looked at what they eat, and how they live, but they are still can not get the potoroos to breed in captivity\n\nIn 2001, a group was formed called the Gilbert’s potoroo Action Group (GPAG). This group helps educate and tell people about the potoroo. It also helps with raising money for more study and captive breeding programs for Gilbert’s potoroo.\n\nThree potoroos, one male and two females, were moved to Bald Island in August 2005. This island is free from other animals, like cats and foxes, that would eat the potoroos. Since then, four more potoroos have been sent to start a breeding colony.\n\nThere is a lot of danger for the survival of Gilbert's potoroo. Because of the small area where they live, they could be lost in a bushfire. Foxes and cats could easily kill all the potoroos. There may not be enough potoroos to give them enough genetic differences to survive a virus. There is not enough natural bushland at Two Peoples Bay, and there is too much cleared land next to the nature reserve.\n\n", "id": "193508", "title": "Gilbert's potoroo"}

It is of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term \"yellow dwarf\" is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. See spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type. \n\nGV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a GV star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion.\n\nOur Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other GV stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi.\n\nOur own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name \"dwarf\" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs).\n\nA GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran. Eventually the red giant will lose its outer layers of gas, which will become a planetary nebula, while the inside of the star (also known as the core) will cool and shrink into a small, very dense white dwarf.\n\n", "id": "193515", "title": "G-type main-sequence star"}

The ballet was choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and the music and words were written by Igor Stravinsky. The music is written for voices, four pianos, and percussion. \n\nThe ballet was first presented on 13 June 1923 at the Théâtre Gaîte-Lyrîqué in Paris. The ballet is sometimes called a \"dance cantata\", and the music is sometimes performed as a concert piece.\n\nIn 1915 ballet producer Sergei Diaghilev wanted to create a ballet called \"La Liturgie\". Its background would be the Greek Orthodox Church. Stravinsky was a strong Christian, and did not want to write this ballet. He turned instead to Russian folk songs for \"Les Noces\". He had started to think about this in 1913. Michel Fokine started the choreography but Vaslav Nijinsky took over. Leonide Massine stepped in for Nijinsky. When Massine left, Bronislava Nijinska designed the dancing.\n\nDesign for the ballet (sets and clothing) was done by Natalia Goncharova. Goncharova, an outstanding artist, made two complete designs before her third was accepted. The first two designs were rejected because they did not suit either the dancing or the musical score. The ballet, though based on a folk tale, was modernist in style: Stravinsky and Nijinska thought it was important for its design to be in sympathy with this.\n\nThe bride, Nastasia, is having her hair done. She complains that it hurts when pulled. The choir sing to her about how beautiful her life will be with her husband, Fétis. The nightingales will sing to them in the garden. The choir sings to the Virgin Mary. They sing about the husband-to-be and his fair hair. They ask for a blessing for the young couple. The actual marriage ceremony is not seen. In the last of the four scenes, we see the wedding feast. The people are happy and start to get drunk. The husband and wife are led to the bedroom.\n\nThe ballet is still in the repertoires of some major ballet companies, such as the Royal Ballet. It was performed in 1936 by Colonel de Basil's \"Ballets Russes\", one of the successor companies to that of Diaghilev. Its post-WWII revival in London (1966) was personally supervised by Nijinska. Because of this, the ballet is still danced to its original choreography. It was also performed at Stutgart (1974) and Paris (1976). Jerome Robbins choreographed it in the American Ballet Theatre version of 1965.\n", "id": "193583", "title": "Les noces"}

It is the capital city of the Nord-Est \"Département\".\n\nThe city is on the \"Baie de Fort-Liberté\" (\"Fort-Liberté Bay\") about 56 km east of Cap-Haïtien and to the west of the Dominican Republic. It is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has three \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Fort-Liberté, Ferrier (Kreyòl: \"Ferye\") and Perches (Kreyòl: \"Opèch\").\n\nBetween 1503 and 1505, Nicolás de Ovando, Spanish governor of the Hispaniola, founded the town of \"Puerto Real\" (English, \"Royal Port\") where is the present town of \"Caracol\", to the west of Fort-Liberté. But soon this town was abandoned and the people moved to the east, founding in 1578 a new town with the Taíno name of the region: Bayajá.\n\nIn 1606, those persons living in the old Spanish towns of Bayajá and Yaguana had, by orders of the Spanish king, to move to the eastern part of the island, to a new town called Bayaguana, combining the two old names.\n\nLater, when French people founded a new town in this place, they called it Fort-Dauphin in 1731, named after the \"Dauphin\" (the \"Dolphin\", son of the French king Louis XV). When the French Republic was founded, the name was changed to \"Fort-Liberté\" in 1792. After Henri Christophe became King Henri I of Haiti in 1811, he renamed the city Fort-Royal. In 1820, after the death of Christophe, the name was changed back to Fort Liberté.\n\nThere are several forts built around the bay.

He collected animal specimens for English naturalist John Gould. Australia's rarest animal, Gilbert's Potoroo, \"Potorous gilberti\", and the Gilbert-Einasleigh River were named after him.\n\nGilbert was born on 14 March, but the exact year is not known. It must have been between 1810 and 1815 and so most books use 1812. Gilbert was a taxidermist for the Zoological Society of London. He met English naturalist John Gould and went to Australia in 1838 with Gould. Gould paid him £100 a year to collect and preserve animals and birds for him\n\nGould and Gilbert arrived in Hobart on the ship \"Parsee\" on 19 September 1838. They were going to collect animal and bird specimens for Gould's books. Both worked in Tasmania for a few months. On 4 February 1839, Gilbert went to the Swan River settlement. He worked there for a year, mainly around Perth, collecting for Gould. Gilbert then sailed for Sydney, and in June 1840 took a ship to Port Essington in the north of Australia. In March 1841 he sailed to Singapore, stopping at Timor on the way. From there he sailed for London and arrived at the end of September. He had collected a very large number of birds for Gould, and made many notes on their habits. \n\nIn February 1842 Gilbert returned Australia to collect further specimens. He reached Perth in July and stayed for 17 months in Western Australia. He made his most interesting discoveries among the Wongan Hills, about 100 miles north-east of Perth. He was a fine naturalist and his notes on birds, their habits, diet, song and the names given them by the aborigines were all of great interest and value. Gilbert collected specimens of 432 birds, including 36 species new to Western Australia. He collected 318 mammals, including 22 species not previously known in the west. By the end of January 1844 he was back in Sydney and during the next six months worked his way to the Darling Downs in Queensland.\n\nGilbert joined Ludwig Leichhardt's expedition in September 1844 which was going to cross Australia's north, from Brisbane to Port Essington. Gilbert, with his experience in the Australian bush, was unofficially the second in charge. The journey was much slower than planned and food supplies were getting low. On 28 June 1845, near the Gulf of Carpentaria, Gilbert was killed when aborigines attacked the explorers. He was buried at the site, but the grave has never been found. The rest of the group reached Port Essington in December 1845.\n\nLeichhardt kept Gilbert's papers and his diary, which, however, was lost for nearly 100 years before its discovery by A. H. Chisholm. Chisholm's research showed Gilbert as a man of much ability and fine character who somewhat ironically had a great respect for the aboriginals. There is a memorial to him in St James church, Sydney with the Latin phrase \"Dulce et decorum est pro scientia mori\" - \"it is sweet and fitting to die for science.\"\n\n\n", "id": "193641", "title": "John Gilbert (naturalist)"}

Voters' votes cannot be transferred to their second choice if their second choice is eliminated before their first choice is. Voters often use their first choice vote for a compromise vote, the same as with plurality.\n\nWhile theoretically simple, instant runoff voting often requires computers because the rankings on each ballot matter for determining the elimination order and can not be counted in aggregate. Opponents of Instant runoff voting often oppose computer counting of ballots, since it is difficult for ordinary citizens to count the ballots by hand and catch any fraud. The fact that a candidate has fewer votes does not mean the candidate is less popular but that the candidate was squeezed out on both sides of the political spectrum. Instant runoff voting can eliminate centrists in the last elimination.\n", "id": "193941", "title": "Instant Runoff Voting"}

It was designed during the 1960s. The Harrier is well known as it can take off vertically. It can do this by changing the direction of thrust from its engines. It is sometimes called V/STOL which means \"Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing\". It can carry heavier loads with a short takeoff than with a vertical one.\n\nIn 1967, the Bristol Engine Company proposed the radical idea of a directed thrust engine. Next, Hawker Aircraft designed an aeroplane that could meet the NATO specification for a \"light tactical support fighter\". There was no financial support for the development from HM Treasury, but support was found from NATO.\n\nA prototype flew in 1960. Various changes were made and several preliminary versions flew including the \"Kestrel\" and the first Harriers flew for the RAF and Royal Navy in 1969. The planes were built in both Britain and the United States. They were redeveloped and manufactured by British Aerospace and Macdonald Douglas, companies which are now owned by BAE Systems and Boeing, respectively. At present the Boeing/BAE Systems AV-8B Harrier II is used by NATO countries such as the United States, Spain and Italy. A modified version, the BAE Systems/Boeing Harrier II is used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.\n\nBetween 1969 and 2003, 824 Harrier variants were delivered. Manufacture of new Harriers ended in 1997. The last remanufactured aircraft (Harrier II Plus configuration) was delivered in December 2003. This ended the Harrier production line.\n\nThe Harrier is used by many military forces. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Air Force (RAF) use versions which are specially designed for taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. Other countries which use the Harrier include Thailand and India.\n\nIn 2006, the RAF introduced a new version of the Harrier, the GR/9. This is an updated version of the previous version, the GR/7. It has a top speed of 574 knots.\n\nThe Harrier was used a lot during the Falklands War. Harriers flew a total of 1,561 sorties, shot down 20 enemy planes (+ 3 probables) with 10 Harriers lost. Of the ten lost, six were shot down; the others were damaged in accidents on the carrier. The Sea Harriers made the Argentine Air Force much less effective than they hoped to be.\n\nThe Harrier can carry different equipment for each mission. It can carry missiles and bombs. It can also carry cameras to take pictures of the ground.\n", "id": "193952", "title": "Harrier Jump Jet"}

He also wrote books and articles, edited texts, translated books from German to English, and published poetry books.\n\nBarthold Fles was born in Amsterdam on February 7, 1902. His family was Jewish but did not keep Jewish laws. His father, Louis Fles, thought that it was wrong for Jews and other people to be religious. Louis Fles imported typewriters and sold them, in addition to other office products, in several stores that he owned and to other stores. Barthold was his oldest son so his father wanted him to help him at work. Barthold did not want to work for his father. He only wanted to read. Barthold read in Dutch, German, English, and French. He read a lot and very fast. Barthold found a job at De Lange publishers. In 1923 he left for the United States. \n\nIn New York Fles first worked as a violinist, painting apartments, selling vacuum cleaners and for publishers. In 1933 he started his own business, a \"literary agency\", in Manhattan, New York. As a \"literary agent\" he mostly helped writers find publishers. He also sold stories for films or magazines and would find a writer to make a book that a publisher wanted. When Barthold started working as a literary agent, many of his clients were people who left Germany for the United States because of the Nazism in Germany. He held meetings for these writers in New York so that they could learn about publishing books and stories in the United States. Later, however, most of the writers he worked with were born in the United States. \n\nIn 1936 Barthold married Ruth Grünwald, a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera who had been just one year in the United States. Ruth helped Barthold with his work. Later she left him. Although he had no children of his own, Barthold Fles wrote two books for kids: \"Slavonic rhapsody: the life of Antonín Dvořák\" (in 1948) and \"East Germany\" (in 1973). He also wrote many articles and introductions to story collections. He translated three books from German to English. One of these books, Bambi's Children by Felix Salten, was also a book for children. \n\nIn 1986, when he was 84 years old, Fles stopped working. He went back to the Netherlands, and lived three years in a home for retired artists. He died on December 19, 1989 at the age of 87.\n\n\n\n\nThese German poetry books were published by Barthold Fles Verlag, New York\n", "id": "193991", "title": "Barthold Fles"}

It is generally thought to be the most important British opera of the 20th century. It is about a community in a small fishing village in the east of England in the 1820s. Peter Grimes is a fisherman who feels that the people do not want to have anything to do with him. He wants to make lots of money so that he can marry and get people’s respect. In his obsession with catching as much fish as possible he is cruel to the boys who help him (his apprentices), and they die. At the end of the opera Grimes drowns himself.\n\nBritten wrote the main part (Peter Grimes) for his life partner Peter Pears to sing.\n\nThere are three acts, and the opera starts with a prologue and ends with an epilogue. Some of the scenes are joined by continuous music, and some of this is often played separately in concerts. This music is known as the Four Sea Interludes.\n\nWhen World War II started Britten and Pears went to America to avoid the war. In 1941 Britten started to feel homesick because he read an article by E.M.Forster about George Crabbe, a poet who had lived in the same part of England that Britten came from. Britten started to realize that, in order to compose well, he had to go back to his own country. Britten and Pears returned to England in 1942.\n\nThe conductor Sergei Koussevitzky asked Britten to write an opera based on a poem by George Crabbe. The poem, called “The Borough”, was about the story of Peter Grimes. The village in the poem was fictitious, but it was very much like Aldeburgh where Britten later made his home. Britten asked Montagu Slater to write the libretto based on the story of Crabbe’s poem.\n\nThe opera was first performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London on 7 June 1945 by the company which later became English National Opera. The conductor was Reginald Goodall. Pears sang the title role.\n\nThe first American performance was in 1946 at Tanglewood conducted by Koussevitzky's pupil, Leonard Bernstein. Britten dedicated it to Koussevitsky’s wife.\n\nThe first young boy who was an apprentice to Peter Grimes has already been killed. He was at sea for three days without water to drink. An inquest is being held to decide whether Grimes is guilty of the boy’s death. The people all seem to think he is guilty. The judge decides that the boy’s death was an accident. However, he says to Grimes that he should not get another apprentice. Grimes is very angry at being told this. Ellen Orford, a school teacher, comforts him. In their beautiful duet Ellen and Peter sing at first in different keys, but finally sing together in the same key.\n\nThe scenery shows the Moot Hall, the Boar Inn (the village pub) and the church. People are saying “Good morning” to one another, especially the Rector who says it many times. The fishermen start work mending their nets. Keene tells Grimes that he has found another apprentice for him. He is a poor boy who lives in the workhouse. Nobody wants Grimes to have another apprentice. Hobson, the cart man, refuses to fetch him. But Ellen supports Peter. She sings to the crowd: “Let her among you without fault cast the first stone” (meaning: “You all have faults so do not criticize”). Hobson goes off to get the boy. A terrible storm is coming.\n\nThe scene now changes to The Boar Inn. It is very noisy inside. Bob Boles gets drunk and wants to make love to the landlady’s nieces. The storm is still raging outside. Grimes comes in. People are shocked, but Grimes does not notice. He sings and song about human fate: “Now the Great Bear and Pleiades”. The tune is in the orchestra in canon while Grimes sings very simple lines of music. People are embarrassed, so they start to sing a round: “Old Joe has gone fishing”. It has three tunes and has seven counts in a bar. The boy is brought in and Grimes takes him off in spite of the storm.\nThe opening of the next act is peaceful. It is Sunday morning. People are in church, and now again we hear the singing coming from the church. Ellen talks to the boy. She is horrified to see he has a bruise on his neck. Grimes says it was an accident. He gets annoyed that Ellen is worried about the boy and runs off with him. The people of the village have noticed and march up to Grimes’s hut. The scene ends with a peaceful contrast: a duet sung by the two nieces.\n\nThe orchestra play a beautiful passacaglia which links to the next scene. Grimes is accusing the boy of “telling stories”. Then he starts to feels guilty about the first boy’s death. He hears the villagers coming and tells the boy they have to go fishing. He pushes him out onto the rocks and the boy falls to his death. When the villagers arrive at the hut they find it empty.\n\nAct 3 opens with music describing moonlight at night. People are dancing in the Moot Hall. People are very merry. Mrs. Sedley tries to tell people that Grimes is a murderer, but they do not listen. People then start to leave, saying “Goodnight” to one another (especially the Rector). Balstrode is walking with Ellen. He tells her that Grimes’s boat is in, but Grimes cannot be found. A boy’s jersey has been washed up on the shore. Ellen sings an aria “Embroidery in childhood was a luxury of idleness”. It is a moment of stillness in the drama.\n\nA short interlude based on one chord leads to the next scene in which people are looking for Grimes. Grimes drags himself onto the shore. He seems to have gone mad. We hear a foghorn (played by an off-stage tuba) as he sings. Balstrode tells Grimes that he should go out to sea in his boat and sink it.\n\nThe opera ends with an epilogue in which the scene is the same as the beginning of the opera. Someone says that a boat has been seen sinking out to sea, but no one is interested. The people have forgotten Grimes, and continue their lives without him.\n\n\n", "id": "194055", "title": "Peter Grimes"}

They were done by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Milgram wanted to find out if people would follow orders, even if the orders went against their conscience. He proved they would. There have been many repetitions and variations, with similar results. \n\nThe experiments do not answer the question as to why apparently normal people commit atrocities in wartime. However, \"obedience to authority\" is built into the experiment, since the subjects were paid, and acting under the instructions of a senior university professor. Many were students.\n\nParticipants (acting as \"teachers\") gave what they thought were electric shocks to \"learners\". The \"learners\" were actually actors, and the shocks were spoof (not real). The learners reacted as if they were in real pain. As the \"shocks\" increased, they acted as if in very bad pain.\n\nIf at any time the subject (\"teacher\") wanted to stop the experiment, he was given a succession of verbal prods by the experimenter, in this order:\nIf the subject still wished to stop after all four successive verbal prods, the experiment was halted. Otherwise, it was halted after the subject had given the maximum \"450-volt\" shock three times in succession.\n\nMilgram found that some of the \"teachers\" became very nervous. For example, they would laugh and be unable to control it.\n\nBefore Milgram did his experiment, he asked fourteen Yale University psychology students what they thought the results would be. On average, the students thought that 1.2% of the \"teachers\" would give the biggest electric shock of 450 volts. In fact, in Milgram's first set of experiments, \"65 percent\" (26 of 40) of participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock.\n\nMilgram wrote about the experiment in his book \"Obedience to Authority: an experimental view\". It was published in 1974. Milgram's experiments have been done again by many psychologists, with very similar results.\n\nMilgram offered two theories:\n\nOther factors might partly explain the Milgram experiments:\n\nThe experiment has been mentioned numerous times in pop culture.

Many articles and comments were made in electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his activities as an editor, Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.\n\nWikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay's use of an identity, saying, \"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don’t really have a problem with it.\" Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned \"that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes\" on Wikipedia.\n\nStacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for \"The New Yorker\", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia. (\"Know It All\"; July 31, 2006) He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. \"The New Yorker\", said Essjay \"was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Jordan told \"The New Yorker\" and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law. He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications. \"The New Yorker\" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.\n\nThe article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day. The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends. Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.\n\nEssjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona's credentials, telling for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, \"I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials.\"\n\nWhen Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he made changes to his Wikia profile and \"came clean on who he really was,\" showing himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question, saying that:\n\nHe later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by \"doing a good job playing the part.\"\n\nSocial activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told \"The New Yorker\" about the difference in profiles. In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change (correction) saying that \"Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught.\"\n\nOn March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a part of Essjay's comments on the incident entered \"the dangerous domain of defamation and libel\" against Stacy Schiff. Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page: \"Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead.\" Lih noted:\n\nLih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it Schiff said that Essjay's statement was \"complete nonsense.\"\n\nTalking about Jordan, Wales said, “Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation.”\nEssjay had said in reply at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part saying:\n\nReaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity difference was pointed. There were many comments. While most editors opposed at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.\n\nAs the controversy went further, the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay's previous changes. Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes. \"People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments,\" said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, \"The Wikipedia Signpost\". \"Those will get looked at again.\" For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as \"Catholicism for Dummies,\" a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: \"This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it’s credibility.\"\nWales was \"...reported to be considering all persons who on factual disputes.\" \"I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address,\" Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. \"We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle\", Wales commented. However, he also warned that “It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate.” Wales argued \"contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them.\" However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential suggestion, saying, \"I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor.\" A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them, before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such suggestions.\n\nAs a follow-up to his first comments to \"The New Yorker\", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which showed in its March 19, 2007 issue:\n\nWales stated his regret that Essjay had \"made a series of very bad judgments.\" He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy.\n\nAndrew Orlowski, a Wikipedia critic and writer for \"The Register\"—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded 'Wikia' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee. Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia.\n\nOthers to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe asked \"why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information\" and asked for additional details \"such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements.\"\n\nLarry Sanger, editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium, and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002, called Essjay's response \"a defiant non-apology\" and elsewhere stated Essjay's actions as \"identity fraud.\"\nShowing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages, Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management, including Angela Beesley (co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation's Communications Committee) and Brad Patrick (legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation) had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference. Sanger also made note that Jordan's dismissal was the result of public response. That \"Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware, only after there was a response, did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay’s to quit.\"\n\nOther comments:\n\nFollowing the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy, a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" commented \"the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud.\" Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review, saying, \"They could make up your life if they wanted to.\" Brann also said that Wikipedia \"has no place in the University,\" and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia. Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information, though they would not cite it in scholarly work.\n", "id": "194143", "title": "Essjay controversy"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194154", "text": "Gameplay of Pokémon\n\nThe gameplay of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games involves the capture and training of a variety of fictional creatures called \"Pokémon\" and using them to battle other trainers. Every generation of games follows this concept by introducing new Pokémon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere before being introduced in the games; double battles appeared in the anime long before appearing in the games, and Pokémon abilities are similar to the Pokémon Powers introduced in the \"Pokémon Trading Card Game\".\n\nBattling is a large part of the games. Pokémon can be found in the wild, in dark grass, caves, forests, ponds, the ocean, and even underwater. Also, whenever the player walks where another trainer can see the player, the two must battle. Hundreds of trainers are in each of the main series \"Pokémon\" games.\n\nPokémon have six statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) which all affect how they perform in battles. Statistics can be raised by using items and by training the Pokémon.\n\nBefore \"Pokémon Gold and Silver\" were released, the \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense\" stats were combined into one statistic, \"Special.\" This later became too complicated so it was divided into \"Special Attack\" and \"Special Defense.\"\n\nStarting in \"Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire\", Pokémon have abilities which affect them in various ways. These can be abilities that work while in battle or when the player is just walking around. An example is the ability \"Overgrow\" which increases the power of Grass-type moves when a Pokémon's health is below 1/3 of its full amount.\nEach Pokémon has either one or two types. Which types it has affect how it performs when it battles other Pokémon of other types. For example, a Fire-type Pokémon is weak against Water-type, but is strong against a Grass-type. It could be compared to a more complex game of rock, paper, scissors.\n\nThis is a list of the types:\n\nTwo more were added when \"Pokémon Gold and Silver\" were released:\n\nAnother type, \"Fairy\", was added in \"Pokémon X and Y\".\n\nPokémon Gyms are buildings where the player faces a Gym Leader, who focuses one of the 18 types of Pokémon. There are also trainers in the Gym that the player can battle, and they also use mostly that type. Beating the Gym Leader earns you a Badge which increases your skills.\n\nPokémon evolve to turn into different Pokémon from the same evolutionary line. Doing so, they become stronger and can learn more powerful moves, but learn moves at higher levels.\n\nThis is the most common way that Pokémon evolve. Pokémon in this category evolve when they reach a certain level. \nSome Pokémon can only evolve by level in a certain place.\nSome Pokémon evolve by level if it is holding a certain item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve by level if they are leveled in a route that is having a certain weather. This weather can only work to evolve the Pokemon if the weather is not caused by a move or Ability.\n\nThis is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones.\n\nThis is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon only evolve if they are traded to a friend. \nSome Pokémon only evolve if traded to a friend while holding an item.\nSome Pokemon only evolve if they're traded with another, specific Pokemon.\n\nAnother way Pokémon evolve is through happiness. Whenever the player character in the game walks 100 steps, gives their Pokémon a vitamin such as Protein, Iron, Carbos, Calcium, or Zinc, training it until it gains a level, or when the character does something else to make it happy, it will gain happiness points. The item Soothe Bell multiplies this amount. Once a Pokémon has reached a certain happiness level, it will evolve after it is leveled once, sometimes depending on the time of day:\n\nExample: Eevee evolves into either Espeon or Umbreon if its happiness rating is maxed out; into Espeon if this happens during the day, or Umbreon if it happens during the night. However, such day-and-night distinction exists only in the second-generation games and the generations that follow (but not in \"Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen\").\n\nPokémon can evolve after learning certain moves and leveling up.\n\n\nSome Pokémon can evolve only if they are a certain gender.\n\n\nSome Pokémon can evolve into a Mega form during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. However, the evolution only lasts for the battle.\n\nA large number of different items exist. They are used to help the player or their Pokémon.\n\nA Poké Ball is a red-and-white sphere that is used to catch Pokémon. Many different forms of it exist, such as the Great Ball, the Ultra Ball, the Heavy Ball, the Net Ball, the Dive Ball, the Friend Ball, and the Master Ball (which can catch any Pokémon without fail). Each of these have different colors and can be used to catch different Pokémon more effectively.\n\nThe Pokédex is a tool used by Pokémon trainers all around the Pokémon world in different regions. These regions include the Unova region, the Sinnoh region, the Hoenn region, the Johto region and the Kanto region. The Pokédex makes records of information about each of the different Pokémon. There are 801 different species of Pokémon recorded in the world today. Different Pokémon are caught in different regions and some Pokémon can only be caught in certain regions, such as Xerneas in the Kalos Region.\n\nLegendary Pokémon are Pokémon that are very rare, and there is usually only one in each game. Examples of legendaries are Articuno, Mewtwo, Mew, Lugia, Groudon, and Dialga. They are hard to catch, and are stronger than most Pokémon. Some roam around, while others can be found in one spot until you KO or capture them. If you KO a legendary, it will usually leave and will never be found again unless the game is restarted or the Elite Four is defeated again. Because of this, players usually save before engaging the Pokémon.\n\nShiny Pokémon are a different color than that Pokémon normal for their species. An example would be a yellow Bulbasaur (they are usually greenish-blue). They are extremely rare; there is only a 1 in 4,096 chance of an encountered Pokémon being shiny, but there are ways to improve your chances of obtaining one, which vary per game.\n", "id": "194154", "title": "Gameplay of Pokémon"}

It was made by LucasArts. It came out in 1995 for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh, and a version was later made for Sony Playstation.\n\nThe player controls Kyle Katarn, who was once a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire but left the Empire to become a mercenary. In \"Dark Forces\", Katarn works for the Rebellion which fights against the Empire. The game's story is about Kyle finding and stopping an Imperial weapons program called the Dark Trooper Project.\n\nEverything in the game is set in the Star Wars universe. Many things in the game are taken from the original Star Wars trilogy movies, such as several weapons and most of the game's enemies, but some things were made just for \"Dark Forces\". \n\nMany of the planets that the levels take place on were created for Dark Forces, but a few of them are from \"Star Wars\" books. \n\n\"Dark Forces\" is a first person shooter, so the player controls Katarn and sees from Katarn's eyes. Much of the gameplay is about fighting and shooting enemies, but there are also many puzzles to solve to move through the missions. \n\nThe player can run, strafe, jump, crouch, and move through shallow water. The player can also look up and down. The game can be controlled with keys on the keyboard, and also a mouse can be used to run, turn, and shoot. \n\nThe game is made up of separate missions. Each mission has certain goals that the player must finish. The missions are all part of the story. Katarn's pilot drops him off and picks him up, but he goes through the missions alone without any help.\n\nThere are many different weapons in the game that the player can use and that enemies also use. Most of the weapons shoot blaster bolts or other projectiles, but the player can also throw \"thermal detonators\" like grenades. Some of the weapons have a \"secondary\" fire mode which shoots in a different way.\n\nThe story is told in two ways. One way is cutscenes, which are animated videos that play between some missions. Also, before each mission the player is given a briefing which talks about what is happening in the story and what the mission goals are.\n\nIn the first mission, Katarn steals the Death Star plans so the Rebels can destroy the Death Star. The rest of the game is a different story. \n\nThe Rebels find out about a secret Imperial program called the Dark Trooper Project. The Dark Trooper project is a plot to create new robotic Stormtroopers that are very powerful and dangerous.\n\nKyle searches for clues about the Dark Trooper Project and sets off to stop it.\n", "id": "194191", "title": "Star Wars: Dark Forces"}

The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Huracán home stadium is the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.\n\nHuracán was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (\"Globo\", literally \"Balloon\") come from the \"Huracán\" balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called \"los Quemeros\" (\"the Burners\") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.\n\nDuring the professional era, Huracán won the Primera División title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Huracán has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).\n\nHuracán's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.\n\nThough officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891–1930), Huracán won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.\n\nDuring the professional era (started in 1931), Huracán had their moment of glory in the \"Metropolitano\" championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989–90 and 1999–00). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006–07 season, when Huracán defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.\n\nHuracán was runner-up of the Primera División in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by Ángel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Matías Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above Vélez Zársfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).\n\nThe Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Huracán played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando \"la tota\" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said \"no veo la hora de volver al Ducó, qué sufrimiento muyayo!\" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).\n\nOn 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Huracán returned to the Ducó, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against Vélez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.\n\nAmateur Era\n\nOther Amateur Titles\n\nProfessional Era\n\nOther professional titles\n\nSecond Division\n\n\n\nThe Club Atlético Huracán plays in the main Roller Hockey league of Argentina, the Liga Nacional Argentina-Serie A1.\n\nHila\n\n", "id": "194224", "title": "C.A.

The person whose penis is inserted is normally referred as the receiving partner, and the person who performs deep-throating is referred to as the giving partner.\n\nIt is difficult for most people to perform deep-throating, because of the natural gag reflex that happens when the soft palate is touched. Different people have different sensitivities to the reflex, but some people learn to suppress the reflex. \n\nUsually, the giving partner's tongue is immobilized during deep-throating and they also are not able to suck.\n\nThe position of both partners is important in performing deep throat. For deep-throating, the giving partner's mouth and throat will need to be aligned (made into) into a straight line, and he or she will need to respirate through the nose. It is important for the giving partner to be in a position to control any pelvic thrust during deep-throating, to be able to pull the penis out if needed; and for the receiving partner not to thrust, as during irrumatio.\n\n\"Over-the-edge\" is a common position for deep-throating. In this position, the giving partner lays on his/her back with the head hanging off the edge of the bed and the receiving partner stands or places himself on his knees in front of the giving partner, with his penis at the giving partner's mouth.\n\nAnother position used for deep-throating involves the giving partner sitting on the receiving partner's chest, with his feet or penis in front of the giving partner. \n\nThe 69 position is another position for deep-throating.\n", "id": "194329", "title": "Deep-throating"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194396", "text": "Lucario\n\nLucario is a character of the Pokémon anime and video game series. Known as the Aura Pokémon, it has the ability to feel the Auras of all things. It is a Fighting and Steel Pokémon. It is seen in the games \"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl\", and in the movie \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\". In an interview with \"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl\" director Junichi Masuda, he noted Lucario's name as one of the hardest to make, because they wanted to make it work for both the Japanese and Americans.\n\nLucario is a jackal-like Pokémon that's around four feet in height. Lucario's hands are black and have one white spike on each arm on the top of its wrists, and there's a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's nose and ears are longer since it evolved from Riolu. Lucario has a furry yellow body, and its hips are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and can use telepathic human speech. By catching the Aura coming from others, it can read their thoughts. A well-trained one can sense auras of creatures over half a mile away.\n\nLucario is a Pokémon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of \"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl\"; Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion. In \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon\" Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and earning 15,000 Rescue Points will put the player in the top rank - the Lucario rank - and the Lucario statue will be put outside the rescue base.\n\nIt is a fighter in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, and uses attacks like Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and its final smash, Aura Storm. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" due to a leak. After seeing their mistake they quickly fixed it. Lucario and Jigglypuff can no longer be seen but there are many YouTube videos which show proof of the leak, as well as screen shots. \n\nIn Pokémon X and Y, the player receives a free Lucario from Korrina. It can Mega Evolve into Mega Lucario using the Lucarionite.\n\nLucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pokémon movie, \"Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\". In the movie, Lucario is a servant to Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to use aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's start, Lucario begins questioning any Pokémon-human relationship. The Lucario in the movie, can also speak human languages without psychic powers. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.\n\nMaylene in the anime, like in the games, has a Lucario and it was seen in four episodes. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pokémon in a flashback. Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup. Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, which ended in a tie. Finaly, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.\n\nIn the Pokémon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier. Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pokémon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity. In \"Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!\" the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved in to Lucario.\n\nUGO described Lucario as \"a new breed of Pokémon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks\", yet called it lame due to its status as a Pokémon. IGN called its presence in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" \"a bit on the head scratching side\" in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu. Although another editor stated that it would make sense for \"Pokémon\" to be represented by a fighting-type Pokémon, since \"Super Smash Bros Brawl\" is a fighting game. GamesRadar described it as an \"all-around bad-ass\" and \"the Bruce Lee of Pokémon\", suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis. Beckett \"Pokémon\" Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in \"Lucario and the Mystery of Mew\" and his appearance in \"Super Smash Bros.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194420", "text": "Hertzsprung–Russell diagram\n\nThe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is a graph of many stars. It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (that is, how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). These diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs.\n\nYou can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell.\n\nThe vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart.\n\nThe horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go \"down\", not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K.\n\nIn general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the Spectral Classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). (Of course, when we say \"coolest\" about stars, we must realize that the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\nAs a matter of fact, when Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams were developed in the early 1900's, astronomers did not know how to find out the temperature of a star. The first diagrams plotted stars' absolute magnitude (where \"adding\" one meant the brightness would go \"down\" by about two and a half times) against color, represented by the spectral classes from blue-white to red. \n\nAs you can see, stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram when graphed in this way. All stars in a given area of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram share similar luminosities and temperatures. The main region where stars appear is the diagonal curved line, going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). This is called the Main Sequence. Above the main sequence is another region containing the red giants. Below is a curved line representing the white dwarfs.\n\nThese collections of stars by brightness and temperature are important when talking about stellar evolution. In general, stars are created in the main sequence. (Of course, when we say \"\"in\" the main sequence\" we really mean \"having a brightness and a temperature that causes them to be plotted within the main sequence on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\") After billions of years, they expand into red giants. Then, after another one or two billion years, they shrink into white dwarfs.\n\nIt was only in the 1930's and 1940's that scientists began to understand the role of nuclear fusion in creating and keeping stars like our sun. These days Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are used to present stellar evolution in pictures to students. They're not used much any more for developing new scientific theories.\n\nOn a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, our Sun is plotted very close to the middle of the main sequence at the intersection of luminosity 1 and temperature 5780K. Therefore, the sun is class G or a \"yellow star\").\n", "id": "194420", "title": "Hertzsprung–Russell diagram"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194431", "text": "Seabird\n\nSeabirds are birds that have adapted so they are better able to live at sea or near it. Many seabirds live \"at sea\", that is, far away from land. They may only come on land to breed. Other seabirds live in colonies on islands. Very often, seabirds use the sea for food, most often fish or shellfish. The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families first appeared in the Palaeogene. The similarities between them are examples of convergent evolution. The same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations. \n\nSeabirds share a number of adaptations to sea life. They live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds. They do spend a great deal of time with their young. Most species nest in colonies. These vary from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species take long annual migrations every year, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds vary in how much of the year they spend at sea.\n", "id": "194431", "title": "Seabird"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194440", "text": "Tropical Depression One (2009)\n\nTropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the third tropical cyclone since 2007 to form before June 1. The storm formed on May 28, and moved across the Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, the storm started to weaken and fall apart. On May 29, the storm died and became a remnant low.\n\nBefore the storm became a depression, some parts of the storm brought light rainfall to the eastern tip of North Carolina. However there were no damages or deaths reported. Also the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not give out any tropical storm watches or warnings for the storm.\n\nDuring mid-May, a disorganized low pressure area formed in the Atlantic Ocean about 290 miles (465 kilometers) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. The low pressure moved north and started to become more organized. On May 27, the storm was 120 miles (195 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina when the National Hurricane Center (NHC) decided to start monitoring the storm. A high pressure area that was located southeast of the storm pushed it into a northeast direction. Then on 8 pm EDT (0000 UTC on May 28), the NHC stopped monitoring the storm, as the low was not expected to strengthen anymore.\n\nOn May 28, the NHC started to monitor the storm again and on 11:00 am EDT (1500 UTC), they declared the storm to be a tropical cyclone and named it Tropical Depression One. At that time, the storm's location was about 310 mi (500 km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. After it was named as a depression, the storm showed deep convection and the center of circulation was at the northwestern part of the storm. The reason why the depression restrengthened was because of lower wind shear and warmer ocean waters from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, the depression started to weaken when it moved into an area with higher wind shear and colder ocean waters. Around 7:30 pm EDT (2330 UTC), a QuikSCAT satellite flew over the depression and found tropical storm-force winds. But the NHC thought the depression didn't strengthen and that winds were affected by rain. After the satellite passed over the depression, the center of circulation moved closer to the northwest edge of the storm and convection started to decrease.\nOn May 29, the depression almost became a tropical storm, when the storm's strength was measured at T2.5, or 40 mph (65 km/h) using the Dvorak technique. But some of the measurements were also low as T1.5, which was the reason why the NHC didn't call it a tropical storm. After a quick burst of convection during the night, thunderstorm clouds inside the depression started to disappear by 3:00 am EDT (0700 UTC). By then, the tropical depression was no longer expected to strength anymore and was forecasted to weaken. A few hours later, the center of circulation was ripped apart by strong wind shear while a nearby trough also started to absorb the rest of the storm. With no convection around the center of the storm, it became a remnant low during the afternoon. At 5:00 pm EDT (2100 UTC), the NHC gave out its last advisory on Tropical Depression One. The remains of the storm were later taken in by a warm front around 2 am EDT (0600 UTC).\n\nOn May 27 the cyclone brought some light rainfall to parts of coastal North Carolina before it was called Tropical Depression One. Hatteras, North Carolina saw 0.1 in (2.5 mm) of rainfall and wind speeds up to 15 mph (24 km/h) with gusts to 23 mph (37 km/h). The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded from the storm was 1009 mbar (hPa; 29.81 inHg).\n\nWhen the storm became Tropical Depression One on May 28, it was the third time since 1851 that an Atlantic tropical cyclone formed before June 1, the official start of an Atlantic hurricane season. The depression followed Subtropical Storm Andrea of May 2007 and Tropical Storm Arthur of May 2008. The first time this event happened was in 1932, 1933, and 1934; the second time it happened was in 1951, 1952, and 1953. The National Hurricane Center also reported that Tropical Depression One was also the farthest north a May tropical cyclone has ever formed.\n\n\n", "id": "194440", "title": "Tropical Depression One (2009)"}

Two criminals might be friends and they might trust one another, but what they trust one another to do is bad (although it might seem good to them).\n\nBeing trusting without thinking carefully about it might be dangerous. People can sometimes win someone’s trust, but then they might break their trust.\n\nThe opposite of “trusting” is “mistrust” (“to have no trust in”).

He was the eldest son of Sultan \nHamengkubowono III. Diponegoro was born at Yogyakarta in 1785 and died at Makassar in 1855. During the Dutch rule, a ruler like his father had lost many rights such as the ability to lease land. Instead, he was paid by the Dutch to keep peace. This was an indignity to his father. This led to an open battle headed by Diponegoro himself using guerrilla tactics, which was called the Java War. It lasted for five years, from 1825 until 1830. During that period Diponegoro had successfully led battles, ambushing Dutch camps and raiding food supplies. Over the period of five years, more than 200,000 people were dead because of the war. In 1830, he was sent away by the Dutch to Manado, then moved to Ujungpandang, and he spent the rest of his life there. After being held by the Dutch in Fort Rotterdam in Ujungpandang for 25 years, he died there in 1855.\n\n", "id": "194682", "title": "Diponegoro"}

Debussy was a young man at the time, and not yet famous. \n\nThe only concerts she went to were those given by the Russian Musical Society in Moscow. She sat alone where nobody would notice her. She met Nikolai Rubinstein. She thought he had great talent, but she disagreed with him a lot of the time. \n\nIn 1877 she came into contact with Tchaikovsky, although she never met him. She asked him to compose some pieces for violin and piano to play at her home. Tchaikovsky knew she was a rich lady who paid well, so he quickly composed some music. They wrote letters to one another, exchanged photographs of one another, but they came to an agreement that they would never meet. She paid him 6,000 rubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.\n\nIn 1876 Tchaikovsky had decided to marry. He was then a composer aged 36. He was gay, and this was something terrible in Russia at that time. He was very frightened that people would find out and that he would be bullied. So he decided to marry. He did not care who it was he married, so long as it would make him look respectable. The next year he found a young girl called Antonina to marry. He told Nadezhda. She wrote to congratulate him and told him she hoped he would be happy. A week later, Tchaikovsky wrote to Nadezhda to ask for more money because the marriage had put him into debt. A few weeks later he was writing again to her saying that he hated his wife. He soon separated from her. Writing to Nadezhda was a great support to him at this time. It is impossible to know whether Nadezhda knew he was gay or whether that would have made a difference to her feelings. At any rate, she continued to write that she loved him. She increased the amount she was paying him to 6,000 roubles a year. This was a lot of money: about twenty times the salary of an ordinary government worker. He was able to stop teaching at the Moscow Conservatory and spend his time composing. Between 1877 and 1890 they wrote about 1,200 letters to one another. Her encouragement was very important to him, and helped him to keep happy when he felt depressed.\n\nHer relationship with Tchaikovsky was also a good thing for her. She hated anything to do with sex, so it was good that she could express her emotions to someone whom she did not have to face in person. Tchaikovsky dedicated his Fourth Symphony to her.\n\nOn one occasion they met one another by accident. Nadezhda had invited Tchaikovsky to stay at her home. This was a huge house in enormous grounds, so it was easy to arrange that they should not meet. They agreed that they would not go out at the same time. However, one day he came home late and she went out early. She was in a horse carriage and he was walking. When they saw one another they looked away quickly.\n\nIn October 1890, von Meck sent Tchaikovsky a year's money in advance, saying that it was the last time she would be able to send him money. She said she was bankrupt. She may have worried that she probably would be bankrupt in a year’s time.\n\nSome people think that she did this because she found out about Tchaikovsky’s homosexuality. Others disagree with this. After all, in her last letter to him she asked him never to forget her.\n\nNadezhda von Meck died from tuberculosis on 13 January 1894 in Nice, France, two months after Tchaikovsky had died.\n", "id": "195230", "title": "Nadezhda von Meck"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195252", "text": "Sovereign state\n\nA sovereign state is a state with borders where people live, and where a government makes laws and talks to other sovereign states. The people have to follow the laws that the government makes. Most sovereign states are \"recognized\" which means other sovereign states agree that it's really a sovereign state. Being recognized makes it easier for a sovereign state to talk to and make agreements (treaties) with other sovereign states. There are hundreds of recognized sovereign states today - see List of sovereign states.\n\nThere is no rule to say what exactly makes a state.Usually, the things a state must have are mainly political, not legal. The Czechs and the Poles were seen as separate states during World War I, even though they did not exist as states yet. L.C. Green explained this by saying that \"recognition of statehood is a matter of discretion, it is open to any existing state to accept as a state any entity it wishes, regardless of the existence of territory or an established government.\" \n\nThis means that it is up to any state that already exists to treat any other group as a state. This recognition can be direct or implied. When a state does this, it usually means that the group will also be treated as a state for things that happened in the past. It does not need to mean that the state wants to have a relationship with the other group.\n\nSovereignty is a word that is often used wrongly. Lassa Oppenheim said that there is no idea whose meaning is more than sovereignty. No one argues the fact that from the time the idea of sovereignty was first used in political science until now, there has never been one meaning that everyone agreed on. Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia says that \"sovereignty is neither a question of fact, nor a question of law, but a question that does not arise at all.\" \n\nAlthough the word sovereignty often includes all types of government, ancient and modern, the modern state has some links to the type of government first seen in the 15th century, when the term \"state\" also first meant what it does today. Because of this, the word is often used to refer only to modern political systems.\n\nWe often use the words \"country\", \"nation\", and \"state\" as if they mean the same thing; but there is actually a difference:\n\n\n\nBecause the meaning of the words has changed over time and past writers often used the word \"state\" in a different ways it is difficult to say exactly what a state is. Mikhail Bakunin used the word simply to mean a governing organization. Other writers used the word \"state\" to mean any law-making or law enforcement agency. Karl Marx said that the state was what was used by the ruling class of a country to control the rule. According to Max Weber, the state is an organization who are the only people allowed to use violence in a particular area.\n\nIn 1815 at the Congress of Vienna the Final Act only recognized 39 sovereign states in Europe. Because of this, they said that in future new states would have to be recognized by other states. In practice, this meant recognition by one or more of the most powerful countries.\n\nThis constitutive theory was developed in the 19th century to describe what is and is not a state. With this theory, the need to follow international law depends on whether other sovereign governments recognize the group. Because of this, new states could not become part of the international community or be bound by international law immediately, so recognized nations did not have to respect international law in their dealings with them. \n\nOne of the major criticisms of this law is the confusion that happens when some states recognize a new group, but other states do not. Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the main people who supported the theory, suggested that it is a state's job to grant recognition as a possible solution. However, a state may use any set of rules when judging if they should give recognition. Many states may only recognize another state if it will help them.\n\nOne of the criteria most commonly used by micronations is the Montevideo Convention. The Montevideo Convention was signed on December 26 1933 by the United States, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru and Cuba but it never received international consensus. The Montevideo Convention has four conditions that a group \"should\" meet to become a state:\n\n\nAccording to this, the existence of a state does not depend upon recognition by other states. Whether or not an group meets the conditions is decided by other states when they decide if they are going to treat that group as a state. Usually, new states are formally recognized by at least a few other states.\n\nMost sovereign states are states \"de jure\" and \"de facto\". This means they exist both in law and in real life. However, sometimes states are only \"de jure\" states. This means that other states see a group as the true government of a place where they have no actual control. Many European states had governments-in-exile during the Second World War which still had relations with the Allies, even though their countries were under Nazi occupation. An example today is the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which is a United Nations observer, has with 104 states. It has no land of its own, only embassies and consulates. Other states may have sovereignty over a place, but are not recognized by other states, these are \"de facto\" states only. Many people agree that Somaliland is such a state.\n", "id": "195252", "title": "Sovereign state"}

Yad Vashem says that the Nazis used rumors about making soap from bodies to frighten camp inmates. However, there is evidence that research facilities had come up with a way for large amounts of soap to be made from human bodies.\n\nDuring World War I, the British had already accused Germany of using the fat from human bodies to make things. In April 1917, an important newspaper in London, England called \"The Times\" wrote that the Germans were using the bodies of their own dead soldiers to make soap and other products. It was not until 1925 that the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, officially said that the \"corpse factory\" story had been an error.\n\nStories that the Nazis made soap from the bodies of concentration camp victims were common during the war. Germany did not have enough fats to make soap during World War II. Because of this, the government took control of making soap. \n\nThe \"human soap\" stories may have started because with the bars of soap made by the government were marked with the initials \"RIF.\" Some people thought this stood for \"Reichs-Juden-Fett\" in German. This means \"State Jewish Fat\" in English. (In German acronyms, \"I\" and \"J\" were often used like the same letter, so people thought \"RIF\" could mean \"RJF\".) \n\nIn fact, \"RIF\" actually stood for \"Reichsstelle für Industrielle Fettversorgung.\" This was the German government agency in charge of making and giving out soap and washing products during the war. (In English, the agency's name was the \"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning.\") RIF soap was not very good, and did not have any kind of fat.\n\nRaul Hilberg reports that stories about soap made from human fat were told in Lublin, Poland, as early as October 1942. The Germans themselves knew about the stories. Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, got letter saying the Poles thought Jewish people were being \"boiled into soap.\" The letter also said the Poles feared they would also be used to make soap. These stories were so widely known that some Polish people actually refused to buy soap. Himmler was so worried by the rumors, and the thought of poor security at the camps, that he said that all bodies should be burnt or buried as quickly as possible.\n\nSoviet propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg reported a common version of the story as fact in \"The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry\":\n\nDuring the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory worker at the Danzig Anatomical Institute, said that soap had been made from the bodies of dead people at Stutthof concentration camp. He said that 70 to 80 kg of fat collected from 40 bodies could make more than 25 kg of soap. He also said that the finished soap was kept by Professor Rudolf Spanner. \n\nMazur gave a recipe that read: \"\"5 kilos of human fat are mixed with 10 liters of water and 500 or 1,000 grams of caustic soda. All this is boiled 2 or 3 hours and then cooled. The soap floats to the surface while the water and other sediment remain at the bottom. A bit of salt and soda is added to this mixture. Then fresh water is added and the mixture again boiled 2 or 3 hours. After having cooled, the soap is poured into molds.\"\" \n\nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Nazi witnesses and British prisoners of war supported Mazur's story. (The British prisoners of war had been used as forced labor to build the Stutthof camp.) These witnesses talked about seeing:\nAfter doing research, Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt found little evidence of mass production of soap from human fat. However, he found evidence that soap had been made from human fat in experiments. Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector agrees that the Nazis \"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof,\" but in small amounts.\n\nIn his book \"Russia at War 1941 to 1945\", Alexander Werth said that while visiting Danzig in 1945 just after it was freed by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human bodies. Werth said that it had been run by \"a German professor called Spanner\" and \"was a\nnightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsoes pickled in some liquid,\nand its full of a flakey substance - human soap\".\n\nAfter the war, in 1955, Alain Resnais included the idea that the Nazis made large amounts of \"human soap\" in his Holocaust documentary movie \"Nuit et brouillard\". After the war, some Israelis also spoke about Jewish victims of Nazism with the Hebrew word \"סבון\" (\"sabon\", \"soap\").\n\nMainstream Holocaust scholars think the idea that Nazis made large amounts of \"human soap\" is part of WWII folklore. Examples of scholars who believe this include the well-known Jewish historians Walter Laqueur, Gitta Sereny, and Deborah Lipstadt. Other people who believe this include Professor Yehuda Bauer of Israel's Hebrew University, and Shmuel Krakowski, archives director of Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust center. Historian Yisrael Gutman agrees that \"it was never done on a mass scale.\" And Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector says that the Nazis \"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof,\" but in small amounts.\n\nToday Holocaust deniers use this story to make people doubt the Nazi genocide.\n\n\"The Soap Myth\" is a 2009 play about Nazis making soap from the bodies of the people they murdered.\n\n\n", "id": "195300", "title": "Soap made from human corpses"}

The movie follows a computer hacker named David Lightman (Broderick) who breaks into a NORAD war games simulation computer that he thinks is really the computer for a computer game company. Lightman begins a series of events that could start World War III. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards and was a big hit. It continues to be popular.\n\nThe movie begins with two air force officers in a nuclear missile silo who are ordered to fire the missiles in the silo. The officers believe the order to be real and begin to fire the missiles. One of the officers decides not to fire and so the US government replaces all the men in the missile silos with computer control. \nDavid Lightman (Broderick) is a smart high school student and computer hacker that at first limits himself to changing his and a girl whom he likes a lot, Jennifer's (Sheedy) grades from failing to passing grades: Lightman being smart but not motivated at school. A little while later David uses his IMSAI 8080 computer to dial many phone numbers and finds a backdoor into a NORAD war games simulation computer called WOPR (nicknamed the \"Whopper\"). At first David is looking for new computer games to download and play and believes that the WOPR is actually the computer of a company that makes new computer games. After finding a list of games on the computer decides to play a game. WOPR (who is an Artificial Intelligence computer) asks David for a password and after doing some research on the computer's creator Professor Steven Falken he guesses that the password is named after the creator's dead son, Joshua. After logging in using the correct password, W.O.P.R. believes David to actually be Dr. Falken whom the computer had believed to be dead. The computer (which David now calls \"Joshua\") asks him if he would like to play a game. David selects the game \"Global Thermonuclear War\". Doing so starts off a series of events that will end up taking the World into World War III unless it is stopped. \n\nThe television news later reports that the USA went on high-alert due to a computer error leading David and Jennifer to wonder if they had caused the problem. David throws away the evidence of his calling Joshua but the computer calls David back. David then asks Joshua if the game it is playing is real or not, Joshua relies \"what is the difference?\" At this point David learns that Joshua is not a computer game companies' computer but a government one and is actually is playing the game for real. He hangs up but Joshua calls him back, leading David to remove the cord from the back of his telephone. David is then arrested by the FBI and taken to NORAD to answer charges of espionage. David tries to explain that he was not trying to be a spy, but he is not believed. Using things found in the medical office in which he is locked, David escapes from NORAD on a bus load of visitors to the facility. After David escapes he telephones Jennifer (using Phreaking skills) to ask her to buy him an airplane ticket so he can go and see Falken and get his help in stopping Joshua. Jennifer meets him and together then both go off to convince Falken to help them stop World War III.\n\nProfessor Falken has in fact resigned from NORAD because he believes war will happen no matter what any one does. Jennifer and David try to convince him to help them explain to NORAD that this is just a game that Joshua is playing. Falken tells them that it is not worth it as it may only buy them a few years but war will still happen. He explains that they are lucky because he lives only a few miles from a primary target and that they will die in a instant. David and Jennifer decide to try to stop the game anyway and try to leave the island. Finding no way off the island since the last ferry has left, Jennifer says that they should \"swim for it\". David admits he cannot swim. Professor Falken shows up with a helicopter and together they all go to NORAD. \n\nInside NORAD Falken tells them it is all a game and they decide to allow the missiles that the Soviet Union has reportedly fired to land to see if it is real or a game. The computer screens show the missiles landing but no missiles actually land. This convinces NORAD that the whole thing was not real. Joshua, however, decides to crack the launch codes and fire the USA's missiles for real. David and Falken try to get Joshua to stop the firing and eventually succeed when Jennifer mentions the word \"games\". After many tries they get Joshua to play tic-tac-toe against itself in an effort to teach it the meaning of (a word meaning that there is no point to doing something, or that doing so will not help). Joshua tries every game of tic-tac-toe possible and then tries the same thing with every scenario within the Global Thermonuclear War game. Joshua then learns that war can not be won, and stops the game ending the threat of World War III.\n\nThe movie was a hit. It was nominated for three Academy Awards. The movie had a production budget of $12 million and had gross revenues of over $120 million making it a high earning movie. \n\n\"WarGames\" has a cult following amongst computer users and fans of the 1980s. The movie led to the development of the term war dialing (the calling of phone numbers looking for computers to connect to and hack).\n\n\n", "id": "195432", "title": "WarGames"}

It was compatible with its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800, by which it was inspired. The IMSAI is largely thought of as the first \"clone\" computer. The IMSAI machine used a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was designed, made and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed \"IMSAI Manufacturing Corp\"). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 until 1978.\n\nIn May 1972, William Millard began business as \"IMS Associates\" (IMS) in the area of computer consultancy and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard began IMS Associates, Inc. Millard soon found capital for his business, and received several contracts, all for software. \n\nIn 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a \"workstation system\" that could do jobs for any General Motors new-car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these work stations were to have common access to a hard disk, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped. Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had first used, the 8080 looked like a better idea. Full scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was begun, and by October 1975 an advertisement was placed in the magazine \"Popular Electronics\", receiving positive reactions. \n\nIMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on December 16 1975. In 1976, IMS was renamed to \"IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation\" because by then they were a manufacturing company, not a consultancy one. By October 1979 the IMSAI corporation had gone bankrupt, and the 'IMSAI' trademark was acquired by Thomas \"Todd\" Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues to this day.\n\nThe IMSAI 8080 was used for\n\nAn IMSAI 8080 and an acoustic coupler type modem were among the hacking tools used by the main character in the 1983 movie \"WarGames\".

He went to see his relatives in the Mississippi Delta area when he spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant. She was the married owner of a small grocery store. Several nights later, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, went to Till's great-uncle's house. They took Till to a barn. It is believed that they beat him and removed one of his eyes. They then shot him in the head and put his body in the Tallahatchie River. His body was found in the river three days later.\n\nTill's body was returned to Chicago. His mother wanted on a public funeral service with an open casket. She wanted this to show the world how her son had been killed. Tens of thousands of people went to his funeral or saw his casket. Images of his body were published in black magazines and newspapers. This caused support from both black and white people in the United States. At first, local newspapers and law enforcement officials spoke against the violence and asked for justice.

It is also called sometimes \"Compostela de Azua\".\n\n\"Azua\" is the Taíno name of the region where the old city was founded. In this place, Pedro Gallego (or Pedro Mariscal), a Spanish colonist, developed a farm and he gave it the name of \"Compostela\" after Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, nortwestern Spain.\n\nThe municipality had, in 2010, a total population of 91,345: 46,280 men and 45,065 women. The urban population was of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts that are part the municipality. The population of the city of Azua de Compostela without those municipal districts was 59,319.\n\nThe town was founded in 1504 by Diego Velázquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba; the Spanish governor of the Hispaniola island at that time was Nicolás de Ovando. The town was in the original region of Azua, where there was a Taíno town and Pedro Gallego had a farm. This place is called now \"Pueblo Viejo\" (in English, \"Old Town\"), at about 8 km to the soutwest of the modern city.\n\nThe first secretary of the town was Hernán Cortés. He lived in Azua from 1504 to 1511, when he left to Cuba and, later, to conquest México.\n\nSeveral sugar factories were established around the town and pirates came here to get the sugar and other products.\n\nIn 1751 there was a strong earthquake that destroyed the old town and a new one was founded on the right (western) side of the River Vía, where the modern city is now.\n\nBecause Azua is on the road that goes from the western part of the island to Santo Domingo, the city was destroyed several times during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856). Two important battles (the \"Azua Battles\") were fought in the city; the first was on 19 March 1844 and the second on 1849.\n\nThe municipality of Azua de Compostela is in a very dry valley (the \"Azua Valley\" or \"Azua Plain\") where cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Farming is possible only with irrigation.\n\nThe territory around the city is very flat, with only a few very small hills but there are mountains in the north and northwest of the municipality; those mountains are part of the \"Cordillera Central\" mountain range. The only river in the municipality is the \"Vía\", a very small river that flows through the city.\n\nAzua de Compostela is at to the west of Santo Domingo. The limits of the municipality are Peralta to the north, Estebanía to the east, the Caribbean Sea to the south, Pueblo Viejo to the southwest and Sabana Yegua to the west.\n\nAzua de Compostela has a subtropical steppe/semi-arid hot climate (Köppen climate classification : BSh).\n\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is .

It was also the first tropical cyclone to affect the Caribbean during 2009. The storm formed on August 11, but strong wind shear weakened it on August 13. Ana later reformed and became a tropical storm on August 15 before wind shear tore apart the storm again. The storm finally died on August 17.\n\nBetween August 15 and 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave out tropical storm watches to some Caribbean islands like the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic. Some people took a few precautions. Most of the damage from Ana was in the form of rain.\n\nA tropical wave formed over the Cape Verde islands on August 9. The NHC started watching the storm to see if it would turn into a tropical cyclone. It became a tropical depression on August 11. By then, the storm had a lot of thunderstorm activity near its center. On August 12, the NHC said that the storm was close to tropical storm-stength. While the storm was still alive, it was not called a tropical storm. However it was later found that the storm had actually reached tropical storm strength winds. The next day, the storm began to weaken and fall apart because of wind shear and dry air. The remains of the storm moved west across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn August 14, the NHC saw that the storm was reforming. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter airplane flew into the storm and the NHC started to follow the storm again. On August 15, the storm was given the name \"Ana\" after it reached tropical storm strength. Soon wind shear started to affect Ana again. The next day, the storm moved into an area of dry air over the Caribbean Sea. Ana weakened into a depression after another Hurricane Hunter airplane found no tropical storm-winds. The storm's circulation fell apart and Ana finally died on August 17.\n\nOn August 15, a tropical storm watch was given to the islands of St. Maarten, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua, Barbuda, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, and the United States Virgin Islands. Later on August 17, Puerto Rico, Dominica, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy were also put on tropical storm watch. When Ana weakened into a remnant low later that day, all watches were stopped.\n\nIn St. Thomas, wind speeds from Ana were recorded at 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts peaked at 40 mph (65 km/h). Also, a lot of rainfall created flooding in Puerto Rico. But there was only little damage done. At most, 4 in (100 mm) of rain fell on the island. Some streets had to be shut down because of the flooding. About 6,000 people lost electricity from the storm. Tree branches broke down power lines. People also reported tornadoes and waterspouts created by Ana in Puerto Rico. The remains of Ana brought rainfall to parts of Hispaniola.

Suppressors are most often added to the gun barrel, usually by screwing the silencer onto the end of the barrel. Some guns have a built-in suppressor.\n\nEven though many people use the name \"silencer\" when talking about a suppressor, it does not really make the gun silent. How much quieter it makes the gun depends both on the cartridges and the suppressor. A suppressed gun usually is between 120 to 135 decibels (dB). This is much quieter than without the suppressor, but is still loud enough to cause hearing loss without protection such as earplugs. An unsuppressed firearm usually produces 140 to 165 dB. For comparison, a typical jackhammer produces about 130 dB.\n\nIn many places, suppressors are illegal to own except for the military and police. This is because suppressors make guns quieter and people worry this could help criminals commit crime.\n\nIn most states in the United States, suppressors are legal for civilians to own, but the National Firearms Act requires that buyers must go through a special background check and pay a $200 tax.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196196", "text": "MissingNo.\n\nMissingNo., also known as MissingNO, is the name of a glitch Pokémon that is short for \"Missing Number\". MissingNo. Pokémon are used as error handlers by game developer Game Freak; they appear when the game tries to access data for a Pokémon species that does not exist.\n\nFirst documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of \"Nintendo Power\", encountering MissingNo. results in messed up graphics and item duplication of the player's sixth item in their inventory. It has a unique effect upon the Pokémon community unlike anything else.\n\nThere are two reasons why the player encounters MissingNo., both as a result of programming bugs. The first is caused by the way the game stores battle information and the second is caused by the Old Man script in Viridian City. When traveling from one area to another, the game assigns numbers for Pokémon that the player encounters to a data buffer, read by the game when they encounter a wild Pokémon. However, on the right side of the Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands, no data is actually assigned to this buffer, and the information from the previous location is used instead (the player's name data).\n\nOnce encountered, players can fight, flee, or capture MissingNo. just like any other wild Pokémon in the game. After encountering the MissingNo., the sixth item's quantity in the player's item menu will be multiplied by 128, and the game's \"Hall of Fame\" gallery will become damaged forever. Other display problems may happen, though these can be fixed by viewing a Pokédex entry or resetting the Game Boy. It commonly appears as a scrambled \"d\" shaped rectangle, though sometimes (encounter values) it will look like a Ghost or two fossils.\n\nEven though it has only appeared in three games in Pokémon, MissingNo. has had a lot of impact. Nintendo says it a \"programming quirk\" and doesn't want players to encounter it and later making impossible to obtain it in the next game, \"Pokémon Yellow\", unless a trade is done. However, information on how to encounter MissingNo. was printed in a lot of magazines and player's guides due to its effect, while some \"Pokémon\" players tried to sell real and fake \"tips\" for capturing MissingNo. for up to $200. In 2009, IGN put MissingNo in their \"Top 10 Easter Eggs\" in games list, describing it as a \"glitchimon\" and saying it was useful for making copies of items. In another article, they said \"It really says something about \"Pokémon\" fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon.\"\n\nReactions by players to MissingNo. has been studied by sociological studies regarding individuals and games. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge said in a study that Game Freak \"spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history\", due to the good and bad results of it and players' interesting use of it. The book \"Playing with Videogames\" studied the effect of MissingNo. deeply, studying players' curious actions as a result of its appearance and examining their own notes along with individual \"sightings\" reports, studying and criticizing other people's findings. The book further describes the extent to which gaming communities revolving around \"Pokémon\" have attempted to make it a real aspect of the game's world through elements such as fan fiction and fan art, adding that this in turn inspires creativity. It also says that people were celebrating and publicizing glitches in the game while trying to make it canon, and adds that MissingNo. popularity was an unusual case.\n\n", "id": "196196", "title": "MissingNo."}

It campaigns mostly for Scotland to leave the United Kingdom and become an independent country. It is a social democratic party and is currently the largest party in the Scottish Parliament, with 69 out of 129 seats and its party leader Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of Scotland.\n\nMost SNP supporters believe in the following things:\n\n\nThe Scottish National Party was founded in 1934. During World War II, its leader Douglas Young told Scottish people not to join the war effort and as a result he was widely disliked. The first SNP Member of Parliament was Robert McIntyre, who entered parliament in a by-election for Motherwell in 1945, but he lost the seat at the general election of that year. The party struggled in the 1950s but achieved greater success in the 1960s and in 1967, Winnie Ewing was elected as an MP for the party at a by-election in Hamilton. Only 1 seat was won by the SNP at the 1970 general election but at the February 1974 general election, it won 7 seats. Following the discovery of oil in the North Sea, the SNP ran a campaign called 'It's Scotland's oil' meaning that they thought it should benefit only the Scots and the party won 11 seats and 30% of the vote in Scotland at the October 1974 general election.\n\nWhen the Labour government of James Callaghan started losing its majority in parliament, it made deals with the smaller parties including the Liberal Party, the SNP and the Welsh nationalists. The SNP only agreed to support this if a referendum was given to the Scottish people on the creation of a devolved assembly. The referendum gained support from 51% of Scots but the Labour government decided that not enough people had voted in the referendum and because of this, the SNP refused to support the Labour government. The general election of 1979 saw the SNP reduced to only 2 seats in parliament.\n\nThe party did poorly at the general elections of 1983, 1987 and 1992. Alex Salmond became party leader in 1990 and in 1997, the party won 6 seats in parliament. The Labour government of Tony Blair established a Scottish Parliament in 1999 and at the elections held for the new parliament, the SNP came in second place behind Labour, with 35 out of 128 seats. It wasn't until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election that the SNP made another major breakthrough and at this election, the party won the most seats with 47 out of 128 seats and a minority government was then formed with Alex Salmond made First Minister.\n\nThe party tried to give Scotland a referendum on independence in 2010, but the other major parties in the Scottish Parliament stopped them. In 2011, they won 69 out of 129 seats in the election to the Scottish Parliament, and were able to govern alone. They held the Scottish independence referendum on September 18, 2014, where 55% of people voted against independence from the UK. Salmond resigned as First Minister of Scotland and was replaced by Nicola Sturgeon. Under her leadership, the SNP won 56 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom general election, 2015. \n", "id": "196250", "title": "Scottish National Party"}

He said that it is not possible to prove or disprove that God exists. Therefore, it is better to bet that God exists. If God existed, and the person believed in God, he would be rewarded (with happiness forever); if the person did not believe, he would be punished (with what is called \"eternal damnation\"). If God did not exist it would make no difference. For this reason, it would be better to believe in God, Pascal said. Indeed, Pascal strongly believed in this ideal. \n\nPascal's argument is a simple one: reason and intellect cannot decide the question of whether God exists or not; therefore, it makes sense to choose the option that would benefit us most should we be right. Accordingly, the options would be as follows: \n\n1. You may live a religious and moral life and be rewarded by eternal happiness.\n\n2. You may live a pleasure-seeking life and be denied eternal happiness.\n\n3. You may live a holy life but there is actually no God or eternal life.\n\n4. You may live a pleasure-seeking life but it makes no difference because there is no God. \n\nFor Pascal, the first of these options is the most important one because it represents the maximum gain and loss. Even if it should turn out that there is no God, the sheer risk of deciding against such a possibility warrants that we should take that option.\n\nThe argument from inconsistent revelations shows we have no idea which hell to avoid since many different religions exist with different beliefs about hell. Within religions there are different denominations and sects with different ideas about heaven and hell. If we try to avoid the hell that Christians believe in we are at risk from the hell Muslims believe. So it goes on. Perhaps god does not like people who accept Pascal's Wager but god may not mind that atheists doubt. Atheists and believers could both be in trouble or neither could be in trouble. \n\n\nFurther three Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam claim worshiping other gods is sinful. We have no proof that any particular deity is real and can easily choose the wrong god. Therefore we are safer worshiping a god or gods that are less exclusive and will not punish us for making the wrong choice.\n\nPierre de Fermat and Pascal created probability theory. Pascal's Wager was very important for the time, because it did new things with probability theory. It is also one of the first tries to use the concept of infinity, and the first use of decision theory. It was important for other philosophers who developed the ideas of pragmatism and voluntarism.\n", "id": "196502", "title": "Pascal's Wager"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196645", "text": "Venice and Dalmatia\n\nVenice and Dalmatia were an Italian city-state and an eastern adriatic region very much related from the Middle Ages until the 19th century.\n\nVenice influenced Dalmatia commercially since the times of Charlemagne. But only at the end of the first millennium the Republic of Venice started to conquest Dalmatia.\n\nIndeed, after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Illyrian towns on the dalmatian coast continued to speak Latin and their language evolved relatively independent from other Romance languages, progressing toward a regional variant and finally to a distinct language called \"Dalmatian language\".\n\nThe earliest reference on the language dates from the 10th century and it is estimated that about 50,000 people spoke it at that time (according to the linguist Matteo Bartoli).\n\nThe Dalmatian language is an extinct Romance language that was spoken along the eastern Adriatic in the Dalmatian coast from Fiume (Rijeka) as far south as Kotor (Cattaro) in Montenegro.\n\nThe Dalmatian speakers lived mainly in the coastal towns of Zadar, Trogir, Split, Dubrovnik and Kotor (\"Zara, Traù, Spalato, Ragusa\" and \"Cattaro\" in Italian), each of these cities having a local dialect, and also on the islands of Krk, Cres and Rab (\"Veglia, Cherso\" and \"Arbe\")\n\nAlmost every city developed its own dialect, but the most important dialects we have information on are the \"Vegliot\" a northern dialect, spoken on the island of Krk (\"Veglia\" in Italian, \"Vikla\" in Dalmatian) and the \"Ragusan\"', a southern dialect, spoken at Dubrovnik (\"Ragusa\" in both Italian and Dalmatian).\n\nThe dialect of Zara disappeared because of the strong Venetian influence while the two other dialects due even to the assimilation by Slavic language speakers.\n\nWe know about the dalmatian dialect of Ragusa from two letters, from 1325 and 1397, and other medieval texts, which show a language influenced heavily by Venetian. The available sources include hardly 260 Ragusan words. Surviving words include \"pen\" (bread), \"teta\" (father), \"chesa\" (house) and \"fachir\" (to do), which were quoted by an Italian, Fillipo Diversi, the head of school of Ragusa in the 1430s.\n\nThe \"Republic of Ragusa\" had at one time an important fleet, but its influence decreased. We know that the language was in trouble in the face of Croatian expansion, as the Ragusan Senate decided that all debates had to be held in \"lingua veteri ragusea\" (ancient Ragusan language) and the use of the \"lingua sclava\" (Croatian) was forbidden. Nevertheless, in the 16th century, Ragusan fell out of use and became extinct.\n\nOther languages influenced the Ddalmatian language, but without erasing its Latin roots (superstrates): the Slavs, then the Republic of Venice. Several cities of the regions have Italian names, and other mostly the romanized Illyrian ones (like Zara, Spalato, etc..)\n\nThe oldest preserved documents written in Dalmatian are some 13th century inventories, in the Ragusan dialect. A letter of the 14th century from Zara (Zadar) shows strong Venetian influence, which was also the cause of its extinction soon after.\n\nThe Christian schism was an important factor in the history of Dalmatia. While the Croatian-held branch of the Catholic Church in Nin was under Pope's jurisdiction, they still used the Slavic liturgy. Both the Latin population of the cities and the Holy See preferred the Latin liturgy, which created tensions between different dioceses. \n\nThe great schism between Eastern and Western Christianity of 1054 further intensified the rift between the coastal cities and the hinterland, with many of the Slavs in the hinterland preferring the Eastern Orthodoxy. Areas of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina also had an indigenous \"Bosnian Church\" which was often mistaken for \"Bogomils\".\n\nThe Latin influence in Dalmatia was increased and the Byzantine practices were further suppressed on the general synods of 1059-1060, 1066, 1075-1076 and on other local synods, notably by demoting the bishopric of Nin, installing the archbishoprics of Spalatum (Split) and Dioclea (Montenegro), and explicitly forbidding use of any liturgy other than Greek or Latin.\n\nDalmatia never attained a political or racial unity and never formed as a \"nation\", but it achieved a remarkable development of art, science and literature. Politically, the neolatin Dalmatian city-states were often isolated and compelled to either fall back on the Venetian Republic for support, or tried to make it on their own.\n\nThe geographical position of the Dalmatian city states suffices to explain the relatively small influence exercised by Byzantine culture throughout the six centuries (535-1102) during which Dalmatia was part of the Eastern empire. Towards the close of this period Byzantine rule tended more and more to become merely nominal, while the influence of the Republic of Venice increased.\n\nThe medieval Dalmatia had still included much of the hinterland covered by the old Roman province of Dalmatia. However, the toponym of \"Dalmatia\" started to shift more towards including only the coastal, Adriatic areas, rather than the mountains inland. By the 15th century, the word \"Herzegovina\" would be introduced, marking the shrink of the borders of Dalmatia to the narrow littoral area where was spoken the Dalmatian language (that was being assimilated into the venetian language).\n\nIn the thirteenth century the Republic of Venice took definitive control of the Montenegro coast and created the \"Albania Veneta\".\n\nAs the city states gradually lost all protection by Byzantium, being unable to unite in a defensive league hindered by their internal dissensions, they had to turn to either Venice or Hungary for support. Each of the two political factions had support within the Dalmatian city states, based mostly on economic reasons.\n\nThe Venetians, to whom the Dalmatians were already bound by language and culture, could afford to concede liberal terms as its main goal was to prevent the development of any dangerous political or commercial competitor on the eastern Adriatic.\nThe seafaring community in Dalmatia looked to Venice as mistress of the Adriatic. In return for protection, the cities often furnished a contingent to the army or navy of their suzerain, and sometimes paid tribute either in money or in kind. Arbe (Rab), for example, annually paid ten pounds of silk or five pounds of gold to Venice.\nHungary, on the other hand, defeated the last Croat king in 1097 and laid claim on all lands of the Croatian noblemen since the treaty of 1102. King Coloman of Hungary proceeded to conquer Dalmatia in 1102-1105.\nThe farmers and the merchants who traded in the interior favoured Hungary as their most powerful neighbour on land that affirmed their municipal privileges. \nSubject to the royal assent they might elect their own chief magistrate, bishop and judges. Their Roman law remained valid. They were even permitted to conclude separate alliances. No alien, not even a Hungarian, could live in a city where he was unwelcome; and the man who disliked Hungarian dominion could emigrate with all his household and property. In lieu of tribute, the revenue from customs was in some cases shared equally by the king, chief magistrate, bishop and municipality.\n\nThese rights and the analogous privileges granted by Venice were, however, too frequently infringed. Hungarian garrisons were being quartered on unwilling towns, while Venice interfered with trade, the appointment of bishops, or the tenure of communal domains. Consequently, the Dalmatians remained loyal only while it suited their interests, and insurrections frequently occurred. Even in Zara four outbreaks are recorded between 1180 and 1345, although Zadar was treated with special consideration by its Venetian masters, who regarded its possession as essential to their maritime ascendancy.\n\nThe once rival Romanic and Slavic population eventually started contributing to a common civilization, and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) was the primary example of this. By the 13th century, the councilmen from ragusan names were mixed, and in the 15th century the ragusan literature was even written in the Slavic language (from which Croatian language is directly descended), and the city was often called by its Slavic name, Dubrovnik. Only in 1918 Ragusa was called officially \"Dubrovnik\", with the creation of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe doubtful allegiance of the Dalmatians tended to protract the struggle between Venice and Hungary, which was further complicated by internal discord due largely to the spread of the \"Bogomil heresy\", and by many outside influences.\n\nThe cities of Zara (Zadar), Spalato (Split), Trau (Trogir) and Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and the surrounding territories each changed hands several times between Venice, Hungary and the Byzantium during the 12th century.\n\nIn 1202, the armies of the Fourth Crusade rendered assistance to Venice by occupying Zadar for it. In 1204 the same army conquered Byzantium and finally eliminated the Eastern Empire from the list of contenders on Dalmatian territory.\n\nThe early 13th century was marked by a decline in external hostilities. The Dalmatian cities started accepting foreign sovereignty (mainly of the Republic of Venice) but eventually they reverted to their previous desire for independence. The Mongol invasion severely impaired Hungary, so much that in 1241, the king Bela IV had to take refuge in Dalmatia (in the Klis fortress). The Mongols attacked the Dalmatian cities for the next few years but eventually withdrew.\n\nThe Croats were no longer regarded by the city folk as a hostile people, in fact the power of certain Croatian magnates, notably the counts Šubić of Bribir, was from time to time supreme in the northern districts (in the period between 1295 and 1328).\n\nIn 1346, Dalmatia was struck by the Black Death. The economic situation was also poor, and the cities became more and more dependent on Venice.\n\nStephen Tvrtko, the founder of the \"Bosnian kingdom\", was able in 1389 to annex the Adriatic littoral between Cattaro and Sebenico (Šibenik), and even claimed control over the northern coast up to Fiume (Rijeka) except for the Venetian-ruled Zara (Zadar), and his own independent ally, Ragusa (Dubrovnik). This was only temporary, as the Hungarians and the Venetians continued their struggle over Dalmatia as soon as Tvrtko died in 1391.\n\nAn internal struggle of Hungary, between King Sigismund and the Neapolitan house of Anjou, also reflected on Dalmatia: in the early 15th century, all Dalmatian cities welcomed the Neapolitan fleet except for Dubrovnik (Ragusa). The Bosnian duke Hrvoje controlled Dalmatia for the Angevins, but later switched loyalty to Sigismund.\n\nOver the period of twenty years, this struggle weakened the Hungarian influence. In 1409, Ladislaus of Naples sold his \"rights\" over Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 \"Ducats\". Venice gradually took over most of Dalmatia by 1420. In 1437, Sigismund recognized Venetian rule over Dalmatia in return for 100,000 Ducats. The city of Omiš yielded to Venice in 1444, and only Ragusa (Dubrovnik) preserved temporarily its freedom. \n\nThe rule of Venice on most of Dalmatia will last nearly four centuries (1420 - 1797).\n\nDuring the Venetian rule in Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797 the number of Orthodox Serbs in Dalmatia was increased by numerous migrations.\n\nAn interval of peace ensued, but meanwhile the Ottoman advance continued. \n\nHungary was itself assailed by the Turks, and could no longer afford to try to control Dalmatia. Christian kingdoms and regions in the east fell one by one, Constantinople in 1453, Serbia in 1459, neighbouring Bosnia in 1463, and Herzegovina in 1483. Thus the Venetian and Ottoman frontiers met and border wars were incessant.\n\nDubrovnik sought safety in friendship with the invaders, and in one particular instance, actually sold two small strips of its territory (Neum and Sutorina) to the Ottomans in order to prevent land access from the Venetian territory.\n\nIn 1508 the hostile \"League of Cambrai\" compelled Venice to withdraw its garrison for home service, and after the overthrow of Hungary in 1526 the Turks were able easily to conquer the greater part of Dalmatia by 1537. The peace of 1540 left only the maritime cities to Venice, the interior forming a Turkish province, governed from the fortress of Klis by a \"Sanjakbeg\" (an administrator with military powers).\n\nChristian Croats from the neighbouring lands now thronged to the towns, outnumbering the Romanic population even more, and making their language the primary one. The pirate community of the \"Uskoks\" had originally been a band of these fugitives, especially near Segna (Senj); its exploits contributed to a renewal of war between Venice and Turkey (1571-1573). An extremely curious picture of contemporary manners is presented by the Venetian agents, whose reports on this war resemble some knightly chronicle of the Middle Ages, full of single combats, tournaments and other chivalrous adventures. They also show clearly that the Dalmatian levies far surpassed the Italian mercenaries in skill and courage. Many of these troops served abroad; at the Battle of Lepanto, for example, in 1571, a Dalmatian squadron assisted the allied fleets of Spain, Venice, Austria and the Papal States to crush the Turkish navy.\n\nThe continental bits of Dalmatia were under Ottoman rule, parts of the Viyalet of Bosnia or the Klis Sanjak. The desolated areas of the Knin Frontier and Bukovica were inhabited by Orthodox Serbs from Bosnia, while the Albania veneta received constant Serb migrations from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The Serbs formed one quarter of Dalmatia's population in the 16th century. They had absolute majority in the Knin Frontier, Bukovica and the Cattaro area. The Ottomans have resettled this populace to create a living defence towards the territories of the Venetian Republic. A great portion of this population fled to Venetian land and gladly fought against the Ottomans. The number of Serbs in Venetian Dalmatia rapidly increased during the War of Crete in 1645 - 1669 and the Great Viennese War in 1683 - 1699, after which the \"Peace of Karlowitz\" gave the whole of Dalmatia and coastal Montenegro (from Sutorina to Cattaro) to the Venetian Republic. After the Venetian-Turkish war of 1714-1718, Venetian territorial gains were confirmed by the 1718 \"Treaty of Passarowitz\". The number of Dalmatian Serbs remained between \"20%\" and \"25%\" by the end of Venetian rule, while the venetian speaking population in the Dalmatian cities and islands increased with colonists from north-east Italy. \n\nThe Serbian peasant population of infertile Upper Dalmatia was freed of \"Feudal bonds\", according that they fight wars for the Venetian Republic. The Serbs living in urban area of cities in Dalmatia were much wealthier. The Serbs in Dalmatia with Boka have had strong national and religious determination through numerous old monasteries as beacons of culture and faith. Such were the early 14th century Krupa, Krka and Dragović monasteries in the Knin Frontier and Bukovica. The Serbs in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) had much more cultural advancement due to the nearby Cetinje capital area, and the Venetians had to fall back from influencing the religious life of people there. \n\nDalmatia was the largest Europe's concentration of Roman Catholic Bishops, Priesthood, Churches, Monasteries and religious institutions. The Catholic Bishops controlled the Orthodox Episcopy in Dalmatia by naming the Eastern Othodox Christian Episcopes themselves. \n\nDalmatia experienced a period of intense economic and cultural growth in the 18th century, given how trade routes with the hinterland were reestablished in peace. Christians that noticeably migrated from the Ottoman-held territory into the Dalmatian cities converted from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. \n\nBecause the Venetians were able to reclaim some of the inland territories in the north during the Turkish wars, the region of Dalmatia was no longer restricted to the coastline and the islands.

The VI scale goes from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst, and 100 being the best. New products are now better than when the scale was first made, so some new products have scores as high as 400.\n\nLubricating oil is meant to reduce friction between two surfaces. If it is too viscous the oil will be thick and sticky and need too much energy to keep the parts moving. If the oil is too thin, then the parts will rub together and create friction. What is needed is an oil that has just the right amount of viscosity to keep the two surfaces apart. Oil becomes less viscous as the temperature goes up. In an automobile engine, the oil needs to be viscous at a range of temperatures. It needs to work when the engine is first started and is cold, and keep working when the engine gets very hot, perhaps as much as 200 °C. The best oils, with a high viscosity index score, will keep their viscosity the same across the temperature range.\n\nThe scale was made up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).\n", "id": "196698", "title": "Viscosity index"}

It contained wrestlers from the Smackdown, ECW, and RAW brands. The name of the event was voted by fans via WWE's official website. Breaking Point was chosen over Submission Sunday, Total Submission, and Submit & Quit.\nBreaking Point contained seven professional wrestling matches, with the three main event matches being held under submission rules. The event involved wrestlers from all three Brands, Raw, WWE SmackDown and ECW. The wrestlers portrayed either a good guy or a bad guy as they followed a series of events which led to a wrestling match or a series of wrestling matches.\n\nOn the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the main event for the Raw brand was announced, it was to be a rematch from the previous nights SummerSlam PPV, Randy Orton would again defend the WWE Championship against John Cena. Due to the controversy surrounding the previous nights match, which involved the match being restarted due to a disqualification, count-out and Orton's use of illegal leverage.\n\nVince McMahon granted Cena a rematch as a result of Orton's actions, in a response to the interference from Brett DiBiase at SummerSlam, McMahon stated if anyone were to interfere on Orton's behalf he would lose the WWE Championship. The Championship was defended in an \"I Quit\" match, where the opponent is won by making the opponent say \"I Quit\".\n\nAfter winning the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, it was announced CM Punk would defend the Championship the following week on the August 28, 2009 (taped August 25, 2009) edition against Jeff Hardy and the winner would face The Undertaker at Breaking Point in a Submission match, where the only way to win is by making your opponent Submit.\n\nOn the August 24, 2009 edition of WWE Raw, the Guest host for the night was weltherweight boxing champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr. who previously had a match with The Big Show at WrestleMania XXIV in 2008. Due to lingering bitterness from their WrestleMania match, Mayweather announced an exhibition match between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Mark Henry versus Unified Tag Team Champions Big Show and Chris Jericho, with an added stipulation that if MVP and Henry won they would face Show and Jericho for the Unified Tag Team Championship at Breaking Point. During the match MVP and Henry gained their chance when Mayweather handed MVP brass knuckles to knock Jericho out and pin Jericho for the win.\n\nOn the July 27, 2009 edition of Raw, to decide the opponent for the current WWE Champion Randy Orton at Night of Champions, a \"beat the clock\" challenge was set up, Triple H had to defeat his opponent Cody Rhodes in under a set time of 6 minutes and 49 seconds set by Mark Henry. Triple H was unsuccessful in his attempt, this match was followed by Rhodes with assistance from The Legacy team member Ted DiBiase beating down Triple H. This event led to Triple H seeking help from Shawn Michaels to reform the group, D-Generation X (DX), to face and beat Rhodes and DiBiase at SummerSlam. Following the weeks of SummerSlam DX was continuously beat down by The Legacy which resulted in an announcement on WWE.com that the two teams would face at Breaking Point, in a Submissions Count Anywhere match.\n\n\n", "id": "196700", "title": "WWE Breaking Point"}

The Venetian territories never reached more than 20 km from the Adriatic Sea. After 1573 the southern limit was moved to the village of Confin (Kufin) near Budua (Budva), because of the Ottoman conquests of Antivari (Bar), and Dulcigno (Ulcinj) in the Balkans.\n\nThe Dominions of Venice were centered around the \"Bocche di Cattaro\" (Bay of Kotor) and included the small cities of Cattaro (Kotor), Risano (Risan), Perasto (Perast), Teodo (Tivat), Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi), Budua (Budva) and Spizza (Sutomore).\n\nVenice started to take control of the small southern Dalmatian villages around the 10th century, assimilating quickly the neolatin \"Dalmatian language\" of the coastal areas into the Venetian language. But only in the 14th century was the Republic of Venice able to create a territorial continuity around the Bay of Kotor. These Venetian dominions around Cattaro (Kotor) lasted from 1420 to 1797 and were called \"Albania Veneta\", a historical province of the Republic of Venice.\n\nWhen the Turks started to conquer the Balkans in 15th century, many Christian Slavs took refuge inside Venetian Dalmatia and so even the \"Albania Veneta\" started to have a huge Serb and Albanian population. By the end of 17th century the Romance speaking population of the historical \"Albania Veneta\" was already a minority, according to Oscar Randi in his book \"\"Dalmazia etnica, incontri e fusioni\".\n\nAfter the Napoleonic armies conquered and put an end to the Republic of Venice in 1797, the area of the Albania veneta changed control many times:\nin 1805 was annexed to the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\", then in 1809 was part of French \"Illyrian Provinces\" and finally in 1815 was put under Habsburg control in the Dalmatia of the Austrian Empire.\n\nUnder the Habsburg domination, \"Albania Veneta\" was part of \"Austrian Dalmatia\" and in 1878 (at the \"Congress of Berlin\") another 40 km² around Sutomore were added to this territory.\n\nThe borders of the former Venetian province of \"Albania Veneta\" changed again in 1918, when was created the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but were reinstated from 1941 to 1943 during World War II, when Mussolini annexed the territories around Cattaro to the Kingdom of Italy. The area was part of the Italian \"Governatorato di Dalmazia\" and was called \"Provincia di Cattaro\".\n\nAfter World War II any political entity related to the historical presence of Venice in southern Dalmatia ceased to exist and the area was definitely incorporated into Yugoslavia.\nThe old \"Albania Veneta\" is currently a coastal region of the newly independent Montenegro.\n\nAccording to the Dalmatian historian Luigi Paulucci (in his book \"Le Bocche di Cattaro nel 1810\") the population of the \"Albania Veneta\", during the centuries of the Republic of Venice, was mainly Venetian speaking (approximately 66%) in the urban areas (Cattaro, Perasto, Budua, ecc..) around the \"Bocche di Cattaro\" (Bay of Kotor).\n\nBut in the inland areas more than half of the population was Serbo-Croatian speaking, after the first years of the eighteenth century. Paulucci wrote even that near the border with Albania there were big communities of Albanian speaking people: Dulcigno (Ulcinj) was half Albanian, one quarter Venetian and one quarter Slavic-speaking.\n\nDuring the French rule of the area of Cattaro the schools were in Italian, when the former Albania Veneta was part of the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". \n\nThe Slovenian Marko Trogrli in his essay \"The French school system in French Dalmatia\" wrote that \"Vincenzo Dandolo, the French governor of Dalmatia as well as Bartolomeo Benincasa, an official from the local (Dalmatian) Education Department, published in May 1807 a plan for the province's public education (\"Il piano generale della pubblica istruzione in Dalmazia\"), which had to be consistent with the education system throughout the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy...Instruction was to be in Italian\".\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, according to the historian Scaglioni Marzio, the wars of independence of Italy from the Austro-Hungarian empire created a situation of harassment against the Italian (or Venetian speaking) communities in the Austrian southern Dalmatia.\n\nThe result was that in 1880 there were in Cattaro, according to the Austrian census, only 930 ethnic Italians (or only 32% of a total population of 2910 people).\n\nFurthermore, in the Austrian census of 1910, the Italians were reduced to only 13.6% in that city, according to Diego De Castro in his book \"Dalmazia, popolazione e composizione etnica. Cenno storico sul rapporto etnico tra Italiani e Slavi nella Dalmazia\".\n\nThere are currently 500 Italian speakers in Montenegro, mainly in the area of Cattaro (Kotor) and Perasto (Perast), who constitute the \"Comunitá Nazionale Italiana del Montenegro\".\n\nThe \"disappearance\" of the Italian speaking populations in Dalmatia was nearly complete after World War II. The linguist Matteo Bartoli calculated that the Italians were 33% of the Dalmatian population during the Napoleonic wars, while currently there are only 300 Italians in Croatian Dalmatia and 500 Italians in coastal Montenegro.\n\n", "id": "196787", "title": "Albania veneta"}

Only the tribes Senecioneae and Astereae are larger. Most Heliantheae come from North America and South America, and Mexico. A few genera come from tropical areas.\n\nMost Heliantheae are herbs or shrubs, but there are some that grow to the size of small trees. Leaves are usually hairy and arranged in opposite pairs.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=196920", "text": "Borderline personality disorder\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a long-term mental illness. It is a type of cluster B personality disorder. People diagnosed with BPD are often very impulsive, and generally have a low self-esteem. Moods often change quickly. For these reasons, these people often have trouble keeping a stable relationship. Frequently, people with BPD also suffer from other conditions, such as clinical depression or they show self-harming behavior. Treating people with BPD is difficult, and is usually done using a combination of therapy and drugs.\n\nC.H.Huges used the term \"Borderland\", to describe a number of conditions bordering mental health issues. Adolf Stern gave a description of some of the symptoms in 1938, and called them \"border line group\". People showed both conditions related to psychosis, and related to neurosis, so the term was though fitting, at the time.\n\nPeople diagnosed with BPD have strong mood swings. They see things as \"all good\" or \"all bad\" (splitting), and are frequently confused about their identity. They usually have a lot of trouble with relationships with people. They have strong emotions which often change quickly. They are often reckless, destructive or self-destructive.\n\nPeople with BPD feel emotions more easily, more deeply and for longer than others do. Emotions may repeatedly return and last a long time. Because of this, it may take longer than normal for people with BPD to return to a normal and stable emotional state. This can have both positive and negative effects. People with BPD are often very happy and loving. People with BPD are also often sad and mad. They feel emotions in a stronger way than most people - grief instead of sadness, rage instead of being annoyed, and panic instead of being anxious. People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of being abandoned, being alone, and being a \"failure\". They are often aware of how strong their emotions are, and, since they cannot control them, they sometimes shut them down entirely.\n\nTheir emotions are intense and their emotions are also quick to change. The most common mood swings they have are between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety.\n\nPeople with BPD often act impulsively, which means they do things or say things without thinking. This behavior can be dangerous, and includes: abusing drugs or alcohol, eating too much or too little, having unsafe sex or frequent sex with multiple partners, spending a lot of money, and driving dangerously. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away and self-injury. Many are imprisoned.\n\nPeople with BPD sometimes act impulsively because it gives them instant relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term people with BPD go through more pain from the shame and guilt that follow these actions. A cycle often begins where people with BPD feels emotional pain and acts impulsively to relieve that pain. Then they feel bad about what they did, and have strong urges to act impulsively to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may start to be an automatic reaction to emotional pain.\n\nSelf-injury is common for people with BPD. Sometimes people hurt themselves without wanting to commit suicide. Common methods include cutting, burning, head banging, and drug overdose. The reasons people with BPD give for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are different from their reasons for suicide attempts. Reasons they give for hurting themselves include expressing anger, punishing themselves, creating normal feelings, and distracting themselves from emotional pain or difficult situations. When suicide is the goal, they usually attempt suicide with the belief that others will be better off without them. Both suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury are a response to feeling negative emotions.\n\nPeople with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them. They can feel very happy and grateful when they feel someone has been nice to them, and very sad or angry when they feel someone has been hurtful to them. Their feelings about others often switch from positive to negative if they feel like they might lose someone, if they think someone important to them does not care about them, or if something is not as good as they expected. They think in extremes, seeing things or people as \"all good\" or \"all bad\". This is sometimes called black-and-white thinking. It includes a change from admiring someone to devaluing them, often feeling pure anger or dislike.The way they see themselves can also change quickly from positive to negative.\n\nWhile strongly wanting to feel closeness, people with BPD tend to be anxious, have mixed feelings, or be paranoid when it comes to their relationships. They often view the world as dangerous and bad. BPD is linked to high levels of stress and conflict in romantic relationships, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy. These things are also common with other types of personality disorders.\n\nPeople with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity. It is difficult for them to know what they value and love. They often do not know about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs. They often have trouble making decisions and can change their minds quickly. These difficulties can cause people with BPD to feel \"empty\" and \"lost\".\n\nPeople with BPD are easily bored and it is hard for them to concentrate. People with BPD may tend to disconnect or \"dissociate\" from people and things around them, which can be thought of as an intense form of \"zoning out\". This often happens in response to a painful event, or something that triggers the memory of a painful event. This can give make the person feel better for a short time, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking ordinary feelings. This has the result of keeping people with BPD from learning how to handle these feelings, and can make it difficult for them to make positive choices when they feel these emotions. Sometimes other people can see when someone with BPD is dissociating because the expressions in their face or voice can seem emotionless, or they look like they are distracted. Sometimes when someone with BPD is dissociating, other people are not able to see or know that it is happening. \n\nPsychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with BPD using a book called the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has five or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have BPD.\n\n\nNearly all people with BPD also have other mental health problems, such as: mood disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders (especially post-traumatic stress disorder), and other personality disorders. Most have or have had substance abuse and/or addictions. Self-harm and suicidal behavior are also common.\n\nOther illnesses that often happen with BPD include diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic back pain, arthritis, and fibromyalgia.\n\nThe cause for BPD is not known. There may be several causes for people developing BPD. Some researchers think that it might be caused by trauma in childhood, such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect. Many people with BPD were abused when they were children. Modern thinking as demonstrated by functioning MRI scans is that neurotransmitters within the brain are not working correctly, and messages are not conducted in the usual way.\n\nTreating BPD is very difficult and takes a long time. Today, most people with BPD are treated with different kinds of psychotherapy. One of these is called dialectical behavioral therapy. In addition to therapy, drugs such as antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood stabilizers are often used.\n\n", "id": "196920", "title": "Borderline personality disorder"}

The parliament is bicameral, which means it has two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. It was copied mainly from the way the United Kingdom's Parliament was run, the Westminster system, but it also has some ideas from the United States Congress. The laws which control the way the parliament is set up and its powers are part of the Australian Constitution. The Parliament meets in a special building, Parliament House, in Canberra.\n\nThe parliament has four main functions:\n\nThe Australian Parliament first met in the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1901. It then took over the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne until it moved to Canberra in 1927. A new building for the Parliament was finished in 1988 to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia.\n\nThere are 150 members of the House of Representatives, each one elected for a three year term. Each member represents about 150,000 people living in an electorate. The boundaries of each electorate are often changed to keep the number of people in each electorate is the same. The size of each electorate can be very different. The electorate of Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, covers an area of 2.3 million square kilometres, while Wentworth in New South Wales is only 26 square kilometres.\n\nThe government is formed by the political party (or group of political parties) who have the most members in the House. The House is set out in the British style, even using the green colours of the House of Commons. The Speaker sits at the front; the members of the government sit on the seats to his right, and the opposition sits on the seats to his left.

There are 76 members in the Senate. There are 12 senators for each Australian state, and 2 for each territory. The Senate makes and changes legislation. To become law, legislation must be passed by both houses and then be signed by the Governor-General.\n\nThe colours in the Australian Senate are red, as in the British House of Lords. The senators sit in a U shape around a central table. The head of the Senate, known as the President, sits at the head of the table.

The painting hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the capital of Spain. It was painted in 1656.\n\nThe word “Menina” means “lady-in-waiting” or “Maid of Honour”, i.e. a girl who serves in a royal court. There is a lot of detail in the painting, and more has been written about it than about almost any other Western painting because it is quite complicated. For example: people do not always agree about who is looking at whom and why they are standing there.\n\n\"Las Meninas\" shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain. Several people are in the painting, and we know who they are. Some are looking at one another and others are looking out from the painting at the viewer (the person who is looking at the painting).\n\nThe person who stands in the middle is the Infanta Margarita (the princess, daughter of the king and queen). She has two maids of honour, one on each side of her, a chaperone, a bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Velázquez has also painted himself, standing just behind the princess and her companions. He is standing at the artist’s easel. He has stopped painting for a moment and looks straight out at the viewer. At the back of the room is a mirror in which we can see the top halves of the bodies of the king and queen. This means that the king and queen are the viewers who are looking at the painting. The king and queen are probably being painted by Velázquez, but not everybody agrees with this.\n\nVelázquez was very famous in his lifetime. He painted portraits of several royal people at the Spanish court. Philip himself did not like being painted when he was old, but he allowed Velázquez to include him in \"Las Meninas\". He had given Velázquez a special room where he could paint, and he often sat and watched the painter at work in his studio.\n\nThe painting was damaged a bit by a fire in 1734 and some of it was repainted, including the left cheek of the Infanta. In recent years it lost some of its colour, partly due to the pollution caused by so many visitors to the gallery. It was cleaned in 1984. Some people thought it made the picture look different.\nThe people in \"Las Meninas\" are in Velázquez's studio in the royal palace. The Infanta Margarita (number 1 in the key picture) in the middle of the picture is five years old. She later married the Roman Emperor Leopold. She has two ladies-in-waiting (\"meninas\"): doña Isabel de Velasco (2), who is about to curtsy to the princess, and doña María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor (3), who kneels in front of Margarita, offering her a drink from a red cup, or \"bucaro\", that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: Maribarbola (4) who was German, and Nicolas Pertusato (5) who was Italian. He is trying to wake up a dog by his feet. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa (6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to a bodyguard (or \"guardadamas\") (7).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197058", "text": "Moon landing conspiracy theory\n\nThe moon landing conspiracy theory (also known as Moon landing hoax or Apollo hoax) is the belief that men did not land on the Moon in 1969–1972 during the Apollo program and that NASA faked the evidence. Some conspiracy theorists believe the Skylab space station is also a hoax.\n\nThis belief is considered by the scientific community and historians to be irrational. But on the internet, the debate can occur since it is easy for anyone to publish their ideas. There are subcultures within the USA and cultures around the world that believe that the Moon landings were faked. This view is claimed to have been taught in Cuban schools and wherever else Cuban teachers are sent (Nicaragua, Angola). It is also shared by the Taliban and by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\n\nOn 12 April 1961, the USSR sent the first man into space in Vostok 1, Yuri Gagarin. Six weeks later, US President John Kennedy promised a manned Moon landing by 1969 to win the battle of systems and impress the world with technical superiority:\n\nMoon conspiracy theorists say that NASA had too many technical problems to meet the eight year deadline for going to the moon. But the USA could not afford to appear lose the race to the moon to the Soviet Union, and so the moon landings were faked. In 2004, President George Bush gave not eight but sixteen years for a manned return to the Moon, even though the technologies for it should have already been developed forty years earlier. In 2010, President Barack Obama canceled this plan, which seemed to the moon conspiracy theorists to be an admission that the USA still does not have the technology to go to the moon.\n\nDoubts about the authenticity of the Apollo Moon landings appeared first in December 1968 when Apollo 8 was launched. The almost perfectly executed odyssey of Apollo 11 amazed many around the world, and some people doubted it was real.\n\nThe first book on the subject (\"Did man land on the Moon?\") was issued in Texas by the mathematician James J. Cranny in 1970.\n\nNASA commented on some of the conspiracy theories in June 1977. But in August 1997, their Director of Media Services (1998–2000) Brian Welch (1958–2000) said in an interview with Sky TV News:\n\nWhen Fox TV aired Bruce Nash's film \"Conspiracy theory: Did we land on the Moon?\" in 2001, NASA released hoax theory rebuttal materials on their web and FTP sites. They also wrote suggestions for science teachers on how to refute the hoax claims using the Lunar Sample Disk Kits.\n\nIn 2002, NASA hired James Edward Oberg, to write a book intended to challenge those who claim the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax. Oberg was a former rocket scientist, MSNBC News space consultant and analyst and journalist, and, it was later discovered, a moon landing conspiracy theorist. But NASA soon cancelled the project, declining to give the reasons for this. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said criticism that NASA was displaying poor judgement and a lack of confidence in commissioning the book caused the agency to abort it. For example, then NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said:\n\nIn 2006, some of the recordings of the Apollo era were declared missing. The question of what happened to the recordings was seen by conspiracy theorists as confirmation of their beliefs, and in 2009, NASA revealed that the tapes were erased.\n\nThe arguments about the moon conspiracy theories are detailed and complex. Some of the major points and counterpoints are listed below.\n\nMoon conspiracy theorists think that NASA faked the Apollo mission with a secret program. According to James Longuski, the complexity of the conspiracy theory scenarios make them impossible. More than 400,000 people worked on the Apollo project for almost ten years, and 12 men who walked on the Moon returned to Earth to talk about their experiences. Hundreds of thousands of people would have had to keep the secret. Longuski says that it would have been a lot easier to actually land on the Moon than to create such a large conspiracy to fake it.\n\nMoon conspiracy theorists say that telescopes like the Hubble should be able to take pictures of the moon where Apollo landed, and if people really did land on the moon then the pictures should show the scars on the moon's surface and equipment it left behind. They believe that our major observatories will not take pictures of the landing sites because it would expose the cover-up. \n\nNASA has said that images have been taken of these landing sites, but the pictures taken by Hubble are too low quality to see very much detail. In 2009 NASA released pictures from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter showing the Apollo landing sites in more detail. These photographs have not convinced the moon landing conspiracy theorists because the pictures were taken by NASA, and they think NASA is behind the cover-up.\n\nBlueprints and drawings of the machines used in the Apollo project are missing. Some Apollo 11 tapes containing telemetry and high quality video of the first moonwalk are also missing. Moon landing conspiracy theorists believe that this is because they never existed, since the mission was faked.\n\nDr. David Williams (NASA archivist at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 flight director Eugene F. Kranz acknowledged that some of the Apollo 11 tapes are missing. When the recordings were sent back to Earth to be shown on TV, they were converted to a different format which was lower quality. Now the lower quality tapes are available, but the original high quality videos received in Australia are missing. Some pictures of the original high quality image are still available, and videos have been released from other missions too, like the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package.\n\nSome people at NASA are looking for the tapes to help them plan for future missions. They believe the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984 all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center. The tapes may have been stored rather than re-used, and efforts to determine where they were stored are ongoing. Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967, even before the lunar landings.\n\nOn November 1, 2006 Cosmos Magazine reported that 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in the basement of the Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Australia. One of the old tapes was sent to NASA for analysis. \n\nOn July 16, 2009, NASA said that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could reuse the tape. On December 22, 2009 NASA issued a final report on the tapes. Senior engineer Dick Nafzger concluded that approximately 45 tapes of Apollo 11 video were erased and reused. For the 40th anniversary of the Apollo moon landing, Lowry Digital of Burbank, California restored the low quality videos. Some pieces of the restored footage are available on the NASA website.\n\nBart Sibrel (a moon landing conspiracy theorist) says that the Soviet Union had much more time in space than the United States before the Apollo Program. The Soviet Union put the first satellite in orbit in October 1957 named Sputnik 1. They also put the first animal in space in Sputnik 2, and were the first country to safely bring back an animal from space in Sputnik 5. Yuri Gagrin was the first man to orbit the Earth in Vostok 1, who was also from the Soviet Union. Sibrel believes that since the Soviet Union was so far ahead of the United States in the Moon race, the United States had to fake the landings to win.\n\nOn January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 caught fire and killed 3 astronauts. Two years later, NASA said that the problems which caused the fire were fixed. Bart Sibrel believes that the problems could not be fixed, so NASA decided to fake the landings to win the Moon race. \n\nNASA says that the Soviet Union's achievements were not as impressive as the United States. Before Apollo 7, the USSR made 9 spaceflights, while the U.S. had made 16. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. had 7 more spaceflights than the USSR, and 600 more hours in space. Apollo 7 launched in October 1968, 21 months after the Apollo 1 fire, with an astronaut on board. By Apollo 11, the Uninted States' lead was even bigger.\n\nBoth the United States and the USSR had many problems during the Moon race. The USSR had the first in-flight death in 1967, only 3 months after the Apollo 1 fire. According to NASA, most of the accomplishments first made by the USSR were also made by the US within a year. By 1965, the US started to beat the USSR to a few important steps. The USSR never developed a rocket which could land on the Moon, and they never tested landing on the Moon with an astronaut on board. \"\n\nSome conspiracy theorists say that the Moon rocks collected by the Apollo Program are actually meteorites from Antarctica. Wernher von Braun, the Marshall Space Flight Center Director, and three others traveled to Antarctica in 1967 (three years before the Apollo launch) to explore for future space missions. Some conspiracy theorists believe that Braun collected meteorites during this trip to use as fake moon rocks. \n\nThe Apollo Program collected of moon rocks during the Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 missions. According to scientists around the world, these rocks are very different from meteorites and other rocks found on Earth. The rocks are also 200,000,000 years older than any rock found on Earth, and are similar to moon rocks later brought back by the USSR.\n\nSome moon rocks could have been collected without landing on the moon, but the first moon rock was found on Earth in 1979, and it was only discovered in 1982 that it came from the moon. Also, moon rocks are very rare on Earth, and only 30 kilograms have ever been discovered, while the Apollo missions brought back 382 kilograms.\n\nIn 2004, Martin Hendry and Ken Skeldon from the University of Glasgow investigated the 'Moon Hoax'. In November 2004, they spoke at the Glasgow Science Centre and examined the top ten lines of evidence that a hoax had taken place. \n\nSome conspiracy theorists say that some astronauts were killed as part of a cover up. In a television program about the conspiracy theory, Fox Entertainment Group listed 10 astronauts and 2 others who conspiracy theorists said were killed.\n\n\nAll the deaths except for Irwin's were related to their job with NASA or the Air Force. Mike Adams and Robert Lawrence were not involved with the civilian space program. James Irwin already had several heart attacks before his death. All except two of the deaths happened at least one or two years \"before\" Apollo 11. Also, Brian Welch was speaking out \"against\" the moon hoax, so he would not have been a good target to be killed.\n\nAs of July 2015, eight of the twelve astronauts who landed on the Moon are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin.\n\n\n", "id": "197058", "title": "Moon landing conspiracy theory"}

It was famous during the years of Jacksonian democracy. It is thought to be important to the Second Party System. Operating from 1833 to 1856, the party was formed opposing the policies of President Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. The Whigs supported the importance of Congress over the importance of the executive branch. They favored a program of modernization. Their name was chosen to tell people about the American Whigs of 1776, who fought for independence. \"Whig\" was then a widely recognized label of choice for people who saw themselves as opposing autocratic rule. The Whig Party had national leaders as Daniel Webster, William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay of Kentucky. The Whig Party also had four war heroes among them, such as Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Abraham Lincoln was a Whig leader in frontier Illinois.\n\nIn its over two decades of existence, the Whig Party saw two of its candidates, Harrison and Taylor, elected president. Both, died in office. John Tyler became president after Harrison's death, but was thrown out from the party. Millard Fillmore, who became president after Taylor's death, was the last Whig to hold the nation's highest office.\n\nThe party was ultimately destroyed by the question of whether to allow the expansion of slavery to the territories. The anti-slavery faction successfully prevented the nomination of its own incumbent President Fillmore in the 1852 presidential election. Instead, the party nominated General Winfield Scott, who was defeated. Its leaders quit politics (as Lincoln did temporarily) or changed parties. The voter base defected to the Republican Party, various coalition parties in some states, and to the Democratic Party. By the 1856 presidential election, the party had lost its ability to maintain a national coalition of effective state parties and endorsed Millard Fillmore, now of the American Party, at its last national convention.\n", "id": "197062", "title": "Whig Party (United States)"}

They were tried in the village of Samlesbury in Lancashire. Their trial on 19 August 1612 was one of a series of witch trials held over two days. It is among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England at that time for two reasons. First, Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, wrote about it in his \"The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster\". Secondly, the number of people found guilty and hanged was high, ten at Lancaster and another at York. However, the three Samlesbury women were found not guilty of witchcraft.some of the accused were burned alive and hung.\n\nThe three women were Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. A 14 year old girl, Grace Sowerbutts, had said they used witchcraft. The women were accused of murdering children, and of cannibalism, amongst other things. In contrast, other people tried at the same time were accused of \"maleficium\", that is causing harm by witchcraft. This included the Pendle witches. The case against the three women collapsed \"spectacularly\" when the main witness, Grace Sowerbutts, was shown by the trial judge to be \"the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest\".\n\nMany historians, notably Hugh Trevor-Roper, have said that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th century were a result of the religious struggles of the period. During this time, both the Catholic and Protestant Churches wanted to stamp out what they saw as heresy. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as \"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\". A trial would show that Lancashire, a wild and lawless area, was being cleared not only of witches but also of \"popish plotters\", that is, Catholics.\n\nKing James I, came to the English throne in 1603. James was influenced by the strict Scottish Reformation very much. He was very interested in witchcraft. By the early 1590s, he was convinced that Scottish witches plotted against him. His 1597 book, \"Daemonologie\", he told his followers that they must report and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. In 1604 a new witchcraft law was made, called \"An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits\". Anyone who caused harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes would be given the death penalty. James was, did not believe some of the evidence presented in witch trials, he even personally showed discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.\n\nThe accused witches lived in Lancashire. At the end of the 16th century, the government thought this county was a wild and lawless area, \"fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people\". Since the death of Queen Mary and the coming to the throne of her half-sister Elizabeth in 1558, Catholic priests had been forced to hide, but in remote areas like Lancashire they were still able to celebrate mass in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to make a list of the recusants in their area—those who refused to attend the services of the Church of England, which was a criminal offence at that time.\n\nDuring the 16th century English Reformation, the Church of England broke away from the rule of the pope and the Catholic Church. This event split up the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family until his death in 1595, was a leading recusant. He had been arrested many times for not giving up his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did join the Church of England, for which his father disinherited him. The rest of the family stayed strictly Catholic.\n\nOne of the accused witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations father and son were not polite; John Singleton, said that the father would not even go passed his son's house if he could keep clear of it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (born Jane Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. John had died only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and she had seven children.\n\nOn 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, who lived just outside the Lancashire village of Fence, near Pendle Hill, met John Law, a pedlar from Halifax. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon had to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30 March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell sent Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for \"maleficium\"—causing harm by witchcraft.\n\nOther Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowell's discovery of witchcraft in the county. On 15 April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury. As a result, eight individuals were sent to trial, including Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley. They were said to have used witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts, Jennet's grand-daughter and Ellen's niece.\n\nThe trial was held on 19 August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley, a judge seeking promotion to a circuit nearer London. He may have wanted to impress King James, the head of the judiciary. Before the trial, Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury, with a warning about their future conduct. Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley were said to have used \"diverse devillish and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts\", to which they pleaded not guilty. Fourteen-year-old Grace was the chief prosecution witness.\n\nGrace was the first to give evidence. She said that both her grandmother and aunt, Jennet and Ellen Bierley, were able to change themselves into dogs and that they had \"haunted and vexed her\" for years. She also said that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair. They had also tried to make her drown herself. Grace said the women had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood. Grace said the child died the next night and after its burial at Samlesbury Church, Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home. The women then cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that let them change themselves into other shapes.\n\nGrace also said that her grandmother and aunt, with Jane Southworth, went to sabbats held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank, on the north shore of the River Ribble. At those secret meetings they met with \"foure black things, going upright, and yet not like men in the face\", with whom they ate, danced, and had sex.\n\nThomas Walshman, the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused, was the next to give evidence. He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one-year-old. He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his father's barn on about 15 April, and did not recover until the following day. Two other witnesses, John Singleton and William Alker, confirmed that Sir John Southworth, Jane Southworth's father-in-law, had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived, as he believed Jane to be an \"evil woman, and a Witch\".\n\nThomas Potts, the clerk, wrote that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they \"humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares\", and \"desired him [Bromley] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts\". Immediately \"the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed\"; the witnesses \"began to quarrel and accuse one another\", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a Jesuit priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them, but none could offer any reason other than that each of them \"goeth to the [Anglican] Church\".\n\nAfter the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty, stating that:\n\nPotts finished his book with the words: \"Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open\".\n\nAlmost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was told to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, and said it was \"truly reported\" and \"fit and worthie to be published\". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts \"seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports\".\n\nIn his introduction to the trial, Potts writes; \"Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury.\" Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but he had yet to deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence \"by special order and commandment\", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his \"masterful exposure\" of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches.\n\nPotts declares that \"this Countie of Lancashire ... now may lawfully bee said to abound asmuch in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists\", and describes the three accused women as having once been \"obstinate Papists, and now came to Church\". The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James, the head of the judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the \"two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire\". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to \"smoke out its Jesuit chaplain\", Christopher Southworth.\n\nThe English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one, with only one really mass witchhunt, that of Matthew Hopkins in East Anglia during 1645. That one incident accounted for more than 20% of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period \"revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of ... evil-doing\", for which evidence had to be provided.\nPotts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies which existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people, who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept familiars, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment \"I would know by what means any Priest can maintaine this point of Evidence\". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with \"foure black things ... not like men in the face\", with the comment that \"The Seminarie [priest] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had a very good face, and was a proper man.\"\n\nIt is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been \"largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda\", or even a \"show-trial\", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of \"popish plotters\".\n\nBromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for \"collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years\". Jane Southworth's eldest son, Thomas, eventually inherited his grandfather's estate of Samlesbury Hall.\n\n\n", "id": "197100", "title": "Samlesbury witches"}

This makes it easier for blood and oxygen to get to the brain (because the blood does not have to work against gravity to get up to the brain, like it would if the person were standing). Lying down will also make sure that the person does not hurt themselves by falling if they faint.\n\nDoctors can treat hypotension by treating whatever is causing the low blood pressure. Sometimes, low blood pressure is caused by dehydration. This can be treated by having the patient eat more salt, drink more fluids, or (in serious cases) get fluids through a needle placed into a vein.\n\nIf low blood pressure is caused by medicines, doctors can change those medications to others that do not lower blood pressure as much.\n\nThere are also medications that increase blood pressure. They work by making it harder for blood vessels to relax. (When blood vessels relax, blood pressure goes down. If the blood vessels cannot relax as easily, blood pressure goes up.)\n\n", "id": "197270", "title": "Hypotension"}

With a race condition, the result of a calculation or the behaviour of the system as a whole is dependent on how long a certain calculation takes, or when it is started. Race conditions occur in logic circuits and computer software, especially with multi-threaded or distributed systems.\n\nIt is often difficult to explain what a race condition is, but the metaphor of a horse race can be used as an explanation.\n\nA computer program is like a horse race. The computer program does several things at the same time, similarly to how several horses run at the same time in a horse race. Each horse represents what is usually called a \"thread of execution\". That way, one such thread may handle network communication, another one may be responsible for redrawing the user interface. In the case of a race condition, the application works properly if a given horse \"wins the race\". For example, the application may work if horse number five wins, but it will crash if any other horse wins the race. One solution to the problem is to use synchronization. This is like several jockeys teaming up, to make sure horse number five is ahead. \n\nOn different computers, or in different situations, computers programs can run at different speeds. Sometimes, they will be faster, other times slower. This may mean that on some systems, the race condition will never show up, even though it may be easy to show it on others. Race conditions can be difficult to find. Bugs caused by race conditions are a frequent source of frustration within the profession of software development.\n", "id": "197282", "title": "Race condition"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197296", "text": "Don Carlos\n\nDon Carlos is an opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi. It was composed to a libretto in the French language by Camille du Locle and Joseph Méry. It was based on a famous German play called \"Don Carlos, Infante of Spain\" by Friedrich Schiller. Schiller’s story is based on the true story of the life of Carlos, Prince of Asturias (1545-1568) who was promised that he could marry Elisabeth of Valois, but then his father,Philip II of Spain, changed his mind and married her himself. It was part of the peace treaty ending the Italian War of 1551-1559 between the Houses of Habsburg and Valois. \n\nThe opera was first performed at the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris on 11 March 1867. It has five acts. \n\nDon Carlos was written for performance in Paris. This has made a problem for the reputation of the opera, because it was tradition in France to write very long operas. They always included a lot of ballet music as well as the singing. Verdi’s opera was in five acts, and when it was performed in other countries it was too long for people’s tastes, so many cuts were made, including, at first, the whole of Act I. This is a great pity, because a lot of the music in Act One is very important, with tunes which also come later in the opera. Since the beginning of the 20th century most of the music of Act I is usually performed. There have been many different versions performed, with different parts of the opera cut. When the opera is sung in Italian it is called \"Don Carlo\".\n\nThe story takes place at a time when Spain is just coming to the end of a war with France. It has been agreed between the two countries that Don Carlos, heir to the Spanish throne, will marry Elisabeth, the daughter of the King of France.\n\nDon Carlos wants to see the girl he is to marry. He goes to France and, secretly, joins a royal hunt in which Elisabeth is taking part. Elisabeth and her page are separated from the others. Carlos speaks to her and offers to take her home. The princess asks him about the prince she is to marry. Carlos says that she need not worry because the prince is kind and in love with her. He then shows Elisabeth a photo of the prince, and then Elisabeth of course realizes that it is the prince she is talking to. They sing a love duet.\n\nSome Spanish officials then come and tell Elisabeth that it has been decided that she is not to marry the prince: she is to marry his father, the king of Spain. The two lovers are dismayed at this news. The crowd of people beg Elisabeth to agree to marrying the King of Spain, so that the war will stop. In the end she agrees.\n\nDon Carlos has gone to a monastery so that he can be quiet in his misery. His grandfather, Charles V, had spent his last days in this monastery. A monk talks to him. Carlos thinks the monk looks like his grandfather.\n\nCarlos is filled with joy when his friend Rodrigue comes. He has just come back from Flanders, where there is still a lot of fighting. Carlos tells him a secret: that he is in love with Elisabeth who has now married his father and is therefore Queen of Spain. Rodrigue tells him he should spend his time helping the poor people of Flanders. The King and Queen process past the tomb.\n\nWhen the Queen leaves the church she goes to the garden where her ladies are waiting for her. A messenger gives her a letter from her mother in Paris, but at the same time he secretly gives her a letter from Carlos. Rodrigue quietly talks to Eboli, the queen’s lady-in-waiting, while the queen reads the letters. Rodrigue asks the Queen to try to persuade the king to let Carlos talk to him. Eboli is in love with Carlos. She has noticed how Carlos has been agitated when he has been in the presence of the Queen, and thinks it is because Carlos loves her (Eboli).\n\nCarlos is given a chance to meet Elisabeth privately. He calmly asks her whether she could persuade the King to send him to Flanders. However, he is not really calm, and soon he starts to be angry with her for not showing any love feelings towards him. She tells him that it is her duty now that she is Queen. Carlos understands, but is still in love with her. He falls at her feet. He grabs her and declares his love for her, but the Queen tears herself from him and he rushes off in despair.\n\nThe Kings comes out of church. He is very cross that his wife has been left on her own. He tells the lady-in-waiting to go away. The Queen comforts her. Then she and her ladies go.\n\nRodrigue asks the King to stop fighting the people of Flanders who are still dying and starving from hunger. The King says they were not faithful and deserve to be punished. He tells Rodrigue that he is afraid of what is going on between Elisabeth and Carlos. He tells him to be aware of the Inquisition.\n\nA masked ball is taking place at the palace in Madrid. Carlos is waiting in the Queen’s garden. A lady comes to the garden, wearing a mask, like everyone else. He thinks it is the Queen and tells her how he loves her. When the lady takes her mask off he realizes it is Eboni. She accuses him of loving the Queen. At that moment Rodrigue comes. He says to Eboni that Carlos is not well and does not understand what he is talking about. But Eboni is not deceived and plans to ruin their love affair.\n\nThe second scene of the act takes place in a square in Madrid. An auto-da-fé is being prepared. During the time of the Spanish Inquisition this was a ceremony in which anyone who did not agree with the Roman Catholic church was burnt to death. Monks enter, followed by the unfortunate people who are going to be burnt. The people sing about the glories of Spain. King Philippe appears and repeats how he will fight against anyone who is an enemy of the Roman Catholic Church. Six people, including Carlos, appear and fling themselves at his feet, begging him to stop his troops from killing the Flemish people. The King will not hear of it. Some of the crowd support the king, but others are begging him to have mercy. Carlos then asks his father to allow him to rule Flanders for him. The King does not allow this, because he realizes that this could be an opportunity for Carlos and the Flemish people to rise against him. Carlos is desperate. He draws his sword and says that he will save Flanders. The crowd are terrified to see him behave like this in front of the King. The King commands his soldiers to take the sword away from Carlos, but no one obeys him. In the end, Rodrigue (who realizes that this is going to be bad for him) saves the situation by calmly asking Carlos for the sword. He hands it over and Rodrigue gives it to the King. The monks process farther, and a voice from heaven promises peace in the world to come.\n\nThe King is alone in church. In a wonderful aria he sings of his sadness that his wife does not seem to love him. The Grand Inquisitor comes in. He is very old, and blind. The King tells him about his son, and asks the Inquisitor whether Carlos should be forgiven or sentenced to death. The Inquisitor answers that it is Rodrigue who should be killed. The king dares to disagree. The Inquisitor tells the King that he is not giving his heart to God. The Inquisitor goes.\n\nThe Queen rushes in and asks the King to help her look for a casket of jewels which have disappeared from her room. The King shows her that it is on the table. He tells her she must open it. She does so. At the top is a portrait of Carlos. The King is very angry and accuses her of adultery. She faints. The King calles Eboli and Rodrigue for help. The King feels sorry for his suspicion, but Eboli feels even more sorry because it was she who had taken the casket because she was jealous of Carlos and Elisabeth. It was she who had suggested the King should look in the jewel case. Rodrigue feels he can only save his friend by offering himself to be killed instead of Carlos. The King and Rodrigue leave. Eboni throws herself at the feet of the Queen, who has now revived, and confesses that she herself is guilty of adultery because she had slept with the king. Elisabeth remains calm, but tells Eboni to go away from her for ever and to live in a nunnery. When Eboni is left alone she expresses her feelings of terribly misery. Before she goes to the nunnery she has one more thing to do: to try to save Carlos from being put to death.\n\nThe second scene of the act shows Carlos in prison. Rodrigue comes to him. He knows that Flemish letters addressed to Carlos have been found in his possession. Someone comes in and kills Rodrigue. As he dies, he tells Carlos that the Queen will wait for him the next day outside the nunnery and will see him for the last time. He dies.\n\nSometimes Act IV ends here, but some performances continue to show a scene in which the King tries to give the sword back to his son, but Carlos accuses him of having murdered his friend. A group of people, including Eboli, enter the prison and cry to the King to set Carlos free. The Inquisitor appears. He tells the crowd angrily that they are wicked to go against God’s will. He tells them all to go down on their knees and repent.\n\nElisabeth kneels before the tomb of Charles V. She sings of her lost youth in France (some of the music from Act I comes back here). She prays for peace. Elisabeth and Carlos then meet for the last time (their third duet in the opera) and wish for happier times. The King and the Inquisitor have been hiding. They now appear and grab Carlos. The guards are told to grab him, but Carlos defends himself. Suddenly the voice of Charles V (or a monk in disguise) is heard. He takes his grandson into the safety of the cloister.\n\nDon Carlos is a great opera. It has some of Verdi’s greatest music, especially the music of Act IV scene i, in which the events of the previous acts are all brought together. There are some wonderful duets (three duets for Carlos and Elisabeth) and some great bass arias. However, the opera is very long, but it is difficult to cut any of the singing without spoiling the drama.\n\nSome people feel that the end of the opera is weak. In Schiller’s play there is a different ending. Carlos is handed over to the Inquisition and put to death.\n\n", "id": "197296", "title": "Don Carlos"}

It is different to fossil fuels from long dead biological material. Biofuel can be in forms of solid, liquid or gas. \n\nBiofuels are usually used to power cars, heat homes and for cooking. Biofuel companies are mainly from Europe, Asia and the Americas. Technologies developed at the Los Alamos National Lab even allows pollution to be converted into renewable biofuel. Agrofuels are biofuels that are produced from specific plants, rather than from waste processes such as landfill or recycled material. \n\nThere are two common ways to convert plants into gas and liquid fuels. One is to grow crops that are high in sugar (e.g. Sugar cane) or starch (e.g. corn), and then use yeast to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The second is to grow plants that contain high amounts of vegetable oil, such as palm oil, soybean and algae. When these oils are heated, their viscosity is reduced, and they can be burned directly in a diesel engine, or they can be chemically processed to produce fuels such as biodiesel. Wood and its by-products can also be converted into biofuels such as charcoal, woodgas, methanol or ethanol fuel. It is also possible to make cellulosic ethanol from non-edible plant parts, but this can be expensive.\n\nSolid biomass is also used. Firewood has been used for thousands of years. Many materials such as wood and grasses can be dried and pelletised and burnt, and this can be used to produce power.\n\n", "id": "197436", "title": "Biofuel"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197572", "text": "Ella Fitzgerald\n\nElla Jane Fitzgerald (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996), was an American jazz singer. She was called \"Lady Ella\", the \"Queen of Jazz\", and the \"First Lady of Song\".\n\nHer voice spanned three octaves. She could sing very high notes and very low notes. She was famous for her scat singing. She won 14 Grammy Awards. She was awarded the National Medal of Art and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nElla Fitzgerald was born in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, United States to William and Temperance \"Tempie\" Fitzgerald. Soon after Ella was born, her parents separated. She went to live in Yonkers, New York with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. In 1923, Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born. When she was a child, Fitzgerald lived in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, the Bronx.\n\nAs a youngster, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer. She loved listening to jazz music by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She especially liked the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, \"My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it...I tried so hard to sound just like her.\"\n\nIn 1932, Fitzgerald's mother died. Ella began doing badly at school. At one time, she had a job as a lookout at a brothel and a job with some people with Mafia connections. She got into trouble with the police, and was sent to a reform school. She escaped from the reformatory, and for a time was homeless.\n\nFitzgerald had her first job as a singer when she was 17 on November 21, 1934 at the Harlem Opera House in Harlem, New York. She was able to compete in one of its famous \"Amateur Nights\". At first she was going to go on stage and dance but, intimidated by some local dancers, she decided to sing instead. She won the first prize of US$25 singing Connee Boswell's \"Judy\" and \"The Object of My Affection\".\n\nIn January 1935, Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. She met a drummer and bandleader called Chick Webb here. Webb had already hired a singer called Charlie Linton to work with the band. According to \"The New York Times\", Webb was \"reluctant to sign her...because she was gawky and unkempt, a \"diamond in the rough.\"\" Webb let her try singing with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.\n\nFitzgerald began singing often with Webb's Orchestra during 1935, at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. She recorded several hit songs with them, including \"Love and Kisses\" and \"(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)\". In 1938 she co-wrote and sang a version of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\". After this, she started getting famous.\n\nChick Webb died on June 16, 1939, and his band was renamed \"Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra\". Fitzgerald became the bandleader. She recorded nearly 150 sides during her time with the orchestra.\n\nIn 1942, Fitzgerald left the band and began to work as a solo singer. She was signed to the Decca label, and she had several popular hit songs. She recording with other musicians like the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys.\n\nDecca's Milt Gabler became her manager and she began working often for the jazz producer Norman Granz. She often sang in his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. Then, Granz became her manager, but he did not record her on any of his record labels for nearly a decade.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, after the swing era, and the end of the great touring big bands, jazz music became quite different. A new kind of jazz called bebop became popular and Fitzgerald changed her style of singing. She worked with Dizzy Gillespie's big band and started including scat singing as a big part of her performances. About singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald said, \"I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing.\"\n\nHer 1945 scat recording of \"Flying Home\" was later described by \"The New York Times\" as \"one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade...Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.\" Her be-bop recording of \"Oh, Lady be Good!\" (1947) was also very popular, and made people think of her as one of the most important jazz singers.\n\nGranz did not like some of the music Fitzgerald was given at this time, so during her last years on the Decca label she recorded some duets with pianist Ellis Larkins, released in 1950 as \"Ella Sings Gershwin\".\n\nIn 1955, Fitzgerald left Decca, and joined Granz's new record label, Verve Records. She said later, \"I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop. I thought be-bop was 'it', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman...felt that I should do other things, so he produced \"The Cole Porter Songbook\" with me. It was a turning point in my life.\"\n\nA new album, \"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook\", was released in 1956. It was the first of eight multi-album \"Songbook\" sets that she would record for Verve between 1956 and 1964. Many of the songs were standards and Fitzgerald tried to cross over into a non-jazz audience.\n\n\"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook\" was the only \"Songbook\" on which the composer of the songs also played with her. Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, who had worked together for a long time, both played on half the set's 38 tracks, and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\", and a musical piece about Fitzgerald (the only \"Songbook\" track that Fitzgerald does not sing on).\n\nThe \"Songbook\" series became the Fitzgerald's most critically acclaimed and popular work. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1996, \"These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.\"\n\nElla Fitzgerald also recorded albums of the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin in 1972 and 1983. The albums were called \"Ella Loves Cole\" and \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\". A later album of songs by a single composer was released when she was with Pablo Records, \"Ella Abraça Jobim\", with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim.\n\nWhile she was recording the \"Songbooks\" and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, with Norman Granz. Granz helped her to become one of the most important live jazz performers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Fitzgerald became the first African-American to perform at the Mocambo (a Hollywood nightclub), after Marilyn Monroe had persuaded the owner to make the booking. This was very important in Fitzgerald's career. The event was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer which is to receive a production in London's West End from November 2009.\n\nSome live albums on Verve that she recorded are well thought of by critics: \"Ella at the Opera House\", \"\" and \"\".\n\nIn later life, Fitzgerald kept a busy concert schedule, but her health worsened. She had heart surgery in 1986. She had diabetes, which accounted for her failing eyesight. Her diabetes worsened, and both legs were cut off (amputated) below the knees. She never completely recovered. She was unable to perform often. She spent time with family. Fitzgerald died in her Beverly Hills, California home on June 15, 1996. She was interred in the Sunset Mission Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\nBy the 1990s, Fitzgerald had recorded more than 200 songs. In 1991, she gave her final concert at Carnegie Hall. She had performed there 26 times. She received numerous awards. In 1979, she received Kennedy Center Honors. In 1987, she received the National Medal of Arts. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. France presented her with the Commander of Arts and Letters award. Yale University, Dartmouth, and other schools awarded her honorary doctorates. Several of Fitzgerald's awards, significant personal possessions, and documents were given to the Smithsonian Institution, the library of Boston University, the Library of Congress, and the Schoenberg Library at UCLA.\n\nIn 1941, Fitzgerald married Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer. The marriage was annulled after two years. In December 1947, she married double bass player Ray Brown. They adopted a child of Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named him Ray Brown, Jr.. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953.\n\nIn July 1957, Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in Oslo. The affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman.\n", "id": "197572", "title": "Ella Fitzgerald"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197616", "text": "Billie Holiday\n\nBillie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter. She was also called \"Lady Day\", a nickname that her friend and musical partner Lester Young gave her. Holiday was a very important influence on jazz and pop singing. The way that she sang was similar to the way jazz musicians played their instruments. She was admired for her very personal and intimate way of singing. Critic John Bush wrote that she \"changed the art of American pop vocals forever.\"\n\nShe co-wrote some songs which have become jazz standards, like \"God Bless the Child\", \"Don't Explain\", and \"Lady Sings the Blues\". She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by other people, like \"Easy Living\" and \"Strange Fruit\".\n\nHoliday was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1915, a Roman Catholic. She had a difficult childhood, which affected her life and career. Not much is known about her early life, but there are stories about it in her autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues\", which was published in 1956. Later, it was found out that some parts of this book were wrong.\nHoliday got her pseudonym, or stage name, from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, the man who was probably her father. At the beginning of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", but then changed it back to \"Holiday\" (they are pronounced the same, 'Hahliday', in American English).\n\nPeople have never been sure who Holiday's father was. This is because her birth certificate said her father was called Frank DeViese. Some people now think that this was a mistake that somebody made when she was born.\n\nHoliday's mother was called Sadie Fagan. Fagan became pregnant when she was 13 years old. Her parents threw her out of her home in Baltimore, and she went to Philadelphia where her daughter Eleanora (Billie Holiday) was born. Fagan moved back to Baltimore and married Clarence Holiday, who was probably her baby's father, but they later divorced. When she was 10 years old, Holiday often missed school. When she said that she had been raped, she was sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school. She was allowed out two years later, with the help of a family friend. Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. In 1929 Holiday's mother saw a neighbor, Wilbert Rich, raping Holiday. Rich was sentenced to three months in jail. But after her incident as a rape victim she was still constantly raped by drunk men in her neighborhood. She almost got pregnant by a drunk man walking down their street.\n\nHoliday later said that in 1930 she worked as a prostitute in a brothel, and was imprisoned for a short time for solicitation (prostitution). In the 1930s in Harlem, New York City, she started singing for tips in night clubs, and got a job at Pod's and Jerry's, a famous Harlem jazz club. In 1933 she was working at a club called Monette's. She was discovered by a talent scout called John Hammond.\n\nHammond helped Holiday to record her first songs in November 1933 with Benny Goodman: \"Your Mother's Son-In-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch\". In 1935 she recorded more songs with a group led by pianist Teddy Wilson. They recorded \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown To You\".\n\nTeddy Wilson was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record pop songs in the new 'swing' style for jukeboxes. They were allowed to improvise the music. Holiday was very good at improvising the melody line to fit the emotions.\n\nHoliday also wrote songs during the 1930s, like \"Billie's Blues\", \"Tell Me More (And Then Some)\", \"Everything Happens For The Best\", \"Our Love Is Different\", and \"Long Gone Blues\".\n\nA tenor saxophonist called Lester Young often accompanied Holiday. He had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and she got on well with him. Young gave her a nickname, \"Lady Day\" and she called him \"Prez.\" She spent three months working at Clark Monroe's Uptown House in New York in 1937. In the late 1930s, she also worked as a big band singer with Count Basie and Artie Shaw. She was one of the first black women to work with a white orchestra (Artie Shaw's).\n\nIn the 1930s, Holiday was recording for Columbia Records. She heard of a song called \"Strange Fruit\". It was based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. The poem had been set to music and was performed at teachers' union meetings. It was heard by a night club owner called Barney Josephson and he told Holiday about it. She sang the song at Josephson's club in 1939. At first she was worried that it might make people angry. She later said that the song reminded her of her father's death, and that this was partly why she did not want to perform it at first. In a 1958 interview, she also said that many people did not understand what the song meant: \"They'll ask me to sing that sexy song about the people swinging\", she said.\n\nThe music producers at Columbia Records thought that subject of the song (the lynching of black people) might upset people. A music producer called Milt Gabler said that Holiday could record it for his label called Commodore Records. That was done in April 1939 and Holiday sang \"Strange Fruit\" over the next twenty years. The song did not get played on the radio but still sold well. Gabler said that this was because the other side of the record was \"Fine and Mellow\", which was a jukebox hit. Later, she recorded \"Strange Fruit\" again for Verve.\n\nIn 1944, Holiday went to work, still with Milt Gabler, at Decca Records. She was 29 years old. Her first songs for Decca were called \"Lover Man\" and \"No More\". \"Lover Man\" was a song written for her. It is about a woman who has never known love, and it became one of her biggest hits.\nIn November 1944, Holiday recorded three songs, \"That Ole Devil Called Love\", \"Big Stuff\", and \"Don't Explain\". Holiday wrote \"Don't Explain\" after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar. After that, Holiday didn't record any songs until August 1945. She recorded, \"Don't Explain\", \"Big Stuff\", \"You Better Go Now\", and \"What is This Thing Called Love?\". In 1946, she recorded songs called \"No Good Man\" and \"Good Morning Heartache\", \"The Blues Are Brewin\", and \"Guilty\". In February 1947, Holiday recorded two hits, \"There Is No Greater Love\" and \"Deep Song\". She also recorded \"Solitude\" and \"Easy Living\", songs that she had recorded with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s.\n\nHoliday's next recording was after she came out of prison in 1948. She recorded this time with a vocal group called the Stardusters. She recorded \"Weep No More\" and \"Girls Were Made to Take Care of Boys\". She was worried that people wouldn't like the recordings and recorded two more songs without the group, \"My Man\" and Gershwin's \"I Loves You Porgy\". These became very popular.\n\nThe next year, Billie had more hits. She sang a version of Bessie Smith's, song \"T'Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do\", \"Gimme A Pigfoot (And A Bottle of Beer)\", \"Do Your Duty\", and \"Keeps on Rainin'\", to her lush \"You're My Thrill\" and \"Crazy He Calls Me\". She also recorded a song that she wrote called \"Somebody's On My Mind\".\n\nIn her last recording in 1950, she recorded two songs. Both of them were backed by strings, horns, and a choir. She recorded her own \"God Bless the Child\" and \"This is Heaven to Me\".\n\nIn 1947, Holiday was in a film with Louis Armstrong called \"New Orleans\". The musical drama film featured Holiday singing with Armstrong and his band and was directed by Arthur Lubin. Holiday was not pleased that she had to play a maid. In her autobiography she said:\n\"I thought I was going to play myself in it. I thought I was going to be Billie Holiday doing a couple of songs in a nightclub setting and that would be that. I should have known better. When I saw the script, I did. You just tell one Negro girl who's made movies who didn't play a maid or a whore. I don't know any. I found out I was going to do a little singing, but I was still playing the part of a maid.\"\nHoliday was also in the 1950 Universal-International short film \"'Sugar Chile' Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet\", where she sang \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Now, Baby or Never\".\nOn May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for the possession of narcotics and drugs in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she had to go to court. Holiday pleaded guilty (admitted that she had the drugs) and was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday said she never \"sang a note\" at Alderson even though people wanted her to. She was released early (March 16, 1948) because of her good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, everybody was there to welcome her back, including her pianist Bobby Tucker.\n\nHer manager Ed Fishman thought of the idea to have a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday was worried at first because she thought that nobody would want her back, but she decided do it. On March 27, 1948, the Carnegie concert was very successful. She did sang songs like Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and \"Strange Fruit\". The concert was not recorded.\n\nHoliday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, at a hotel in San Francisco.\n\nHoliday said that she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She had married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. When she was still married to Monroe, she started a romantic relationship with trumpeter Joe Guy, who was also her drug dealer. She lived with him as his wife (called a common law wife) and divorced Monroe in 1947. She also separated from Guy. After of she was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs in 1947, she was not allowed to work in clubs in New York for the rest of her life. The only time she was able to was when she sang at the Ebony Club in 1948, where she had the permission of John Levy.\n\nIn the 1950s, Holiday's health became bad, because of her drinking alcohol, using drugs and her relationships with abusive men. Her voice became rough, but some people say that her singing became more emotional.\n\nOn March 28, 1952, Holiday married Louis McKay, a man who worked for the Mafia. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her to stop using drugs. They later separated.\n\nOn November 10, 1956, she performed two concerts before big audiences at Carnegie Hall. \n\nHoliday went on tour Europe for the first time in 1954 with Buddy DeFranco and Red Norvo. When she went back to Europe, almost five years later, she went on television for Granada's \"Chelsea at Nine\", in London. This was one of the last times she was on television. Her last studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's \"Lady in Satin\" album \nin 1958. The MGM recordings were released after Holiday's death on an album called \"Last Recordings\". \n\nHoliday's autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues\", was published in 1956. It was ghostwritten by William Dufty, a \"New York Post\" writer and editor who was married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty. He wrote the book quickly after talking to Holiday in his apartment, as well as using earlier interviewers. His wanted to let Holiday tell her story her way.\n\nHoliday never had any children of her own, but had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather, daughter of Leonard Feather, and Bevan Dufty, son of William Dufty.\n\nOn May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to the Metropolitan Hospital in New York. She had liver and heart disease. Police officers were at the door to her room. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying and her hospital room was raided by the police. They kept guarding her at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959. In the last years of her life, she had gradually lost her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 in cash.\n\n\n \n", "id": "197616", "title": "Billie Holiday"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197631", "text": "Nina Simone\n\nNina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger and civil rights activist. Simone did not like people to classify her music, or say what genre it fell into, but people often call her a jazz musician. She was often called \"The High Priestess of Soul\".\n\nNina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina in 1933. She was one of eight children in a poor family. She began playing the piano when she was age of three. The first song she learned was \"God be With You, Till we Meet Again\" and she played at her local church. Her first concert was a classical piano recital, when she was twelve. Her parents sat on the front row to watch her, but were made to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. Simone said she would not to play until her parents were moved back to the front. She remembered this event later when she got involved with the civil rights movement.\n\nSimone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon was a strict Methodist minister. Her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman, and sometimes a barber, who was often ill. Mrs. Waymon worked as a maid and her employer, hearing of Simone's talent, gave them money for piano lessons. After that, a local fund was made to help in carrying on her education. When she was 17, Simone moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nShe found more racism here when she applied for a scholarship at a local college. She had to take a test, and passed it, but she was not given the scholarship. When she asked the examiner why she was not given a scholarship, the examiner told her \"because you're black.\"\n\nAfter this, Simone became very passionate about the civil rights movement. She began to earn money teaching piano and accompanying singers. This money helped her to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. She applied to study piano at the Curtis Institute, but was not successful. She believed that this too was because she was black, and because she was a woman.\n\nSimone played the piano at the Midtown Bar & Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City to earn money for her studying. The owner said that she would only get the job if she would sing as well as play the piano. She did not want her mother to know that she was playing \"the devil's music\", so she started using the stage name Nina Simone. She got \"Nina\" from a nickname given to her by a boyfriend, and \"Simone\" from a French actress called Simone Signoret. Simone played and sang a mixture of jazz, blues and classical music at the bar. She began to get fans. In 1958 she recorded a song called \"I Loves You Porgy\", from \"Porgy and Bess\" by George Gershwin. She had learned the song from a Billie Holiday album, and performed it as a favor for a friend. It became her only \"Billboard\" top 40 success in the United States. Soon, she recorded her first album \"Little Girl Blue\" on Bethlehem Records. Simone never earned money from the album because she sold the rights for $3000, missing out on more than $1 million of royalties.\n\nSimone then signed a contract with the record company Colpix Records and released several studio and live albums. Colpix let her have control over choosing the material that she recorded. Simone made sure she had control and did not really mind whether she had a recording contract or not. She only played pop music to make money for her classical music studies.\n\nIn the 1960s, Simone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 1964, Simone began to work with the Dutch record label Philips. She began to record songs about her African-American origins and racial inequality. She recorded a live album called \"Nina Simone In Concert\" which included the song \"Mississippi Goddam\". It was about the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children. The song was boycotted in some southern states. With \"Old Jim Crow\" on the same album she reacts to the Jim Crow Laws.\n\nAfter that, a civil rights was a common theme in Simone's songs. Simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings, like the Selma to Montgomery marches. She sang a version Billie Holiday's song \"Strange Fruit\" (on \"Pastel Blues\"), a song about the lynching of black men in the South. She also a poem by W. Cuney called \"Images\" on her 1966 album \"Let It All Out\", about the lack of pride in African-American women. Simone wrote \"Four Women\", a song about four different stereotypes of African-American women. It was on her 1966 album \"Wild Is the Wind\"\n\nSimone moved from Philips to RCA Victor in 1967. She sang \"Backlash Blues\", written by her friend Langston Hughes on her first RCA album, \"Nina Simone Sings The Blues\". On \"Silk & Soul\" she recorded Billy Taylor's \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Turning Point\". The 1968 album \"Nuff Said\" has some live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang \"Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)\". This was a song written by her bass player straight after they heard the news of King's death. \n\nTogether with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's unfinished play \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on her 1970 album \"Black Gold\". A studio recording was released as a single, and the song has been covered by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway.\n\nSimone left the United States in September 1970. She flew to Barbados. She thought that her husband and manager, Andrew Stroud, would tell her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud thought that Simone's sudden disappearance (and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring) meant that she wanted a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was also in charge of Simone's income. This meant that after their separation Simone did not know anything about how her business was managed and what she was actually worth. When she came back to the United States, she found out that she was wanted for not paying taxes. She went back to Barbados again to get away from the authorities and prosecution. She stayed in Barbados for quite some time, and had a long affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, persuaded her to go to Liberia in Africa. After that she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands. She went to live in France in 1992.\n\nShe recorded her last album for RCA Records, \"It Is Finished\", during 1974. In 1978 CTI Records owner Creed Taylor persuaded her to record another album, \"Baltimore\". This album got good reviews, but did not make much money. Four years later Simone recorded \"Fodder On My Wings\" on a French record label. During the 1980s Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. She recorded an album there in 1984 called \"Live at Ronnie Scott's\". On stage, Simone often seemed to be haughty and aloof but seemed to enjoy talking to her audiences. In 1987, her 1958 song \"My Baby Just Cares For Me\" was used in an advert for Chanel No. 5 perfume in the UK. After that, the song was released again and it went to number 5 in the UK singles chart, making Simone more popular in the UK. Her autobiography, \"I Put a Spell on You\", was published in 1992 and she recorded her last album, \"A Single Woman,\" in 1993.\n\nIn 1993 Simone went to live near Aix-en-Provence in Southern France. She was ill with breast cancer for several years. She died of the disease in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, Bouches-du-Rhône on April 21, 2003. Her funeral service was attended by singers Miriam Makeba and Patti LaBelle, poet Sonia Sanchez, actor Ossie Davis and hundreds of other people. Elton John sent a flowers with the message \"We were the greatest and I love you\". Simone's ashes were scattered in several African countries. She left behind a daughter, Lisa Celeste, who is now an actress and singer who took on the stage name Simone.\n", "id": "197631", "title": "Nina Simone"}

She was sometimes called \"The Empress of the Blues\" and was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. A lot of people think that she was one of the best singers of her time, and along with Louis Armstrong, she was an important influence on later jazz singers.\n\nIn the 1900 American census, Bessie Smith's mother, Laura Smith, said that Bessie was born in Chachanooga, Tennessee in July 1892. In the census in 1910, her sister, Viola Smith said that Bessie's birthday was April 15, 1894. That is the date that is on all later documents, and was the one that Smith used.\n\nShe was the daughter of Laura and William Smith. William Smith was a laborer and part-time Baptist preacher who died before his daughter was old enough to remember him. By the time she was nine, her mother had died as well, and her older sister Viola had to look after for her sisters and brothers.\n\nTo earn money for their poor family, Smith and her brother Andrew began Busking (performing) on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo. She sang and danced, and he accompanied her on guitar. They liked to perform in front of the White Elephant Saloon in the middle of Chattanooga's African-American community.\n\nIn 1904, Smith's oldest brother, Clarence, ran away from home and joined small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"\n\nIn 1912, Clarence came back to Chattanooga, with the Stokes troupe and helped Smith get an audition. She got a job as a dancer, not a singer, because the company already had a singer called .\n\nBy the early 1920s, Smith starred a musical called \"How Come?\" with Sidney Bechet. The musical went to Broadway. Smith had an argument with the producer of \"How Come?\" and she was replaced by Alberta Hunter. Smith went back to Philadelphia, where she now lived. She met and fell in love with a security guard called Jack Gee. They got married on June 7, 1923. At this time, Smith made her first song recordings with Columbia Records. Her marriage was difficult and both of them had affairs.\n\nSmith became the biggest headliner on the black Theater Owners Booking Association circuit. She ran a show that sometimes had as many as 40 people and made her the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Gee liked the money she was earning, but did not like her show business life. In particular, he did like the fact that Smith was bisexual. In 1929, Smith found out that Gee was having an affair with another performer called Gertrude Saunders. Smith separated from Gee but they never got divorced. Smith went to live with a man called Richard Morgan, as is they were husband and wife. He was an old friend and the uncle of a jazz musician called Lionel Hampton. Smith and Morgan stayed together for the rest of her life.\n\nMa Rainey helped Smith to get better as a performer, but she did not teach her to sing. Smith began started her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theatre. By 1920 she had got a good reputation in the South and along the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nIn 1920, a singer called Mamie Smith recorded a song called \"Crazy Blues,\". This was one of the first blues songs recorded by an African-American singer, and was very popular. The recording industry realised that there were lots of black people who would buy blues records. Smith was signed by Columbia Records in 1923 when the label decided to make a \"race records\" series.\n\nHer first recording, a coupling of \"Gulf Coast Blues\" and \"Downhearted Blues,\" was very popular. Smith became a headliner on the black T.O.B.A. circuit and was its top attraction in the 1920s. She worked very hard, in theatres during the winter, and touring for the rest of the year. She became the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Somebody from Columbia Records gave her a nickname, \"Queen of the Blues\". Soon, the press were calling her the \"Empress of the Blues\".\n\nShe made about 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by other popular musicians like Louis Armstrong, James P. Johnson, Joe Smith, Charlie Green, and Fletcher Henderson.\n\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was seriously injured in a car accident while traveling between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her boyfriend Richard Morgan was driving. People think he might have fallen asleep at the wheel or that he could not tell what speed a slow-moving truck was driving in front of him. Tire marks at the scene showed that Morgan tried to hit the truck by driving around its left side but he hit the back of the truck side-on very fast. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, was hit worst in the crash. Morgan did not have any major injuries. One of the first people to see her after the crash was a doctor. He said that she had a bad injury to her arm which made her lose a lot of blood. She also had bad injuries to the side of her body, and was in shock.\n\nAn ambulance took Smith to Clarksdale's Afro-American Hospital and her right arm was amputated (taken off). She did not wake up and died that morning. After she died, some people said that it was because a hospital for white people would not treat her, but in those days, an amubulance driver would never have taken a black person to a \"Whites only\" hospital at all.\n", "id": "197700", "title": "Bessie Smith"}

It was built by Lockheed's \"Skunk Works\" in the 1960s for the United States Air Force (USAF). In other words, it was a spy plane.\n\nThe Blackbird was designed to fly at more than Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound. This meant it would become very hot during flight. To help with this, most of the aircraft was made of titanium. Radar absorbing material was also used to make the aircraft more difficult to .\n\nSR-71 Blackbird used a special fuel called JP-7. Before the flight, the fuel tanks used to leak. This is because at ground altitude the tolerances (distance between parts of the fuel tank) were larger than at the plane's cruising altitude. Once in the air, because of the speed and air resistance, the parts became very hot. Because of this heat, the distance between the parts shrank stopping the loss of fuel.\n\nThe aircraft also had cameras and radars fitted to take photographs of targets.\n\nThe first Blackbird flight happened on 22 December 1964 in Palmdale, California. In January 1966, the first aircraft entered service with the USAF. No aircraft were lost in war but one crashed in an accident in 1969. Only 32 aircraft were built. Its final flight was on 6 March 1990, Blackbird S/N 61-7972. The SR-71 program was retired from service in 1998.\n\nThe aircraft flew at an altitude of over 80,000 feet (24,000 m) and at speeds over 2,190 miles per hour (3,520 km/h). It held the world record for the jet-powered flight, flying at Mach 3.2. The record was broken in March 2004 by NASA's X-43A aircraft.\n\nThe SR-71 Blackbird had two crew members.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197833", "text": "Main sequence\n\nThe main sequence is a region on a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram where most stars appear. Any star that is plotted within that area is a main-sequence star. The Sun is a main-sequence star. Most of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main-sequence stars.\n\nHertzsprung-Russell diagrams are graphs that measure each star's brightness against its temperature or color. The main sequence appears as a band going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). You can see an example of the band of main-sequence stars to the right.\n\nStars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence. They stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years. When a star begins to run out of fuel, it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant. After this happens, the star is no longer on the main sequence.\n\nIn general, the hottest and brightest stars (in the upper-left of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) also have the most mass. The main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts. Any star that has a mass greater than 1.5 times the Sun's mass is grouped into the \"upper main sequence\"; any star with a mass lower than 1.5 solar masses belongs to the \"lower main sequence\".\n\nStars get the energy they produce through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. The upper main sequence (hot and bright with the most mass) produces energy by one type of nuclear fusion involving only hydrogen and helium. The lower main sequence (cooler and less bright with a lower mass) produces energy by another type of nuclear fusion. This type uses other elements (for example, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) with higher atomic numbers as nuclear catalysts.\n\nBecause of these different types of fusion, stars on the lower main sequence last much longer than stars on the upper main sequence. Our Sun is located on the lower main sequence and is predicted to last between 10 and 12 billion years. A star located on the upper main sequence may only last a few million years.\n\nNowadays, a new star may be classified as main sequence just by its color. A main sequence star of a particular color has a narrow band of brightness when seen from a standard distance. An astronomer could calculate the distance to this newly-discovered star by comparing its brightness as seen from Earth against the brightness for a certain color on the main sequence.\n", "id": "197833", "title": "Main sequence"}

Two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax.\n\nProper motion is an object’s change in position over time when seen from the Earth. Just like anything else that moves, a star's proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved. The difference with stars is that, from Earth, they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year. When a star has a large proper motion, it usually means that it is nearby. Barnard’s Star, the star with the largest proper motion, only moves 1 degree across the sky (3600 arcseconds) in 348 years.\n\nParallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places. When an object is seen from a new place, there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance. Parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight.\n\nParallax can also be used to measure distances to the nearest few thousand stars. These distances are measured in parsecs which are equal to about 3.26 light years.\n\n", "id": "197934", "title": "Astrometry"}

His mother was a piano player and she gave Basie his first piano lessons. To earn money, she took in laundry to wash and baked cakes for sale.\n\nBasie was not very interested in school. He dreamed of a traveling, inspired by the carnivals which came to town. He only got as far as junior high school. He helped out at the Palace theater in Red Bank, to get into the shows for free. He also learned to use the spotlights for the vaudeville shows. One day, when the pianist did not arrive in time for the show, Basie played instead. He soon learned to improvise music for silent movies.\n\nBasie was very good at the piano, but he liked drums better. There was another drummer in Red Bank who was better, called Sonny Greer, so Basie stopped playing drums and just played piano. They played together until Greer started his professional career. Basie played with different groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, like Harry Richardson’s \"Kings of Syncopation\". When he was not playing a gig, he spent time at the local pool hall with other musicians. He got some jobs in Asbury Park, playing at the Hong Kong Inn, until a better player took his place.\nAround 1924, Basie went to Harlem, New York City. A lot of jazz was being played there. He liced down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Soon after he went to Harlem, he met Sonny Greer again, who was now the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington's early band. Soon, Basie met many Harlem musicians, like Willie \"the Lion\" Smith and James P. Johnson.\n\nBasie toured in some acts between 1925 and 1927, as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White. He went to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. He met many great jazz musicians, like Louis Armstrong.\n\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie got his first regular job at Leroy’s, a place known for its piano players, where lots of celebrities went. The band usually played without sheet music. He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater, accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play the organ. Willie \"the Lion\" Smith helped Basie out when there was not much work, arranging gigs at house-rent parties, where he met other important musicians.\n\nIn 1928 Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which had Jimmy Rushing singing. A few months later, Basie was asked to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. He began to be known as \"Count\" Basie.\n\nIn 1929, Basie started playing with the Bennie Moten band, Kansas City. The Moten band was classier and more respected than the Blue Devils. They played in a style called the Kansas City stomp. As well as playing piano, Basie also arranged music with Eddie Durham. When they were staying in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He sometimes played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten. The band got better when they added a saxophone player called Ben Webster.\n\nThe band voted Moten out and Basie became the leader. The band was now called \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms\". Later he went to join Moten's new band. Moten died in 1935 and the band did not stay together. Basie made a new band, which included many of the musicians from Moten's band. Lester Young, a saxophone player, also joined. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes on local radio. One night the band started improvising a piece which Basie called \"One O'Clock Jump\". It became his signature tune.\n", "id": "197990", "title": "Count Basie"}
