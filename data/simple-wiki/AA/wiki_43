{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138930", "text": "Legal precedent\n\nIn common law legal systems, a precedent or authority is a legal case that establishes a principle or rule. This principle or rule is then used by the court or other judicial bodies use when deciding later cases with similar issues or facts. The use of precedent provides predictability, stability, fairness, and efficiency in the law. The Latin term stare decisis is the doctrine of legal precedent. \n\nThe precedent on an issue is the collective body of judicially announced principles that a court should consider when interpreting the law. When a precedent establishes an important legal principle, or represents new or changed law on a particular issue, that precedent is often known as a landmark decision.\n\nPrecedent is central to legal analysis and rulings in countries that follow common law like the United Kingdom and Canada (except Quebec). In some systems precedent is not binding but is taken into account by the courts.\n\nPrecedent that must be applied or followed is known as \"binding precedent\" (alternately \"mandatory precedent\", \"mandatory\" or \"binding authority\", etc.). Under the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In the United States state and federal courts, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court, and all regional courts fall under a supreme court. By definition decisions of lower courts are not binding on each other or any courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on each other or on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings.\n\nOne law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent in any event.\n\nPrecedent is not \"binding\" on a judge or “mandatory”\nin the same sense that laws are binding on citizens. A judge can't be\njailed or fined for disagreeing with it. His oath is not to\nprecedent, but at least for federal judges, is to \"the\nconstitution\nand the laws of the United States\". The Canons of Judicial\nEthics\ndo not mention obedience to precedent, but to \"the federal\nConstitution and that of the state whose laws they administer.\"\nThe Code\nof Judicial Conduct says nothing about precedent. In most cases,\nprecedent is the most reasonable interpretation of the Constitution\nand our laws, in which cases the oath to the constitution is most\nfaithfully observed by following precedent. But when a judge finds\nthe interpretation of the Constitution in a majority opinion\nunpersuasive, compared to the interpretation in the dissent, then\nfollowing precedent may violate the judge's oath. In a ruling where\nJudge Roy Moore saw such a distinction, he acknowledged its authority\nas precedent, but said\n\"[The] interpretation of the Constitution [by the Supreme Court\nmajority] is \"their\" interpretation. But nothing can conflict\nwith a sworn officer's oath to the Constitution.\" Of course\nchaos is the consequence of \"careless\" disregard of precedent. Citizens\ntrying to obey the law need a sense of what the law is.\n\nPrecedent that is not mandatory but which is useful or relevant is known as \"persuasive precedent\" (or \"persuasive authority\" or \"advisory precedent\"). Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, State courts versus Federal courts in the United States), and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.\n\nIn a case of first impression, courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other jurisdictions that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through the adoption of the persuasive precedent by a higher court.\n\nLong-held custom, which has traditionally been recognized by courts and judges, is the first kind of precedent. Custom can be so deeply entrenched in the society at large that it gains the force of law. There need never have been a specific case decided on the same or similar issues in order for a court to take notice of customary or traditional precedent in its deliberations.\n\nThe other type of precedent is case law. In common law systems this type of precedent is granted more or less weight in the deliberations of a court according to a number of factors. Most important is whether the precedent is \"on point,\" that is, does it deal with a circumstance identical or very similar to the circumstance in the instant case? Second, when and where was the precedent decided? A recent decision in the same jurisdiction as the instant case will be given great weight. Next in descending order would be recent precedent in jurisdictions whose law is the same as local law. Least weight would be given to precedent that stems from dissimilar circumstances, older cases that have since been contradicted, or cases in jurisdictions that have dissimilar law.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:\n\nPrecedents viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still.\n\nScholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedents in order to establish which precedents are most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.\nSuper-stare decisis is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power, or alternately, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.\n\nIn 1976, Richard Posner and William Landes coined the term \"super-precedent,\" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations. Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term \"super-precedent\" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision. In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in \"Roe v. Wade\"), that side can protect its position from being reversed \"by a kind of super-stare decisis.\" \n\nThe issue arose anew in the questioning of Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito during their confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Before the hearings the chair of the committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in the \"New York Times\" referring to \"Roe\" as a \"super-precedent.\" He mentioned the concept (and made seemingly humorous references to \"super-duper precedent\") during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept. \n\nIn a controversial 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:\n", "id": "138930", "title": "Legal precedent"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139018", "text": "Furby\n\nA Furby (plural Furbys or Furbies, according to Tiger. Co.) is a popular electronic toy or robot, more specifically, a hamster/owl-like creature made by Tiger Electronics, which went through a time of being the \"must-have\" toy following its launch in the winter holiday season of 1998, with continuing sales until 2000. Furbies sold 1.8 million units in 1998, 14 million units in 1999, and altogether in its three years of original production, Furby sold over 40 million units, and its speaking capabilities were translated into 24 languages. A video game of the Furbies was released in 1998 by Hasbro Interactive with many activities. Furbies were the first successful attempt to produce and sell a programmed robot. In 2005, new Furbies were released, with voice-recognition and more complex facial movements, among many other changes and improvements. There was a common mistake that they repeated words that were said around them. This belief most likely came from the fact that it is possible to have the Furby say certain pre-programmed words or phrases more often by petting it whenever it said these words. As a result of this myth, several intelligence agencies banned them from their offices.\n\nDavid Hampton and Caleb Chung created the Furby in about nine months (in addition to an additional nine months spent designing the toy). That was the amount of time between Tiger Electronics showing an interest in his interactive creatures, during which Roger Schiffman bought the rights to it, and the time they hit store shelves. Furby's first public appearance was at the International Toy Fair in 1998. Furbys originally retailed for about US$35, and upon release Furbys flew off the shelves in toyshops. The demand for these toys during the 1998 holiday season drove the resale price over US$100 and sometimes as high as several hundred dollars. Furbies sold for over US$300 in newspapers and in auctions. Nicknames were given to them, and sellers gave values to them. Some people continue to call their Furbies by the terms 'wedding Furby', 'tuxedo Furby', 'snowball Furby', 'biker Furby', and others. All, of course, were named rare by sellers, because they were so hard to find at the time. In a sure display of the demand for even one Furby, some sellers at the time scammed people out of a lot of money, without even having first given them a Furby. Parent battles, arguments, and fights grew higher at the popularity of them, and when retail supplies ran out, parents turned to the Internet, where Furbies could be purchased for two, three, or more multiples of their retail price. This action led to many parents ending up on eBay.\n\nIn 2005 Furbies were re-introduced with the release of the new Emoto-Tronic Furby. The highly growing emotional realism of the Emoto-Tronic Furby has given birth to a number of Furby-like special interest groups. These communities want to bring features of the Furby experience into human society. The most visible of these groups include Furbish-to-English translators and Furby adoption agencies. \n\nThe original Furbies were 6 inches (15 cm) tall. The main reason for their popularity was because of their apparent \"intelligence\", reflected in their ability to develop language skills. Furbies can communicate with one another via an infrared port located between their eyes. \nA simple electric motor and a system of cameras and gears close the Furby's eyes and mouth, raise its ears, and lift it off the ground in a \"faux\" display of mobility. The originals are still popular with many hackers as they can be dissected and made or changed to do other interesting things, including being able to say something insulting or humorous, like \"Shut up\". In particular, they can made be to do things with their advanced audio capabilities and various sensory interfaces. \n\nIn 1999, the Furby Babies line was introduced. Furby Babies are smaller than the original, have higher voices, and cannot dance, but switch to speaking English more quickly. They also have bigger vocabulary, and different \"Easter Eggs\" and \"games\" built into them. Baby furbies come in 24 different colors. All with white eye lashes, six different eyecolors.\n\nBook Furbies were also released, including an interactive Furby-like Gizmo, from the movie Gremlins, a Furby-like Interactive Yoda based on the Star Wars character, and a Furby-like Interactive E.T. from the movie of the same name. Another 'friend of furby', called Shelby, is similar to Furby, but looks like a clam, has lots of improvement in memory, and has a different personality; it was released in 2001 and can communicate with the original Furbies and Furby Babies. They also have sensors that can sense loud sounds, they can sense being upside down (they say things like \"Shiver me timbers\" and \"Walk the plank\", in the style of a pirate ship captain, when you leave them upside-down for a long period of time), and they laugh when you \"tickle\" them (their antennae - or \"tennies\", as they like to call them). They also purr when you \"pet\" them. You can feed them by sticking your finger in their mouth. Similarly, Shelbys do not have their own names, unlike the classic Furbies. Shelbys are also capable of knowing if it is talking to a Furby or another Shelby, saying phrases such as \"Where's Furby?\" - though they cannot tell the difference between a Furby and a Furby Baby - they just think it's a Furby. In addition to English, Shelbys also know some Furbish words and also have their own language called \"Shelbish.\"\n\nThe latest kinds of Furby were released in August 2005. Larger than the other ones, the new Furbies have been upgraded with a more emotional face and a voice recognition system, letting them communicate with humans. Unlike the Furbies originally released, just one order is necessary to make them 'sleep', and they have an off switch. They can communicate with other types of Emoto-tronic Furbies, though to a smaller amont than the communication between original Furbies, and they cannot themselves communicate with the original Furbies. They also do not have light sensors and basic motion sensors. These Furbies, according to the story they come packed with, are from Furby Island.\n\nIn 2006, a new version of Furby baby was released, with most notable features being the new look and a more \"Baby-ish\" appearance in contrast to the Emoto-Tronic Furby adult. They also have considerably less features than the \"adult\" Furby, with a very limited vocabulary and a lower level of interactivity. Another notable feature of the 2006 Emoto-Tronic Baby Furby is the movable \"legs\", which unfurl when Furby baby is awakened.\n\nFurbish is the language which is spoken by the Furbies. It is similar to English with a different grammar structure. A newly bought Furby starts out speaking entirely Furbish, the unique language with short words, simple syllables, and various other sounds, that all Furbies use, but are programmed to speak less Furbish as they learn more English as they \"grow\". Throughout a Furby's lifetime, it gradually learns English words and phrases, which it begins to speak in place of Furbish. The more English they learn, the more they \"grow\", making them more muture. The Furbish phrase \"WHOA! Me deep sleep!\" would translate into English as \"Whoa! I slept for a long time!\"\n\nThese are common Furbish pharses.\n\nFurbies may say these Furbish words:\n\n", "id": "139018", "title": "Furby"}

Enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit-level parallelism \n\nIncreasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. (For example, consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers. The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer, then add the 8 higher-order bits, requiring two instructions to complete a single operation. A 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction) \n\nHistorically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors, then 64-bit microprocessors. 32-bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years, but now 64-bit processors are taking the lead.\n", "id": "139136", "title": "Bit-level parallelism"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139139", "text": "Instruction level parallelism\n\nInstruction-level parallelism (ILP) is a measure of how many operations in a computer program can be performed \"in-parallel\" at the same time (termed:\"\"simultaneously\"\"). Consider the following program:\n\nOperation 3 depends on the results of \"e\" and \"f\" which are calculated from operations 1 and 2, so \"g\" cannot be calculated until both of \"e\" and \"f\" are computed. However, operations 1 and 2 do not depend on any other operation, so they can be computed simultaneously. If we assume that each operation can be completed in one unit of time then these three instructions can be completed in a total of two units of time, giving an ILP factor of 3/2; which means 3/2 = 1.5 greater than without ILP.\n\nOne of the goals of compilers and processors designers is to use as much ILP as possible. Ordinary programs are written execute instructions in sequence; one after the other, in the order as written by programmers. ILP allows the compiler and the processor to overlap the execution of multiple instructions or even to change the order in which instructions are executed.\n\nHow much ILP exists in programs depends on the application type, for example, in graphics and scientific applications the amount can be very large while in cryptography the amount much less.\n\nMicro-architectural techniques that use ILP include:\n\nIn recent years, ILP techniques have been used for performance improvements in conditions where the difference between processor operating frequencies and memory access times is large. As of 2008, a cache \"miss\" costs several hundreds of CPU cycles in a main memory access; with much longer latency compared when the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache. Hence, this technique was proved to be insufficient to save the CPU time from waiting for the off-chip data. Instead, the industry is moving towards improving higher levels of parallelism using techniques such as multiprocessing and multithreading. \n\n", "id": "139139", "title": "Instruction level parallelism"}

It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism.\n\nIn a multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions, data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data. In some situations, a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data. In others, different threads control the operation, but they execute the same code. \n\nFor example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs A and B) in a parallel computing environment, and we want to do a task on some data D, it is possible to tell CPU A to do that task on one part of D and CPU B on another part of D simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution. \n\nData parallelism is used by many applications especially data processing applications; one of the examples is database applications.

It contrasts to data parallelism as another form of parallelism.\n\nIn a multiprocessor system, task parallelism is achieved when each processor executes a different thread (or process) on the same or different data. The threads may execute the same or different code. Different execution threads communicate with one another usually to pass data as they work.\n\nAs a simple example, if we are running code on a 2-processor system (CPUs \"a\" & \"b\") in a parallel computing environment and we want to do tasks \"A\" and \"B\", it is possible to tell CPU \"a\" to do task \"A\" and CPU \"b\" to do task 'B\" simultaneously (at the same time), in order to reduce the runtime of the execution. \n\nTask parallelism is used by multi-user and multitasking operating systems, and applications depending on processes and threads, unlike data processing applications (see data parallelism). Most real programs use a combination of Task parallelism and Data parallelism.\n", "id": "139145", "title": "Task parallelism"}

When Baloo arrives for a visit, Mowgli leaves with him to go back to the jungle. However, his friend Shanti thinks he was kidnapped. She follows him into the jungle.

He is known as the lieutenant of the Kelly Gang. He was shot dead in the siege of Glenrowan. Joe Byrne was a very good shot, a good horseman and skilled at living in the bush. This made it difficult for the police to capture him. His skill at writing helped him to write the items that were important in starting the Kelly legend. He wrote the famous Jerilderie letter. There is also a legend that Ned Kelly, with Byrne's help, was going to start an independent republic in north east Victoria. The siege at Glenrowan was the first step.\n\nJoe was born at Woolshed, near Beechworth, in November 1856. His father, Patrick Byrne, had come from County Carlow, Ireland, in 1849, to join his father, Joseph, who had come to Australia as a convict in 1834. Joe's mother was an Irish girl from Galway. The family moved to Sebastopol, a small gold mining town, about two kilometres farther up the valley. Joe learned to speak Chinese from the Chinese miners who lived in a small camp near his house. He was educated at a small Roman Catholic school at Woolshed.\n\nAfter leaving school in 1870, Joe had a number of jobs including driving a delivery cart for a tannery, putting up fences, looking for gold, wood cutting, and shearing. He often visited the Chinese village at Beechworth and became addicted to opium. During the celebrations for the Prince of Wales birthday in 1873, Joe saw a suit of Chinese armour in the Beechworth museum. This armour provided the ideas for the armour the Kelly Gang wore at Glenrowan.\n\nIn September 1873, Byrne was in court for taking a neighbour, Anton Wick's horse. He had ridden it for several days before bringing it back. He had to pay a fine of 20 shillings. In December 1875, he was in court again for taking a saddle, but the court believed Byrne when he said he had found it in the bush. On May 20, 1876, Joe Byrne and his friend, Aaron Sherritt, stole a cow and cut it up for the meat. Someone saw them and told the police. They were taken to court and given six months in the Beechworth Gaol. In prison, Byrne and Sherritt met Jim Kelly, who was the brother of Ned and Dan Kelly. Joe Byrne met Ned Kelly in 1876 and they became friends.\n\nByrne was probably at the Kelly house on 15 April, 1878, when Constable Fitzpatrick said that Ned Kelly shot him and that Ellen Kelly, Ned's mother, had hit him over the head with a shovel. Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush at Bullock Creek, an old gold mining area. The police offered a reward of £100 for them, and Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years.\n\nJoe Byrne was at Stringybark Creek with the Kelly brothers and Steve Hart on 26 October, 1878, when they found four police officers on their trail, and shot three of them dead. Joe Byrne shot dead Trooper Scanlon, and was wearing Scanlon's ring at the time of his death. The gang were made outlaws on 15 November 1878, which meant they could be legally killed by anyone at any time. A reward of £2000 (about AU$754,000 in 2008) was offered for them, dead or alive.\n\nByrne was Kelly's lieutenant, and the two of them planned the gang's actions. The Kelly Gang robbed the Euroa branch of the National Bank of Australia and took over £2,000. Joe Byrne wrote a letter in red ink for Ned Kelly which was sent to Donald Cameron, a local member of the Victorian Parliament. Ned said justice had not been done in the case of his mother and himself. It ended: \"For I need no lead or powder to revenge my cause, and if words be louder I will oppose your laws.\"\n\nThe police locked up over 20 possible supporters of the Kelly gang between January 1879 and April 1879 under the \"Felons Apprehension Act 1878\". This increased public support for the gang, especially in north east Victoria. Joe Byrne was able to use this increase this by writing a number poems about Ned Kelly and his gang, including \"My Name is Ned Kelly\":\nMy friends are all united,\nMy mates are lying near.\nWe sleep beneath shady trees,\nNo danger do we fear.\"\nJoe Byrne often visited his mother at her house in Beechworth. He was also seen drinking in hotels in the town, even though there was a reward for him. He could do it because of his skill and daring, and because the police were badly trained and badly led, and because of the support of local people for the Kelly Gang.\n\nKelly and Byrne planned their next robbery for Jerilderie. On 10 February, 1879, dressed as policemen, the gang robbed the Bank of New South Wales at Jerilderie taking another £2,000. Byrne wrote the Jerilderie Letter which wanted an independent republic in north east Victoria. The money from both the Euroa and Jerilderie robberies was given to the gang's family, friends and supporters.\n\nAfter the Jerilderie robbery, the gang went into hiding for 16 months. This increased their reputation and embarrassed the government of Victoria and the police. The Victorian Government increased the reward for the Kelly Gang to £8,000 (about AU$2,000,000 in 2005).\n\nByrne and Kelly planned another bank robbery in Benalla in 1880. They thought Aaron Sherritt was being used by police to get information about them. Byrne had told Sherritt to tell the police that the gang was planning a robbery in the Goulburn River while they were really planning the Jerilderie robbery. Kelly and Byrne believed that Sherritt could no longer be trusted. They also knew he was being protected by the police. Byrne and Dan Kelly murdered Sherritt on 26 June, 1880. Ned Kelly believed that this would bring a large group of police to Beechworth to search for the killers.\n\nThe next day, the Kelly Gang took over the town of Glenrowan. They tore up the railway tracks because they knew the police would travel by train to Beechworth They held over 60 people hostage in Jones' Hotel. Thomas Curnow, the local school teacher, escaped and stopped the police train before it could crash on the missing track. The police were able to the hotel.\n\nJoe Byrne helped design the armour worn by all members of the gang at Glenrowan. This did not stop him from being shot in the groin cutting his femoral artery. He was in the middle of a speech about the gang when he was shot. He died quickly from loss of blood on 28 June 1880.

It was only removed after a young woman begged the police to let Byrne rest in peace.

In the following 125 years, the legend has grown. There have been a number of movies made about the Kelly Gang including \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" in 1906, the world's first feature-length movie. In 2003, Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne in Gregor Jordan's movie, \"Ned Kelly\".\n\nAustralian novelist Peter Carey won the 2001 Booker Prize and the Commonwealth Writers Prize for the \"True History of the Kelly Gang\". This was based on the Jerilderie letter written by Byrne.\n\nNed Kelly and the Kelly Gang has been made famous by Sidney Nolan wearing the armour designed by Joe Byrne in a famous set of paintings.

It was once the centre of Nundle Shire. Most of this area, including the village of Nundle, was added to the new Tamworth Regional Council in 2004. The village is 400 km north of Sydney and about 56 km south east of Tamworth. In 2006 there were 289 people living in Nundle.\nNundle was settled when gold was found nearby at “The Hanging Rock” and Swamp Creek in 1852. By June 1852 there were 300 people digging for gold at Oakenville Creek. People from California, Europe and China were also digging along the Peel River and up the mountain slopes. By 1865 there were about 500 people living there and about 50 shops and small businesses had started. A school building was put up in December 1871. Lessons started in 1872. Nundle was made a town in 1885. In 1924 the Peel River Bridge was built. In 1941 electricity was connected to the town. During 1966 the swimming pool was opened by the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. There were 1350 people living in the area in 1969. In 1979 the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, opened the new Chaffey Dam. Sheep, cattle and timber are now the main business activities in Nundle.\n\nThere are many old buildings: the Nundle Woollen Mill, old Court House, Peel Inn and Primitive Methodist Church. The old Nundle Courthouse and Police Station have been placed on the Register of the National Estate.\n\nNundle is of the best areas in the State for finding crystals. Some gold and other precious stones can be found including zircons, green jasper, sapphires and serpentine minerals. Nundle is a popular tourist destination for both casual travellers and motorcycle riders. Nearby is the interesting Hanging Rock mining village with good views of the Nundle valley.\n\nA new bridge across the Peel River at Nundle was finished in 2008. The cost of $683,000 was paid by the NSW State Government.\n\nIn July 2008 the rare Euphrasia arguta was rediscovered in a State Forest near Nundle. This plant was last recorded in 1904. It is believed to have grown after fire control burning the previous summer.\n\n\nThe annual Go for Gold Festival is held each Easter with around 4,000 visitors. The State Member for Tamworth told the NSW Parliament “that visitors had come to Nundle from all points of the compass during the Easter weekend to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and the beautiful setting.” The Great Nundle Dog Race, only open to working dogs, is run on the first Sunday in May and attracts many visitors.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139299", "text": "Instruction pipelining\n\nA instruction pipelining is a technique used in the design of modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs to increase their instruction throughput (the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time).\n\nThe main idea is to divide (termed \"split\") the processing of a CPU instruction, as defined by the instruction microcode, into a series of independent steps of micro-operations (also called \"microinstructions\", \"micro-op\" or \"µop\"), with storage at the end of each step. This allows the CPUs control logic to handle instructions at the processing rate of the slowest step, which is much faster than the time needed to process the instruction as a single step.\n\nThe term pipeline refers to the fact that each step is carrying a single microinstruction (like a drop of water), and each step is linked to another step (analogy; similar to water pipes).\n\nMost modern CPUs are driven by a clock. The CPU consists internally of logic and memory (flip flops). When the clock signal arrives, the flip flops store their new value then the logic requires a period of time to decode the flip flops new values. Then the next clock pulse arrives and the flip flops store another values, and so on. By breaking the logic into smaller pieces and inserting flip flops between pieces of logic, the time required by the logic (to decode values till generating valid outputs depending on these values) is reduced. In this way the clock period can be reduced.<br>For example, the RISC pipeline is broken into five stages with a set of flip flops between each stage as follow:\n\nProcessors with pipelining consist internally of stages (modules) which can semi-independently work on separate microinstructions. Each stage is linked by flip flops to the next stage (like a \"chain\") so that the stage's output is an input to another stage until the job of processing instructions is done. Such organization of processor internal modules reduces the instruction's overall processing time.\n\nA non-pipeline architecture is not as efficient because some CPU modules are idle while another module is active during the instruction cycle. Pipelining does not completely remove idle time in a pipelined CPU, but making CPU modules work in parallel increases instruction throughput.\n\nAn instruction pipeline is said to be \"fully pipelined\" if it can accept a new instruction every clock cycle. A pipeline that is not fully pipelined has wait cycles that delay the progress of the pipeline.\n\nAdvantages of Pipelining:\n\nDisadvantages of Pipelining:<br>\n\nTo the right is a generic pipeline with four stages:\n\nThe top gray box is the list of instructions waiting to be executed; the bottom gray box is the list of instructions that have been completed; and the middle white box is the pipeline.\n\nExecution is as follows:\n\nWhen a \"hiccup\" (interruption) in execution occurs, a \"bubble\" is created in the pipeline in which nothing useful happens. In cycle 2, the fetching of the purple instruction is delayed and the decoding stage in cycle 3 now contains a bubble. Everything behind the purple instruction is delayed as well but everything in front of the purple instruction continues with execution.\n\nClearly, when compared to the execution above, the bubble yields a total execution time of 8 clock ticks instead of 7.\n\nBubbles are like stalls (delays), in which nothing useful will happen for the fetch, decode, execute and writeback. It is like a NOP (short for No OPeration) code.\n\nA typical instruction to add two numbers might be codice_1, which adds the values found in memory locations A and B, and then puts the result in memory location C. In a pipelined processor the pipeline controller would break this into a series of tasks similar to:\n\nThe locations 'R1' and 'R2' are registers in the CPU. The values stored in memory locations labeled 'A' and 'B' are loaded (copied) into these registers, then added, and the result is stored in a memory location labeled 'C'.\n\nIn this example the pipeline is three stages long- load, execute, and store. Each of the steps are called pipeline stages.\n\nOn a non-pipelined processor, only one stage can be working at a time so the entire instruction has to complete before the next instruction can begin. On a pipelined processor, all of the stages can be working at once on different instructions. So when this instruction is at the execute stage, a second instruction will be at the decode stage and a 3rd instruction will be at the fetch stage.\n\nTo better understand the concept, we can look at a theoretical 3-stage pipeline:\n\nand a pseudo-code assembly listing to be executed:\n\nThis is how it would be executed:\n\nThe LOAD instruction is fetched from memory.\n\nThe LOAD instruction is executed, while the MOVE instruction is fetched from memory.\n\nThe LOAD instruction is in the Store stage, where its result (the number 40) will be stored in the register A.\nIn the meantime, the MOVE instruction is being executed. \nSince it must move the contents of A into B, it must wait for the ending of the LOAD instruction.\n\nThe STORE instruction is loaded, while the MOVE instruction is finishing off and the ADD is calculating.\n\nAnd so on. Note that, sometimes, an instruction will depend on the result of another one (like our MOVE example). When more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can lead to the hazards situation (mentioned above).\n\n\n", "id": "139299", "title": "Instruction pipelining"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139330", "text": "Superscalar\n\nA superscalar CPU architecture implements a form of parallel computing called Instruction-level parallelism inside a single processor which allows faster CPU throughput at the same clock rate. A superscalar processor executes more than one instruction during a clock cycle by simultaneously dispatching multiple instructions (termed instruction dispatching) to multiple redundant functional units built inside the processor. Each functional unit is not a separate CPU core but an execution resource inside the CPU such as an arithmetic logic unit, floating point unit (FPU), a bit shifter, or a multiplier.\n\nWhile most superscalar CPUs are also pipelined, it possible to have a non-pipelined superscalar CPU or a pipelined non-superscalar CPU.\n\nThe superscalar technique is associated with several identifying characteristics of the CPU core:\n\nEach instruction executed by a Scalar processors manipulates one or two data items at a time, while each instruction executed by a Vector processor operates simultaneously on many data items. A superscalar processor is a mixture of the two:\n\nIn a superscalar CPU an instruction dispatcher reads instructions from memory and decides which ones can be run in parallel, dispatching them on the multiple redundant functional units available inside the CPU. \n\nSuperscalar CPU design is concerned with improving accuracy of the instruction dispatcher, and allowing it to keep the multiple functional units in use at all times. As of 2008 all general-purpose CPUs are superscalar, a typical superscalar CPU may include up to 4 ALUs, 2 FPUs, and two SIMD units. If the dispatcher failed to utilize all of the units at all times the performance of the CPU will suffer.\n\nAvailable performance improvement in Superscalar CPU design is limited by two key areas: \n\nHowever even given infinitely fast dependency checking logic inside a conventional superscalar CPU, if the instruction stream itself has many dependencies, this would also limit the possible speedup. Thus the degree of intrinsic parallelism in the code stream forms another limitation.\n\nNo matter how fast the dispatcher speed, there is a practical limit on how many instructions can be simultaneously dispatched.

Each season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation occurs between June 1 and November 30.\n\nObservation info for years before 1492 is completely unavailable because record keeping was non-existent in the pre-Columbian era, and any records that may have once existed have long since been lost.

A theory has been postulated that an anti-phase pattern exists between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High—controlled by the North Atlantic Oscillation—was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. In fact, few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium; these quiescent intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times.

Most modern CPU designs include support for out of order execution.\n\nThe key concept of OoO processing is to allow the processor to avoid a class of delays (termed: \"\"stalls \"\") that occur when the data needed to perform an operation are unavailable.\n\nOoO processors fill these \"slots\" in time with other instructions that are ready, then re-order the results at the end to make it appear that the instructions were processed as normal. The way the instructions are ordered in the original computer code is known as program order, in the processor they are handled in data order (the order in which the data, operands, become available in the processor's registers). Fairly complex circuitry is needed to convert from one ordering to the other and maintain a logical ordering of the output; the processor itself runs the instructions which seems as if in random order.\n\nThe benefit of OoO processing grows as the instruction pipeline expands and the speed difference between main memory (or cache memory) and the processor increases. On modern machines, the processor runs many times faster than the memory, so during the time an in-order processor spends waiting for data to arrive, it could have processed a large number of instructions.\n\nIn earlier In-order processors, the processing of instructions is normally done in these steps:\n\nOut-of-order processors breaks up the processing of instructions into these steps:\n\nIn the examples outlined above, the OoO processor avoids the stall that occurs in step (2) of the in-order processor when the instruction is not completely ready to be processed due to missing data.\n\n\n", "id": "139435", "title": "Out-of-order execution"}

The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use. If they use a code, both will require a copy of the same codebook. If they use a cipher, they will need appropriate keys. If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher, both will need a copy of the same key. If an asymmetric key cipher with the public/private key property, both will need the other's public key.\n\nThe key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so, in such a way, that no one else can obtain a copy. Usually, this required trusted secure channel. With the arrival of (public key / private key) cipher algorithms, the encrypting key (aka, the public key) could be made public, since (at least for \"\"high quality\"\" ciphers) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the private key) could decrypt the message.\n\nIn principle, then, the only remaining problem was to be sure that a public key actually belonged to its claimed owner, this is not a problem easy to solve; specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other.\n\nIn 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman published a cryptographic protocol, (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), which allows users to establish secure channels in order to exchange keys, even if an attacker is monitoring that communication channel. However, Diffie-Hellman key exchange did not address the \"identity authentication\" problem of being sure of the actual identity of the person or an entity.\n\nPublic key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of \"identity authentication\". In their most usual implementation, each user applies to a \"certificate authority\" for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct (termed: non-tamperable) authentication of identity.\n\nIn contrast, the web of trust system, which do not use central \"certificate authority\" at all. Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate, (see digital signatures).\n\nThe problem of key exchange has not yet been solved. In particular, it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically, as, for instance, in electronic commerce. Some of the existing work-around designs work, more or less, but are not fully satisfactory.\n\n", "id": "139444", "title": "Key exchange"}

The white stands for peace and prosperity, the green for fertility and the Green Mountains, and the red for battles against foreign invaders. The red is also the colour of the former flag of the nation when it was known simply as the Sultanate of Musca and Oman.\nUntil 1970, Oman used the plain red banner of the indigenous people, the Kharijite Muslims. In 1970, the Sultan introduced a complete new set of national flags. Bands of green and white were added to the fly, and the national emblem, the badge of the Albusaidi Dynasty, was placed in the canton. This shows crossed swords over a Gambia, a traditional curved dagger. White has been associated historically with the Imam, the religious leader of Oman and at times the political rival to the ruling Sultan. It also symbolizes peace. Green is traditionally associated with the Jebel al Akhdar, or \"Green Mountains,\" which lie toward the north of the country. Red is a common color in Gulf state flags. The national emblem is said to date back to the 18th century. A curved dagger is fastened over a pair of crossed swords.

It is in the region Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in the Vaucluse department in the south of France. The town has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and mild winters. It does not rain very often and snow is rare. Protected by the Luberon, a mountain range, the town is sheltered from the mistral, a cold dry wind that blows from the north. The town was first built on a hill which was easy to defend. After the town was destroyed in 1545, it was rebuilt on the plain, near the river.\n\nA ferry was in use to cross the Durance River in the year 1240. Mérindol was abandoned, probably because of plague, in the 15th century. \n\nIn the late Middle Ages, Louis II of Provence sold the land to the lords of Abacus-Cental and Rocca Sparviera. They moved in farming families from Piedmont. The farmers were followers of Pierre Vaudes (Peter Waldo). They were part of a group, known as the Vaudois or Waldensians, who had separated from the Catholic Church in 1170. They believed in a simple life based on a line in the Gospel of Matthew. This put them in opposition to the rich and powerful church. In 1530, a Dominican priest, Jean de Roma, began a campaign against the Vaudois because he said they were heretics. His gangs attacked the town and burnt many houses and killed many of the people.\n\nIn 1540, de Roma arrested a flour miller from Mérindol, took his mill, and then burned the man at the stake. On November 18 1540, 19 more people were sentenced to death by burning at the stake, and the town was ordered to be completely destroyed. A group from the town went to the king to save the people and the village. He gave them until 1545 AD to give up their religion and rejoin the Catholic Church. On April 18 1545, the village was completely burned and about 12 of the Vaudois still living there were killed. Over one week there were attacks on 11 other small villages, and it is thought that about 3000 people were killed. Many of the Vaudois from Mérindol were able to escape and ran away to Switzerland.\n\nIn 1977, members of Vaudois organizations in Germany, France and Italy built a path in memory of the people who had been killed for their religious beliefs. The path leads to the ruins of the Vaudois church.\n", "id": "139538", "title": "Mérindol"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139552", "text": "Diffie-Hellman key exchange\n\nThe Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a way for people to secretly share information. When two people want to use cryptography, they often only have an insecure channel to exchange information. Martin Hellman, Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle developed a protocol that allows this information exchange over an insecure channel. The resulting protocol has become known as Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Sometimes it is called Diffie-Hellman key agreement, Diffie-Hellman key establishment, Diffie-Hellman key negotiation or Exponential key exchange. Using this protocol, both parties agree on a secret key. They use this key to encrypt their communication using a symmetric-key cipher.\n\nThe scheme was first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976. Diffie-Hellman key agreement itself is an \"anonymous\" (non-\"authenticated\") key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's short-lived modes.\n\nIn the original description papers, the Diffie-Hellman exchange by itself does not provide authentication of the communicating parties and is thus susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack. An attacking person in the middle may establish two different Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, with the two members of the party \"A\" and \"B\", appearing as \"A\" to \"B\", and vice versa, allowing the attacker to decrypt (and read or store) then re-encrypt the messages passed between them. A method to authenticate the communicating parties to each other is generally needed to prevent this type of attack.\n\nMany cryptographic authentication solutions include a Diffie-Hellman exchange. When two parties \"A\" and \"B\" have a public key infrastructure, they may digitally sign the agreed key \"G\", or \"G\" and \"G\", as in MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications. When \"A\" and \"B\" share a password, they may use a password-authenticated key agreement form of Diffie-Hellman.\n\nThe simplest and the original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo \"p\", where \"p\" is prime, and \"g\" is a primitive root modulo \"p\". Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in blue, and secret values in red.\n\n\nBoth Alice and Bob have arrived at the same value, because (\"g\")\"\" (for Bob, \"8\" mod \"23\" = (\"g\" mod \"p\")\"\" mod \"p\" = (\"g\")\"\" mod \"p\") and (\"g\")\"\" are equal mod \"p\". Note that only \"a\", \"b\", and \"(g\" mod \"p\" = \"g\" mod \"p)\" are kept secret. All the other values – \"p\", \"g\", \"g\" mod \"p\", and \"g\" mod \"p\" – are sent in the clear. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret they can use it as an encryption key, known only to them, for sending messages across the same open communications channel.\n\nOf course, much larger values of \"a\", \"b\", and \"p\" would be needed to make this example secure, since there are only 23 possible results of \"n\" mod 23. However, if \"p\" is a prime of at least 300 digits, and \"a\" and \"b\" are at least 100 digits long, then even the fastest modern computers cannot find \"a\" given only \"g\", \"p\" and \"g\" mod \"p\". The problem such is called the discrete logarithm problem. The computation of \"g\" mod \"p\" is known as modular exponentiation and can be done efficiently even for large numbers.\nNote that \"g\" need not be large at all, and in practice is usually a small integer (like 2, 3, ...).\n\n\n\n", "id": "139552", "title": "Diffie-Hellman key exchange"}

This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting all the higher level protocols, because applications do not need to be designed to use IPsec, whereas the use of TLS/SSL or other higher-layer protocols must be built-in the application.\n\nThe term \"IPsec\" is officially defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This definition includes the form of capitalization used for the term; it is often incorrectly spelled \"IPSec\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "139612", "title": "IPsec"}

Later in the season, a major hurricane moved northwestward across the Western Atlantic to the north of Puerto Rico. It hit near Atlantic City, New Jersey on October 9, and turned northeastward. As it crossed New England, cool air was entrained in the circulation, and it became extratropical. The storm brought heavy snow across the Northeast, in some areas up to 2–3 feet, and killed 8 people. This was the first observation of snow from a landfalling hurricane, but not the last.\n\nI.

After moving through the Leeward Islands on July 29, this storm struck Jamaica from July 31-August 1, leading to many lives lost. The hurricane was last seen moving into Belize on August 3.\n\nIII. Between August 3 and August 7, a tropical cyclone passed nearby Bermuda, with a bulk of the impact occurring on August 4 and early August 5. It was the worst hurricane to impact the island since 1793 and forced the construction of a breakwater to prevent a similar harbor disaster from recurring; more than 30 ships were driven ashore by the \"violent gale.\" Winds were estimated at during the cyclone's passage. (from the book Beware the Hurricane)\n\nIV. A powerful hurricane hit Dominica and Martinique beginning August 25, causing 3000 deaths. The cyclone moved south of Jamaica by August 28.\n\nV.

It moved northeastward across the state, reaching the Atlantic Ocean near Maryland. It weakened over land to a tropical storm, but still brought gusty winds to New England. It caused at least 4 deaths.\nII. Three weeks later, another major hurricane was located off the coast of Virginia moving northward. It hit Long Island, New York on September 23, causing damage and destruction throughout New England. At least 20 deaths occurred, though \"The loss of life was so heavy that the newspapers did not have space enough to give all the details of the marine disasters.\"\n\nIII. A tropical storm was located off the coast of South Carolina on September 28, but did not make landfall.\n\nIV. From October 17 until October 19 Jamaica was hit by a hurricane. It drifted over the island, causing 100 deaths.\n\nV. A minor hurricane hit Saint Bartholomew on October 18. It turned northwestward, and moved up the Chesapeake Bay on October 24, delaying ships' arrivals.\n\nRecords from ship logs have determined both 1815 and 1816 were active hurricane seasons, with at least 12 tropical cyclones ascribed to 1816 alone. This is some evidence that a northward-displaced Intertropical Convergence Zone appears to be partially responsible for the increased 1816 tropical cyclone activity.\n\nI. June 5-8: A hurricane brushed the Florida Keys, causing the loss of 5 ships. Interestingly, it appears to have been lured northward by an unusual June snowstorm across New England \n\nII.

During the storm, an earthquake shook the region.\n\nI. A hurricane was first observed near Tobago on August 1 before continuing through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico by August 6. It crossed over Florida, and when it reached the western Atlantic, it paralleled the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina. It moved inland over southern North Carolina, and brought heavy rain to the Norfolk, Virginia area, delaying mail delivery and causing flooding through the mid-Atlantic as it moved northward into Pennsylvania by August 9. Its track appears similar to that of Hurricane Charley of August 2004.\n\nII. Barbados was struck by a hurricane on October 21, causing 250 deaths as it moved through the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane subsequently moved into Nicaragua by October 26.\n\nI. A hurricane passed through the central Atlantic east of Bermuda to south and east of the Azores between August 26 and September 5. It reportedly silted at Hamilton Harbor on Bermuda. (from Beware the Hurricane)\n\nII. A hurricane passed by the Cayman Islands in early September. It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and turned northwest when it reached the Bay of Campeche. The hurricane intensified to a Category 2-3 before hitting Galveston, Texas on September 12 and continuing onward to Mississippi. The hurricane was \"quite severe\", destroying all but six houses on Galveston Island.\n\nIII. A tropical cyclone seriously affected Puerto Rico on September 22. It possibly recurved sharply offshore the Eastern Seaboard, as the frigate Macedonian encountered a hurricane on the 26th and 27th to the east-northeast of Bermuda. The breeze freshened that afternoon as the ship lay near 35.6N 55.7W. By sunset, waves increased to nine feet, and southeast gales lashed the system after midnight on the 27th. Winds continued to increase into that afternoon, as seas increased to . One man fell overboard by 5 p.m. and drowned. The hurricane reached its full violence by 10 p.m., splitting the storm staysails, and making the rigging useless. The main mast cracked under the strain by 2 a.m. on the 28th, and the mizzenmast followed suit by 4 a.m.. Seawater poured into the ship from all sides, as the wooden hull twisted under the force of the waves. The ship finally cleared the storm without capsizing by noon, and finally got to see a sunset by the evening of the 29th (from Chronicles of the Frigate Macedonian 1809-1922 p. 129-139).\n\nIV. An October 12-14 hurricane affected Jamaica and the central Bahamas.\n\nV. Between November 6 and November 13, another hurricane moved across the southwest Caribbean Sea into Jamaica and Cuba.\n\nThe exact origin of this hurricane is unknown, but it likely formed off the coast of Cuba before heading on a west-northwest track towards the Gulf Coast. A small hurricane, it reached an estimated Category 3-4 strength before making landfall on July 27 in southeastern Louisiana, bringing heavy winds and a 5–6 ft storm surge. The hurricane continued northeastward, making a second landfall in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi before dissipating inland. Known as one of the most destructive hurricanes to affect the United States during the first half of the 19th century, the Bay St. Louis Hurricane caused severe damage across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, leaving behind the remains of shattered buildings and uprooted trees. Several vessels (from small boats to 60-ton brigs) were driven ashore by the hurricane's storm surge. One of them was the capsizing of the U.S. warship Firebrand, drowning 39 sailors. Several U.S. solders were caught off guard by the hurricane and died in its midst. There were also reports of people being attacked by alligators, snapping turtles, and snakes, which further added to the death toll. The hurricane caused over $100,000 dollars (1819 US dollars) in damage, and killed between 43 and 175 people, some of them later found washed up across the Gulf Coast.\n\nII. A tropical storm hit between New Orleans and Apalachicola in September.\n\nIII. Between September 19 and September 26, a hurricane tracked through the northeast Lesser Antilles and southwest of Bermuda. During September 21 and September 22, this hurricane hit the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing heavy damage and loss of life.\n\nIV. From October 13 to October 15, a hurricane passed through the Leeward Islands.\n\nV. A hurricane is recorded to have impacted Cuba on October 27 before moving onward to the Bahamas on October 28.\n\n\n\n", "id": "139634", "title": "1810–1819 Atlantic hurricane seasons"}

A hurricane which formed in the west-central Gulf of Mexico on September 11 moved slowly northeast, striking the central Gulf coast on September 14.\nI. A severe hurricane was sighted at Guadeloupe on September 7 and moved across the northeast Lesser Antilles and the southwest Atlantic to hit Georgia and South Carolina on September 14, causing 100 deaths. It washed out all bridges between Darien and Savannah. Moving northward, it hit Savannah and South Carolina before going out to sea. Because hurricanes were somewhat frequent, residents were used to evacuating the area. Those who did not evacuate saw the destruction caused by this strong hurricane. This is likely one of the strongest hurricanes to hit Georgia in its history.\n\nII. Between September 26 and September 27, a tropical storm moved south of Jamaica.\n\nI.

Since it was introduced early in the \"Pokémon\" anime, it has become one of the most famous Pokémon.\n\nJigglypuff is perhaps most famous for the song it sings which puts everyone who hears it into a deep sleep. Jigglypuff then becomes upset because it assumes everyone is very bored by the song, and it draws all over their faces with a marker.\n\nJigglypuff is a small Pokémon, slightly shorter than Pikachu. It is shaped like a balloon and has a pink body with blue eyes, catlike ears, and a strange tuft of fur on its forehead.\n\nIn the \"Pokémon\" video games, Jigglypuff is famous among players because it learns the move Sing, which puts enemy Pokémon to sleep. This often causes them to lose the battle, and many players find it very annoying.\n\nJigglypuff was introduced in \"Pokémon Red and Blue\", the first \"Pokémon\" games. It has appeared in most of the games since then. It evolves into Wigglytuff, an \"upgraded\" form of Jigglypuff. Starting with \"Pokémon Gold and Silver\", Jigglypuff has a pre-evolved evolutionary form, Igglybuff. Igglybuff was one of the 100 new Pokémon introduced in \"Gold\" and \"Silver\". Previously there were only 151.\n\nJigglypuff has also appeared in \"Super Smash Bros.,\" \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\". It is a light and fast character who is great in the air. Its attacks include Rollout, Pound, Sing, Rest, and its Final Smash, Puff Up.\n\nJigglypuff is one of the most famous Pokémon, alongside Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Mewtwo, mostly because it has appeared many times in the still-running \"Pokémon\" anime. It usually appears unexpectedly and puts Pokémon and humans near it to sleep for a few minutes by singing its trademark song. It has a black permanent marker, similar to a Sharpie, with which it often draws on people and Pokémon's faces while they are asleep. This is an act of revenge, because everyone falls asleep when they hear Jigglypuff's song and Jigglypuff assumes it's because they are very bored by it. Since people are upset when Jigglypuff puts them to sleep, and Jigglypuff is upset when they fall asleep, it is a vicious circle.\n\nIn one episode, a Jigglypuff was trapped in a Blastoise's cannon. When it finally escaped, it put everyone to sleep and drew on their faces.\n", "id": "139639", "title": "Jigglypuff"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139657", "text": "Anti-nuclear movement\n\nMany people who are anti-nuclear, are against the use of nuclear power for electricity generation, since they think nuclear power is dangerous. They consider the risk of a nuclear accident unacceptable and generally believe that radioactive waste cannot be disposed of safely. Many also see uranium mining and nuclear reprocessing as bad, because of the environmental risks of these activities. The 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents have \"revived anti-nuclear passions worldwide, putting governments on the defensive and undermining the nuclear power industry's recent renaissance\".\n\nAnti-nuclear groups believe that nuclear power is a risk to people and the environment. These include health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste, and the possibility of further serious accidents. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity.\n\nOpponents of nuclear energy make connections between the international export and development of nuclear power technologies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The facilities and expertise to produce nuclear power can be readily adapted to produce nuclear weapons. Greenpeace suggests that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown up like Siamese twins. \n\nNuclear power plants are very expensive. Making reliable cost estimates is difficult, and estimates for new reactors in the USA range from $5 billion to $10 billion per unit. Building nuclear plants is seen to be \"a risky business\", according to several notable credit rating agencies and investment analysts. \n\nNuclear accidents are often cited by anti-nuclear groups as evidence of the inherent danger of nuclear power. The most well-known nuclear accident, a mishandled safety test at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986 in Kiev, Ukraine, \"killed at least 4056 people and damaged almost $7 billion of property\". Radioactive fallout from the accident concentrated near Belarus, Ukraine and Russia and at least 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas. After the accident, \"traces of radioactive deposits unique to Chernobyl were found in nearly every country in the northern hemisphere\". Other serious nuclear accidents include the Mayak disaster, Soviet submarine K-431 accident, Soviet submarine K-19 accident, Chalk River accidents, Windscale fire, Church Rock Uranium Mill Spill and the SL-1 accident. \n\nEspecially since the September 11 attacks, people have become concerned that terrorists or criminals could bomb a nuclear plant and release radioactive material. Building more plants would create more targets to protect.\n\nThere is an international consensus that spent nuclear fuel should be stored in deep geological disposal sites. However, no country has opened such a site yet. The demise of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada leaves the USA with no plan for the long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel.\n\nAnti-nuclear groups generally claim that reliance on nuclear energy can be reduced by adopting energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. Energy efficiency can reduce the consumption of energy while providing the same level of energy \"services\".\n\nAnti-nuclear groups also favour the use of renewable energy, such as wind power, solar power, geothermal energy and biofuel. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.\n\nAustralia has no nuclear power stations and the current Gillard Labor government is opposed to nuclear power for Australia, as are the Greens, the party with the current balance of power in the upper house. However, Australia does have a small research reactor (OPAL) in Sydney, and it does export uranium. Australia has 40% of the world's known uranium deposits as well as similar deposits of the other potential fission reactor fuel thorium, and sells uranium to members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. \n\nUranium mining and export and nuclear issues have often been the subject of public debate, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia has a long history. It all began with the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific, which involved several groups, and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.\n\nIn the 1970s, an anti-nuclear movement in France, consisting of citizens' groups and political action committees, emerged. There were many large anti-nuclear protests and demonstrations. More recently, targeted campaigns have been conducted, mainly by Greenpeace, and Sortir du nucléaire (France) has called for an official safety inspection of Areva facilities. \n\nThe anti-nuclear movement in Germany has a long history dating back to the early 1970s, when large demonstrations prevented the construction of a nuclear plant at Wyhl. Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired nuclear opposition throughout Germany, in other parts of Europe, and in North America.\n\nIn January 2008 the UK government announced plans to build new nuclear power stations, and the anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom has voiced concerns. There are also public concerns about the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Many different groups and individuals have been involved in demonstrations and protests over the years.\n\nFor many years the anti-nuclear movement in the United States succeeded in delaying or halting commitments to build some new nuclear plants. Anti-nuclear campaigns that captured national public attention in the 1970s involved the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant, Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, and the Three Mile Island accident. More recent targeted campaigning has related to the Indian Point Energy Center, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, Salem Nuclear Power Plant, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, Idaho National Laboratory, proposed Yucca Mountain waste repository, the Hanford Site, the Nevada Test Site, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and transportation of nuclear waste from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Many different groups have been involved in various protests and demonstrations over the years.\n\nMore than fifty anti-nuclear groups are operating, or have operated, in the United States. These include: Abalone Alliance, Clamshell Alliance, Greenpeace USA, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, Musicians United for Safe Energy, Nevada Desert Experience, Nuclear Control Institute, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, Public Citizen Energy Program, Shad Alliance, and the Sierra Club. \n\nMany well-known scientists and engineers have expressed reservations about nuclear power. These people include: Barry Commoner, S. David Freeman, John Gofman, Amory Lovins, Arjun Makhijani, Gregory Minor and Joseph Romm.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, anti-nuclear ideas received coverage in the popular media with novels such as \"Fail-Safe\" and feature films such as \"\" (1964), \"The China Syndrome\" (1979), \"Silkwood\" (1983), and \"The Rainbow Warrior\" (1992).\n\nOn April 21, 2010, a dozen environmental groups called on the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to investigate possible problems in the AP1000 reactor design.\n\nOn April 24, 2010, about 120,000 people built a human chain (KETTENreAKTION!) between the nuclear plants at Krümmel and Brunsbüttel. In this way they were protesting against the plans of the German government to extend the period of producing nuclear power.\n\nIn May 2010, some 25,000 people, including members of peace organizations and 1945 atomic bomb survivors, marched for about two kilometers from downtown New York to a square in front of United Nations headquarters, calling for the end to nuclear weapons.\n\nIn September 2010, German government policy shifted back toward nuclear energy, and this created some new anti-nuclear sentiment in Berlin and beyond. On September 18, 2010, tens of thousands of Germans surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office in an anti-nuclear demonstration that organisers said was the biggest of its kind since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. \n\nIn October 2010, tens of thousands of people protested in Munich against the nuclear power policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government. The action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in Bavaria for more than two decades.\n\nIn November 2010, there were violent protests against a train carrying reprocessed nuclear waste in Germany. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Dannenberg to signal their opposition to the cargo. Around 16,000 police were mobilised to deal with the protests.\n\nIn December 2010, some 10,000 people (mainly fishermen, farmers and their families) turned out to oppose the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in western Maharashtra state in India, amid a heavy police presence.\n\nIn December 2010, five anti-nuclear weapons activists, including octogenarians and Jesuit priests, were convicted of conspiracy and trespass in Tacoma, USA. They cut fences at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor in 2009 to protest submarine nuclear weapons, and reached an area near where Trident nuclear warheads are stored in bunkers. Members of the group could face up to 10 years in prison when they are sentenced.\n\nIn January 2011, five Japanese young people held a hunger strike for more than a week, outside the Prefectural Government offices in Yamaguchi, to protest site preparation for the planned Kaminoseki Nuclear Power Plant near the environmentally sensitive Seto Inland Sea.\n\nAfter the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accidents, anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. On 12 March 2011, 60,000 Germans formed a 45-km human chain from Stuttgart to the Neckarwestheim power plant. On 14 March, 110,000 people protested in 450 other German towns, with opinion polls indicating 80% of Germans opposed the government's extension of nuclear power. On March 15, 2011, Angela Merkel said that seven nuclear power plants which went online before 1980 would be temporarily closed and the time would be used to study speedier renewable energy commercialization.\n\nIn March 2011, around 2,000 anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated in Taiwan for an immediate end to the construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant. The protesters were also opposed to plans to extend the lifespan of three existing nuclear plants.\n\nIn March 2011, more than 200,000 people took part in anti-nuclear protests in four large German cities, on the eve of state elections. Organisers called it the biggest anti-nuclear demonstration the country has seen. Thousands of Germans demanding an end to the use of nuclear power took part in nationwide demonstrations on 2 April 2011.\n\nAfter the Fukushima I nuclear accidents, environmental activists at a U.N. meeting in April 2011 \"urged bolder steps to tap renewable energy so the world doesn't have to choose between the dangers of nuclear power and the ravages of climate change\".\n\nIn mid-April, 17,000 people protested at two demonstrations in Tokyo against nuclear power.\n\nIn India, environmentalists, local farmers and fishermen have been protesting for months over the planned Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project six-reactor complex, 420 km south of Mumbai. If built, it would be one of the world's largest nuclear power complexes. Protests have escalated in the wake of Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster and during two days of violent rallies in April 2011, a local man was killed and dozens were injured.\n\n", "id": "139657", "title": "Anti-nuclear movement"}

The game is the third in the \"Fallout\" series of games. It is set in a world where nuclear bombs have ruined the surface and people are fighting to survive. \"Fallout 3\" was released on October 28, 2008 in North America, October 30, 2008 in Australia, and October 31, 2008 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe player controls a character on the screen with two different view points. One point of view is from the character's head and another is from behind the character. The player may make their character different by changing their name, gender, how they look, and using skill points to make their character better at doing certain things. \n\nThe character may use either close-up weapons, guns or grenades to fight enemies. These need to be repaired in order to stay good. The player can also create weapons using drawings found in the game. There are two modes of fighting. The player may either aim and shoot at enemies or use a special system, called the \"Vault-tec Assisted Targeting System\" (VATS), to attack an enemy's arms and legs. \n\nThe character has a limited number of Health Points. If these are lost due to damage, the character will die. However, the player can dress their character in armor so that the character takes less damage. The character may also get sick from radiation.\n\nThe character can also be good or bad, and earns \"Karma points\" for being good and doing nice things or loses Karma points for being mean or killing people who do not deserve it.\n\nBecause of the nuclear war the world was radiated very badly. The people who were not safe turned into Ghouls, living zombies. The player also has to fight against Raiders, Super Mutants and animals like radiated cockroachs, scorpions, and vicious dogs.\n\nMany normal people are alive, though. For example, a city made of airplane parts, \"Megaton\", has normal humans, \"Tenpenny Tower\" has rich people and \"Paradise Falls\" that has slaves and slavers. There is also a city made of Ghouls called \"Underworld\" which is an old museum.\n\nIn the \"Fallout\" games, the world after 2050 destroyed itself because all the nations bombed each other with nuclear bombs. A few people in the United States hid underground in shelters called \"Vaults\". The player comes from Vault 101 in Washington, D.C. They leave the vault because their father has gone missing.\n\nThe game does not have a required story as the player can play any missions, called \"quests\", whenever they want. The main story involves the player interacting with what used to be the Army, the Brotherhood of Steel, and the evil Enclave, which used to be the government. The player has to either stop the Enclave's mission to kill all mutant people or help them.\n\nBlack Isle Studios, a company belonging to Interplay, was making the game. Interplay lost all of its money and sold the game to Bethesda Softworks in July 2004. Bethesda Softworks created a new version of the game. It was supposed to look like Bethesda's game before Fallout, Oblivion, but they made it much bigger. The game now has a 16-square mile game setting. In Australia, the game could not be sold because it talked about real drugs. The programmers renamed the drugs so that it could be sold in Australia.\n\n\"Fallout 3\" has gotten very good reviews. It has a 93% mark at Metacritic and sold 110,000 more copies than another Bethesda Softworks game, .\n", "id": "139704", "title": "Fallout 3"}

The right has generally been given after long political campaigns. In many countries, it was recognised before universal suffrage. Before the late 19th century, no woman had the right to vote in any political election.\n\nThe modern movement for women to gain the right to vote started in France in the late-18th century. The French Republic had been founded after a revolution, and political scientist Antoine Condorcet and activist Olympe de Gouges campaigned for women to be allowed to vote in the national election.\n\nIn early cases of women's suffrage, only those women who met certain requirements were given the right to vote in certain kinds of elections. In Sweden, there was conditional women's suffrage during the Age of Liberty (1718–1771). Unmarried women who owned property could vote in New Jersey from 1776 to 1807. In the 1792 election in Sierra Leone, all heads of household—one-third of whom were women—could vote.\n\nSeveral British colonies recognised women's suffrage before most countries. The female descendants of the \"Bounty\" mutineers who lived on Pitcairn Islands could vote from 1838. This right was kept when they were resettled on Norfolk Island in 1856. Women in South Australia allowed to vote in local elections from 1861, and those on the Isle of Man could vote in parliamentary elections from 1881. In 1893, New Zealand became the first independent country to give all adult women the right to vote in national elections. The women in South Australia got the same right in 1894, and became the first to get the right to stand (run) for seats in parliament.\n\nMany countries did the same soon after, following similar battles. Limited voting rights were also gained by women in several Western countries in the late 19th century, including Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom. Russian Empire was the first European country to introduce women's suffrage, in 1906. It also elected the world's first female members of parliament in its 1907 elections. At that time it was a part of the Russian Empire. In the years before World War I, women in Norway (1913) and Denmark (1915) also won the right to vote, as did women in the other Australian states. In most other Western countries, women's suffrage came at the end of World War I.\n\nCeylon, now called Sri Lanka, recognised the right in 1931. It elected the world's first female head of government, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, in the country's 1960 elections.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=139952", "text": "Group (mathematics)\n\nIn mathematics, a group is a kind of algebraic structure. A group has a set and an operation. The group's operation can put together any two elements of the group's set to make a third element, also in the set. A familiar example of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operator.\n\nInstead of \"an element of the group's set\", mathematicians usually save words. They say \"an element of the group\".\n\nMathematicians use capital letters to stand for groups. They often use \"G\", \"H\", or \"K\".\n\nThey use lower-case letters to stand for group elements. To save words, they say \"\"a\" is in \"G\"\" to mean \"\"a\" is an element of \"G\"\".\n\nThey write group operations with symbols like • or *, or by writing two elements next to each other. So \"\"a\" • \"b\"\", \"\"a\" * \"b\"\", and \"\"ab\"\" can all mean \"the element formed when the group's operation combines \"a\" and \"b\"\".\n\nNot every set and operation make a group. A group's set and operation must obey some special rules. These are called group axioms. This list has each axiom twice, once in words, and once in mathematical symbols.\n\n\nTo name the group, one should say all three parts: (\"G\", •, \"e\"). But when it is clear, one may just say that \"G\" is a group.\n\nIt's possible to find that for two elements \"a\" and \"b\" in a group, \"a\" • \"b\" is different from \"b\" • \"a\". For example, maybe \"a\" • \"b\" = c, but \"b\" • \"a\" = d.\n\nFor some groups, however, \"a\" • \"b\" = \"b\" • \"a\" for every \"a\" and \"b\" in the group. These special groups have a special name. They are called \"Abelian groups\" and their operation is said to be \"commutative.\"\n\nThe number of elements in a group is called the group's \"order\". \n\nOne everyday example of a group is the set of integers, the addition operation, zero (the identity). It is easy to see that when you add two integers, the result is always an integer. So closure is true. The identity element for this group is zero. Because the order of additions does not matter (or in other words, formula_1), associativity is true. And the inverse of any integer is its negative value. This group is also an abelian group. It is an infinite group (also called a group of \"infinite order\") because it has an infinite number of elements, the integers.\n\nThe set of integers with the multiplication operation is not a group because there is no integer which is the inverse to multiplication. \n\nAnother important example of a group is a group of symmetries. \n\nEach symmetry of an object is an element of the group. \n\nThe \"operation\" of the group is this: make the change of the one symmetry and then make the change of the other symmetry. The combination is also a symmetry, and that means that there is \"closure\". \n\nThe \"identity element\" is the symmetry in which nothing changes. \n\nAny symmetric change can be undone by reversing the change. That reverse is the \"inverse element\". \n\nSymmetry groups provide many examples of groups. For example, here are all of the symmetries of a square: turn the square clockwise 90, 180, or 270; turn the square counter-clockwise 90, 180, or 270; reflect the image of the square in a vertical mirror, or in a horizontal mirror, or a diagonal mirror to the right or the left; or leave the square unchanged. This is a \"finite\" group (or a group of finite order). It is a non-abelian group because it can make a difference which order when making a turn and a reflection. \n\nIt can be proved that every group of finite order is a group of symmetries. For this reason, group theory is called the mathematical study of symmetry.\n\nMany things in mathematics are groups. For example, equations. The ways of solving equations can be a group. Physical things can be studied as groups. There are important symmetries about physical things which are groups. \n\nSometimes part of the group is also a group. In that case, the part is called a \"subgroup\". For example, there is this subgroup of the group of symmetries of a square: only the turns of the square and the identity (not the reflections in a mirror). Many useful things can be proved about groups and their subgroups.\n", "id": "139952", "title": "Group (mathematics)"}

The flag has been used from 1903, but did not become the official flag of Australia until 1953.\n\nOn 29 April 1901, some private companies with the support of the Australian Government set up a competition to design a new flag for Australia. The prize money was ₤200 including ₤75 from a magazine and ₤50 from a tobacco company. There were 32,823 designs entered into the competition. These were put on show in Melbourne at the Royal Exhibition Building. The judges, from the army, navy, merchant navy, and pilot service, to choose the best flag were:\nThe judges took eight days to choose a winning flag.\n\nFive flags were almost the same, and they shared first prize.

The Prime Minister Edmund Barton wrote to the Governor-General to get approval from the King for the new flag. This was officially announced on February 20, 1903.\n\nSome of the winning flags had different numbers of points on the stars of the Southern Cross. This was simplified to seven points for the four largest stars and five for the small one. The Commonwealth Star had six points for the six states. This was the design in 1903. In 1912, an extra point was added to the Commonwealth Star for the Territories of Australia. \nIn 1934, the government published how the Australian flag should be made. The flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack was still the official flag in Australia until 1954. By law, only the Australian government was allowed to fly the blue Australian flag. Everyone else that wanted to use an Australian flag used the red one, called the Red Ensign. In 15 March 1941, the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, gave permission for the blue flag to be used on public buildings, schools and by the public. Australian ships would use the Red Ensign.\n\nIn 1954, the Australian Flag became the official Australian National Flag. The Australian flag is the most important flag flown in Australia, and must be given more importance than flags from other countries.

The instructions must name these values in order to distinguish them from one another. A typical instruction might say, add X and Y and put the result in Z. In this instruction, X, Y, and Z are the names of storage locations.\n\nIn order to have a compact instruction encoding, most processor instruction sets have a small set of special locations which can be directly named. For example, the x86 instruction set architecture has 8 integer registers, x86-64 has 16, many RISCs have 32, and IA-64 has 128. In smaller processors, the names of these locations correspond directly to elements of a register file.\n\nDifferent instructions may take different amounts of time (e.g., CISC architecture). For instance, a processor may be able to execute hundreds of instructions while a single load from main memory instruction is in progress. Shorter instructions executed while the load is outstanding will finish first, thus the instructions are finishing out of the original program order. Out-of-order execution has been used in most recent high-performance CPUs to achieve some of their speed gains.\n\nConsider this sequance of instructions running on an out-of-order CPU:\n\nInstructions 4, 5, and 6 are independent of instructions 1, 2, and 3, but the processor cannot finish 4 until 3 is done, because 3 would then write the wrong value.\n\nWe can remove this restriction by changing the names of some of the registers:\n\nNow instructions 4, 5, and 6 can be executed in parallel with instructions 1, 2, and 3, so that the program can be executed faster.\n\nWhen possible, compilers do this renaming. But compilers are limited by the number of register inside the CPU. Many high performance CPUs have more physical registers than may be named directly in the instruction set and they can rename registers in hardware to achieve better instruction level parallelism.\n\nAnything that is read and written can be renamed. While the general-purpose and floating-point registers are the most, flag and status registers or even individual status bits are commonly renamed as well.\n\nMemory locations can also be renamed, although it is not commonly done to the level used in register renaming.\n\nWhen more than one instruction references a particular location for an operand, either reading it (as an input) or writing it (as an output), executing those instructions in an order different from the original program order can cause to three kinds of problems, also known as hazards:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "140072", "title": "Register renaming"}

The accepted idea is that 4.6 billion years ago, there was a very big cloud of gas in our area of space, known as a nebula. The nebula eventually became so big that gravity pulled all the gas to the center. Eventually because of all the gas it became so hot there that some hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium.\n\nThis process by which the solar systems are created is called the nebular theory. The spin of the planets around the Sun, and each around its own axis was first caused by the original gas cloud having different density in different places. The spin increased as an effect of the contraction under gravity. So did the flatness of the solar system's shape.\n\nGravity caused the atoms in the Sun to become very close to each other. All this energy eventually made our star: the Sun. The leftover gas mostly went to the gas giants—also known as Jovian planets. The rock and dust went off to make the terrestrial planets, their moons, asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System.\n\nBecause of the sun's huge mass (99.86% of the whole mass of the solar system), it had very strong gravity that caused all of the surrounding celestial objects to stay in orbit around the sun. The huge density of its core causes a fusion reaction which turns hydrogen into helium with the radiation of heat, light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe solar system was now formed.\n\nThe nebular hypothesis, as it was called, was first worked out in the 18th century. Three men worked on it:\n\nSwedenborg first had the idea, and Kant worked it up into a proper theory. In 1755 Kant published his \"Universal natural history and theory of the heavens\" (in German, of course). He argued that gaseous clouds, nebulae, slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity. They eventually form stars and planets.\n\nMeanwhile, a similar model was developed independently and proposed in 1796 by Laplace. in his \"Exposition du systeme du monde\". He thought that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. His theory had a contracting and cooling protosolar nebula. As this cooled and contracted, it flattened and spun more rapidly, throwing off (or shedding) a series of gaseous rings of material; and according to him, the planets condensed from this material. His model was similar to Kant's, except more detailed and on a smaller scale. Unfortunately, there was a problem with Laplace's version. The main problem was the angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model. It was quite a long time before this was understood.\n\nThe birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation – the solar nebular disk model (SNDM) – is due to the Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov. His book \"Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets\", translated to English in 1972, had a big effect. In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed. There are still quite a few aspects of the Solar System which need to be explained. \n\nAlthough it originally applied only to our own Solar System, the SNDM is now thought to be at work throughout the universe. As of 1 October 2015, 1968 extrasolar planets have been discovered in our galaxy.\n", "id": "140077", "title": "Formation and evolution of the Solar System"}

Microarchitecture and instruction set architecture (ISA) together constitute the field of computer architecture.\n\nComputers have been using microprogramming of control logic since the '50s. The CPU decodes the instructions and sends signals down appropriate paths by means of transistor switches. The bits inside the microprogram words controlled the processor at the level of electrical signals.\n\nThe term: microarchitecture was used to describe the units that were controlled by the microprogram words, in contrast to the term: architecture that was visible and documented for programmers. While architecture usually had to be compatible between hardware generations, the underlying microarchitecture could be easily changed.\n\nThe microarchitecture is related to, but not the same as, the instruction set architecture. The instruction set architecture is near to the programming model of a processor as seen by an assembly language programmer or compiler writer, which includes the execution model, processor registers, address and data formats etc. The microarchitecture (or computer organization) is mainly a lower level structure and therefore manage a large number of details that are hidden in the programming model. It describes the inside parts of the processor and how they work together in order to implement the architectural specification.\n\nMicroarchitectual elements may be everything from single logic gates, to registers, lookup tables, multiplexers, counters, etc., to complete ALUs, FPUs and even larger elements. The electronic circuitry level can, in turn, be subdivided into transistor-level details, such as which basic gate-building structures are used and what logic implementation types (static/dynamic, number of phases, etc.) are chosen, in addition to the actual logic design used built them.\n\nA few important points:\n\n\n\nA very simplified high level description — common in marketing — may show only fairly basic characteristics, such as bus-widths, along with various types of execution units and other large systems, such as branch prediction and cache memories, pictured as simple blocks — perhaps with some important attributes or characteristics noted. Some details regarding pipeline structure (like fetch, decode, assign, execute, write-back) may sometimes also be included.\n\nThe pipelined datapath is the most commonly used datapath design in microarchitecture today. This technique is used in most modern microprocessors, microcontrollers, and DSPs. The pipelined architecture allows multiple instructions to overlap in execution, much like an assembly line. The pipeline includes several different stages which are fundamental in microarchitecture designs. Some of these stages include instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, and write back. Some architectures include other stages such as memory access. The design of pipelines is one of the central microarchitectural tasks. \n\nExecution units are also essential to microarchitecture. Execution units include arithmetic logic units (ALU), floating point units (FPU), load/store units, branch prediction, and SIMD. These units perform the operations or calculations of the processor. The choice of the number of execution units, their latency and throughput is a central microarchitectural design task. The size, latency, throughput and connectivity of memories within the system are also microarchitectural decisions. \n\nSystem-level design decisions such as whether or not to include peripherals, such as memory controllers, can be considered part of the microarchitectural design process. This includes decisions on the performance-level and connectivity of these peripherals. \n\nUnlike architectural design, where achieving a specific performance level is the main goal, microarchitectural design pays closer attention to other constraints. Since microarchitecture design decisions directly affect what goes into a system, attention must be paid to such issues as:\n\n\nIn general, all CPUs, single-chip microprocessors or multi-chip implementations run programs by performing the following steps:\n\nComplicating this simple-looking series of steps is the fact that the memory hierarchy, which includes caching, main memory and non-volatile storage like hard disks, (where the program instructions and data are) has always been slower than the processor itself. Step (2) often introduces a delay (in CPU terms often called a \"stall\") while the data arrives over the computer bus. A big amount of research has been put into designs that avoid these delays as much as possible. Over the years, a central design goal was to execute more instructions in parallel, thus increasing the effective execution speed of a program. These efforts introduced complicated logic and circuit structures.\nIn the past such techniques could only be implemented on expensive mainframes or supercomputers due to the amount of circuitry needed for these techniques. As semiconductor manufacturing progressed, more and more of these techniques could be implemented on a single semiconductor chip.\n\nWhat follows is a survey of micro-architectural techniques that are common in modern CPUs. \n\nThe choice of which Instruction Set Architecture to use greatly affects the complexity of implementing high performance devices. Over the years, computer designers did their best to simplify instruction sets, in order to enable higher performance implementations by saving designers effort and time for features which improve performance rather than wasting them on the complexity of instruction set. \n\nInstruction set design has progressed from CISC, RISC, VLIW, EPIC types. Architectures that are dealing with data parallelism include SIMD and Vectors.\n\nOne of the first, and most powerful, techniques to improve performance is the use of the instruction pipeline. Early processor designs performed all of the steps above on one instruction before moving onto the next. Large portions of the processor circuitry were left idle at any one step; for instance, the instruction decoding circuitry would be idle during execution and so on.\n\nPipelines improve performance by allowing a number of instructions to work their way through the processor at the same time. In the same basic example, the processor would start to decode (step 1) a new instruction while the last one was waiting for results. This would allow up to four instructions to be \"in flight\" at one time, making the processor look four times as fast. Although any one instruction takes just as long to complete (there are still four steps) the CPU as a whole \"retires\" instructions much faster and can be run at a much higher clock speed.\n\nImprovements in chip manufacturing allowed more circuitry to be placed on the same chip, and designers started looking for ways to use it. One of the most common ways was to add an ever-increasing amount of cache memory on-chip. Cache is a very fast memory, memory that can be accessed in a few cycles as compared to what is needed to talk to main memory. The CPU includes a cache controller which automates reading and writing from the cache, if the data is already in the cache it simply \"appears,\" whereas if it is not the processor is \"stalled\" while the cache controller reads it in.\n\nRISC designs started adding cache in the mid-to-late 1980s, often only 4 KB in total. This number grew over time, and typical CPUs now have about 512 KB, while more powerful CPUs come with 1 or 2 or even 4, 6, 8 or 12 MB, organized in multiple levels of a memory hierarchy. Generally speaking, more cache means more speed.\n\nCaches and pipelines were a perfect match for each other. Previously, it didn't make much sense to build a pipeline that could run faster than the access latency of off-chip cash memory. Using on-chip cache memory instead, meant that a pipeline could run at the speed of the cache access latency, a much smaller length of time. This allowed the operating frequencies of processors to increase at a much faster rate than that of off-chip memory.\n\nPipeline stalls and flushes due to branches are the two main things preventing achieving higher performance through instruction level parallelism. The from time that the processor's instruction decoder has found that it has encountered a conditional branch instruction to the time that the deciding jumping register value can be read out, the pipeline might be stalled for several cycles. On average, every fifth instruction executed is a branch, so that's a high amount of stalling. If the branch is taken, its even worse, as then all of the subsequent instructions which were in the pipeline needs to be flushed. \n\nTechniques such as branch prediction and speculative execution are used to reduce these branch penalties. Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken. The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read. Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not.\n\nThe addition of caches reduces the frequency or duration of stalls due to waiting for data to be fetched from the main memory hierarchy, but does not get rid of these stalls entirely. In early designs a \"cache miss\" would force the cache controller to stall the processor and wait. Of course there may be some other instruction in the program whose data \"is\" available in the cache at that point. Out-of-order execution allows that ready instruction to be processed while an older instruction waits on the cache, then re-orders the results to make it appear that everything happened in the programmed order.\n\nEven with all of the added complexity and gates needed to support the concepts outlined above, improvements in semiconductor manufacturing soon allowed even more logic gates to be used. \n\nIn the outline above the processor processes parts of a single instruction at a time. Computer programs could be executed faster if multiple instructions were processed simultaneously. This is what superscalar processors achieve, by replicating functional units such as ALUs. The replication of functional units was only made possible when the integrated circuit (some times called \"die\") area of a single-issue processor no longer stretched the limits of what could be reliably manufactured. By the late 1980s, superscalar designs started to enter the market place. \n\nIn modern designs it is common to find two load units, one store (many instructions have no results to store), two or more integer math units, two or more floating point units, and often a SIMD unit of some sort. The instruction issue logic grows in complexity by reading in a huge list of instructions from memory and handing them off to the different execution units that are idle at that point. The results are then collected and re-ordered at the end.\n\nRegister renaming refers to a technique used to avoid unnecessary serialized execution of program instructions because of the reuse of the same registers by those instructions. Suppose we have to groups of instruction that will use the same register, one set of instruction is executed first to leave the register to the other set, but if the other set is assigned to a different similar register both sets of instructions can be executed in parallel.\n\nDue to the growing gap between CPU operating frequencies and DRAM access times, none of the techniques that enhance instruction-level parallelism (ILP) within one program could overcome the long stalls (delays) that occurred when data had to be fetched from main memory. Additionally, the large transistor counts and high operating frequencies needed for the more advanced ILP techniques required power dissipation levels that could no longer be cheaply cooled. For these reasons, newer generations of computers have started to utilize higher levels of parallelism that exist outside of a single program or program thread.\n\nThis trend is sometimes known as \"throughput computing\". This idea originated in the mainframe market where online transaction processing emphasized not just the execution speed of one transaction, but the capacity to deal with big numbers of transactions at the same time. With transaction-based applications such as network routing and web-site serving greatly increasing in the last decade, the computer industry has re-emphasized capacity and throughput issues.\n\nOne technique of how this parallelism is achieved is through multiprocessing systems, computer systems with multiple CPUs. In the past this was reserved for high-end mainframes but now small scale (2-8) multiprocessors servers have become commonplace for the small business market. For large corporations, large scale (16-256) multiprocessors are common. Even personal computers with multiple CPUs have appeared since the 1990s.\n\nAdvances in semiconductor technology reduced transistor size; multicore CPUs have appeared where multiple CPUs are implemented on the same silicon chip. Initially used in-chips targeting embedded markets, where simpler and smaller CPUs would allow multiple instantiations to fit on one piece of silicon. By 2005, semiconductor technology allowed dual high-end desktop CPUs \"CMP\" chips to be manufactured in volume. Some designs, such as UltraSPARC T1 used a simpler (scalar, in-order) designs in order to fit more processors on one piece of silicon.\n\nRecently, another technique that has become more popular is multithreading. In multithreading, when the processor has to fetch data from slow system memory, instead of stalling for the data to arrive, the processor switches to another program or program thread which is ready to execute. Though this does not speed up a particular program/thread, it increases the overall system throughput by reducing the time the CPU is idle.\n\nConceptually, multithreading is equivalent to a context switch at the operating system level. The difference is that a multithreaded CPU can do a thread switch in one CPU cycle instead of the hundreds or thousands of CPU cycles a context switch normally requires. This is achieved by replicating the state hardware (such as the register file and program counter) for each active thread.\n\nA further enhancement is simultaneous multithreading. This technique allows superscalar CPUs to execute instructions from different programs/threads simultaneously in the same cycle.\n\n\n\n", "id": "140085", "title": "Microarchitecture"}

At first the trams were horse-drawn, but later they were powered by electricity.\n\nSouthampton, a city of the United Kingdom located in Hampshire, was becoming bigger in the nineteenth century. The population was 27,000 people in 1841. This was because the docks were becoming much more used. Also, a railway openened in 1839 and a horse-drawn omnibus service started at as well. By 1843 a regular service was running from the station to Millbrook, Eling, Bitterne, Shirley, Portswood, Totton and Romsey. Because of this, by 1861 the population had become 42,000.\n\nBy 1872 tramways were a lot more popular. The British and Foreign Tramway Company contacted Southampton Corporation with an idea to set up a tramway in the town. Lots of people were against the idea. The Corporation did not allow tram tracks to be put in the High Street and Above Bar. The British and Foreign Tramway Company stopped thinking about the idea.\n\nIn 1876 Southampton Corporation saw that their public transport was not as good as the public transport in other cities. The Southampton Tramways Company was made to build a new tramway system. The tramway started to be built in the summer of 1878.\n\nThe first tram ran on 5 May 1879. The tramway made £26. Many people did not want the trams to run on a Sunday, and 3,500 people put their names on a petition to stop the trams running on a Sunday. The company's manager said that there were lots of people who rode on the trams on Sunday and that the service would continue. If the service made money on a Sunday, then the trams would keep running. The first tram route that opened was Stag Gate - Holy Rood. A second route opened on 6 May 1879 which was Alma Road - Canute Road - Oxford Street - High Street - Floating Dock and Stag Gates - Lodge Road - Portswood. The Tramway Junction - Commercial Road - Shirley route opened on 9 June 1879.\n\nThe company got into some trouble soon after it opened. One of the managers ran away with some money to America in 1881. Another manager got the sack in 1882 because there was a problem with the company's money. By 1887 though the company had recovered. It had a good financial base to stand on, and it was paying divedends of 8% a year to its shareholders. On the 22 October 1889, the Portswood route ran via Spear Road and Avenue Road. Fares cost less money in 1896 because they changed from 3 to 2 for \"through routes\". The tram times became two times as fast to every 5 minutes from Stag Gates to Holy Rood. Four new trams and forty horses were needed to run this service.\n\nThe Southampton Tramway Company was bought by Southampton Corporation on 30 June 1898 for £51,000.\n\nThe tramway had twenty-three tramcars when it was bought in 1898. They were:\n\nSouthampton Corporation bought the Southampton Electric Light and Power Company in 1896. Two years later in 1898 it bought the Southampton Tramway Company two years later in 1898. This allowed them to change the town's tramway system to electricity instead of horse power. In 1899 a group of people from the Corporation visited tram systems in Bradford, Dover, Glasgow, Liverpool and London for ideas. They decided that Southampton's was going to be based on Liverpool's. The first electric tram route from Junction to Shirley opened on 22 January 1900. The second route from Stag Gates to Holy Road via Prospect Place opened on 29 May 1900. Over the next 3 years the system slowly got bigger. The following routes opened:\nThe last route to open as part of the first stage of the electrified system was Portswood - Hampton Park on 25 July 1903.\n\nBefore World War One more routes were added:\n\nAfter the war, more new routes were added:\n\nAfter thiese additions, the system was at its biggest. The only new lines opened after this were to miss out the Bargate Arch in Southampton. The east side opened on 24 April 1932 and the west side on 5 June 1938.\n\nBefore World War 2, two routes were also closed. Roberts Road - Millbrook closed on 2 October 1935 except for workmen's services. It did however re-open whilst the war was happening. The second route to close was Clock Tower - Northam Bridge, which closed on 4 June 1926.\n\nWhen the electrified system opened it needed some new tramcars to replace the horse drawn ones. The first trams used on the system were built by G F Milnes & Co., Birkenhead. They had open upper deck had back-to-back \"knifeboard\" seats so that they could fit under Bargate arch. No.2 was changed into a \"\"toastrack\"\" car in 1916. It was sold to Portsmouth in 1919 where it became Number 104. In 1903 twelve trams were built by Hurst, Nelson & Co. The trams originally had three windows on each side on the bottom deck. This was later chnged to have four windows on each side because the original design did not give enough support for the top deck. Two bogie trams were ordered in 1910. This order was later cancelled. The system also bought six ex-London County Council Tramways cars with enclosed upper decks. These were numbered 75-80. A final sixteen trams were bought in 1918. As well as these, a number of trams were built by the tramway:\n\nBefore 1932, the only road route between Southampton High Street and Above Bar was through the arch in the centre of the Bargate. In 1923 a new design of enclosed double deck tram was built by P.J Baker, General Manager of the tramways. It had a rounded top that would fit through the arch. These trams had smaller wheels to help reduce the tram's height. They were driven by high speed motors which produced more torque. However, the roadway through the arch in the Bargate still had to be lowered to allow the trams to pass through the arch. Some secret changing of the profile of the arch's masonry was also needed at the last minute. Trams started to pass around the East of the Bargate on 24 April 1932. The last tram to pass through the central archway did so on 4 June 1938. By this time part of Southampton ancient walls had been demolished so that the Bargate was passable on both sides.\n\nSouthampton Tramways were mainly affected by staffing issues during World War I. To try and stop this women were allowed to become \"conductorettes\". Because of this toastrack tram No.2 had a gangway cut through the middle of it. In the early years of the war a tram went round Southampton for two hours twice a week. It had a military band playing on the top deck. This was an effort to try and boost recruitment.\n\nWorld War II affected Southampton much more than World War One. Women were again employed by the company. Unlike in World War I though they were allowed to drive the trams this time.\n\nCar No.31 was destroyed by an incendiary bomb on 30 November 1940. It was the only tram to be destroyed during the war. To save the fleet of trams from the intensive bombing of Southampton during World War II they were painted grey. Regular services stopped at 7pm and they were parked up overnight in Cemetery Road on Southampton Common for the same reason.\n\nIn November 1942, a tram was accidentally set in motion whilst parked up overnight. It took two other trams with it. The unmanned convoy of trams was stopped by a lorry before anybody was hurt. The incident caused some worry locally because it was thought that saboteurs were responsible. It later emerged that the incident was due to a young boy playing on the trams.\n\nThe trams in Southampton made good profits for Southampton Corporation. However the Corporation had not put those profits back into the tram system. Because of this the whole system needed modernisation by the end of the Second World War. This included the trams, the power supply and the track.\n\nIt was decided that buses were a better alternative to modernising the trams. The tramway system therefore closed. The first line to close was Bitterne Park - St. Mary's - Docks on 15 May 1948. Swaythling - Portswood - Lodge Road - Stag Gates closed on 30 October 1948. Swaythling - Burgess Road - Bassett Crossroads - Avenue Junction closed on 5 March 1949. Floating Bridge - Shirley, Holy Rood - High Street - Royal Pier and Roberts Road - Millbrook all closed on 31 December 1949. The last movement of a tram in Southampton was on 4 February 1950 when cars No.21 and No.101 were moved from Shirley depot to Portswood depot under their own power. After the system closed some trams were sold to Leeds. The majority though were sent to A F Harris's scrapyard at Bevois Valley for scrapping. A few were sold on from there to be used as sheds or summer houses. This allowed some trams to be preserved.\n\nThree Southampton trams have survived.\n\n", "id": "140089", "title": "Southampton Corporation Tramways"}

With this, certain states of the European Union will send police forces as well as lawyers to help make Kosovo more secure. This is what was agreed by the Ahtisaari plan. The idea is to continue the presence of foreign police forces to help the police in Kosovo, as planned under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Russia and Serbia see this mission as illegal. The plan is to have 2.000 police force and lawyers on the ground. The mission started to deploy its forces on 16 February 2008. Currently only 400 of the some 1,900 police officers and judges foreseen by the EULEX mission are in place.\n\nThe European Council agreed on sending 1800 to 1900 people on 14 December 2007. Because of the unstable political climate, this force was later increased to 2000 people. Primarily this was done because it was impossible to reach an agreement with Serbia. The force is made up mainly of police officers. Some of the officers have received training on how to control rioting crowds. Some people of the force are prosecutors and judges. Because the force is so big, there will soon be the most EU civil servants doing their job there, rather than in Brussels. Chief of the mission is Yves de Kermabon, who is accountable to the European Union Special Representative in Kosovo, Pieter Feith. The mission is expected to cost €165 million in its first year.\n\nThe final decision on the mission was planned to be taken on 28 January 2008. This was postponed due to concerns over possible negative effects on the second round of the presidential election in Serbia on 3 February 2008 and the possible signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia on that date. The officially voiced reason for the postponement is the lack of a legal basis (through a UNSC resolution or something similar) for the mission. A Joint Action was approved on 4 February 2008, meaning that only the final approval is required; it is expected to be given on 18 February 2008.\n\nThere are still questions on how this mission should replace the UN administration in Kosovo.

They are native to Central and South America. \n\nUnlike most frogs, these are active during the day. They often have brightly-coloured bodies, which act as warning colouration. Although all dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic in the wild, levels of toxicity vary greatly from one species to the next, and from one population to another. Many species are critically endangered. Blue poison dart frogs are poisonous because they eat ants and other small insects that have toxins in their bodies. If an animal eats the frog, it will become very sick. \n\nMany poison dart frogs secrete alkaloid toxins through their skin. Alkaloids in the skin glands of poison frogs serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in poison frogs. The most toxic of poison dart frog species is \"Phyllobates terribilis\". It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites – the diet-toxicity hypothesis. Because of this, captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid-containing diet. \n\nMost wild species are not lethal to their predators, but rather taste foul enough that frogs are released immediately. Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators have developed the ability to withstand them. One is the snake \"Leimadophis epinephelus\", which has developed immunity to the poison.\n\nDart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently. Family Dendrobatidae was revised taxonomically in 2006 and contains 12 genera, with about 170 species.\n\nSome poison dart frogs species include a number of colour morphs that emerged as recently as 6,000 years ago. \n\nPredation may have influenced the evolution of polymorphism in \"O. granulifera\", while sexual selection appears to have contributed to differentiation among the Bocas del Toro populations of Oophaga pumilio.\n\n\nDyeing Poison Frog.

This amphibian of the Dendrobatidae family is currently considered the most poisonous vertebrate worldwide. The optimal habitat of \"P. terribilis\" is the rainforest with high rain rates (5 m. or more), altitude between 100-200 m, temperature of 26 °C, and relative humidity of 80-90%.\n\nThe high toxicity of \"P. terribilis\" may be due to eating small insects or other arthropods, and one of these may truly be the most poisonous creature on Earth. Scientists have suggested the crucial insect may be a small beetle from the family Melyridae. At least one species of these beetles produces the same toxin found in \"P. terribilis\". Their relatives in Colombian rainforests could be the source of the batrachotoxins found in the highly toxic \"Phyllobates\" frogs of that region.\n", "id": "140363", "title": "Golden poison frog"}

Iniki was a powerful hurricane that affected Hawaii, just weeks after Hurricane Andrew stuck Florida during the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThe origin of Iniki is unclear, but it possibly began as a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on August 18. It moved westward across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and crossed Central America into the Pacific on the 28th. the shock wave continued to go west, and remained disorganized. Conditions slowly became more favorable, and, as the convection concentrated around a center, the wave was classified Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 5, located 1,700 miles (2700 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico or 1550 miles (2500 km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until the 8th, when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical storm. Iniki continued to get stronger and became a hurricane on September 9. It turned north towards Hawaii and became major Hurricane the next day. On September 11, Iniki peaked as Category 4 hurricane and hit Hawaii with wind of 145 mph. inki rapidly weakened ande went extra tropical Midway between Also and Hawaii.\n\nThe Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance. For several days prior to the disaster, the CPHC and the news media forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain, with the only effect being some high surf conditions. Some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated Hawaiian Islands, but these were rejected by the CPHC forecasters. CHPC Advisory #19 was issued at 11 AM local time on September 10, and suggested that a weakening Iniki would remain well to the south. It was not until a special bulletin was issued by the CPHC at 6:30 PM on September 10 - less than 24 hours before landfall - that any warning was given to the public. \n\nA hurricane watch was issued for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000 people were housed in shelters, most of whom remembered Hurricane Iwa 10 years prior. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage. During the evacuation of the island, people left days before to family, friends or shelters. Because schools were cancelled, traffic was light and evacuation was well-executed.\n\nThe CPHC issued a tropical storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.\n\nHurricane Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $1.8 billion ($2.6 billion in 2004 US dollars) in damage. Most damage was on the island of Kauai, where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power, although Oahu also suffered significant damage. Iniki also was responsible for 6 deaths.\n\nThe hurricane nearly struck the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. Had it hit there, Iniki, along with Hurricane Andrew and Typhoon Omar, would have struck each of the three National Weather Service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month period.\n", "id": "140447", "title": "Hurricane Iniki"}

He once delivers pizzas and is late because he had to save two children from being run over in the street.\n\nSoon, Peter was invited to attend a demonstration by a man named Otto Octavius. He has built a series of four mechanical arms. He says that the arms can control him, but because of a special mental chip on his back, he can control them instead of the other way around. He uses the arms to allow him to build and touch a reactor that uses energy from the sun. The reactor is powered by tritium. Tritium is very rare and costly, so Harry Osborn and his company spend their money to provide him with the product. However, a paper clip gets into the machine and causes massive damage. Otto's wife is killed. Peter dons the Spider-Man costume and rescues his friend Harry Osborn. Harry is mad because he hates Spider-Man since he thinks that Spider-Man killed his father (back in the first movie). The accident causes Otto's mechanical arms to fuse to his body, and it also destroyed the chip that allows him to control his arms. The loss of his wife makes him go crazy. The arms start forcing him to build the machine again to get revenge, but say they needed money in order to do it. Now called Doc Ock by the press, Otto attempts to rob a bank vault for cash, but is foiled by Spider-Man in the process.\n\nLater, Peter promises to attend Mary Jane Watson's play, but is distracted by a crime in progress and has to go fight it and arrest the criminal. He cannot go into the play afterwards and Mary Jane likes him less for missing the play. He finally decides to give up the Spider-Man costume and become a normal person.\n\nWithout Spider-Man in his life, Peter's grades improve in school. He attends Mary Jane's play. However, she tells him that she has already been engaged to John Jameson. John is the son of his boss at the Daily Beagle.\n\nDoc Ock later, after finishing the machine, wants some more tritium to power it.. He wants to build rebuild his reactor to be even larger than before. He forces Harry to give it to him by threatening to kill him. Harry says he will give him the tritium as long as he brings Spider-Man to him. Doc Ock kidnaps Mary Jane, forcing Peter to put his suit again. A fight breaks out. Finally, Doc Ock puts a subway on course to crash. Spider-Man manages to stop the train with great effort. but becomes very weak and is captured and tied up and brought to Harry. Harry takes out a knife to kill him, but is shocked and stopped when he pulls off Spider-Man's mask to reveal that his friend Peter is underneath the mask. Peter forces Harry to tell him where Doc Ock is, and then goes down there to save Mary Jane and the city.\n\nDown at the river, Doc Ock has rebuilt his reactor, this one much larger than before. Peter stuns him with an electric shock, reveals who he is, and convinces him to not do it, and Doc Ock has a change of heart. He says that the reactor is so big that only a river can contain it and uses his mechanical arms to destroy the floor underneath and dies in the process. Peter reveals his secret identity to Mary Jane but says they cannot be together because Spider-Man's enemies will target her.\n\nAt the end of the movie, Peter sits in his apartment and is very unhappy.

There, she tells him that she is willing to take the risk of being Spider-Man's girlfriend. A fire truck siren roars past.

It was published in 1870. It is the story of Captain Nemo and his submarine \"Nautilus\".\n\nThe story starts in 1866. All over the world, people on ships see something strange in the sea. The strange thing is long and thin, and sometimes it glows in the water. It is much bigger and faster than a whale. Some people think it is a moving reef. Others say it could be a sea serpent.\n\nThe next year, in 1867, the strange thing attacks two ships. People become scared that the strange thing will attack other ships, so the United States government sends an expedition to look for the thing and find out what it is. The expedition group includes a French professor named Pierre Arronax. He thinks the strange thing might be a giant narwhal. Arronax's servant Conseil goes with him. A Canadian harpooner named Ned Land is also in the group.\n\nThe expedition sets sail on a ship, the \"Abraham Lincoln\" (named after Abraham Lincoln). After looking for some time, the expedition sees the strange thing. The thing attacks the \"Abraham Lincoln\". Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land fall into the sea. They swim to the strange thing and climb onto it. They find that it is not a sea animal at all; it is a submarine, the \"Nautilus\". (The submarine is named after the nautilus, a sea creature that can rise and sink to different levels in the sea, just like a submarine).\n\nArronax, Conseil, and Ned Land meet the owner of the submarine, who calls himself Captain Nemo (\"Nemo\" is the Latin word for \"nobody\"). Nemo tells them that they will be prisoners on the submarine for the rest of their lives, because if he let them escape from the submarine, they would tell everybody about him. Ned Land is very angry to be a prisoner, and he starts making up plans to escape. Arronax is angry at first, but soon he finds that living in a submarine is fun; he is an expert on sea animals, and now he can look at them in their own habitat. As for Conseil, he just likes being a helpful servant, so he is happy as long as Arronax is happy.\n\nNemo takes his prisoners on a trip around the world, going through all of the world's oceans. They travel 43,200 miles, or 20,000 leagues (that is why the book is called \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\"). They have many adventures. But then Arronax discovers that Captain Nemo attacks some ships on purpose, to try to sink them. Nemo is trying to get revenge on a country that killed his family. But he will not say which country it is, or even where he came from.\n\nFinally, the \"Nautilus\" gets stuck in the Maelstrom, a giant whirlpool in the Atlantic Ocean. Arronax, Conseil, and Ned Land finally escape and make it back to dry land. Arronax wonders whether Captain Nemo got out of the Maelstrom safely. He also wonders whether he will ever learn what Nemo's real name is, or where he came from. Most of all, Arronax hopes that Nemo will forgive his enemies and become a peaceful man, studying all the wonderful things under the sea. The story ends\n\nPierre-Jules Hetzel published the novel in a magazine he owned, the \"Magazine of Education and Recreation\" (). The story was serialized in issues of the magazine, beginning in March 1869 and ending in June 1870.

They are small, burrowing rodents which live in short-grass prairies and the high plains of western USA and Mexico. The explorers Lewis and Clark sent a prairie dog to President Thomas Jefferson during their expedition; it was quite strange to him.\n\nPrairie dogs are found in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In Mexico, they are mostly found in the northern states, which are the southern end of the great plains: northeastern Sonora, north and northeastern Chihuahua, northern Coahuila, northern Nuevo León, and northern Tamaulipas; in the U.S., they range primarily west of the Mississippi River, though they have also been introduced in a few eastern locales. They will eat all sorts of vegetables and fruits.\n\nPrairie dogs are mostly herbivores (plant-eaters). They eat grasses, seeds, leaves, flowers, fruit, eggs, and some insects.\n\nHighly social, prairie dogs live in large colonies – collections of prairie dog families that can span hundreds of acres. Families usually are made up of one male and two to four females living in a strict social hierarchy. Prairie dog pups reach sexual maturity at about 3 years of age, and after their third winter the dominant male in a given family will drive them away, forcing them to establish their own families on the edges of the colony. The dominant male will defend the family's borders against rival prairie dogs, and disputes are resolved by fighting. Prairie dogs are also aggressive against predators such as badgers and snakes. \n\nPrairie dogs are social animals, and often make social visits with each other, and greet each other with a sort of kiss. Prairie dogs employ a complex form of communication that involves barks and rhythmic chirps.\n\nPrairie dog tunnel systems usually have several rooms. Tunnels can go down as far as , and can extend laterally as much as . Prairie dogs line their burrows with grass to insulate them, and the earth excavated from the burrow is piled up in mounds around the burrow's entrance. The prairie dogs use these carefully maintained mounds as observation posts.\n\nThe prairie dog is well adapted to predators. They can detect predators from a far distance and alert other prairie dogs to the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Prairie dogs use different calls to identify specific predators. Prairie dogs also trim the vegetation around their colonies, perhaps to remove any cover for predators. Their burrows generally contain several routes of escape.\n\nThe prairie dog is chiefly herbivorous, though it eats some insects. It feeds primarily on grasses and, in the fall, broadleaf plants. Prairie dogs have 1-6 pups (babies) yearly, which are born blind and furless and need about 30 days of close nurturing from their mother.\n\nSometimes two prairie dogs touch teeth with each other. Researchers think they do this as a way of recognizing each other.\n\nPrairie dogs are hunted by many animals, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and humans.\n", "id": "140517", "title": "Prairie dog"}

He was a leading painter who helped to create the Impressionist style. He painted portraits, and still life, but above all, he painted social scenes of the day. \n\nAs a painter of women, it has been said that \"Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau\".\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, the child of a working class family. As a boy, he worked in a porcelain factory where his drawing talents led to him being chosen to paint designs on fine china. He also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans before he enrolled in art school. During those early years, he often visited the Louvre to study the French master painters.\n\nIn the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water \"en plein air\" (in the open air), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect today known as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet, working side-by-side, depicted the same scenes (\"La Grenouillère\", 1869). \n\nRenoir experienced his initial acclaim when six of his paintings hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. In the same year, two of his works were shown with Paul Durand-Ruel in London.\n\nOne of the best known Impressionist works is Renoir's 1876 Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (\"Bal du moulin de la Galette\"). The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people, at a popular dance garden on the \"Butte Montmartre\", close to where he lived.\nThe works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling colour and light.\n\nA trip to Italy in 1881, when he saw works by Raphael and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. For the next several years he painted in a more severe, classical, style. After 1890, however, he changed direction again, returning to thinly brushed colour to dissolve outlines as in his earlier work. From this period onward he concentrated on nudes and domestic scenes.\n\nA prolific artist, he made several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir's style made his paintings some of the most well-known and reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works—181 paintings in all—is at the Barnes Foundation, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\nIn 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot. She, with a number of the artist's friends, had been a model for \"Le Déjeuner des canotiers\" (Luncheon of the Boating Party, 1881). They already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After his marriage, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life, including their children and their nurse, Aline's cousin. The Renoirs had three sons, one of whom, Jean, became a film director of note and another, Pierre, became a stage and film actor.\n\nAround 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of \"Les Collettes,\" a farm at Cagnes-sur-Mer, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life, even when arthritis severely limited his movement, and he was wheelchair-bound. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to adapt his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.\n\nDuring this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to help him paint large works.\n\nIn 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with the old masters. He died in the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, on 3 December.\n", "id": "140520", "title": "Pierre-Auguste Renoir"}

Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. \n\nIn contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on color and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic. Friend and spiritual heir to Théodore Géricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \"forces of the sublime\", of nature in often violent action.\n\nHowever, Delacroix was given neither to sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\"\n\nDelacroix was a member of the Club des Hashischins, or Hashish Club.

This process is termed: multiplexing.\n\nAn electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to share one expensive device or other resource, for example one A/D converter or one communication line, instead of having one device per input signal. \n\nAn analog multiplexer is a special type of analog switch that connects one signal selected from several inputs to a single output.\n\nA digital multiplexer is a set of parallel switches, with selector that selects one of the input digital channels to outputs into the single digital output channel. The selector selects one of the input channels according to the digital command (number) it receives.\n\nIn electronics, a demultiplexer (or demux) is a device taking a single input signal and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the single input. A multiplexer is often used with a complementary demultiplexer on the receiving end. \n\nAn electronic multiplexer can be considered as a multiple-input, single-output switch, and a demultiplexer as a single-input, multiple-output switch. \n\nIn telecommunications and signal processing, a multiplexer is a device that combines several input information signals into one output signal, which carries several communication channels, by means of some multiplex technique. A demultiplexer is in this context a device that takes a single input signal that carries many channels and separates the channels over multiple output signals.\n\nOne cost-saving use for multiplexers is connecting a multiplexer and a demultiplexer (or demux) together (called mul-dex) over a single communication channel (by connecting the multiplexer's single output to the demultiplexer's single input). The image to the right demonstrates this.\n\nIn this case, the cost of implementing separate channels for each data source is more expensive than the cost of implementing the multiplexing/demultiplexing functions.\n\nAt the receiving end of the data link a complementary \"demultiplexer\" is normally required to break single data stream back down into the original streams.\n\nIn some cases, the far end system may have more functionality than a simple demultiplexer and so, at the same time as the demultiplexing still exists logically, it may never actually happen physically, such as in network address translation where a number of IP private network users are multiplexed over a single public IP address.\n\nM.

As a result, VLIW CPUs offer significant computational power with less hardware complexity but with greater compiler design complexity.\n\nThe VLIW approach is a concept which is only useful as the code generated by a compiler makes it, but with a number of special-purpose instructions available to simplify certain complicated operations:\n\n\n", "id": "140621", "title": "Very long instruction word"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140643", "text": "Modesty\n\nModesty (also called demureness or reticence) is the name for a number of norms of behaviour a society expects form the individual people that make up this society. Excessive modesty is sometimes called prudery.\n\nModesty usually includes:\n\nDifferent fashions test the level of modesty. People are usually also subjected to peer pressure.\n\nDifferent levels of modesty apply in different situations, and to different groups of people.\n\nModesty is a social norm, it does not apply when it cannot, such as in an emergency. In the case of an emergency it is more important that doctors treat those that are wounded. It does not matter that doctors may see those people naked. In some cases, it may be necessary that they take off all the clothes, to be able to treat them better.\n\nSome people still insist on maintaining their standards of modesty, even in an emergency situation.\n\nModesty usually says that the parts of the human body that do not need to be exposed should not be. Usually, this applies to bare skin, hair, undergarments, and especially to intimate parts. Sometimes, the standards do not only say that the respective part should be hidden, but also that special clothing should hide its shape, what it looks like. Certain standards say how the changing of clothes should be done, like using a towel on a beach or closing (and locking) a door of a cabin that is provided.\n\nDifferent cultures have different standards of modesty. But standards are also different according to who the other people are, that could possibly see one's body:\n\n\nSocial standing or class can also matter. That way, different rules can apply to people of the same social class than to those of other (or lower) social classes.\n\nOther things that influence these norms include:\n\n\nThat way, a teacher that would perform at a night club might be seen as \"bringing the profession into disresapect\". Some people say this kind of modesty is \"body shame\".\n\nToo much modesty is called prudishness. As a medical condition it is also called gymnophobia. Excessive \"immodesty\" is called exhibitionism. Proponents of modesty often see it as respect for their bodies and the feelings of themselves and others, and some people believe it may reduce sexual crimes. Critics argue that it's not healthy to have a negative attitude toward the human body. Some assert that there may be a correlation between repressive body attitudes and undesirable outcomes such as sexual crimes, violence, and stress.\n\nThe cultural and religious background heavily influence the views a person has on modesty.\n\nWhat is called Western culture expects that Intimate body parts are covered in public places at all times. There are exceptions for places where people change clothes, as these are usually differentiated by sex. This means there is one changing-room for men, and another for women. Other exceptions include saunas, which tend to be mixed-sex (there is one sauna for both men and women) places.\n\nSpecial rules also apply for places where bathing is common. It might be tolerated that a woman is topless on a beach, or near a pool. If there is a restaurant near the beach or pool, it is usual, that the woman can be topless on the beach, but if she wants to eat something in the restaurant, that she has to cover her breasts. Very often, such restaurants are visually segregated by a railing. On one side of the railing there is the beach, on the other, there is the restaurant.\n\nThere are more and more beaches in cities. This blurs the boundary even more. There may be people in swimsuits next to businesspeople in a suit.\n\nIn private homes, the rules may be more relaxed. Nudity among close family members in the home is sometimes permitted, especially in the bedroom and bathroom. Wearing undergarments casually may be permitted as well. Elsewhere in the home, family members may be expected to wear more clothes, casually, especially if guests are present. A bathrobe may fulfill the purpose here.\n\nNaturists have different views. They want to create an environment, were people can feel at ease, even when they are nude, they can be seen nude, or nude people are among them. These values conflict with the current standards of modesty. For this reason, nudists mostly reject the current standards of modesty.\n\nTraditional indigenous cultures such as those in Africa, or the aborigines in Australia have social norms that vary greatly. How much exposure is acceptable varies from nothing for some women, to everything except the glans penis for some men of certain tribes. Certain African cultures think body painting is body coverage. Many think it is an \"attire\".\n\nThere are different standards of modesty for men and women. Western culture expects that both men and women keep their genitals covered. It also expects that women keep their breasts covered, most of the time. There may be exceptions for bathing, or breastfeeding.\n\nShowing naked soldiers bathing became common during the Second World War. Boys in high-school age also swam in the nude, during that time.\n\nFashion as well as other social norms expect that men cover more body parts than women, such as the midriff and the upper part of the back.\n\nSwimming pants are often larger for men than for women. Before the 1930s, men were generally prohibited from baring their chests in public, even at beaches. Organizations such as the Topfree Equal Rights Association advocate for gender equality in this regard. In 1992, New York State's highest court accepted 14th Amendment arguments and struck down the provision in New York's \"Exposure of the Person\" statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so.\n\nSexual orientation is a subject that is less and less a taboo. Homosexuality also seems to be more common or more talked about. This has led to stricter levels of modesty in same-sex situations, such as in changing-rooms. In several places, community showers have been converted to single showers, with curtains or doors. Many students no longer shower after exercise. Research has shown a dramatic decline in same-sex sexual activity among adolescent males that correlates with the increasing social visibility of gays and the increasing level of modesty. Related factors are the increasing emphasis on ideal male physiques shown by advertisements and the concern over being photographed and videotaped.\n\nIslamic society thinks modesty is important, but there are different interpretations of what dress should be considered modest. Many Muslim women wear a headscarf (hijab) as a sign of modesty. More conservative societies expect that women cover their whole body, except for their hands and their face.\n\nA woman who choses to also cover her face and hands is said to be expressing greater \"modesty and holiness\". In some Islamic societies, women wear the niqab, an all-encompassing garment intended to conceal every part of the body, sometimes including the eyes. Wearing a niqab (sometimes referred to as a burqa, although this term only technically applies to an Afghan all-in-one garment) is common in some countries with a majority Muslim population.\n\nIn most Muslim countries a woman can chose how to express her modesty. More conservative countries such as Afghanistan or Iran do have laws that say what kind of dress a woman should wear. Not obeying these laws can lead to harsh punishments.\nLikewise, according to some Islamic interpretations of Hadith, men are required to cover everything from 'navel to knee'; with some men choosing to extend this to the traditional Islamic head covering taqiyah (cap), the male counterpart to hijab which closely resembles the Jewish yarmulke but is slightly larger in size. The taqiyah cap may vary in shape, size or color just as the hijab does, with many regional differences according to tradition and personal taste.\n\nA burqini is a swimsuit designed for Muslim women that covers the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, that enables them to satisfy the requirements of Muslim standards of modesty while enabling them to take part in swimming activities.\n\nModesty is also important in Judaism, especially in the case of women. An ultra-orthodox Hasidic married woman is expected by their community to cover her hair in public, and sometimes at home. The hair covering may be a scarf, hat, snood, or a wig (\"sheitel\"). Some communities have stricter standards and expect women to cover their elbows and legs, with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves covering elbows. Skirts are expected to cover the knees. All slits in skirts are expected to be closed. See-through materials may not be used and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting, provocative, loud in color, or display texts. Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three. Modern Orthodox women will usually wear a kerchief or a hat to cover the top of their head, exposing lower hair. \n\nNon-orthodox Jewish women tend to adopt the fashions of the non-Jewish society in which they live.\n\nCatholics are expected to dress modestly, but there are no \"official guidelines\". Form time to time, priests and popes have given their opinion. These opinions are not binding, nevertheless many Catholics find them useful.\n\nPope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders, that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee, and the neckline should not reveal anything. Another example is Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa, who stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women. Many tradition-minded Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard.\n\nSome Catholics have attempted to make theories of modesty. Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective, while at other times it takes a more systematic, Thomistic approach, combined with the writings of the Church Fathers. Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities, such as the saints, can also be found.\n\nThe Church also expects men to dress modestly, but the demands are not as strict for them as for women; this is largely because men are often thought to be more inherently susceptible to sexual thoughts.\n", "id": "140643", "title": "Modesty"}

It is usually graphic material in the form of drawings, photographs or video, but can be in writing as well. Child pornography that involves real children is a record of child sexual abuse.\n\nUsually, these children are shown or described as being in different stages of undress, with some clothes off, or completely naked.\n\nChild sexual abuse happens in different ways in the making of child pornography, with the most critical way being the actual molestation. Another way is that, when the act is captured with a camera it makes the abuse worse for the child,\njust knowing that the event is being recorded for possible future abuse – including extortion (blackmailing) and sharing, out of the victim's control. Linked to that is many of the reasons to why that recording is then – in itself – seen as abuse. One important part of those reasons, is that the recording makes the abuse possible to go on even longer than the direct damage upon the child,\nand with the Internet it may very well be seen as permanent. This makes the impact on the child even larger, not knowing – but surely worrying about – how the images might be used.\n\nIn both common usage and for the purpose of research (looking up information), the word \"child\" in the phrase \"child pornography\" refers to children before they reach puberty, and does not refer to post-puberty teenagers. For practical reasons, the way the law describes child pornography generally refer to a wider age range, including any pornography involving a minor, according to where the law applies. Most people who own child pornography who are arrested are found to own images of children who have not started puberty; owners of pornographic images of post-puberty minors are less likely to be prosecuted, even though those images also fall within the laws.\n\nChild pornography is a multibillion-dollar industry and among the fastest growing crime activities on the Internet, according to the US The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) and other international sources. According to the NCMEC, almost one fifth of all Internet pornography is child pornography. New technology such as inexpensive digital cameras and sending across the internet, such as file sharing, has made it easier than ever before to produce and pass out child pornography. The people who make child pornography try to avoid prosecution by sending their material across borders with other countries, though this issue is being dealt with more and more with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries happening over the last few years.\n\nChild pornography is looked at and collected by pedophiles for a number of purposes, ranging from private sexual uses, exchanging with other pedophiles, preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as \"grooming\", or for bribing victims into making more child pornography or going into child prostitution.\n", "id": "140697", "title": "Child pornography"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140701", "text": "Child prostitution\n\nChild prostitution is a term for children working as prostitutes. They are children who get paid to have sex. Sometimes, the children do not get paid with money, but they are given other things in exchange for having sex such as toys. The meaning of \"child prostitute\" varies. Many laws say that children are people under 18 years of age. In most cases, it is not the child who makes money from the prostitution, but another person. This is either a pimp, or someone who directly abuses the child. This person will make a deal directly with the child to get sexual gratification. Different people may also exchange children to have sex with. \n\nThe Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (Convention No 182) of the International Labour Organization (ILO) provides that the \"use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution\" is one of the \"worst forms of child labor\". This convention from 1999, provides that countries that have signed it must get rid of child prostitution s soon as possible. It has the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.\n\nThe prostitution of children is seen as part of the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), and is sometimes connected to the trafficking of children for sexual purposes, and to child pornography. Child sex tourism also falls within the category of the prostitution of children.\nIn 1992, researcher and expert Ron O'Grady estimated the number of child prostitutes to be 1 million.\n\nIn 2001, Dr. Richard Estes and Dr. Neil Alan Weiner estimated that in the U.S., 162,000 U.S. homeless youth are victims of commercial sexual exploitation (CVE) and that 57,800 children in homes (including public housing) are estimated to be victims of CVE. They also estimated that 30% of shelter youth and 70% of homeless youth are victims of CVE in the United States.\n\nOne third of street-level prostitutes in the U.S. are less 18 years old while fifty percent of off-street prostitutes are less than 18 years old. Off-street prostitution includes massage parlors, strip clubs, and escort services. According to Estes and Weiner, 12 to 14 is the average age of entry into prostitution for girls under 17 years old in the United States while the average age of entry into prostitution is between 11 and 13.\n\nIn Ukraine, a survey conducted by the group “La Strada-Ukraine” in 2001-2003, based on a sample of 106 women being 'trafficked' out of Ukraine found that 3% were under 18, and the US State Department reported in 2004 that incidents of minors being trafficked was increasing. \n\nIn Thailand, NGOs have estimated that up to a third of prostitutes are children under 18. A study by the International Labor Organization on child prostitution in Vietnam reported that incidence of children in\nprostitution is steadily increasing and children under 18 make up between 5 percent and 20 percent of prostitution depending on the geographical area.\n\nIn the Philippines, UNICEF estimated that there are 60,000 child prostitutes and many of the 200 brothels in the notorious Angeles City offer children for sex.\n\nECPAT New Zealand and Stop Demand Foundation have cited in a report “The Nature and Extent of the Sex Industry in New Zealand,” a police survey of the New Zealand sex industry that 210 children under the age of 18 years were identified as selling sex, with three-quarters being concentrated in one Police District.\n\nThe 1996 report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography estimates that about one million children in Asia alone are victims of the sex trade. According to the International Labor Organization, the problem is especially alarming in Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia and Nepal.\n\nA 2006 report by World Vision Middle East/Eastern Europe funded by the Canadian government and supported by six United Nations agencies and the International Organization for Migration reported that the sexual exploitation of children, child trafficking and sexual violence towards minors is increasing and that Russia is becoming a new destination for child sex tourism. The report adds that some studies claim approximately 20 to 25 percent of Moscow's sex workers are minors.\n\nIn Africa and South Asia, many countries are faced with a rising child prostitution rate and the linkage with tourism is evident. Child prostitution and the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation is also increasing in Europe, North America, and Australia.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the City Social Assistance Secretary estimates that there are 223 child prostitutes, both boys and girls. Some are transvestites. The transactions are intermediated by pimps. They charge from 2 reals to 30 reals, which is approximately from 1 US dollar to 15 US dollars. The children are between 10 and 17 years old. In some cases, the families are involved in the prostitution.\n", "id": "140701", "title": "Child prostitution"}

When an adult becomes friends with a child, this is sometimes done for a reason. The reason is to lower the inhibitions of the child and to prepare for sexual abuse. So, action taken by an adult to form a trusting relationship with a child, with the intent of later having sexual contact, is 'child grooming'. \n\nThe act of grooming a child may include activities that are legal, but later lead to sexual contact. The grooming is done to gain the child's trust, and the trust of those responsible for the child. Children are less likely to report a crime if it involves someone the child knows, trusts, and cares about. Also, a relationship with the family means the child's parents will be less likely to believe any accusations.\n\n\nSexual grooming of children also occurs on the internet. Some abusers pose as children online and make arrangements to meet with them in person.\n\nIn 2003, MSN implemented restrictions in their chat rooms purportedly intended to help protect children from adults seeking sexual conversations with them. In 2005, Yahoo! chat rooms were investigated by the New York State attorney general's office for allowing users to create rooms whose names suggested that they were being used for this purpose. That October, Yahoo! agreed to \"implement policies and procedures designed to ensure\" that such rooms would not be allowed.\n\nAn organization called Perverted-Justice (known as PJ) uses PJ operatives posing as underage teens on the internet to identify potential child molesters and turn the information over to the police and the courts. The news program \"Dateline NBC\" features the recurring segment \"To Catch a Predator\", based on documenting such activities.\n\nAn organization called Crisp Thinking has created an expert service providing social platforms and apps with the risk protection they need to protect their users from sexual exploitation, child abuse images and trolls.\n\nAnother software company in the UK has developed a program that hold as competitor to Crisp, called Sentry Parental Controls. It was launched by television personality Coleen Nolan and is supported by Mark Williams-Thomas, a leading expert in child protection.\n", "id": "140707", "title": "Child grooming"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140713", "text": "Cynic\n\nThe Cynics (, ) were an important group of philosophers from the ancient school of Cynicism. Their philosophy taught that the purpose of life was to live a life of Virtue in agreement with Nature. This meant rejecting all the usual desires for wealth, power, health, and fame, and by living a life free from all possessions. People are reasoning creatures. They could therefore gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for humans. They believed that the world belonged equally to everyone, and that suffering was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless customs and conventions which surrounded society. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into Stoicism.\n\nThe first philosopher to outline these themes was Antisthenes, who had been a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BCE. He was followed by Diogenes of Sinope, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens, took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of Imperial Rome in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the Empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its ascetic and rhetorical ideas were adopted by early Christians.\n", "id": "140713", "title": "Cynic"}

In 2007, it was the most voted place in an online election to choose the \"Seven Wonders of Brazil\". The botanical garden houses part of the campus of the Federal University of Paraná. Is the unofficial symbol of the city. and of all the South Brazil.\nThe international identification code is CURIT.\n\nThe first Botanical Garden in Curitiba was the Passeio Público (\"Public Promenade Park\"), in 19th century. Inaugurated by the President of Paraná Province Alfredo d’Escragnolle Taunay, was the first public park of the city.\n\nThe official name - \"Jardim Botânico Fanchette Rischbieter\" - is a tribute to Francisca Maria (Fanchette) Garfunkel Rischbieter (1929-1989), pioneer planner in urban planning of Curitiba.\n\nOpened in the administration of Jewish Mayor Jaime Lerner, on October 5, 1991 on an old dump, was created in the style of French gardens. The design of flowerbeds geometrical gardens was inspired by the flag of the city, which can be clearly seen in an aerial view of the place. The greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them inspired in the Crystal Palace (a building that existed in London in 1851) were designed by the architect Abraão Assad, who also planned the Botanical Museum.\n\nThe Botanical Garden of Curitiba is the most know Curitiba's picture postcard landmark and contains many Brazilian plants and from other countries, spread across boulevards and greenhouses of iron and glass - the main one of them, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in England. \n\nOnce the portal of entry, may be seen extensive gardens in the French style in the middle of fountains, waterfalls and lakes, and the main greenhouse of 458 square meters, which holds in its interior, copies plants characteristic of tropical regions. It rolls out its carpet of flowers to the visitors right at the entrance, between 6 geometric gardens (each one illuminated by chandeliers with Republican-style, each with five lanterns), each with 4 flowerbeds - totaling 24 flowerbeds - enclosed by buxaceae and adorned with seasonal flowers. This occupies 278.000 m² in area. The principal greenhouse, with three domes, in an art nouveau style with a modern metallic structure, looks like the mid-19th century Crystal Palace in London, England. The Botanic Museum, which provides a national reference collection of native flora, attracts researchers from all over the world. It includes many botanic species from the moist Atlantic Forests of eastern Brazil. \n\nThe native forest have many paths for walk. Behind the greenhouse is the Museum of Franz Krajcberg, the Polish Brazilian artist who took up the cause of environmental conservation; with 1,320 square meters of area, divided into multimedia classrooms, an auditorium with 60 seats and lounge with several exhibitions of works donated by visual artist, represented by sculptures and reliefs, as well as photographs, videos, publications and educational materials.\n\nIn the other side is the Botanical Museum, a wooden building which entrance using a bridge made of wood also. Actually, the Botanical Museum of Curitiba has the fourth largest herbarium in the country. In front of the construction there is a pond with carp, turtles, teal, herons, etc., and offers a lake, an auditorium, a library, an expositions area and a theatre. The park also has tennis courts and a cycle track.\n\nMore than a postcard of the city, or a place for leisure and recreation, is a research center for the flora of Paraná, contributing to environmental education, preservation and conservation of nature.\n\nLike all botanical gardens, the curitiban has a great variety of plants and also has the objective of cultivate them, protect them, study them and reproduce them. \n\nIn 2008, another greenhouse was built to research, shelter and reproduction of Brazilian living plants - and in danger of extinction - and Brazilian native ornamental plants. In contrast to main greenhouse, this is not open to the public; it serves to scientific research and is home to rare plants to prevent disappearance of nature. It is made of polycarbonate and has internal system of irrigation and temperature control.\n\n\nIn order to appreciate the native plants, in 2007, the Garden of Native Plants of Curitiba was created; every plant in the garden is native, even the grass. Because it has no exotic plants, the garden attracts lots of butterflies and other pollinating insects\n\n\nIn the past, the Atlantic Forest was the second largest forest in Brazil; currently there is less than 5% of forest in the country.\n\nThis is the native vegetation of Curitiba. The araucaria moist forests are a subtropical moist forest ecoregion of southern Brazil, and is now one of the most endangered biomas of the world; corresponds to approximately 40% of the vegetation of the \"Jardim Botânico de Curitiba\". The park was created in order to protect this biodiversity.\n\nNext to one of the lakes, 200 seedlings of trees and shrubs native of the Serra do Mar of Paraná were planted; the Mountain Range of the Sea () is a 1,500 km long system of mountain ranges and escarpments in Southeastern Brazil, which runs in parallel to the Atlantic Ocean coast. Some planted species were cultivated on the coast of Paraná and then transplanted into the garden of plants of the Serra do Mar.\n\n\nEvery year, in July, the prunus serrulata blossoms; there are about 30 trees, planted in a path that connects the parking to the portal of entrance of the park.\n\nIn the capital city of Parana, the first seedlings were taken by Japanese immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, but began to be planted in large quantities from the 1990s, with the opening of the Botanical Garden. Now the seedlings are produced by the city and used in afforestation of streets and squares.\n\n\nOpened in 2008, the \"Jardim das Sensações\" is a track of 200 meters long where visitors walk blindfolded (without the vision) to know some plants and natural landscapes using the other senses. More than 70 plant species with smells, textures, shapes and sizes fill the course of the Garden. \n\nOccupies an area of 2381 meters square surrounded by trees that help to isolate external noise and, to guarantee the surprise, it is hidden by a fence of bamboo. All elements of the track are identified in Braille, the language made with points in high relief used by blind persons. The space is free and monitored, where small groups are organized to make the experience (that can walk the path with or without the blindfold). Receives approximately 5,000 visitors per week.\n\n\n\n\nThe Museu Botânico de Curitiba (\"Botanical Museum of Curitiba\") is inside the Botanical Garden of the city; has ample space for exhibitions, library and auditorium. Was founded in 1965, when the botanical Gerdt Günther Hatschbach donated his private collection to the municipality of Curitiba. Today, the collection is the fourth largest in Brazil, with more than 333,000 specimens.\n\nThe Museum has developed an exchange program for botanical material, and exchanges material with 207 institutions worldwide (53 in Brazil, 154 in other places). Due to this program, around 90% of the collection has been identified by specialists; it makes the Botanical Museum of Curitiba an international reference for botanical material - receives annually an average of 400 research scientist visitors, and includes specialists and graduate students.\n\nEach year, the collection increases by approximately 15,000 specimens.\n\nAmor Materno (\"Maternal Love\") - Sculpture of Polish artist João Zaco Paraná (stage name of Jan Żak) (1884-1961), cast in bronze and placed in a fountain. This sculpture was made in 1907 (in the same year, the Polish-Brazilian artist won the special prize of the \"Hall of Fine Arts in Brussels\"), and was donated by the Polish colony of Brazil to honor all paranaense mothers in the celebration of 300th anniversary of the city in 1993.\n\nZaco Paraná immigrated with his parents to Brazil in 1896; was the author of many monuments, statues, sculptures, etc. in several Brazilian states and around the world.\n\nTorso do Trabalhador (\"Worker's Trunk\") - Sculpture of paranaense artist Erbo Stenzel (1911-1980), cast in bronze and placed inside the glasshouse, in a fountain. This sculpture was made in 1941 and was placed in 1994 to honor all the workers of the world, when Curitiba hosted the \"World Habitat Day\" in 1995 - an event celebrated by UN to make reflection on the situation of cities and the human right to adequate housing, as well remind the world of its collective responsibility for the habitat for future generations.\n\nErbo Stenzel was born in Parana State, descendant of Germans and Austrians; held many monuments and sculptures of political personalities of the state and about local culture.\n\nThe \"Frans Krajcberg Cultural Space\" is behind the main greenhouse. Originally opened to be a orchidary, received the artworks in 2003, including 110 large sculptures (all made from the remains of burned or illegally cut down trees), reliefs, photographs, videos and texts. The name \"The Revolt\" expresses the artist's feeling about the complete destruction caused by man in the Brazilian forests. There is also an exhibit of photos taken by the sculptor and selling books related to the artist. The main purpose of the space is, according to Krajcberg, environmental awareness. All works were donated by the artist.\n\nKrajcberg was born in 1921, in Poland. Son of a Jewish family who disappeared in 1945 (in the Holocaust), left for Brazil in 1948 and became a naturalized Brazilian years later. Received many awards around the world, and other \"Frans Krajcberg Cultural Space\" - but in Paris. But in Curitiba Botanic Garden was the first place in the world that was specifically designed to house his works. The gallery receives about 60,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe new Botanical Garden was part of many other creations of Mayor Jaime Lerner, who at time had created the slogan for the city \"The Ecological Capital of Brazil\". It quickly became an icon of the city, and the image of the main greenhouse is the most landmark used in advertising about the city, becoming the unofficial symbol of Curitiba and of all the South region of Brazil.\n\nThe city of Concórdia, in Santa Catarina state, built a mall inspired in the greenhouse of the Botanical Garden; another construction evidently inspired is the Shopping Pátio Higienópolis, in São Paulo City. The logo for the candidacy of Curitiba as the host city of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil was also inspired in the park's glasshouse.\n\nAs the best known place in the city, the image of greenhouse is used from many manifestations: since 2008, the park lights are turned off by one hour as a way to join the Earth Hour (an global event organized by World Wide Fund for Nature - WWF - held on the last Saturday of March annually); every year, in October, the greenhouse is illuminated with pink, to support the \"Breast Cancer Awareness Month\"; in December, an Christmas decoration is made, as part of the \"Christmas of Light\". And a thousand days to the World Cup in Brazil (2014), between 16 and 23 September 2011 was made an tribute with the light colors of the flags of each country that has won the championship: Brazil, Italy, Germany, Uruguay, Argentina, England, France and Spain. At the same year Curitiba became part of the cities engaged in the \"Decade of Action for Road Safety\", by United Nations; the yellow color, that in traffic means \"attention\", lighted the greenhouse.\nThe park has Wi-Fi at many places. To access the network of free wireless internet is necessary first register on the site of Passport Curitiba.\n\nThe Irineu Marinho Velodrome (also known as Curitiba Velodrome) was opened in 1979 and is the first Brazilian velodrome to have a public cycling school. The measurements are Olympic, with 333,33 meters long and holds national and international competitions.\n\nIn 1982, it was refurbished and in 2002 and underwent a major renovation. Due to the work of their coaches, became an important way to formation of many of Brazil's best cyclists, male or female, forming teams representing the state and the country to participate in national championships, international and Olympic.\n\nThe Velodrome Center for Sport and Leisure\n\nThe \"Center for Sport and Recreation\" has the velodrome cycling track, courts to beach football and sand volleyball, and three tennis courts. It offers activities guided by physical education teachers, like gymnastics, walking and cycling.

The area forms the border of Bangladesh with the Republic of India and Burma. It was a single district of East Pakistan till 1971. In that year it was divided into three separate districts: Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban. Topographically, this is the only hill intensive area of the People's Republic. With a population of Around 800,000 Indigenous peoples (Native (non-Bengali). The Chittagong Hill Tracts is one of the most diverse regions in the country in terms of geography, ethnicity, culture and traditions of the people. The indigenous distinct Jumma people are distinct and different from the majority Bengali people of present-day \"Bangla-desh\" in respect of race, language, culture, heritage, religion, political history and economy.\n\nWhen India was split into two separate countries in 1948, the Radcliffe Line gave this area to East Pakistan (Bangladesh), which was mostly Muslim, even though most people in the area were Buddhists. Today most people are Buddhist, some Christians and animists. The major ethnic groups among 13 peoples are the Chakma, Tipra, Murong and Magh, Marma, Tanchangya, Mro, Lushai, Khumi, Chak, Khiyang, Bawm, Pangkhua and with the Ten indigenous languages. Beside, a very small number of descendants of Ahamiya, Gorkha and Santal also live there. They collectively identify themselves as the Jumma people (High Landers), the first people of the CHT.but almost 50% of the present day's population are immigrated Bengali Muslim settlers. Since the Independence of Bangla-Desh the indigenous population was faced with increasing immigration of settlers from the mainland, fostered by the central nationalist government. Among the tribal nations first political and civil, later (since the 1980s) armed resistance was organised, especially by the Shanti Bahini guerrilla movement. In reaction the whole region was heavily militarised and the police and army unleashed a wide spread repression with a serious human rights violations. The 5-points-manifesto of the Jana Samhati Samiti, released on 7 September 1987, was focused on a well entrenched Autonomy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn 2 December 1997 a \"Peace agreement\" was signed by the government and Parvatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti, the political platform of the indigenous peoples, granting a limited level of autonomy to three districts of CHT. The Jana Samhati Samiti transformed into a party, but this treaty has never been implemented, as it was opposed by both the opposition parties of Bangla Desh and by the majority fraction of the Shanti Bahini. The previous nationalists Bangla Desh government of Khaleda Zia promised to re-launch the peace process, but until now did not accomplish with its promises.\n\nBefore the colonization, the indigenous Jumma people of CHT were independent. There had been no external interference by any outside power in the affairs of the CHT until 1787, when an agreement was signed with the British. British colonization actually started in 1860. From 1787 to 1860 the British government did not intervene in the internal administration of the CHT. After 1860 and until 1900 the British government administered CHT through a set of Rules promulgated from time to time. For the maintenance of discipline among the police personnel in the CHT, Frontier Police Regulation III of 1881 was promulgated on the 7 December 1881 and CHT Police Force was raised with indigenous Jumma people. For the good government of the CHT, in 1900 the British government enacted the CHT Regulation 1 of 1900 and declared it as an Excluded Area, in order to protect the Jumma people from economic exploitation by non-indigenous Bengali people and to preserve their traditional socio-cultural and political institutions based on customary laws, community ownership of land and so on.\n\nIn August 1947, the British handed over the administration of CHT to the then new Government of Pakistan. The Pakistani government recognized CHT as an Excluded Area and even in the first Constitution of Pakistan, which was adopted in 1956, CHT was declared as an Excluded Area under the CHT Regulation of 1900. From the very outset, the Pakistani government looked upon the Jumma people with an eye of suspicion for being anti-Pakistani as well as anti-Islamic. There was discrimination against the Jumma people in employment, business and education. The government policy was clearly revealed by the repeal of the CHT Frontier Police Regulation of 1881, thus disbanding the Jumma police force in 1948. Even in 1950, in implementing its brazen designs violating the principles and spirit of the CHT Regulation of 1900, the Government of Pakistan started Bengali Muslim settlement program, which continued up to 1966. The government had enacted the CHT (Land Acquisition) Regulation in 1958 in order to grab Jumma people’s ancestral lands. Moreover, the government snatched away the rights and privileges of the Jumma people by canceling the Excluded Area status of the CHT in 1963. In 1960, in order to carry out its plan and break down the economic backbone of the Jumma people of the CHT in the name of so-called industrial development, the Pakistani government built the Kaptai hydro-electric dam on the Karnaphuli river in the heartland of the indigenous Jumma people.\n\nDuring the Separatists War of 1971, the then Chakma King sided with the Pakistanis, so when independence came, the Adivasis’ plea for special status fell on deaf ears. The Chakma king left for Pakistan and later became that country’s ambassador to Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, more and more Bengalis were migrating into the area, usurping the land. In 1973 the Adivasis initiated an insurgency. To counter it, the government, in 1979, started issuing permits to landless Bengalis to settle there, with title to tribal land. This practice continued for six years and resulted in a mass migration of approximately 400,000 people into the area – almost as many as all the tribal groups combined. Countless human-rights abuses occurred as the army tried to put down the revolt.\n\nFrom 1973 until 1997 the Hill Tracts area was the scene of a guerrilla war between the Bangladeshi army and the Shanti Bahini rebels. The troubles stemmed from the cultural clash between the tribal groups and the plains people. After nine months of war of separatism against Pakistan, Bangladesh emerged as an independent state on 16 December 1971. The Jumma people then had hoped that the new rulers of Bangladesh would realize their hopes and aspirations. So the Jumma people demanded to the then government for regional autonomy in a democratic way. Unfortunately, the government of Bangladesh did not respect their fundamental rights and did not write even a single word in the Constitution regarding the entity and safeguard of the Jumma people. Rather, immediately following the independence of Bangladesh in early 1972 the CHT underwent militarization. When the democratic movement to safeguard the national existence of the Jumma people was negotiated by the government with repressive measures through the civil and police administrations, including through militarization with the construction of three Army cantonments, it forced Manabendra Narayan Larma, the then MP and the hero of the CHT Jumma movement, to call for an armed struggle. An armed wing of PCJSS was formed with the name of Shanti Bahini (Peace Force). Since 1979 the Government of Bangladesh has undertaken a drastic program to settle the Bengali population from other Districts of Bangladesh to CHT, so that they would outnumber the Jumma people and use them as human shields for the protection of the Army personnel. At least four hundred thousands of Bengali Muslims were transferred into the CHT and settled on Jumma people’s lands.\n\nThe PCJSS has always kept the door open for dialogue for resolving the CHT problem through political and peaceful means. For this purpose, the PCJSS held 6 and 13 times formal dialogues with the governments of Ershad and Khaleda Zia respectively. During the last one, after holding 7 round of dialogues with Sheikh Hasina government, the 'CHT Accord' was signed between the National Committee on the CHT on behalf of the government of Bangladesh and the PCJSS on behalf of the permanent residents of the CHT in Dhaka on 2 December 1997.\n", "id": "140770", "title": "Chittagong Hill Tracts"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140775", "text": "Kerberos (protocol)\n\nKerberos (pronounced \"kur-ber-uhs\") is a computer network authentication protocol, which allows people communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. It is also a suite of free software published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that implements this protocol. Its designers aimed primarily at a client-server model, and it provides mutual authentication — both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against spying and replay attacks.\n\nKerberos performs authentication as a trusted third party authentication service by using cryptographic shared secret under the assumption that packets traveling along the insecure network can be read, modified, and inserted. Kerberos builds on symmetric-key cryptography and requires a key distribution center. Extensions to Kerberos can provide for the use of public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication.\n\nMIT developed Kerberos to protect network services provided by Project Athena. The protocol was named after the Greek mythological character \"Kerberos\" (or \"Cerberus\"), known in Greek mythology as being the monstrous three-headed guard dog of Hades. Several versions of the protocol exist; versions 1–3 used only internally at MIT.\n\nSteve Miller and Clifford Neuman, the primary designers of Kerberos version 4 (which used the DES encryption algorithm with 56-bit keys),\npublished that version in 1989, although they had targeted it primarily for Project Athena. \nVersion 5, designed by John Kohl and Clifford Neuman, appeared as RFC 1510 in 1993 (made obsolete by RFC 4120 in 2005), with the intention of overcoming the limitations and security problems of Version 4. The MIT makes an implementation of Kerberos Version 5 freely available, under a software license similar to that used by BSD license.\n\nSeveral companies used Kerberos Version 5 in commercial software including:\n\nIn 2005, the IETF Kerberos working group introduced a new updated specifications for Kerberos Version 5 . updates include:\n\nIn 2007, MIT formed the Kerberos Consortium for continuation of development.\n\nKerberos uses as its basis the Needham-Schroeder protocol. It makes use of a trusted third party authentication known as \"key distribution center (KDC)\", which consists of two logically separate parts: an Authentication Server (AS) and a Ticket Granting Server (TGS). Kerberos works on the basis of \"tickets\" (called Kerberos tickets) which serve to prove the identity of users.\n\nKerberos database: The key distribution center (KDC) maintains a database of secret keys; each entity on the network — whether a client or a server — shares a secret key known only to itself and to the KDC. Knowledge of this key serves to prove the identity of each entity. For communication between two entities, the KDC generates a session key which they can use to secure their communications.\n\nThe term \"Kerberos server\" generally refers to the KDC. For reliability purposes, it is possible to have backup KDCs. These are referred to as \"Kerberos slave servers\". All slaves synchronize their databases from the master Kerberos server.\n\nThe term \"Kerberized application server\" generally refers to Kerberized programs that clients communicate with using Kerberos tickets for authentication. For example, the Kerberos telnet server is an example of a Kerberized application server . While the term The term \"Kerberized applications\" is used to referrer to the client side of Kerberized application server , For example, the Kerberos telnet client is an example of a Kerberized applications\n\nThe security of the protocol depends heavily on:\n\nThe following abbreviations will be used:\n\nBriefly, the client authenticates to AS using a long-term \"shared secret\" and receives a ticket from the AS. Later the client can use this ticket to get additional tickets for SS using the same shared secret. These tickets can be used to prove authentication to SS.\n\nUser Client-based Logon Steps:\n\n\nClient Authentication Steps:\n\n\nClient Service Authorization Steps:\n\n\nClient Service Request Steps:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "140775", "title": "Kerberos (protocol)"}

Therefore, his started to protest against the government. He thought war was a bad thing, so it was necessary to resist government.  That led to him being put into jail. Although people gave him advice to pay the tax, he still didn't pay it. He didn't fear the government and at the same time inspired other people to join this protest.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140842", "text": "Naturism\n\nNaturism or nudism (from Latin \"nudus\" - \"nude\") is a term used by many action groups in society. These action groups usually want to spread the news that being naked is a good feeling, even around other people, and often with males and females mixed together. Usually, nakedness is seen without any relation to sex. Rather, these action groups want to enjoy common activities in the nude, like bathing. Often, they also want to do things nude where this is not really necessary, like naked bicycle tours.\n\nIt is difficult to know exactly when naturism began as an action group. In 1903, Paul Zimmermann opened the first club, \"Freilichtpark\" (in English, \"Free Light Park\"), near Hamburg, Germany. In the United States, German immigrant Kurt Barthel organized the first nudist event in the forest just outside of New York City. His club was called \"the American League for Physical Culture\" (ALPC) and started in the late 1920's. Zimmermann's vice president was a man named Ilsley Boone. Boone had been a minister (religious leader) of a large church. He quit to become involved with naturism all the time, and soon replaced Zimmermann as president. Also, he renamed the ALPC as the \"American Sunbathing Association.\" Since 1995, it is known as the \"American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR).\"\n\nNaturists come from many different social classes and backgrounds, and practice naturism for very different reasons. In addition, religion can effect how people dress. Islam generally does not allow anyone to be seen naked by others, except married couples in private, and young children by their parents and caregivers. Traditional Judaism is similar, but less strict about a group of people of the same sex. In India, Hinduism and Jainism have a few rituals with male nudism. Buddhism has little to say about naturism. If practiced, it is considered more of a way of living, than anything religious. Within Christianity, nudity and naturism are probably the most complicated of all religions. Many Christians have similar views as those of traditional Judaism, the religion from which Christianity began and grew out of. Others, called \"Christian naturists,\" believe it is alright to be nude, and even to live nude, unless it is for the wrong reason or forced. The human body is considered by them to be the greatest creation of God, and is neither shameful nor should be covered. In addition, they believe it was the devil, not God, who told Adam and Eve that they were naked upon eating from a fruit tree which was not theirs.\n\n", "id": "140842", "title": "Naturism"}

The Kansas Turnpike is owned and repaired by the Kansas Turnpike Authority (KTA), which is based in Wichita.\n\nThe Kansas Turnpike was built between 1954 and 1956. It was built before the Interstate Highway System. The turnpike was not part of the Interstate System at first. However, it became part of the system in 1956. Parts of the turnpike also are parts of four Interstate Highways: I-35, I-335, I-470, and I-70.\n\nAround 120,000 people use the Kansas Turnpike every day. KTA helps users by running a radio station about the road. It has also built places called \"service areas\" where people can stop and rest, and buy gasoline and things to eat. One service area has a memorial to American football coach Knute Rockne, who died near the turnpike.\n\nThe Kansas Turnpike Authority does not need tax money to pay for repairs to the road.

Afterwards, he taught psychology at universities and later on, got married to his former student Alice Chipman. In 1886, he started a new school which came to be known as the \"Laboratory School\" or \"Dewey School\". This school taught pragmatism, which says that a school's curriculum should be based on everyday life, lessons, and focuses on hands-on activities to better help students learn. His wife Alice was principal of the \"Dewey School\" from 1901 to 1904. After he retired as a teacher, he continued watching and figuring the society and politics. John Dewey died in 1952.\n\nJohn Dewey believed in the \"theory of inquiry\", which shows how animals survived in their environment. He used the theory in the way he taught. He said that children learn best with real-life problems and hands-on activities.

The tramway was built in 1885. It is one of the oldest electric tramways in the world and is the only one of the earliest tramways that is still in operation in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe tramway is owned by Blackpool Borough Council and is run by Blackpool Transport as part of the \"Metro Coastlines\" network. The tramway runs for , and over 6,500,000 people travel on it each year.\n\nThe first part of Blackpool tramway opened on 29 September 1885. It was a conduit line. It ran from Cocker Street to Dean Street on the Blackpool Promenade. This was one of the first practical electric tramways built in the world. It opened six years after Werner von Siemens first showed electric traction. At the opening was Holroyd Smith, the person who created the system, and Alderman Harwood, the Mayor of Manchester, along with many other people.\n\nThe \"Blackpool Electric Tramway Company\" ran the line until 1892. At this point, the lease on the line finished, and Blackpool Corporation then ran the line. In 1895 another line was added. It ran from Manchester Square along Lytham Road to South Shore. In 1897 the tracks were extended to South Pier. A line was also built on Station Road that connected Lytham Road to the promenade.\n\nThe conduit system was changed to overhead wires in 1899. In 1900 the line was built more to the north to Gynn Square. It linked up the \"Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad\" there. The Marton loop opened in 1901. It connected Talbot Square and Central Station along Church Street, Devonshire Square, Whitegate Drive, Waterloo Road and Central Drive. At Whitegate Drive in Marton a new depot was built. Another line was added from Talbot Square along Talbot Road to Layton on 1902. The promenade line had got as far as the Pleasure Beach by 1903.\n\nThe Blackpool Corporation took over the \"Blackpool & Fleetwood Tramroad Company\" in 1920. The Corporation got eight miles of track and three depots from the take-over. Two depots were in Fleetwood and one was in Bispham. The small Bold Street Depot in Fleetwood was closed and a new loop was built at Fleetwood Ferry.\n\nThe depot at Blundell Street was replaced by a bigger one on Rigby Road in 1920. In 1925 the line to Fleetwood was made more direct between Rossall and Broadwater. The last extension was built in 1926. It went along the promenade to Clifton Drive at Starr Gate. A connection was made there with the Lytham St Annes tracks.\n\nThe first route closure took place in 1936. They were the Central Drive and Layton routes. In 1961 Lytham Road closed, and Marton closed one year later. The tramroad line on Dickson Road to North Station closed in 1963. Marton and Copse Road Depots closed in the same year. The depot at Bispham closed in 1966. All that was left was the track running from Starr Gate to Fleetwood. It is still there today. The running of the buses and tramway was handed over to Blackpool Transport Services Limited in 1986 by Blackpool Borough Council.\n\nToday the tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to the Ferry Terminus in Fleetwood. Most of the route runs along the Fylde Coast sea front. At Cleveleys the line turns inland for a few miles. It then returns to the coast in Fleetwood. There are four different types of track:\n\n\nOn the line there are four turning loops. One is at Starr Gate, another is opposite the Pleasure Beach and two more are at Little Bispham and Fleetwood. There is also one that links into Rigby Road Depot.\n\nBlackpool runs a mix of double-deck and single-deck cars, though there are more single-deck trams in the fleet. The double-deck trams are used the most in the tourist season. The single-deck trams are not used as much at that time. They are sometimes used though when it is busy to let the system carry more passengers. Blackpool was the only town in the UK that kept its trams. Between 1962 and 1992 Blackpool was the only town with a tramway in the UK that was not a preserved system. The last English city to lose its trams was Sheffield in 1960. The last in the UK was Glasgow in 1962. Trams have been returning to the towns and cities in Britain since the Manchester Metrolink opened in Manchester in 1992.\n\nThere are lots of different trams in the fleet at Blackpool. Most of them were built in the 1930s and are still in service in an unchanged condition. Some others have had their bodywork changed. Sometime historic trams are borrowed from the National Tramway Museum in Crich and other museums for public service.\nThe trams from Starr Gate in the south to Fleetwood in the north. At busy periods such as the Blackpool Illuminations or on bank holidays services start or finish short at Cleveleys, Bispham or the Pleasure Beach. This means that more trams can run through the centre of Blackpool in a small period. When the Illuminations are on specially decorated trams carry passengers along the promenade and the illuminated area. The area runs from Starr Gate to Bispham. Until the opening of the Metrolink, Fleetwood was the only town in England that kept trams running down the main street.\n\nIn November 2007 the whole tramway closed for the first time. It was closed for five months for the second part of an £11,800,000 upgrade. Blackpool Transport Services and Blackpool Council currently have a joint bid awaiting Government approval. It could give up to £77,000,000 for a total upgrade of the trams and tracks. In January 2007 the City Class 611 prototype \"supertram\" was being tested on the tramway. It caught fire as it approached Central Pier. This caused lots of damage. The driver managed to get out of the cab. The tram was built by Mersyside-based Tram Power. It was being tested as part of a bid to replace the current trams. The same tram had already derailed on 30 May 2006 at Starr Gate loop in trials then. A Rail Accident Investigation Board report said that the derailmet was because of wear and tear on the track. They said another factor was the new type of running gear on the two-car prototype.\nThe company paid £150,000 to rebuild the tramcar. It cannot be re-tested until November 2008 at the earliest though. This is because testing is not allowed during the busy summer months and also because of the earlier closure of the tracks for repairs.\nA £1 billion bid for a Government grant was made in 2002 by Blackpool Council and Lancashire County Council after the Government made a to build 25 new tram networks by 2010. They want to expand the tram network to include St Annes to the south and new housing estates in Fleetwood to the north. There is a possible further phase to include links to Poulton-le-Fylde and Thornton. In 2004 campaigners behind the bid expressed disappointment that nothing had been done to take the plans forward in two years. By November 2007 there was no further development.\n\n\n", "id": "140910", "title": "Blackpool tramway"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140929", "text": "Combined oral contraceptive pill\n\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is a contraceptive for women. It is often called birth control pill or simply \"The Pill.\" The pills contain hormones that make the women who take them infertile. Women who take the pill will not become pregnant during sexual intercourse. When a woman stops taking the pills, she will usually become fertile again. When taken as prescribed, the pills are one of the safest methods of contraception.\n\nIn the 1950s, scientists (such as Carl Djerassi) realized that the hormone progesterone stopped women from making eggs (stopped ovulation). After this discovery, the combined oral contraceptive pill was created. The combined oral contraceptive pill has two female hormones: estrogen and progesterone. Some oral contraceptive pills have only progesterone. These are often called the \"minipill\".\n\nThe combined oral contraceptive pill is thought to be safe and usually works well.\n\nIn the United States, the combined oral contraceptive pill was first given to women in 1960. It is extremely effective at preventing pregnancy if it is used in the right way. It may also make women's menses shorter and with less bleeding, which most women like. And unlike barrier methods, hormonal methods do not interfere with sex. When a woman is \"on the Pill,\", she and her man are usually not even aware of it during sexual intercourse, which seems and feels very natural. The couple can have sex at any time they wish; they don’t need to interrupt foreplay to put birth control in place, and they can feel the physical sensations and emotional closeness of intercourse without interference from a make or female condom. Unlike coitus interruptus, when a woman is on the Pill, intercourse usually ends with her man reaching orgasm while inside the vagina, which both the man and woman usually find very pleasurable. For all of these reasons, the Pill is very popular. In 2005, more than 80 million women across the world used the Pill. It is the most common method of contraception in the United States. Use of the Pill is different in different countries, and among women of different ages and levels of education. Both single women and married women use the Pill in large numbers.\n\nThe Pill has some slight risks for side effects. It may make a very small increase in the risk of blood clots in the lungs, strokes, heart attacks, and breast cancer. Most of these risk are small. Some women may experience mood swings, weight gain, or loss of sex drive. Sometimes, but rarely, these side effects are serious enough to make a woman decide to stop using the Pill.\n\nThe choices a woman has for contraception - and whether contraception is even available - depends on what country she lives in. These things are different in different countries. In the United Kingdom, one out of every 4 women aged 16–49 were using the Pill as at 2006 (either the combined pill or progestogen only pill (\"minipill\")). compared to only 1% of women in Japan. \n\nLocal culture and habits may also affect whether or not people use the Pill. \n\nIn some countries, women do not really have a choice because only one kind of contraception is available. In some countries (like Algeria, Morocco, and Zimbabwe), the Pill is the most common method offered by national family planning programs. In other countries, like India, national family planning programs only offer female sterilization (a surgery which makes a woman unable to ever have children again). Other countries, like Egypt and Vietnam, only offer the IUD, intrauterine device.\n\nThere are two major kinds of oral contraceptive pills. The first kind has both estrogen and progesterone in it. The other only has progesterone (these are called progesterone-only pills, or POPs). The pills do not actually have natural hormones in them. Instead, they have other chemical substances that are mostly the same as the hormones, but have been made in a laboratory. \n\nSome women can only take one kind of COCP. For example, estrogen stops the breast from producing milk. Because of this, women who are breastfeeding should not take pills that have estrogen in them. There are also some other types of women who should not be given estrogen. These women should only use progesterone-only pills.\n\nWhile there are just two major kinds of birth control pills (COCPs and POPs), there are many different brands or versions of each kind of pill. Every brand of COCP will have the same hormones (estrogen and progesterone) in it. However, each brand has a different amount of hormones in it. Also, some brands change the amount of hormones given from week to week.\n\nThere are two ways to measure how well COCPs work. (Most forms of birth control are also measured in these two ways.):\nTo show how well the Pill works, scientists figure out rates of effectiveness (for perfect use and for actual/typical use). These rates show how many women are kept from getting pregnant by the Pill. Rates of effectiveness usually look at how well the Pill works during the first year that women are using the Pill. Most often, the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates. However, some studies use decrement tables.\n\nThe typical use pregnancy rate for women taking COCPs measures how many women get pregnant while taking COCPs. All women are not equally likely to get pregnant while taking COCPs. Different groups of women have different typical use pregnancy rates. Overall, between 2% and 8% of women taking COCPs get pregnant every year. If COCPs are used perfectly, only 0.3% become pregnant each year.\n\nThere are a few reasons why women do not use the Pill perfectly. Because of these things, typical use effectiveness is lower than perfect use effectiveness.\n\nCOCPs can prevent pregnancy if the first pill is taken no later than 5 days after a woman starts menstruating. If the treatment is started at any other time in the menstrual cycle, COCPs cannot safely prevent pregnancy for the first 7 days of use. During this time, a woman needs to use other types of contraception in order to prevent pregnancy. When active pills have been taken for 7 days, COCPs can work well to prevent pregnancy. COCPs should be taken at about the same time every day.\n\nCertain things can make COCPs not work as well:\n\nSome other medicines can interact with COCPs and make them not work as well. These medicines can also cause breakthrough bleeding (where a woman bleeds between her periods). Some of these medicines are:\n\nThe traditional medicinal herb St. John's Wort also seems to make COCPs not work as well. This is because of the way St. John's Wort affects the liver.\n\nThe Pill can be used for other things besides contraception. There are many medical conditions that are caused by problems with hormone levels. Because the Pill has hormones in it, it can treat these conditions. Some of these conditions are:\nIf a woman's menstrual cycle is not regular, the Pill can make the woman menstruate on a regular schedule. The Pill can also be used to treat certain problems that cause bleeding from the uterus.\n\nWomen who use combined oral contraceptives are less likely to get cancer of the ovaries. If a woman takes Pill for five years, her risk for getting ovarian cancer is cut in half. Women taking the Pill are also only half as likely to get endometrial cancer than women who have never taken the Pill. The longer a woman uses the Pill, the more her risk of getting endometrial cancer drops. However, women who take the Pill have a higher risk of getting breast cancer and cervical cancer.\n", "id": "140929", "title": "Combined oral contraceptive pill"}

A client-server application is a distributed system made up of both client and server software. Client server application provide a better way to share the workload.The client process always initiates a connection to the server, while the server process always waits for requests from any client. When both the client process and server process are running on the same computer, this is called a single seat setup.\n\nAnother type of related software architecture is known as peer-to-peer, because each host or application instance can simultaneously act as both a client and a server (unlike centralized servers of the client-server model) and because each has equivalent responsibilities and status. Peer-to-peer architectures are often abbreviated using the acronym P2P.\n\nThe client-server relationship describes the relation between the client and how it makes a service request to the server, and how the server can accept these requests, process them, and return the requested information to the client. The interaction between client and server is often described using sequence diagrams. Sequence diagrams are standardized in the Unified Modeling Language.\n\nBoth client-server and P2P architectures are in wide usage today.\n\nThe basic type of client-server software architecture employs only two types of hosts: clients and servers. This type of architecture is sometimes referred to as two-tier. The two-tier architecture means that the client acts as one tier and server process acts as the other tier.\n\nThe client-server software architecture has become one of the basic models of network computing. Many types of applications have been written using the client-server model. Standard networked functions such as E-mail exchange, web access and database access, are based on the client-server model. For example, a web browser is a client program at the user computer that may access information at any web server in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "140934", "title": "Client-server"}

It is most often applied in the arts (i.e., music, literature, and performance). This includes:\n\n\nThe mainstream includes all popular culture, usually by mass media. An example of the opposite of the mainstream is counterculture. The term is sometimes used as a negative term. In the United States, Protestant with a mix of conservative, moderate, and liberal theologies are sometimes referred to as \"mainstream.\"\n\nMainstream movies can be defined as movies that cost much to make and are created for profit. To pay the cost and make the profit they are made so very many people will want to pay to see them. They have a wide release to first run theaters. Those are movie theaters that run mostly new mainstream movies from the major movie companies. After their time in first-run theaters, mainstream movies are sold at popular stores. Hollywood and Bollywood movies are usually considered mainstream, and may also be blockbusters. The boundary is vague. An example of the opposite of mainstream movie is art films.\n\nIn literature, \"mainstream\" refers to traditional realistic fiction, as opposed to genre fictions such as science fiction or mysteries.\n\nMainstream music refers to music that is familiar to and popular with the majority of people in their culture. For example, popular music or pop music. However, older generations often dislike the mainstream taste of the youth, and may not agree as to what is or is not mainstream.\n\nOpposing mainstream music is the music of subcultures. This exists in most all genres of music and is commonly found in punk rock, indie rock, and extreme metal, among others. In the 1960s, the music of the hippie counterculture exemplified this music. In more recent years, alternative rock, such as the music of Nirvana, has managed to maintain popularity in the mainstream music market even though their music did not conform to mainstream standards.\n\nPunk rock has set itself apart from other non-mainstream genres by self-asserting an active \"anti\"-mainstream social movement that resists commercialism and corporate control. The punk subculture usually does not appreciate major label bands that play punk music that denies the do it yourself (DIY) punk ethic, and thinks they are the same as mainstream music. Indie rock that surfaced in the early 1990s underground took this same DIY ethic. Many anti-corporate and not-for-profit forms of alternative protest have surfaced in the punk underground, for example, self-made publications known as \"zines\", where there is greater freedom to discuss controversial (usually far left) political issues such as bigotry, LGBT community issues, feminism, militant atheism, and veganism. And though the mainstream media often views this as a youthful expression of rebellion, modern punk embodies a range of age groups who generally disagree with the perceived shared countercultural principals and it is not uncommon for middle-aged people to form punk houses (houses where people of the punk subculture live and open to others to stay, including touring bands) and resistance movements against what they see as the widespread, unfair use of human and animal rights for profit. This modern group is effectively voiced through the anarcho-punk and crust punk subcultures, in attempt to fight what is seen by those groups as a general of, and way to profit from, life.\n\nMainstreaming refers to a type of education where children with a learning disability are mixed into classes with children without learning disabilities to help them learn better and to become comfortable with the \"mainstream\" of student life and life in their community. This is normally called \"integration\". When their needs cannot be met, they must be moved to special schools.\n", "id": "140957", "title": "Mainstream"}

Subcultures can be hobbies, groups or communities. A subculture is a group of people with a culture (whether distinct or hidden) which makes them different from the larger culture that they belong to, known as the \"dominant\" culture. If a subculture is described as opposing the dominant culture, it may be described as a counterculture. As Ken Gelder notes, subcultures are social, with their own shared rules, values and rituals, but they can also seem self-involved—another thing that makes them different from countercultures.\n\nSubcultures can be shown to be different because of the age, race, ethnicity, social class, location, or gender of the members. The qualities that determine a subculture as different from each other may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors. Members of a subculture often signal each other through the use of fashion style, certain behaviors, and use of a secret language created to prevent others not in their group from understanding them (this is known as Argot). They also live out particular relations to places: Ken Gelder talks about 'subcultural geographies' along these lines.\n\nThe study of subcultures often involves the study of symbolism attached to clothing, music and other visible things by members of subcultures, and also the ways that these same symbols are seen and understood by members of the dominate culture. Subcultures have been documented by others for a long time. In some cases—such as homeless people, criminal gangs or skateboarders—subcultures have had laws created to control or end their activities.

It is 310m above sea-level and about 300 km west of Sydney. Cowra is on the banks of the Lachlan River.\n\nThe first name for Cowra was \"Coura Rocks\". This may have been the name of one of the first cattle farms.

The first European explorer, George Wilson Evans, came into the Lachlan Valley in 1815. He named the area the Oxley Plains after his boss, the Surveyor-General, John Oxley. In 1817 he said the area was \"unfit for white settlement\". An army camp was set up soon after at Soldiers Flat near present-day Billimari. Arthur Ranken and James Sloan, from Bathurst, were amongst the first European settlers on the Lachlan. They moved to the area in 1831.\n\nThe township of Coura Rocks began in 1840. By 1847 the township was called Cowra. The village was officially listed in 1849.\n\nIn the 1850s many people looking for gold went through on their way to the gold fields at Lambing Flat (Young) and Grenfell. The first school was started in 1857. The first bridge over the Lachlan River was built in 1870. Gold was found at Mount McDonald in the 1880s. The railway, from Sydney, reached Cowra in 1886. Local government started in 1888. The first telephone were connected in 1901. The town water supply was started in 1909, the gas in 1912, and town supplied electricity was connected in 1924.\n\nCowra is home to the Australian copy of the United Nation's World Peace Bell. These are normally kept in a nation's capital city. It was given to Cowra because of its special role in international understanding, world peace and as a centre of world friendship.\n\nDuring World War II Cowra was the site of a prisoner of war (POW) camp. Most of the prisoners were captured Japanese and Italian soldiers, sailors and airmen. On August 5, 1944 about 545 (some sources say over 1000) Japanese POWs attempted a mass escape from the camp. This is perhaps the largest prison escape in the world. At the same time, other Japanese prisoners killed themselves, or were killed by their countrymen, inside the camp.\n\nThe POWs tried to capture machine gun posts, armed only with home made weapons. The Prime Minister John Curtin said this was a \"suicidal disregard of life\", and had no chance of success.\n\nDuring the escape 231 Japanese and 4 Australian guards were killed, and 108 prisoners were wounded. The dead Japanese were buried in Cowra in a specially made Japanese War Cemetery. This is the only such cemetery in Australia. It also has some of the dead from the WWII air raids on Darwin.\n\nAn Avenue of Honour also remembers those who died in World War I.\n\nThe Japanese War Cemetery was looked by members of the Cowra RSL and given to Japan in 1963. In 1971 the Cowra Tourism Development decided to celebrate this link with Japan. They planned a Japanese garden for the town. The Japanese Government agreed to help as a sign of thanks for the respectful treatment of their war dead. The garden also received money from the Australian Government and private groups.\n\nThe garden was designed by Ken Nakajima (1914 - 2000). He was a world famous designer of Japanese gardens. The first part was opened in 1979, with a second part opened in 1986.\n\nThe gardens were built in the style of the Edo period. They are a \"kaiyū-shiki\" or strolling garden. They are designed to show all of the landscape types of Japan. At five hectares, the Cowra Japanese Garden is the largest Japanese garden in the Southern Hemisphere. An annual \"Sakura Matsuri\" (cherry blossom festival) is held in the gardens during late September and/or early October each year. The garden also has other events during the year.\n\n", "id": "141059", "title": "Cowra, New South Wales"}

The borrower needs to repay the lender the sum of money loaned part by part over time in order to clear the debt.\n\nActing as a provider of loans is one of the main tasks for financial institutions. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a main source of funding. Bank loans and credit are one way to increase the money supply.by Lakshya Gupta...\n\nA loan can be broadly described by the following terms.\n\nThe deposit or down-payment is an amount of money that the borrower is required to pay, as the first contribution towards clearing the debt, so that the loan deal can be finalized. The deposit is usually higher than the monthly contribution towards the loan. Some loans require a deposit while some do not. The deposit is usually a fraction, typically a percentage, of the total amount that is loaned out.\n\nAn Installment is money that is a monthly payment towards the loan. It may not be necessarily paid monthly but it has to be paid from time to time over throughout the loan deal. Installments are paid according to a loan rate.\n\nInterest is a charge on top of the value of the loan, that acts as a cost of the loan. Interest is paid according to a rate called an interest rate. The interest rate varies from loan to loan and from lender to lender.\n\nLoans can be broadly classified as either secured or unsecured loans.\nSecured loans are loans for which the borrower is required to guarantee repayment, by pledging with property, for instance a car, a house etc. This property is called security or collateral. Because of the pledging, secured loans are given in larger amounts and have lower interest rates. However, there is a risk of losing the property used as security, in the event that the loan is not paid off.\n\nAn example of a secured loan is a mortgage.\nUnsecured loans are loans that are given without pledges of repayment. This means that the borrower is not required to provide security to get the loan.\nBecause of the high risk involved, unsecured loans are given out in smaller amounts and have higher interest rates. The lenders raise the interest rates in an effort to recover their money as quickly as possible. Most personal loans are unsecured loans.\nA personal loan is a 'small expense' loan that is mostly used by people to \nfinance their day to day emergencies. They come in smaller amounts and\ntherefore, just like most unsecured loans, they are easily approved.\n\nHome loans are loans that are taken for the purpose of buying a house.\nHome loans are secured loans. The house acts as a collateral or security\nto the loan. \nPayday loans are the easiest loans to get if you are employed. They are \nsignature loans or cash advances that requires no security. This means that \nit is possible to get a payday loan even with a bad credit status or no credit \nat all. Payday loans are given on the basis of employment and income.\n\nHowever, payday loans have a high interest rate especially when the paying\nschedule is not followed. The high interest rates are a cost of convenience.\nInterest could run as high as 2000%, for this reason, it is not a good idea to\ntake a payday loan if you don't expect to earn enough to repay it.\n\nAuto loans are loans given out by financial institutions or car dealerships, for the purpose of buying an automobile. Due to the nature of automobiles to loose value with time, Auto loans usually have high interest rates. The shorter the time an auto loan is paid, the lower the overall cost of the loan.\nMortgage is a loan that is used specifically to purchase a house. Usually, a mortgage is given to you by a mortgage company or any financial institution, after evaluation of your potential to pay back the loan in full. A mortgage is a secured loan, therefore, providing collateral is necessary. Mortgage can be further classified into long-term and short-term mortgages, depending on the length of time required for the mortgage to be paid. Short-term mortgages usually have a term of 15 years while long–term mortgages have a 30-year term.\n\nWhen you get a credit card, you have taken a loan. This is a credit card loan, and just like any other loan, it comes with interest and fees. Credit card loans are given out by credit companies and most banks today. The interest rates on credit card loans are higher than that on most personal loans, often around 15%.\n\n", "id": "141067", "title": "Loan"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141068", "text": "Mortgage\n\nA mortgage is a way to use one's real property, like land, a house, or a building, as a guarantee for a loan to get money. Many people do this to buy the home they use for mortgage: the loan provides them the money to buy the house and the loan is guaranteed by the house.\n\nIn a mortgage, there is a debtor and a creditor. The debtor is the owner of the property, while the creditor is the owner of the loan. When the mortgage transaction is made, the debtor gets the money with the loan, and promises to pay the loan. The creditor will receive money back with interest over time (usually in payments made each month by the debtor). If the debtor does not pay the loan, the creditor may take the mortgaged property in place of the loan. This is called foreclosure.\n\nIn the 2008 American economic failure, creditors lent money to debtors who could not pay back that money. This lowered housing prices and hurt the economy.\n\nDefined under Section 58(b) of the Indian Transfer of Property Act as a simple mortgage is a transaction whereby ‘without delivering possession (ownership or occupancy) of the mortgaged property, the mortgagor binds himself personally to pay the mortgage money and agrees, expressly or implicitly, that in the event of his failing to pay according to his contract, the mortgagee shall have a right to cause the mortgaged property to be sold by a decree (an order of law) of the court in a suit(a case in a law court) and the proceeds of the sale to be applied so far as may be necessary in payment of the mortgage money;There is no foreclosure of the mortgaged property. Normally a mortgage is to be registered if the mortgaged money is Rs.100 or more. Mortgage deed is to be executed and appropriately stamped ad valorem with two best available witnesses.\n\nThe borrower promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date. The borrower transfers the property to the lender. The lender will re transfer the property when the money is repaid.\nThe mortgaged property is absolutely transferred to the mortgagee.\n\nA reverse mortgage is a loan where the lender pays the monthly installments to the borrower instead of the borrower paying the lender. The payment stream is reversed. A reverse mortgage allows people to get tax-free income from the value of their home. They are mainly to improve older people's personal and financial independence.\n\nThe lender takes the property. The lender receives income from the property (rent, profit, interest, etc.) until the money is paid back. The owner keeps the title deeds with him. \n", "id": "141068", "title": "Mortgage"}

In this kind of life, a person gets rid of worldly pleasures for religion or spirituality. A person might not have sex or drink alcohol. One might spend much of their time in prayer or meditation. Often, the reason is to follow goals of Christianity and the Indian religions (including yoga). These teach that salvation and freedom involve a process of changing one's mind and body. This is done by limiting speech, what one thinks and does with the body. \n\nThe earliest people who practiced Buddhism, Jainism, and the Christian hermits, lived very simply and without luxury. They rejected sensual pleasures and keeping money. This did not mean that life could not be enjoyed. But spiritual and religious goals are hindered by such indulgence. \n\nAsceticism is closely related to the abstinence and the Christian concept of chastity and might be said to be the technical implementation of the abstract vows of renunciation. Those who practice ascetic lifestyles do not consider their practices as virtuous but pursue such a life-style in order to satisfy certain technical requirements for mind-body transformation. There is remarkable uniformity among the above religions with respect to the benefits of sexual continence. Religions teach that purifying the soul also involves purification of the body which thereby enables connection with the Divine and the cultivation of inner peace. In the popular imagination asceticism is considered a sort of perversion (self-flagellation by birch twigs as the archetypal stereotype of self-mortification) but the \"askēsis\" enjoined by religion functions in order to bring about greater freedom in various areas of one's life, such as freedom from compulsions and temptations bringing about peacefulness of mind with a concomitant increase in clarity and power of thought.\n", "id": "141119", "title": "Asceticism"}

The first \"prior\" (head man) was St. Antoninus of Florence. The famous painter known as Fra Angelico was one of the first of the Dominican Friars to live and work there. He later became the prior. The land for the convent was given to the friars by Cosimo Medici. The monks lived in small rooms called \"cells\". Cosimo had a cell built for himself, where he could stay sometimes. Between 1447 and 1452 Cosimo got his favourite architect, Michelozzo, to build a large new library and improve other parts of the building. In the late 1700s, the facade (front) of the building was rebuilt in a Classical style. \n\nIn 1490, the prior of St. Marks was a famous Domincan called Savonarola. He lived in the cell that had once belonged to Cosimo Medici. He was a great preacher. He disliked Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo Medici, who was often called \"Lorenzo the Magnificent\" (Lorenzo il Magnifico). He thought that Lorenzo had too much power and was acting like a prince. He preached against Lorenzo, against the Pope and against the Roman Catholic Church. He told everyone that the end of the world was near.

Mixed-race children were more valuable in South Arabia. Two such children became Princes of the Abbassids. At this time, the Arabian army, known as the Sabaens, moved to Ethiopia. In Iraq, Bantu-speaking Africans were called Zanj. The large number of Zanj slaves working in bad conditions in Iraq lead to the famous Zanj Rebellion over fifteen years (869-883 AD).

RC6 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. RC stands for \"Rivest Cipher\", or alternatively, \"Ron's Code\".\n\nIn 1997, the NIST announced a competition to choose a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES) to be known as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). RC6 was derived from RC5 to meet the competition requirements, and was selected as one of the \"five finalists\" of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) competition, but was not selected as a standard.\n\nIn order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels, RC6 allows choices for the block size: 32 bits (for experimentation and evaluation purposes only), 64 bits (for use as a replacement for DES), and 128 bits (intended for AES). The number of rounds can range from 0 to 255, while the key sizes can range from 0 bits to 2040 bits in size. \n\nRC6 is very similar to RC5 in structure and could be viewed as interweaving two parallel RC5 encryption processes. However, RC6 does use an extra multiplication operation not present in RC5 and the use of four b/4-bit working registers (see splitting of plaintext blocks in feistel cipher) instead of two b/2-bit registers as in RC5 (b is the block size). Integer multiplication is used to increase the diffusion achieved per round so that fewer rounds are needed and the speed of the cipher can be increased.<br>The reason for using four working registers instead of two is mainly for optimization on 32-bit CPUs. The default block size of RC5 was 64 bits, while the default block size of the AES is 128 bits. RC5 has only two working registers. It uses 32-bit operations when dealing with 64-bit blocks and 64-bit operations when dealing with 128-bit blocks, so four working registers are required to build the AES architecture using only 32-bit operations.\n\nRC6 is a proprietary and patented algorithm (by RSA Security and ), and may require licensing and royalty payments for any products using the algorithm. It was designed by Ron Rivest, Matt Robshaw, Ray Sidney, and Yiqun Lisa Yin, and was also submitted to the NESSIE and CRYPTREC projects.\n\n\n", "id": "141170", "title": "RC6"}

The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds.\n\nA key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR (Xor)s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of \"nothing up my sleeve numbers\". The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts.\n\n12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 2 chosen plaintexts. 18–20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.\n\nRSA Security, which has a patent on the algorithm, offered a series of US$10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5, but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007. A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing, organised by Distributed.net.

Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1987. \"\"RC\"\" stands for \"Rivest Cipher\", or alternatively, \"Ron's Code\".\n\nRC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds.\n\nRounds are arranged as a source-heavy feistel network, with 16 rounds of one type called \"\"mixing rounds\"\" interleaved by two rounds of another type called \"\"mashing rounds\"\".\n\nThe 18 rounds are performed using the following interleaved sequence: \n\nRC2 uses \"key-expansion algorithm\" by which an expanded key consisting of 64 (16-bit words) is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied \"\"variable-length\"\" input key. A mixing round consists of four applications of the \"\"mix-up\"\" transformation, as shown in the diagram. A round is \"\"mashed\"\" by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key (RFC 2268).\n\nRC2 is susceptible to a related-key attack using 2 chosen-plaintext attacks (Kelsey \"et al.\", 1997).\n\nThe development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus, who were seeking a custom cipher be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software, after evaluation by the NSA. The NSA suggested a couple of changes, which Ronald Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989.\n\nAlong with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated under US export regulations for cryptography. Now all 40-bit encryption algorithms are obsolete because they are dangerously susceptible to brute force attacks.\n\nInitially, the details of the algorithm were kept secret — proprietary to RSA Security — but on 29 January 1996, source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum, sci.crypt. A similar post had occurred earlier with RC4. It is unclear whether the poster had access to the specifications or whether it had been reverse engineered.\n\n\n", "id": "141188", "title": "RC2"}

Militia who did not like the independence in East Timor started the conflict when they attacked civilians. These attacks led to more violence all over the country. Most of the violence occurred in the capital Dili. \n\nThe violence started after the result of an election was independence from Indonesia. About 1400 people are thought to have died. An UN force (InterFET) made up mainly of people from the Australian Defence Force was sent to East Timor to establish and maintain peace.\n\nIn 1999, there was a lot of pressure on Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian government decided to hold a vote. In this referendum it asked the people of East Timor, whether they wanted to stay with Indonesia or become independent. Portugal had done some lobbying. The referendum was held on August 30. In it, a clear majority (78.5%) of people voting said they would prefer to become independent. The alternative proposal would have been to stay with Indonesia, but to have many freedoms as an \"autonomous province\", called Special Autonomous Region of East Timor (SARET).\n\nDirectly after the referendum, violence broke out. The violence came from Indonesian soldiers and from a special East Timorese pro-integration militia which was supported by Indonesia. These troops became violent and terrorised the population. They did not like how the people had voted. About 14,000 Timorese people were killed. 300.000 had to flee to West Timor to live as refugees. Most of the infrastructure of the country, including houses, watering systems, and the electricity was destroyed. Noam Chomsky said: \"In one month, this massive military operation murdered some 2,000 people, raped hundreds of women and girls, displaced three-quarters of the population, and demolished 75 percent of the country's infrastructure.\"\n\nOn 20 September 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) came to the country. This ended the violence. Activists in Portugal, Australia, the United States, and elsewhere pressured their governments to take action. US President Bill Clinton eventually threatened Indonesia, that the IMF loans would be stopped. Indonesia was in deep economic troubles already. The Indonesian government agreed to withdraw its troops and allowed a multinational force into Timor to stabilize the area. It was clear that the UN did not have sufficient resources to fight the paramilitary forces directly. Instead, the UN authorised the creation of a multinational military force known as INTERFET (International Force for East Timor), with Security Council Resolution 1264. 23 nations sent troops, about 11,000 people in total. The force was led by Major-General Peter Cosgrove. Troops landed in East Timor on 20 September 1999.\n", "id": "141191", "title": "1999 East Timorese crisis"}

There are legends that say that she rode naked through the streets of Coventry in England.\n\nLady Godiva was the wife of Earl Leofric of Mercia. The Earl’s taxes were very high, and people in Coventry was very upset about it. Lady Godiva begged her husband to lower the taxes many times, but he never agreed to. Finally, the Earl told Lady Godiva that if she rode through the streets completely naked, he would lower the taxes. Lady Godiva sent a message through town that told everyone to close their shutters and stay indoors. Then, she rode through town only clothed by her hair. The Earl gave in and lowered the taxes of the town. However, a tailor named Tom drilled a hole through his shutters, and caught a glimpse of Lady Godiva. He was struck blind, some think from heaven, and some think the town “took care of him” themselves. This is where the phrase “Peeping Tom” for a voyeur comes from.

In 2013 there were 514,417 people living there, which makes it the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom. The area code in Manchester is 0161.\n\nIt is a city and metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, England. Manchester was given city status in 1853. The city is in the middle of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, which has 2,240,230 people, and is the United Kingdom's third largest built-up place. \n\nManchester is a very important city in England, and is often called the \"Capital of the North\". Manchester has many places for the arts, places for learning, businesses providing media as well as lots of shops. In a poll of British managers in 2006, Manchester was named the best place in Britain to have a business. A report in 2007 said Manchester is a fast-growing city (meaning lots of jobs are being created). Manchester was the host of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. It has two well-known football teams, Manchester United and Manchester City. Manchester United are the current Europa League holders.\n\nManchester was the first city to industrialise, because of the Industrial Revolution. It became the main place for making cloth and fabric. During the 19th century it had the nickname Cottonopolis, because it had so many cotton mills. The middle of Manchester is important because it is on UNESCO's World Heritage Sites, because of its network of canals and mills built during its 19th-century development.\n\nIn the late 1700s, Manchester was only a small village with few people. This changed at the start of the Industrial Revolution. During this time, there were revolts about the living conditions for workers. The most well known of these revolts was the Peterloo Massacre. Fifteen to twenty people were killed during the Peterloo Massacre and hundreds of other people were hurt. In 1780, Richard Arkwright built the first cotton mill in the area.\n\nLater in the 1800s, Manchester became most important cotton town in the world. It was also the first 'industrialised' city, meaning that it was the first city to have a big amount of industry in it. Only a small amount of cloth is still made in the city and the trade has mainly stopped. This left a big number of old buildings from that time including the Town Hall, Free Trade Hall and Central Library and left a lot of other buildings empty.\n\nThe Manchester Ship Canal was created by the digging of canals in the rivers Irwell and Mersey for from Salford to the Mersey estuary. This let ocean going ships sail into the Port of Manchester.\n\nThe county of Greater Manchester was made in 1974. The county was created from cities and towns in southern Lancashire and northern Cheshire (the two main areas which make up Greater Manchester), and some mainly rural districts of Derbyshire and Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1996, the Irish Republican Army put a bomb in a truck in the centre of the city. Nobody was killed, but it did a lot of damage.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, A bombing occurred at the Manchester Arena with 22 people dead and 55 injured. It is a suspected suicide bombing.\n\nManchester is northwest of England's capital, London. The city has many canals and rivers which were a big part in its earlier growth. The largest open space in the city is Heaton Park. It has an area of about . Heaton Park is a place that attracts many people every year. People go there to see the many animals and the beauty of the countryside. Much of Manchester is built-up (or 'urbanised'). Much of Manchester's rain comes over from the Pennines, which are a hilly range to the south and east of the city. The city is mainly urban areas but also has some areas which are mainly of farmland. To the south of the centre is Manchester Airport. This is the third largest airport in the United Kingdom.\n\nA revival of the city's importance started in the 1980s. This was partly led by a vibrant music scene whose spirit was labelled 'Madchester', which was led by bands such as The Happy Mondays and Joy Division. The Smiths came from nearby Salford.\nThe scene was partly fuelled by the number of students attending the universities and further education colleges in the city. Manchester has the most students in the United Kingdom in term time.\n\nThe largest university in the UK, the University of Manchester, is in the city. It has over 30,000 students. It also has the fourth largest university, the Manchester Metropolitan University.\n\nThe city has two Premier League football teams, Manchester City and Manchester United. Football is a very important part of the culture of the city. Many of the people support or show interest in the sport.\n\nManchester and North West England are served by Manchester Airport. The airport has the most passengers in the UK outside London, with 22.1 million passengers in 2007. Planes fly to lots of in Europe, North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia (with more destinations from Manchester than from London Heathrow).\n\nManchester is very well served by train and in terms of passengers, Manchester Piccadilly was the busiest English train station outside London in 2005 and 2006. Northern Rail operates all over the north of England, and other operators include Virgin Trains. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first passenger railway in the world. Greater Manchester has a very big railway network. The city centre has over a lot of park and ride sites. Manchester became the first city in the UK to get a new tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. There are lots of new lines being built. \n\nThe city has one of the biggest bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester area around the city. First Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester are the main bus operators. First Manchester also operates three free bus services called Metroshuttle which carry workers around Manchester's business areas.\n\nA big canal network runs though the city, built in the Industrial Revolution, today mainly used for leisure. The Manchester Ship Canal is open, but not many boats use it.\n\nManchester's buildings display many different types of building styles, from Victorian to contemporary architecture. The very common use of red bricks characterises the look of the city. Much Manchester's architecture dates back to its days as a global centre for the trade of cotton. Just outside the city centre is a large number of former cotton mills, some of which have been left mostly untouched since they were closed, while many others have been turned into apartment buildings and office spaces.Manchester Town Hall, in Albert Square, was built in the gothic revival style and is thought of by many to be one of the most important Victorian buildings in all of England.\n\nThere are two universities in the City of Manchester. The University of Manchester, created in 2004 when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST were combined, is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom. The Manchester Business School, at the University of Manchester, was the first school to offer an MBA course in the United Kingdom in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was created as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It was given university status in 1992, and in the same year, combined with Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education, in South Cheshire.\n\nManchester has twinning plans (or \"friendship agreements\") with lots of places. In addition, the British Council has a \"metropolitan centre\" in Manchester. Although not an official twin city, Tampere, Finland is known as \"\"the Manchester of Finland\"\" – or \"\"Manse\"\" for short. Also, Ahmedabad, India became the centre of a booming textile industry, and it got the nickname \"\"the Manchester of the East\".\"\n\n\n", "id": "141239", "title": "Manchester"}

On the night of the seven-hour long television programme lots of celebrities appear to support the cause and ask for donations. Various performances are often given, including sketches and musical numbers. There are also featurettes that show what the money is used for. Celebrities that appear are from both the BBC's own programmes, and also from the rival ITV network. They often appear in character and on the sets of their own programmes. One of the most popular features has been a musical number by the BBC newsreaders. In 2006 they had a \"James Bond\" theme, and in 2008 it was a \"Mamma Mia!\" one. The stars of newly opened West End musicals also perform songs from their shows later in the evening, after the 'curtain call' of the actual show performance for that evening. The total is also show on a screen about every hour. The presenters always accompany this with the phrase \"every penny counts\" to help to push the total beyond that of the previous year.\n\nMost of the British public support Children in Need, but some have a different view. They say that showing children on television as victims, many of which are disabled, is unfortunate and counter-productive. Changes in society will be better for such children than money and sympathy.\n\nMoney that is given to Children in Need is used in lots of ways. When the appeal for the year closes, the money is given to organisations that help children that are at the age of 18 and under. The children that are helped often have mental, physical or sensory disabilities, or have behavioural or psychological disorders. Others live in poverty or deprivation, and some are living in distress, are sexually abused or just neglected. These children are in need of some help and children in need provides a basis for that help.\nChildren in need started I 1927\n", "id": "141427", "title": "Children in Need"}

They are known for philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art, and big live shows. One of rock music's most successful acts, the group have sold over 210 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million albums in the United States alone.\n\nPink Floyd had moderate mainstream success and were one of the most popular bands in the London underground music scene in the late 1960s led by Syd Barrett; however, Barrett's decline in health would eventually forced his band members to replace him with guitarist and singer David Gilmour. After Barrett left the group Pink Floyd released \"Ummagumma\". The album was released as a double disc, the first disc contained songs performed live the other disc contained the new studio recorded songs. Singer and bass player Roger Waters gradually became the leader of the band in the mid-1970s, until 1985 when he left the group. The band recorded several albums, achieving worldwide success with \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973), \"Wish You Were Here\" (1975), \"Animals\" (1977), and \"The Wall\" (1979) with all of them topping the American record chart with the exception of Animals. \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" is the third best-selling studio album in the world (not counting compilations and various artists soundtracks). In 1985, Waters stated that Pink Floyd was no more, but the remaining members, led by Gilmour, continued recording and touring under the name Pink Floyd. Waters sued the remaining members for the rights to the name, Waters lost and the band enjoyed worldwide success with \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" (1987) and \"The Division Bell\" (1994).\n\na These singles would later appear on the Pink Floyd compilation \"The Early Singles\".\n\n", "id": "141433", "title": "Pink Floyd discography"}

There is also the fundamental concept of Bicameralism. For example, in the United Kingdom the accountability tends towards the Lower House (House of Commons), as the upper House (House of Lords) is not wholly elected. Thus, there is a better representation of those who voted for the government that holds the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nIn the government of a country that uses responsible government, the leaders of the executive branch of government (called the cabinet) are also members of the legislature. Also, the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power. If it loses the support of the legislature, there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet.\n\nCountries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government. Some examples of countries that have responsible government are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\n\nIn countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately.

Most Palestinians view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as constituting the area of their future state, which is a view also accepted by most Israelis. A handful of academics advocate a one-state solution, whereby all of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and West Bank would become a bi-national state with equal rights for all. However, there are significant areas of disagreement over the shape of any final agreement and also regarding the level of credibility each side sees in the other in upholding basic commitments. The conflict started in 1948.\n", "id": "141561", "title": "Israeli–Palestinian conflict"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141608", "text": "Aboriginal art\n\nAboriginal art is art made by indigenous Australian people. It includes work made in many different ways including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpting, ceremonial clothing and sand painting. Aboriginal art is closely linked to religious ceremonies or rituals. It is an important part of the world's oldest continuous cultural tradition, based on totems and the Dreaming. All the designs, painted or drawn, have a story infront of rocks.\n\nSymbols are used in aboriginal art, to show different things. While the meaning of these symbols are often shared, they can change meaning within the same piece, and they can be different between different groups. Aboriginal art is a language in itself, communicating through beautiful patterns. This started around 30,000 to 40,000 years ago.\n\nSome aboriginal artists sell their artwork for a lot of money. In 2007 Pitjantjatjara artist Yannima Pikarli Tommy Watson sold a painting for AU$240,000.\n\nIn 2010 the Queensland Government said that it would have the first two Tilt Trains painted by indigenous artists Judy Watson and Alick Tipoti. With seven carriages and two locomotives, the trains will be 185 metres long, making them the biggest modern aboriginal art piece. The Tilt Trains will run between Brisbane and Cairns.\n\nThere are several types of aboriginal art and ways of making art. This includes rock painting, dot painting, rock engravings, bark painting, carvings, sculptures, and weaving and string art. \n\nAustralian indigenous art is the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world. The oldest dated rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal image on a rock, drawn 28,000 years ago. It is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth. It was found in the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. \n\nRock art includes painting and engraving or carving. It can be found at sites throughout Australia, but is difficult to date. Some examples in the Pilbara area of Western Australia and at Olary in South Australia are believed to be 40,000 years old. Some art shows extinct animals such as \"Genyornis\" and \"Thylacoleo\". Other paintings show the arrival of European ships.\n\nThe indigenous Australians used different ways of making a rock engraving. This often depended on the type of rock. There are several different types of rock art across Australia. The most famous sites are Murujuga in Western Australia, the Sydney rock engravings around Sydney in New South Wales, and the Panaramitee rock art in Central Australia. The Sydney engravings show carved animals and humans in a style not found elsewhere in Australia.\n\nThe rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of petroglyphs. It has images of animals such as the thylacine, which are now extinct.\n\nDot painting is made up of small dots of paint colours like yellow (representing the sun), brown (the soil), red (desert sand) and white (the clouds and the sky). These are traditional Aboriginal colours. Dot paintings can be painted on anything, including on rocks, in caves, etc. The paintings were mostly images of animals or lakes, and the Dreamtime. Stories and legends were shown on caves and rocks.\n\nBark painting is made on sheets of bark from trees. Bark paintings are regarded as fine art, and high prices are often paid for it on the international art markets. The best artists are recognized annually in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award.\n\nThis is a kind of maplike, bird's-eye view of the desert landscape. It is often used to tell Dreaming stories. In the distant past, these were made on rock, sand or as body painting. Today they are often colored drawings with liquid based color on canvas (see section Papunya Tula and \"Dot Painting\" below).\n\nStone arrangements are found across Australia. Some are large, such as the 50m-diameter circles of Victoria, with 1m-high stones buried in the ground. Some are small such as those near Yirrkala which show images of the praus used by Macassan Trepang fishermen and spear throwers.\n\n\n\nModern Aboriginal art still uses traditional symbols. While the meaning of the symbols can be the same across Australia, they can also change within in a single painting. A symbol such as a circle can be used as a circle within a circle, sometimes on its own or clustered in groups. The meaning can depend on which tribe the artist is from. The circles could be campfires, trees, hills, digging holes, water holes or a spring. The meaning can be changed by the use of colour, so water could be blue or black.\nMany paintings by Aboriginal artists, tell a story from the Dreamtime. These can be drawn like a map. The story shows how the land was created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. These paintings continue a tradition of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that is thousands of years old.\n\nWhatever the meaning, interpretations of the symbols should be made in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, and the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water. \n\nTraditional art almost always is about the Dreamtime of indigenous Australian artists. Wenten Rubuntja, an indigenous landscape artist, says it is hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning:\nDoesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all Dreaming. There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture. – source \"The Weekend Australian Magazine\", April 2002\n\nStory-telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. In some parts of Arnhem Land, the artists used an X-ray style of painting. \n\nMany important sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually damaged or destroyed by early settlers and modern-day visitors. Some sites have been cleared or built over. Other sited have been damaged by visitors touching the paint, or graffiti. Many sites are now protected by fences or closed off to the public permanently.\n", "id": "141608", "title": "Aboriginal art"}

Mice might spontaneously appear in stored grain or maggots could spontaneously appear in meat.\n\nAccording to Aristotle it was a readily observable truth that aphids arise from the dew which falls on plants, fleas from putrid matter, mice from dirty hay, crocodiles from logs rotting at the bottom of bodies of water, and so forth. In the 17th century these things started to be questioned.\nSir Thomas Browne wrote a book called \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\". He subtitled it \"Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and Commonly Presumed Truths\". He published it in 1646. He wrote it as an attack on \"false beliefs and \"vulgar errors\"\". \n\nScientists failed to accept the conclusions he reached. For example, Alexander Ross, a scientist who lived at the same time as Browne, wrote about it: \"To question this (he meant: to question spontaneous generation) is to question reason, sense and experience. If he doubts of this let him go to Egypt, and there he will find the fields swarming with mice, begot of the mud of Nylus, to the great calamity of the inhabitants.\"\n\nIn 1546 the physician Girolamo Fracastoro theorized that epidemic diseases were caused by tiny, invisible particles or \"spores\", which might not be living creatures, but this was not widely accepted. Next, Robert Hooke published the first drawings of a microorganism in 1665. He is also credited for naming the cell which he discovered while observing cork samples.\n\nIn 1676, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms that were probably protozoa and bacteria. This sparked new interest in the microscopic world. \n\nThe first step was taken by the Italian Francesco Redi. In 1668, Redi proved that no maggots appeared in meat when flies were prevented from laying eggs. From the 17th century onwards it was gradually shown that, at least in the case of all the higher and readily visible organisms, the previous sentiment regarding spontaneous generation was false. The alternative seemed to be omne vivum ex ovo: that every living thing came from a pre-existing living thing (literally, everything from an egg). \n\nIn 1768 Lazzaro Spallanzani proved that microbes came from the air, and could be killed by boiling. Yet it was not until 1861 that Louis Pasteur performed a series of careful experiments. With these experiments, Pasteur proved that organisms such as bacteria and fungi do not appear in nutrient-rich media of their own accord in non-living material. This experiment supported cell theory.\n", "id": "141663", "title": "Spontaneous generation"}

He was one of the few members of the gang to die of old age, and not to be killed.\n\nVane was born at Jerry Plains near Singleton, New South Wales on 28 June 1842. His grandparents had come to Australia as convicts but his father and mother were seen as respectable and wealthy. They lived at Kelso, near Bathurst before moving to Jerry Plains in about 1841. When John was about six years old the family moved back to Kelso and then onto Teasdale Park (Carcoar), near Hobbys Yards. Teasdale Park was owned by George Chesher (Cheshire) who would become Vane's father-in-law. The Vane family moved to Kempfield, near the Abercrombie caves where they stayed for a number of years. John worked as a shepherd and the money he was paid helped his father buy land, probably their Wattle Grove home.\n\n1850 John Vane and his brother William (Billy) went to work at James Hanrahan's Wentworth Gully Station near the Weddin Mountains. It is not known if all the family went or just the two boys. Billy taught John to ride horses while at Hanrahan's. They stayed there for about a year and returned to the Kempfield district.\n\nJohn was 14 years when sent to Bathurst, apprenticed to a blacksmith and wheelwright named McDonald. He then went on to the Turon goldfields where he saved a some money before it was stolen from him. He then drove a bullock team between Orange and Lambing Flat (Young).\n\nHe was described in 1863 as being about six feet tall, with dark hair and a ruddy complexion. He worked as a stockman, looking after cattle and was said to be an excellent horse rider.\n\nOn Christmas Eve of 1862 John Vane, Billy Vane, George Chesher Jnr, James Burke and John McKellar were at Boyce's public house at Long Swamp near Trunkey Creek. Warrants were issued for the five youth for robbery of the publican. John Vane hid in the bush and eluded capture until his surrender later that year. The others were captured by police but were released as there was not enough evidence to take them to court [1863 New South Wales Police Gazette].\n\nJohn Vane and his good mate Micky Burke had built a reputation for providing locals with stolen beef and horses. In July 1863 members of the Ben Hall gang were seeking fresh horses and new places to rob. John Gilbert and John O'Meally came to the Carcoar district and sent out word that they needed Vane's local knowledge and skills. The pair met with Vane at his camp at Millpost Creek and laid plans for an attack on the Carcoar bank. On 30 July 1863 that plan was put into action. Vane had provided information and support for the raid, though he did not participate. Gilbert and O'Meally rode into town and performed the first daylight bank robbery in Australia. Vane joined the gang and soon after so did his mate Micky Burke.\n\nBen Hall joined the other members of the gang and they began stealing around the district. They bailed up store owners and gold buyers. They held the town of Canowindra and all its people prisoner for three days. They tied the pursuing police troopers to trees and took their uniforms and weapons. They raided the large town of Bathurst and which sent the colonial government into turmoil.\n\nThe excitiment and adventure came to a tragic end when on the afternoon of 24 October 1863, the gang went to the home of Gold Commissioner Henry Keightley at Dunn's Plains, near Rockley. At the house were Mrs. Keightley, house staff and Dr. Pechey. During the gun battle Vane's mate Micky Burke was shot in the stomach, and through fear of being caught by police decided to shoot himself. There is still debate today around who actually shot Burke. Vane was enraged and wanted to kill Keightley in revenge. It was decided though that the ransom Keightley would receive for killing Burke (₤500)should be sought by the gang. Keightley's wife and Dr Pechey rode to Bathurst that night to get the money from Mrs Keightley's father, Henry Rotton. Pechey and Rotton returned the next morning and the money was handed to Gilbert. Keightley was immediately released. The story of the ride was later turned into a stage play. Many people say that John Vane is a handsome, old, lad but hated him dearly.\n\nIn November 1863 a priest, Father Tim M'Carthy met Vane by chance in the bush. He later met the bushranger's mother. They talked Vane into giving himself up. It is said that John, cried and cried. His Father and mother knew how he felt! They gave him some food and money and told him sternly that a life as a bushranger was not good. He eventually decided that there was no point continuing to hide, so he walked off with shredded pants and shirt. He went with the priest to Nathaniel Connolly's home, who supplied them with a letter to secure Vane's passage to Bathurst courthouse. Vane was sentenced to 15 years at Darlinghurst and released after six for good behavior.\n\nHe drove the mail coach between Carcoar and Mt Donald until retiring. Vane continued to be in trouble with the police. In 1880 the newspapers reported that John Vane, ex-bushranger, was in court at Bathurst, for stealing 431 sheep. A friend, Terence M'Cann who had helped steal the sheep, was the main witness. John Vane's brother-in-law, Thomas Parker, tried to stop M'Cann from giving evidence. He was put in gaol for 12 months.\n\nJohn Vane died of Ileocolitis in the hospital at Cowra, New South Wales on January 30, 1906.\n\nJohn was a known bushranger in the 1800's because of all the big and small things he stole. He was also a help to the police in controlling, pubs, roads and the like. Although it wasn't his intention he inadvertently made these places better today! \nHe made gold diggers and people around the gold fields more aware of robbers and bushranger.\n\n", "id": "141743", "title": "John Vane (bushranger)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141778", "text": "Cloud computing\n\nIn Computer science, cloud computing describes a type of outsourcing of computer services, similar to the way in which electricity supply is outsourced. Users can simply use it. They do not need to worry where the electricity is from, how it is made, or transported. Every month, they pay for what they consumed.\n\nThe idea behind cloud computing is similar: The user can simply use storage, computing power, or specially crafted development environments, without having to worry how these work internally. Cloud computing is usually Internet-based computing. The \"cloud\" is a metaphor for the Internet based on how the internet is described in computer network diagrams; which means it is an abstraction hiding the complex infrastructure of the internet. It is a style of computing in which IT-related capabilities are provided “as a service”, allowing users to access technology-enabled services from the Internet (\"in the cloud\") without knowledge of, or control over the technologies behind these servers.\n\nAccording to a paper published by \"IEEE Internet Computing\" in 2008 \"Cloud Computing is a paradigm in which information is permanently stored in servers on the Internet and cached temporarily on clients that include computers, laptops, handhelds, sensors, etc.\"\n\nCloud computing is a general concept that utilizes software as a service (SaaS), such as Web 2.0 and other technology trends, all of which depend on the Internet for satisfying users' needs. For example, Google Apps provides common business applications online that are accessed from a web browser, while the software and data are stored on the Internet servers.\n\nCloud computing is often confused with other ideas: \n\nMany cloud computing deployments are powered by grids, have autonomic characteristics and are billed like utilities, but cloud computing can be seen as a \"natural next step\" from the \"grid-utility model\". Some successful cloud architectures have little or no centralised infrastructure or billing systems including peer-to-peer networks like BitTorrent and Skype.\n\nThe majority of cloud computing infrastructure currently consists of reliable services delivered through data centers that are built on computer and storage virtualization technologies. The services are accessible anywhere in the world, with \"The Cloud\" appearing as a single point of access for all the computing needs of consumers. Commercial offerings need to meet the quality of service requirements of customers and typically offer service level agreements. Open standards and open source software are also critical to the growth of cloud computing.\n\nAs customers generally do not own the infrastructure or know all details about it, mainly they are accessing or renting, so they can consume resources as a service, and may be paying for what they do not need, instead of what they actually do need to use. Many cloud computing providers use the utility computing model which is analogous to how traditional public utilities like electricity are consumed, while others are billed on a subscription basis. By sharing consumable and \"\"intangible\"\" computing power between multiple \"\"tenants\"\", utilization rates can be improved (as servers are not left idle) which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development.\n\nA side effect of this approach is that \"computer capacity rises dramatically\" as customers do not have to engineer for peak loads. Adoption has been enabled by \"increased high-speed bandwidth\" which makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites.\n\nCloud computing is being driven by providers including Google, Amazon.com, and Yahoo! as well as traditional vendors including IBM, Intel, Microsoft and SAP. It can adopted by all kinds of users, be they individuals or large enterprises. Most internet users are currently using cloud services, even if they do not realize it. Webmail for example is a cloud service, as are Facebook and Wikipedia and contact list synchronization and online data backups.\n\n\"The Cloud\" is a metaphor for the Internet, or more generally components and services which are managed by others.\n\nThe underlying concept dates back to 1960 when John McCarthy expressed his opinion that \"computation may someday be organized as a public utility\" and the term \"Cloud\" was already in commercial use in the early 1990s to refer to large ATM networks. By the turn of the 21st century, cloud computing solutions had started to appear on the market, though most of the focus at this time was on Software as a service.\n\nAmazon.com played a key role in the development of cloud computing when upgrading their data centers after the dot-com bubble and providing access to their systems by way of Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis. They found the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements.\n\n2007 observed increased activity, including Google, IBM and a number of universities starting large scale \"cloud computing\" research project, around the time the term started gaining popularity in the mainstream press. It was a hot topic by mid-2008 and numerous cloud computing events had been scheduled.\n\nIn August 2008 Gartner observed that \"organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models\" and that the \"projected shift to cloud computing will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and in significant reductions in other areas\".\n\n\"Clouds\" cross many country borders and \"may be the ultimate form of globalisation\". As such it is the subject of complex geopolitical issues, whereby providers must satisfy many legal restrictions in order to deliver service to a global market. This dates back to the early days of the Internet, where libertarian thinkers felt that \"cyberspace was a distinct place calling for laws and legal institutions of its own\"; author Neal Stephenson envisaged this as a tiny island data haven in his science-fiction classic novel Cryptonomicon.\n\nAlthough there have been efforts to match the legal environment (such as US-EU Safe Harbor), providers like Amazon Web Services usually deal with international markets (typically the United States and European Union) by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select their countries. However, there are still concerns about security and privacy for individual through various governmental levels, (for example the USA PATRIOT Act and use of national security letters and title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Stored Communications Act).\n\nIn March 2007, Dell applied to trademark the term '\"cloud computing\" in the United States. It received a \"Notice of Allowance\" in July 2008 which was subsequently canceled on August 6, resulting in a formal rejection of the trademark application in less than a week later.\n\nIn November 2007, the Free Software Foundation released the Affero General Public License (abbreviated as Affero GPL and AGPL), a version of GPLv3 designed to close a perceived legal loophole associated with Free software designed to be run over a network, particularly software as a service. According to the AGPL license application service providers are required to release any changes they make to an AGPL open source code.\n\n\"Cloud architecture\" is the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of \"cloud computing\" (e.g. hardware, software) as designed by a \"cloud architect\" who typically works for a \"cloud integrator\". It typically involves multiple \"cloud components\" communicating with each other over application programming interfaces (usually web services).\n\nThis is very similar to the Unix philosophy of having multiple programs doing one thing well and working together over universal interfaces. Complexity is controlled and the resulting systems are more manageable than their monolithic counterparts.\n\n\"Cloud architecture\" extends to the client where web browsers and/or software applications are used to access \"cloud applications\".\n\n\"Cloud storage architecture\" is loosely coupled where metadata operations are centralized enabling the data nodes to scale into the hundreds, each independently delivering data to applications or users.\n\n\nA \"cloud application\" influences The Cloud model of software architecture, often eliminating the need to install and run the application on the customer's own computer, thus reducing software maintenance, ongoing operations, and support. For example:\n\nA \"cloud client\" is computer hardware and/or computer software which relies on The Cloud for application delivery, or which is specifically designed for delivery of cloud services, and which is in either case essentially useless without a Cloud. For example:\n\n\"Cloud infrastructure\" (e.g. Infrastructure as a service) is the delivery of computer infrastructure (typically a platform virtualization environment) as a service. For example:\n\nA \"cloud platform\" (e.g. Platform as a service) (the delivery of a computing platform and/or solution stack as a service) facilitates deployment of applications without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. For example:\n\nA \"cloud service\" (e.g. Web Service) is \"software system[s] designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network\" which may be accessed by other cloud computing components, software (e.g. Software plus services) or end users directly. For example:\n\n\"Cloud storage\" is the delivery of data storage as a service (including database-like services), often billed on a utility computing basis (e.g. per gigabyte per month). For example:\n\n\nTraditional storage vendors have recently begun to offer their own flavor of cloud storage, sometimes in conjunction with their existing software products (e.g. Symantec's Online Storage for Backup Exec). Others focus on providing a new kind of back-end storage optimally designed for delivering cloud storage (EMC's Atmos), categorically known as Cloud Optimized Storage.\n\nA \"cloud computing provider\" or \"cloud computing service provider\" owns and operates \"cloud computing\" systems serve someone else. Usually this needs building and managing new data centers. Some organisations get some of the benefits of cloud computing by becoming \"internal\" cloud providers and servicing themselves, though they do not benefit from the same economies of scale and still have to engineer for peak loads. The barrier to entry is also significantly higher with capital expenditure required and billing and management creates some overhead. However, significant operational efficiency and quickness advantages can be achieved even by small organizations, and server consolidation and virtualization rollouts are already in progress. Amazon.com was the first such provider, modernising its data centers which, like most computer networks were using as little as 10% of its capacity at any one time just to leave room for occasional spikes. This allowed small, fast-moving groups to add new features faster and easier, and they went on to open it up to outsiders as Amazon Web Services in 2002 on a utility computing basis.\n\nThe companies listed in the \"Components\" section are providers.\n\nA user is a consumer of \"cloud computing\". The privacy of users in cloud computing has become of increasing concern. The rights of users is also an issue, which is being addressed via a community effort to create a bill of rights (currently in draft).\n\nA vendor sells products and services that facilitate the delivery, adoption and use of \"cloud computing\". For example:\n\n\nA \"cloud standard\" is one of a number of existing (typically lightweight) open standards that have facilitated the growth of cloud computing, including:\n", "id": "141778", "title": "Cloud computing"}

The tree Pimenta diocia is from the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), and it is very valued for its berries. The allspice was named because the flavor of the berry is like a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It is used very much in baking, mostly for making mincemeat and mixed pickling spice. It was discovered first by the early Spanish explorers, who mistook it for a type of pepper.\n\nAllspice is the only spice grown in the Western Hemisphere. But after that, the wild trees were cut down to get the berries and only a few allspice are left. There are many plantations in Mexico and Central America, too. However, the best allspice comes from Jamaica where the weather and soil are best for the berries.\n\nAllspice was used by the Mayans and by other South American Indians when making chocolate. The name \"Jamaica\" comes from Xamayca. This means ‘land of wood and water’ in the language of the Arawaks. The Arawaks used allspice to help keep the meat from rotting, or sometimes against their enemies.\n\nThe spice was imported to Europe after it was discovered. There were many tries to plant it in the East, but it did not work because the trees could not give a lot of fruit. Even though it had a rich smell and a tasty flavor, allspice never had the same caché in Europe as cinnamon or pepper. The English started taking the spice by ship to England in 1737, but by that time the want for spices had been taken over by other kinds of products such as sugar and coffee. It was still a little popular in England though, where it came to be known as the \"English Spice\".\nIn the Napoleonic war of 1812, Russian soldiers put the spice in their boots to keep their feet warm. Because of this, today the pimento oil from the allspice is usually used for the men’s dress.\n\nDried allspice berries look like large brown peppercorns and their colors are cocoa brown. When the berries are not yet ripe, they are harvested and dried by the sun. They are different in size from between 4 and 7 mm (1/8 - 1/4 in) in diameter and are dark brown. Their skin is very wrinkled, and the outer case has two seeds. Allspice can be eaten ground or whole.\n\nWhole dried allspice can keep without a time limit if they are properly kept in airtight jars.

Morse code uses \"dots\" and \"dashes\" to show the alphabet letters, numbers, punctuation and special characters of a given message. When messages are sent by Morse code, dots are short beeps or clicks or flashes, and dashes are longer ones.\n\nMorse code is named after Samuel Morse, who helped invent it. It is not used as much today as it was in the 19th and 20th centuries. Teletypewriters were invented in the early 20th century with their own codes and gradually replaced Morse code. Other types of technology that are easier to use for communication became even more common. However, some people still use Morse code to communicate on amateur radio. \n\nThere are different types of Morse code for some different countries. \n\nThere are three different symbols in Morse code; there's a short one, usually called 'dit', a long one, called 'dah', and the pause. A dah is three times as long as a dit, and the pause has the same length as the dit. \n\nMorse code can be sent in different ways. On ships, flickering lights were often used instead of radio communication.\n\nThe S.O.S as it is used today, was introduced by the Imperial German Marine in 1904. It was mandatory for all German ships starting in 1905. It was meant as a distress signal, and should be repeated until all other stations stopped sending. Afterwards the real message would be sent. Also, there is no pause between the characters. \n\nAt the time, the market was controlled by two companies; one was Telefunken, and the other was Marconi. Marconi was under British control, Telefunken was German. Marconi used CQD as a distress signal. \n\nThe people doing the communication were employees of either Marconi or Telefunken; they were not employed by the ships' owners. These operators were not allowed to answer calls sent by the competing company, which also included distress signals. As this was against the laws of the sea, a conference in Berlin decided to use the German distress signal internationally. This started in 1908. When the ship Republic sent a distress signal in 1909, it was still CQD, and the Titanic also sent CQD at first, in 1912. \n\nThe first ship to use the new signal was the RMS Slavonia, in 1909.\n\nThe Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) is a satellite-based system that was introduced in 1999 to handle distress situations. It defines four different regions, three of which are covered by satellite. The fourth, which covers the polar regions, is covered by shortwave radio. With the introduction of GMDSS, the S.O.S signal is no longer used. \n", "id": "141901", "title": "Morse code"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142002", "text": "Komodo dragon\n\nThe Komodo dragon (\"Varanus komodoensis\") is a species of lizard that lives in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rincah, Flores, Gili Motang, and Gili Dasami. It is the largest living lizard. They grow to an average length of 2–3 meters (approximately 6.5–10 ft) and weigh around 70kg (154 pounds). Komodo dragon bites can be very dangerous, and they sometimes attack people. \n\nWestern scientists first saw Komodo dragons in 1910. They are very popular animals in zoos because they are very big and look scary. The lizards are in some danger. There are very few Komodo dragons still alive on their home islands. Indonesian law does not allow hunting these lizards. Komodo National Park was made to help protect Komodo dragons.\n\nThe Komodo dragon has other names. It can also be called the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor by some scientists, but this is not very common. The people who live in Komodo Island call them \"ora\", \"buaja durat\" (land crocodile) or \"biawak raksasa\" (giant monitor).\n\nThe Komodo dragon is cold-blooded. Its tail is as long as its body. It has about 60 sharp teeth that can grow up to 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) long. It also has a long, yellow, forked tongue. Its skin can be blue, orange, green, gray, or brown. Its saliva is red because its gums almost completely cover its teeth. When they eat, their teeth cut their gums and make them bleed. This creates a good environment for the dangerous bacteria that live in its mouth. \n\nThese lizards are the top predators in the places where they live because they are so big.\nPeople used to think they were very big because there are no other large, meat-eating animals on the islands where they live. Therefore they did not have to compete with other similar animals for the same food and places to live. People also thought they were big because of their low metabolic rate. \n\nHowever, facts are different. The fossil record shows that the Komodo is the last of a group of lizards called varanids. These lizards have been about the same size for nearly a million years. They had their origin in Australia nearly four million years ago, and spread later to much of Indonesia. Their size has nothing to do with being on a relatively small island.\n\nMost of them died out after contact with the \nmodern humans.\n\nThe Komodo dragon's earholes are easy to see, but Komodo dragons are not very good at hearing. It is able to see as far away as 300 meters (985 feet), but it is thought to have poor night vision. The Komodo dragon is able to see in color, but has trouble seeing objects that do not move. \n\nThe Komodo dragon uses its tongue to taste and smell like many other reptiles. They have a special part of the body called the Jacobson's organ for smelling. With the help of a good wind, they can smell dead animals from 4–9.5 kilometres (2.5–6 mi) away. The Komodo dragon's nostrils are not very useful for smelling, because it does not have a diaphragm. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales have special connections to nerves that give the lizard a sense of touch. The scales around its ears, lips, chin, and bottoms of the feet may have three or more of these connections.\n\nKomodo dragons have dangerous bacteria in their saliva. Scientists have identified 57 of them. One of the most dangerous bacteria in Komodo dragon saliva appears to be a kind of \"Pasteurella multocida\". These bacteria cause disease in the blood of their victim. If a bite does not kill an animal and it escapes, it will usually die within a week from infection. The Komodo dragon seems to never get sick from its own bacteria. So, researchers have been looking for the lizard's antibacterial. This may be used as medicine for humans. In addition to this deadly bacterial brew, the Komodo dragon has venom glands in its lower jaws which match the potency of the inland taipan, a venomous snake. The venom acts as a blood thinner, and will cause death by heart failure and massive internal bleeding in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nMating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. Dragons leave about twenty eggs in empty nests left by birds called megapodes. The eggs develop for seven to eight months. The eggs open and the baby lizards come out in April, when there are many insects to eat. Young Komodo dragons live in trees, where they are safe from adult Komodo dragons and other animals that might eat them. They take around three to five years to mature and may live as long as fifty years. Female Komodo dragons can have babies without fertilisation (parthenogenesis).\n\nThe Komodo dragon likes hot and dry places and lives in dry open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest on lower land. It is most active in the day because it is cold-blooded, although it is sometimes active at night. Komodo dragons live alone. They come together only to breed and eat. They can run up to 20 kilometers per hour (12.4 mph), dive up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) at top speed for short periods of time. When they are young, they climb trees with their strong claws. As the Komodo dragon grows bigger, its claws are used mostly as weapons, because it is too big to climb trees well. \n\nThe Komodo dragon digs holes for protection with its powerful legs and claws. These holes can be from 1–3 metres (3–10 ft) wide.\nBecause it is very big and sleeps in holes, it is able to keep itself warm through the night. The Komodo dragon usually hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day. Komodo dragons have special resting places on ridges that catch cool sea breezes.\n\nKomodo dragons are carnivores, which means that they eat meat. Although they eat mostly dead animals they will also catch live animals as prey. When prey goes by a Komodo dragon, it will suddenly charge at the animal and bite or claw the belly or the throat. To catch animals that are up high and out of reach, the Komodo dragon may stand on its back legs and use its tail as a support.\n\nKomodo dragons do not chew their food. They eat by biting and pulling off large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole. They can swallow smaller prey, up to the size of a goat, whole. This is because they have flexible jaws and skulls, and their stomachs can expand. Komodo dragons make much saliva to help the food move easily, but swallowing still takes a long time (15–20 minutes to swallow a goat). Komodo dragons may try to swallow faster by running and pushing the dead animal in its mouth very hard against a tree. Sometimes a lizard hits the tree so hard that it gets knocked out. Dragons breathe using a small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs. This allows it to continue breathing even while swallowing large things. Komodo dragons can eat up to 80 percent of its body weight in one meal. After swallowing its food, it drags itself to a sunny place to speed up digestion so the food does not rot and poison the dragon. Large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon vomits the horns, hair, and teeth of the animal it ate. This vomit is covered in a smelly mucus. After vomiting, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus. This suggests that komodo dragons dislike the smell, just like humans do.\n\nThe largest animals usually eat first, while the smaller ones eat later. Dragons of equal size may wrestle each other. Losers usually run away, although sometimes they are chased and eaten by the winners.\n\nThe Komodo dragon's diet includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boars, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo. Young Komodo dragons will eat insects, eggs, geckoes, and small mammals. Komodo dragons may eat people and, they can even dig up bodies from their graves to eat them. Therefore, people on Komodo Island moved their graves from sandy to clay ground and piled rocks on top to stop the lizards from digging up dead bodies.\n\nBecause the Komodo dragon does not have a diaphragm, it cannot suck water when drinking. It cannot lap water with its tongue either. Instead, it drinks by taking a mouthful of water, lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.\n\nRecent fossils from Queensland suggests that the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia. Its body size remained stable on Flores, ever since the islands were isolated by rising sea levels, about 900,000 years ago. The sea level dropped very low during the last ice age and uncovered wide areas of continental shelf. The Komodo dragon spread into these areas. They became isolated on the islands where they live today when sea levels rose again. They moved into what is now the Indonesian island group. They spread as far east as the island of Timor. \n\nKomodo dragons have been popular in zoos for a long time. However, there are few of them in zoos because they may become sick and do not have babies easily. As of May 2009, there are 13 European, 2 African, 35 North American, 1 Singaporean, and 2 Australian institutions that keep Komodo dragons.\n\nA Komodo dragon was shown in a zoo for the first time in 1934 at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. But, it lived for only two years. People continued to try to keep Komodo dragons in zoos, but the lives of these creatures was very short. The average life of a dragon in a zoo was five years in the National Zoological Park. Walter Auffenberg studied the dragons in zoos and eventually helped zoos to keep dragons more successfully.\n\nMany dragons in zoos may become tamer than wild lizards within a short period of time in a zoo. Many zoo keepers have brought the animals out of their cages to meet visitors without any problems. Dragons can also recognize individual humans. However, even dragons that seem tame may surprise people and become aggressive. This can often happen when a stranger enters the animal's home. \n\nResearch with captive Komodo dragons has shown that they play. One dragon would push a shovel left and seemed attracted to the sound of it moving across rocks. A young female dragon at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. would grab and shake things like statues, drink cans, plastic rings, and blankets. She would also put her head in boxes, shoes, and other objects. She did not make a mistake and think these objects were food; she would only swallow them if they were covered in rat blood.\n\nKomodo dragons do not attack human very often. However, they do sometimes hurt or kill people.\n\nIn June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously hurt Phil Bronstein—executive editor of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Bronstein had entered the dragon's cage at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper. The zoo keeper had told him to take off his white shoes, which could have excited the Komodo dragon. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot. Although he escaped, he needed surgery to repair his foot.\n\nOn June 4, 2007, a Komodo dragon attacked an eight-year-old boy on Komodo Island. The boy later died because he lost too much blood. This was the first time that people know a dragon had killed a human in 33 years. Local people blamed the attack on environmentalists. People from outside the island had stopped local people from killing goats and leaving them for the dragons. The Komodo dragons no longer found the food they needed, so they came into places where humans lived in search of food. Many natives of Komodo Island believe that Komodo dragons are actually the reincarnation of relatives and should be treated with respect.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, two Komodo dragons attacked and killed fisherman Muhamad Anwar on Komodo Island. They attacked Anwar after he fell out of a sugar-apple tree. He was bleeding badly from bites on his hands, body, legs, and neck. He was taken to a clinic on the nearby island of Flores, but doctors said he was dead when he arrived.\n\nThere are very few Komodo dragons, and they may not survive. The lizards are on the IUCN Red List of animals in danger. Not many Komodo dragons still live on their home islands.\n\nHowever, there may now be only 352 females having babies in the wild. The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon on its home islands. \n\nMany things have reduced the number of dragons, including: volcanoes, earthquakes, loss of good places to live, fire, not enough animals to eat, tourism, and illegal hunting.\n\nBuying or selling Komodo dragons or their skins is illegal as part of an international law called CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).\n\n\n", "id": "142002", "title": "Komodo dragon"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142144", "text": "Kavirondo\n\nKavirondo is the old name of the region around Kavirondo Gulf (now Winam Gulf) as well as of two native peoples living there under the regime of British East Africa (The \"Nilotic Kavirondo\" and the \"Bantu Kavirondo\"). Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza. \n\nSuggested origins of the name \"Kavirondo\" include \n\nKavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of tribes: The Bantu immigrated from the south and the other Nilotic, came from the north. The Bantu appear to have been the first. The Nilotic tribes are probably an offshoot of the Acholi. They appear to have crossed the lake to reach their current home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two groups the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). Their further progress north was stopped by the southward movement of the Nilotic tribes, while the Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east. \n\nThe Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa-Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Bantu neighbors call the Nilotic Kavirondo \"Ja-Mwa\". The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is \"Ja-Luo\", but the Bantu Kavirondo call them \"Awa-Nyoro\". The two groups have many characteristics in common. \n\nThe Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically.\n\nTraditionally, these people seem to be naked. The men of the Nilotic Kavirondo start to wear a small piece of goat-skin on their penis when they become fathers. This is called \"Sembe\". Even though this covering is practically useless as a covering, ettiquette says it must still be worn. Even those men who wear clothes must wear the goat-skin, when they are fathers. \n\nMen of the tribe have traveled more, and have had more contact with white people. Some of the tribesmen now wear European-style clothing. Women traveled less, or were more conservative. They kept the nudity, or the few garments they had before.\n\nAmong the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fiber suspended from a girdle behind. This tassel looks like a tail from a distance. The first travelers to Africa talked about a \"tailed race\". The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but not the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders. \n\nSome of the Bantu tribes practice circumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body. \n\nThe Kavirondo are known for being independent, eager, and ready to fight. They are seen as honest, and as having a high sexual morality, traits common among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men. For this reason, polygamy is common.\n\nAmong the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy, endeavoring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of adultery. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in installments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Niotic tribes. Names are not male and female, and a daughter often bears her fathers name.\n\nThe Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the veranda of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the veranda of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fiber worn round the neck and waist.\n\nA chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children.\n\nWhile some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round.\n\nA portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep.\n\nCooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished. \n\nThough a peaceful people the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies. \n\nIn the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria, while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of small-pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars on his wife's body to ensure him good luck.\n\nOf dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped instrument. They also use various drums.\n\nThe Ja-Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggry beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from ancient cities in Baluchistan.\n\nThey appears to practice a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil.

In addition to sorghum, Eleusine and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child-bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people. \n\nThe Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made. \n\nThe Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut. \n\nTraditional Kavirondo industries are salt-making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.\n\n", "id": "142144", "title": "Kavirondo"}

However, in 1857 rebellions broke out in many different places, Murree being one of these places. People thought the rule of the British was about to be overthrown. In the Murree hills it was the Dhund Abbasi and Karlal tribes who rose up against the British.\n\nAlthough the tribes of Murree had risen against the British, not everyone had been against British rule. Before British rule had been established in the area, the tribes had fought against the Sikhs. Under the command of Mohammed Ali Shah (also known as the Pir of Plasi), they had fought against the Sikh Army in Balakot - the troops here were commanded by Syed Shah Ismail Shahid and Syed Ahmad Shaheed (known as \"The Martyrs\")\n\nThe British, after battling in Rawalpindi in 1845 had captured Rani Jind Kaur, the widow of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (the former Ruler of Punjab) - this caused the collapse of Sikh rule and, when the British marched into the Murree area, the local tribes at first welcomed them. However, many of the tribes soon considered that they had exchanged one form of occupation for another and events elsewhere in India also encouraged an uprising.\n\nThe British had recruited many of the tribes in the area into their army, for example many members of the Satti tribe were recruited as Sepoys and the British commanders (like elsewhere across Colonial India) won this war largely by the use of Indian soldiers.\n\nThe War against the British then reached Murree and the Southern Areas of Hazara Division, the part of which is now known as Circle Bakote in July 1857 when the Dhund Abbasi leader Sardar Sherbaz Khan planned to attack the British.\n\nBy the end of August many of the British troops who had been in Murree had left to join the campaign in Delhi. Rebels had taken Delhi from British control and the British had sent as many soldiers as they could. The decision to send troops to Delhi meant that the defence of Murree was weakened However the British were unable to take Delhi quickly, and as Delhi still held out against the British the Dhund tribesmen decided to take Murree. The Dhund attacked Murree by rising on every side at the same time and crowding up the nearer hill-sides threatening destruction of the station. Several of the table-servants supported the hill-men, and for some hours the danger to Murree became imminent.\n\nAccording to the 1857 Punjab Mutiny Report the attack failed because the British were told of the plan to attack them. One of Lady Lawrence's servants, named Hakim Khan, told the British of the attack to come. The loyalty of Hakim was described in the report as \"the means, under God, of saving Murree\" The British quickly organised defences, and quickly got volunteers. A cordon of sentries surrounded the station and the three weakest points were held in some force. When the Dhunds arrived in the middle of the night they found the whole station waiting for them.\n\nAfter a few hours of skirmishing the Dhunds retreated with the loss of two or three of their men who had come within musket range of the British. After that, the British quickly arrested, convicted and executed two Hindustani doctors for being involved in the plot. They had been educated in government institutions, were practising in Murree and employed by the government. The British suspected that the Dhunds were expecting support from their Hindustani allies, so as well as the doctors several domestic servants were seized and punished.\n\nAn urgent request was sent to troops in Hazara to reinforce Murree and Major Beecher sent every available man from Abbottabad to Murree - however the British troops in Murree had managed to secure the station and beat off the attack before the arrival of reinforcements.\n\nThe revolt did not succeed, the rebels' leaders were arrested and punished. All of Sardar Sherbaz Khan's eight sons were blasted by cannon fire in Murree whilst Sardar Khan himself was hanged.\n", "id": "142307", "title": "1857 War of Independence in Murree"}

She is also the only woman to be a part of Clockwork Orange House of Fun matches.\n\nJames started working with WWE in October 2005. She was a part of a storyline with Trish Stratus. James' gimmick was that she was Stratus' biggest fan and later became Stratus' stalker. This storyline lasted almost a year. The person at WWE believed she was doing good work. Because of this, she won her first WWE Women's Championship at WrestleMania 22. She has held the championship a total of four times.\n\nOutside of wrestling, James has an associate of arts degree in business administration.

James was a fan of professional wrestling as a child. She used to watch wrestling with her father. Her favorite wrestlers were Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat and Ric Flair.\n\nJames started her training at a professional wrestling school in the Washington, D.C. area. She started her wrestling career on the independent circuit in 1999. Her first work was as a valet for KYDA Pro Wrestling using the ring name Alexis Laree. The name is a combination of her stage name from when she was a dancer and her middle name. As Laree, she managed several male wrestlers. This included managing Tommy Dreamer to win the KYDA Pro Heavyweight Championship. In March, she wrestled in her first match. It was an intergender tag team match with Jake Damian against American Mike Brown and Candie. James trained to get better at wrestling at many places. These places include the Funking Conservatory run by Dory Funk, Jr. and an Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) dojo. She also started wrestling for Maryland Championship Wrestling. While there, she was trained by Ricky Morton and Bobby Eaton. Because the independent circuit did not pay enough, James worked as a waitress at an Olive Garden restaurant. Trish Stratus, a former WWE wrestler, was and still is Mickie James' role model\n\nJames worked in Ring of Honor for a year. During this time, she also started wrestling in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. As Alexis Laree, she was a part of a lingerie battle royal. On March 26, 2003, she teamed with Amazing Red against Kid Kash—the X Division Champion—and Trinity. Weeks later, she became the first member of the Gathering, a stable led by Raven.

She won a Halloween Costume Contest on October 30 and defeated Jillian Hall in a $1,000 match on November 12.\n\nLaree began a feud with Beth Phoenix on July 20. This feud started after Phoenix interrupted Laree during an interview. A match took place on July 29. Laree lost to Phoenix. The feud continued into September. Shelly Martinez was added to the storyline to side with Phoenix against Laree. On October 12, she appeared in OVW under her real name. She finished the year losing matches against Martinez and Jillian Hall.\n\nJames was first used on television in WWE on the October 10 2005 episode of \"Raw\". She used her real name. James used the gimmick of WWE Women's Champion Trish Stratus' biggest fan. The storyline had the two WWE Divas wrestling together in tag team matches. James' character became more obsessed with Stratus as time went on. A Halloween Costume Contest was part of the story line. James was dressed like Stratus. She even started using Stratus' personal finishing moves as her own during matches. On December 12, James wrestled and defeated Victoria. The match was to decide who would wrestle Stratus at New Year's Revolution for the championship. Lesbian themes were added to the story line with James kissing Stratus under mistletoe and saying nice things to her about her breasts. In the championship match, James lost to Stratus but still showed romantic fellings towards her the next night on \"Raw\". She told Stratus that she loved her at the Royal Rumble.\n\nOn March 6 2006 the storyline had Stratus telling James that they needed time apart from each other. They wrestled as a team at the March 18, 2006 Saturday Night's Main Event. James and Stratus defeated Candice Michelle and Victoria in the match. After the match, James tried to kiss Stratus. Stratus pushed her away and James' character made a complete heel turn. She attacked Stratus in the ring. James' character later said she would destroy Stratus. The two women wrestled each other at WrestleMania 22. James won the match to become the Women's Champion for her first time. During the match, even though James was playing the heel character, the fans liked her more than Stratus. The storyline ended at Backlash with a rematch after Stratus legitimately dislocated her shoulder when James threw her out of the ring. James lost the Women's Title on August 14 to Lita. During the match, Lita hit James with the title belt when Edge distracted the referee. This causes a face turn for James' on-screen character. When Stratus retired as champion, there was no longer a Women's Championship. WWE held a tournament to name a new champion. James was a part of that tournament. She defeated Victoria and Melina in the early parts of the tournament. She made it to the finals at Cyber Sunday. In the final match, she lost to Lita. At the 2006 Survivor Series James defeated Lita to win her second Women's Championship.\n\nA new feud began between James and Melina on January 29 2007. Melina was the number one contender for the Women's Title at the time. James defeated Melina on February 5 to keep the championship. After this, she teamed with Super Crazy in a mixed tag team match against Melina and Johnny Nitro. Melina defeated James and challenged her to a rematch for the title. James lost the Women's Championship to Melina on February 19. The two wrestled in the first ever Women's Falls Count Anywhere match in WWE history. James lost to Melina. Near the end of the match, James fell from the turnbuckle. She landed on her neck but was not badly injured.\n\nAt a house show in Paris, France on April 24, James won her third Women's Championship. In a Triple Threat Match with Malina and Victoria, James pinned Victoria. However, she did not pin Melina, Jonathan Coachman said that a rematch would take place immediately. James lost the title back to Melina. This gave her the shortest Women’s Championship reign in WWE history.\n\nOn the November 26 edition of \"Raw\", James defeated Melina in a number one contenders match for Beth Phoenix's Women's Championship. This led to a title match between James and Phoenix at Armageddon 2007. James lost the match to Phoenix. On the April 14, 2008 edition of \"Raw\", held in London, James defeated Phoenix to win her fourth Women's Championship. At Judgment Day James successfully defended the Women's Championship against Phoenix and Melina in a Triple Threat match. James lost the championship back to Phoenix at SummerSlam 2008.

It was one of the first experiments showing that bacteria can get DNA through a process called transformation.\n\nGriffith used two strains of \"Pneumococcus\". These bacteria infect mice. He used a type III-S (smooth) and type II-R (rough) strain. The III-S strain covers itself with a polysaccharide capsule that protects it from the host's immune system. This means that the host will die. The II-R strain does not have that protective shield around it and is killed by the host's immune system.\n\nIn this experiment, bacteria from the III-S strain were killed by heat, and their remains were added to II-R strain bacteria. While neither harmed the mice on their own, the blend of the two was able to kill mice. \n\nGriffith was also able to get both live II-R and live III-S strains of \"pneumococcus\" from the blood of these dead mice. He concluded that the type II-R had been \"transformed\" into the lethal III-S strain by a \"transforming principle\" that was somehow part of the dead III-S strain bacteria.\n\nToday, we know that the \"transforming principle\" Griffith saw was the DNA of the III-S strain bacteria. While the bacteria had been killed, the DNA had survived the heating process and was taken up by the II-R strain bacteria. The III-S strain DNA contains the genes that form the shielding polysaccharide part from attack. Armed with this gene, the former II-R strain bacteria were now protected from the host's immune system and could kill the host. \n\nThe exact nature of the transforming principle (DNA) was confirmed in the experiments done by Avery, McLeod and McCarty and by Hershey and Chase.\n\n\n", "id": "142440", "title": "Griffith's experiment"}

For example, a \"flu strain\" is a certain biological form of the influenza or \"flu\" virus. Properly speaking, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses do not have species, because they do not have eukaryote-type sexual reproduction. Bacteria do exchange DNA, but they may exchange it between different kinds of bacteria, illustrating their considerable difference from eukaryotes. Strains are therefore an absolutely essential part of bacterial identification. \n\nIn botany, the term is not used to rank plants. It is sometimes used to refer to all the descendants produced from a common ancestor that share a uniform morphological or physiological character. A strain is a designated group of offspring that have descended from a modified plant, produced ether by conventional breeding or by biotechnological means or result from genetic mutation. As an example, some rice strains are made by inserting new genetic material into a rice plant, all the descendants of the genetically modified rice plant are a strain with a unique genetic code that is passed on to later generations; the strain designation, which is normally a number or a formal name, covers all the plants that descent from the originally modified plant. The rice plants in the strain can be breed to other rice strains or cultivars, and if desirable plants are produced, these are further breed to stabilize the desirable traits; the stabilized plants that can be propagated and come true, are given a cultivar name and released into production to be used by farmers.\n\nA mouse or a rat strain is a group of animals that is genetically uniform. Strains are used in laboratory experiments. Mouse strains can be inbred or genetically engineered, while rat strains are usually produced by inbreeding.\n\n", "id": "142448", "title": "Strain (biology)"}

A plug-in hybrid differs primarily in that it can be plugged in to charge the batteries, while a conventional hybrid relies solely on energy generated from braking, coasting or from the gasoline engine.\n\nHowever, a plug-in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity. Plug-in hybrids can be driven for long distances—from a few miles to as much as 40 miles—without using any gasoline. Plug-in hybrid cars are also known as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or PHEVs. Plug-in hybrid cars that use a gas engine exclusively for recharging batteries—rather than directly powering the wheels—are also called Extended-Range Electric Vehicles or E-REVs.\n\nFueling a car with electricity is about 5 times cheaper than fueling it with gasoline. That is equivalent to buying gasoline at less than $1 per gallon. It also reduces greenhouse pollution and helps reduce crude oil imports. Also plug-in hybrids produced substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than either conventional gasoline cars or unplugged hybrids. The reduction in emissions results from electric operation being much more efficient than gasoline operation. \n\nCriticisms of the hybrid include the additional cost, weight, and size of a larger battery pack. But The extra weight of the batteries will be offset somewhat by the reduced weight of the gas engine. \n\nIt is obvious for most people that internal combustion engine cars cannot represent the future anymore because of the oil reserves that are estimated to be finished in forty or fifty years. Obviously, Plug-in vehicles cannot be considered a short term option because we lack the needed infrastructure and capable batteries for increasing the autonomy that is currently limited. The general opinion was that, at least for the next seven or eight years, Plug-ins are not going to become the standard in hybrid vehicles and that regular HEVs will have the biggest proportion on the market.\n", "id": "142540", "title": "Plug-in hybrid"}

It has the most members of any technical professional organization in the world, with more than 400,000 members in more than 160 countries. About 45% of IEEE's members live outside the United States.\n\nIt was formed in 1963 by the merger of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE, founded 1912) and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE, founded 1884).\n\nThe IRE concerned mostly radio engineering. The major interests of the AIEE were wire communications and light and power systems. As technology developing, the IRE and the AIEE became difficult to distinguish. And people who belong to both group were increasing gradually. After World War II, the leadership of both the IRE and the AIEE merged the organizations on January 1, 1963.\n\nIEEE says its purpose is \"scientific and educational, directed toward the advancement of the theory and practice of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences.\" In pursuing these goals, the IEEE serves a major publisher of scientific journals, provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology and so on.\n\nIEEE consists of 150 countries, 350,000 members, 39 societies, organized around specialized technical fields, with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings. Famous presidents of IEEE and its founding organizations include Elihu Thomson, Alexander Graham Bell, Ernst Weber. The current (2008) president of IEEE is Lewis M. Terman. \n\nIEEE produces 30 percent of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThe content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences are available in the IEEE's online digital library.\nIEEE is one of the leading standards-making organizations in the world. The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) makes and maintains standards for the IEEE. IEEE standards affect a wide range of industries including: power and energy, biomedical and healthcare, Information Technology (IT), telecommunications, transportation, nanotechnology, information assurance, and many more. In 2005, IEEE had close to 900 active standards, with 500 standards under development. One of the more notable IEEE standards is the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN group of standards which includes the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networking standard (Wi-Fi).\n", "id": "142541", "title": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers"}

It is an analog electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The term has been expanded to include uses of the same mechanism in recording, positioning, and servomechanism equipment.\nThe most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charge) through an electric circuit. The D'Arsonval/Weston form used today is constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.\n\nWhen a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform, so that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation.\n\nA tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Claude Servais Mathias Pouillet in 1837.\n\nA tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.\n", "id": "142542", "title": "Galvanometer"}

Nearly all recording tape is of this type, whether used for recording audio or video or computer data storage.\n\nMagnetic tape recording uses magnetic tape which moves on a recording head. Electrical signals are fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal.\n\nDevices that record and playback audio and video using magnetic tape are generally called tape recorders and videotape recorders respectively. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape can be called a tape drive, a tape unit, or a streamer. Autoloaders and tape libraries are frequently used to automate cartridge handling.\n\nMagnetic tape was first invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany. Pfleumer's invention used an iron oxide(FeO) powder coating on a long strip of paper.\n\nMagnetic tape has been used for data storage for over 50 years. In this time, many advances in tape have been made. Modern magnetic tape is most commonly packaged in cartridges and cassettes. \n\nToday, many other technologies like CD or DVD are replacing magnetic tape. However, innovation in the technology continues and tape is still widely used.\n\nWhen storing large amounts of data, tape can be cheaper than disk or other data storage options. Tape storage has always been used with large computer systems. Modern usage is a high capacity medium for backups and archives. As of 2008, the highest capacity tape cartridge (Sun StorageTek T10000B) can store 1 TB of data without using compression.\n\nBut, magnetic tape has quite a long wait time for random accesses since the deck must wind the tape to move from one data to another. (Magnetic tape data storage uses Sequential access method.)\n\n\n", "id": "142543", "title": "Magnetic tape"}

Electrodes are an electrical conductor (usually a metal) that is connected to something that is not a metal. The cathode type of electrode delivers electrons (negative charge) and the anode collects electrons (has the positive charge). \n\nThis lets an electrical current go into an electrical device such as a battery. It can also end in a vacuum, like in a cathode ray tube. In this case, the electrons may go into open space.\n\nIn other words, a cathode is a positive electrode on a battery and a negative electrode on an electrolytic cell. Electric current is perceived as flowing in the opposite direction that the electrons are flowing. So electrons go into the + terminal of a battery, but electric current goes out. Electrons go into the - terminal of an electrolytic cell, but electric current goes out. \n\nAn electrode through which electrons flows out of the device is termed an anode because it is positively charged. An anode is a negative electrode on a battery and a positive electrode on an electrolytic cell. \n\n", "id": "142544", "title": "Cathode"}

In general the term electrical telegraph refers to a signalling system where an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key which results in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by a human.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber installed a 1000m long wire above the town's roofs. They were allowed to do this on 6 May 1833. Carl August Steinheil was able to build a telegraph network in 1835–1836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.\n\nThe telegraph had a transmitting device which had a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current.\n\nDr. David Alter created it one year before the much more popular Morse telegraph was invented. Alter demonstrated it publically.\n\nIn the United States, the telegraph was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. Morse created an electrical telegraph in 1837. His version was a design that could transmit over long distances using poor quality wire. Vail, his assistant, developed the Morse code signalling alphabet with Morse.\n\n", "id": "142555", "title": "Electrical telegraph"}

The project was announced on December 13, 2007 and opened in beta to the public on July 23, 2008. When it was opened, there were a few hundred articles mostly about health and medicine.\n\nKnol pages are \"meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read\", according to Manber. The term \"knol\", which Google defines as a \"unit of knowledge\", refers to both the project and an article in the project. Several experts see Knol as Google's attempt to compete with Wikipedia, while others point out the differences between the projects.\n\nAnyone can create and own new knols. There can also be several articles on the same topic, each written by a different author.\nBecause multiple articles can have the same title, readers find a topic by searching, rather than just by title. The authors can say who can edit their articles: the public, other authors, or only themselves. They may also choose to include ads from Google's AdSense to their knols. Knol has a policy that specifies topics that are unacceptable for the project. Relevant nudity is allowed (in most countries), but pornography, commercial or otherwise, is forbidden. Also forbidden is discriminatory or violent content. Content designed to promote businesses, products or services is allowed, but articles devoid of substantive content and created solely to generate ad revenue are not.\n\nIn its early stages of development as a resource, Knol was criticised very much. Commentators have called it a \"wasteland\" of articles copied from other sources, entries that were outdated or abandoned, as well as spam or self-promotion. Knol is frequently criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate articles. Google has said that \"Since knol authors receive attribution, knols are a great forum for expressing your opinions.\" In October 2008, Google unveiled using Knols as a forum for debate, and enabled French, Italian and German versions, in the face of stagnating traffic.\n\nAnyone who wants to contribute to Knol must first sign in, with a Google account. The users should give their real names. If permission is given, Google will check if the name is true. Google will do this by credit card or phone. Google \"[believes] that knowing who wrote what will significantly help users make better use of web content\". The company hopes that \"knols will include the opinions and points of view of the authors who will put their reputation on the line\".\n\nReaders who are logged in with a google account can comment on entries, rate them or suggest changes. This works much like a blog. When the project was announced, Manber said that \"Google will not serve as an editor in any way, and will not bless any content. All editorial responsibilities and control will rest with the authors.\"\n\nAll knols are licensed by default under the Creative Commons CC-BY-3.0 license. This license allows anyone to reuse the material as long as the original author is named, but authors may choose the CC-BY-NC-3.0 license (which prohibits commercial reuse) or traditional \"all rights reserved\" copyright protections instead.\n\nKnol has \"nofollow\" outgoing links, using an HTML directive. This prevents links in its articles from influencing search engine rankings.\n\nPeople have described Knol as a rival to other encyclopedia sites such as Wikipedia and Scholarpedia. Sometimes people pointed out that the format was very different, and therefore it might be an addition to these sites. It might allow to get around some of the Problems of Wikipedia. The non-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which owns the name Wikipedia and the servers hosting the Wikipedia projects, welcomed the Google Knol initiative saying that \"The more good free content, the better for the world.\" Wikipedia articles are written collectively under a \"neutral point of view\" policy,\n\nThere has been debate whether Google search results can remain neutral because of possible conflict of interest. According to Danny Sullivan, the editor of \"Search Engine Land\", \"Google’s goal of making Knol pages easy to find on search engines could conflict with its need to remain unbiased.\" Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, raised similar concerns: \"At the end of the day, there's a fundamental conflict between the business Google is in and its social goals. What you're seeing here, slowly, is Google embracing an advertising-driven model, in which money will have a greater impact on what people have ready access to.\"\n\n", "id": "142560", "title": "Knol"}

There is some criticism of Wikipedia.\nWikipedia editors know that the site should not be used as a primary source for research. A librarian, whose name is Philip Bradley, said Wikipedia does not have authority. For a printed encyclopedia, the people writing it have to make sure the information is correct, or they could lose their job. Some people say calling Wikipedia an \"encyclopedia\" means that people trust it even when they should not trust it. Some librarians, academics, and writers of other encyclopedias do not like Wikipedia as a source of information. Many schools and universities do not accept Wikipedia as a source, except most of them do not want \"any\" encyclopedias used - they want primary sources instead.\n\nKat Walsh, a person in the Wikimedia Foundation (which runs Wikipedia), said Wikipedia was easier when it was made. Today, there are many rules and it is more difficult for new people to change articles. Many people who change Wikipedia have stopped, and the number of article changers have gone down since 2006. In 2006, Jimmy Wales said most of changes on Wikipedia are made by about 500 people who \"all know each other\". But most of the changes are made by people who sometimes change articles, or who do not have Wikipedia accounts at all.\n\nOn some articles, many people bother each other. Sometimes good arguments are ignored because they are not popular with the article changers.\n\nTo stop vandalism, some people have administration powers. People with administration powers can delete articles, stop a change on an article, and stop users. There are special rules to stop people with administrative powers from taking too much control, but the ideas of people with administration powers can be over the ideas of other people.\n\n\n", "id": "142562", "title": "Criticism of Wikipedia"}

The program was founded and pioneered at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, by the then college president Gordon Chalmers which was then called the \"Kenyon Plan\". The first study was conducted by three prep schools—the Lawrenceville School, Phillips Academy, and Phillips Exeter Academy—and three universities—Harvard University, Princeton University, and Yale University. In 1952 they gave the report \"General Education in School and College: A Committee Report\" which said to allow high school seniors to study college level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work. The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and put the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines.\n\nThe College Board, a non-profit organization based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955. From 1965 to 1989, Harlan Hanson was the director of the Advanced Placement Program. It makes and keeps guidelines for the teaching of higher level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses and universities. These activities are funded through fees charged to students taking AP Exams.\n\nIn 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations. Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses, though the College Board allows any student to take any examination, regardless of participation in the course. Therefore, home-schooled students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take the examination.\n\nAs of the 2011 testing season, exams cost $87 each, though the cost may reduced for poor students who cannot pay for it. The exam reduction is $22 per exam from College Board plus an additional $8 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further discounts depending on the state. Out of the $87, $8 goes directly to the school to pay for the administration of the test, which some schools will reduce to lower the cost to the student.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses – French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture – will be gone after the 2008–2009 school year due to no money.\n\nAdvanced Placement coursework is made to be very hard for average high school students. Most AP courses are sufficient preparation for the AP exams that students can take at the end of the year. If students do well on these exams, they can skip the introductory courses in college.\n\nThe academic benefit of AP coursework, aside from being able to pass out of college courses with good AP exam scores, is that students get an extra GPA point particularly for that class. An A+ or A in regular US History, for example, will factor in 4.0 GPA points to a student's grade; however, an A+ or A in AP US History would factor in 5.0 GPA points, which would improve that student's grade a lot.\n\nAP courses are not required to go to college however, most students who apply to picky colleges and universities like Stanford University and MIT take multiple AP courses in high school. They do this for various purposes:\n\nAP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:\nGrading the AP exam takes a long time. The multiple choice part is graded by a computer and the essays are scored by a group of teachers that do not teach at the student's school. \n\nStudents usually find out what they got on the test until the middle of July .\n\nSome students who do well on their AP exams may be allowed to skip a few classes in college. Generally if a student gets a 4 or 5, their university will award them credit. some colleges will also take a 3.\n\n", "id": "142637", "title": "Advanced Placement Program"}

At its height it was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire. Manichaeism appears to have died out before the sixteenth century in southern China.\n\nThe original six sacred books of Manichaeism were written in Syriac Aramaic. They were soon translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, and ultimately Uyghur and Chinese translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into Greek, Coptic, and Latin. The spread and success of Manichaeism were seen as a threat to other religions, and it was widely persecuted in Christian, Zoroastrian, and later, Islamic areas.\n", "id": "142734", "title": "Manichaeism"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142773", "text": "Niobe\n\nIn Greek mythology, Niobe (Νιόβη) was the daughter of the semi-legendary ruler Tantalus, called the \"Phrygian\" and sometimes even as \"King of Phrygia\" Tantalus ruled in Sipylus, a city located at the western end of Anatolia. The city has the same name than the mountain on which it was founded (Mount Sipylus) and of which few traces remain, and not in the traditional heartland of Phrygia lying more inland and centered around Gordion. Niobe was an Anatolian princess. She married Amphion of Thebes and Greek mythology was a vehicle for her historical record mixed with legends. Niobe was the sister of Pelops, who gave his name to the Peloponnese.\n\nAccording to the Greek myth, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because the goddess only had two children, the twins Apollo and Artemis, while Niobe had fourteen children (the Niobids), seven male and seven female. Her famously quoted speech which caused the indignation of the goddess is as follows:\nArtemis killed Niobe's daughters and Apollo killed Niobe's sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life. Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions at least one Niobid was spared, (usually Meliboea). Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo for swearing revenge. A devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylus (Spil Mount) of Lydia in Anatolia and was turned into a stone waterfall as she wept unceasingly. Spil Mount has a natural rock formation resembling a female face claimed to be Niobe, not to be confused with a sculpture carved into the rock-face of nearby crag Coddinus, north of Spil Mount, probably representing Cybele and attributed by the locals to Broteas, the ugly brother of Niobe. The rock formation is also known as the \"Weeping Stone\", as the stone is said to have wept tears during the summer. The rock appears to weep because it is porous limestone and rainwater seeps through the pores. \n\nThere are various accounts about how and where Niobe died; the story that returns Niobe from Thebes to her Lydian homeland is recorded in \"Bibliotheke\" 3.46.\n\nThe story of Niobe is an ancient one among Greeks: Niobe is mentioned by Achilles to Priam in Homer's \"Iliad\" book XXIV, as a stock type for mourning. Priam is like Niobe in that he is grieving for his son Hector, who was killed and not buried for several days. Niobe is also mentioned in Sophocles'\n\"Antigone\": as she is marched toward her death, Antigone compares her own loneliness to that of Niobe. The \"Niobe\" of Aeschylus, set in Thebes, survives in fragmentary quotes that were supplemented by a papyrus sheet containing twenty-one lines of text. From the fragments it appears that for the first part of the tragedy the grieving Niobe sits veiled and silent. Sophocles too contributed a \"Niobe\" that is lost. Furthermore, the conflict between Niobe and Leto is mentioned in one of Sappho's poetic fragments, (\"Before they were mothers, Leto and Niobe had been the most devoted of friends.\") The subject of Niobe and the destruction of the Niobids was part of the repertory of Attic vase-painters and inspired sculpture groups and wall frescoes as well as relief carvings on Roman sarcophagi.\n\nNiobe's iconic tears were also mentioned in Hamlet's soliloquy (Act 1, Scene 2), in which he contrasts his mother's grief over the dead King, Hamlet's father — \"like Niobe, all tears\" —\nto her unseemly hasty marriage to Claudius.\n", "id": "142773", "title": "Niobe"}

It officially began May 15, 1996 in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1, 1996 in the central north Pacific. It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nFew notable storms formed this season, however it was very eventful. Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Douglas.\nAlma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to, or make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. Alma killed at least three people, and possibly twenty. Three were killed when a house near Lazaro Cardenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in Puebla from rains related to Alma. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with Debris.\nHurricane Boris was the second consecutive storm to approach close to Mexico. It made landfall halfway between Acapulco and Lazaro Cardenas on June 29. It killed ten people. A flood caused by Boris on the San Jeronimo River left thousands homeless.\nCristina was the third cyclone to come close to Mexico in the space of ten days. It killed a fisherman when his boat was caught at sea off Oaxaca. At least 11 other fishing boats and 22 people were missing. Their fate is unknown.\nHurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar, which crossed Central America. Continuing Cesar's nearly due-west heading, it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29, and quickly regained hurricane status.\n\nDouglas's strengthened over the next two days as it turned west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. It reached its peak intensity on August 1,with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of 946 millibars, making it the strongest hurricane of the season. Its slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters, and it officially dissipated on August 6, though like many Pacific hurricanes, a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward.\n\nThe precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31, and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran. By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific; it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10.\n\nFausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the 12th, peaking with sustained winds of 120 mph (190 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 955 millibars. The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm; this same trough also turned the storm north on the 13th, where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane Baja California that day. On September 14, the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California, and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane. Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and Texas, but otherwise soon lost their identity.\n\nDamage in Mexico was relatively minor, with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line.\nHurricane Hernan made landfall in a thinly-populated region of Mexico. It washed out roads, and knocked down power lines and telephone poles. There were 100 injuries but no deaths.\n", "id": "142811", "title": "1996 Pacific hurricane season"}
