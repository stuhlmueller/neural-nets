It is the capital city of the district. The town was founded in the Middle Ages. It lies in the Seetal valley, about south of the Aare delta. Lenzburg and the municipalities of Niederlenz and Staufen have merged over time. The city name refers to the name of the castle which can be translated as \"spring castle\". \n\nAs of 31 December 2010, Lenzburg had a population of about 8,341 people. Lenzburg is about west of Zürich. Many people living in Lenzburg go to Zürich to work.\n\nThe district of in area is in a valley between two ranges of minor limestone mountains which rise about above the otherwise flat valley. The two major mountains are Während der Schlossberg at above sea-level with a diameter of only , and the nearby Goffersberg at above sea-level which is only long and has a broad plateau wide. Lenzburg grew together with the nearby communities into a regional area \n\nNearby municipalities are Rupperswil in the northwest, Niederlenz and Möriken Wildegg in the north; Othmarsingen in the northeast, Hendschiken in the east, Ammerswil in the southeast, Egliswil the south, Seon in the southwest as well as Staufen in the west.\n\nThe area has a long history. A neolithic cemetery with 16 chambered tombs built about 3,800 years ago was found near the castle in 1959.\n\nA Roman theatre was uncovered when the motorway was built in 1964. It was built about 100 AD. It could seat an audience of about 4,000 people. It was part of a small village of 400 to 600 people that existed for about 200 years. The village was built on either side of the road for a distance of about 400 metres. There were shops, taverns, and small factories making wood and leather products. Behind these building were houses and farms. It is possible that there was a small fort in the village. The first buildings were wooden but these were destroyed in a fire at the end of the first century. The new buildings were made of stone. The village was abandoned in the 3rd century. \nIn the 5th and 6th centuries, an Alamanni village existed. The oldest registered usage of the name \"Lencis\" (from which Lenzburg derives) is from 893. In 1036, Castle Lenzburg became the seat for the count of Lenzburg, then an important lord. The family died out in 1173, and the castle was then owned by emperor Frederick Barbarossa. After this, it was mainly used by the Kyburger house. The Habsburgs took over the castle in 1273. \n\nCity rights were granted in 1306. Lenzburg was conquered by Bern in 1415, along with the western part of what is now Aargau. Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the area from 1444 to 1798. A major fire ruined the town in 1491. Only fifteen houses were not destroyed. The reformation was carried out at the same time with the rest of the region in 1528. The economy started to move slowly from a farming economy to a more industrial one in the 16th century. A textile factory was founded in 1732.\n\nIn 1798, the Helvetian Republic was made and the lords from Bern were removed. The canton of Aargau was founded and Lenzburg became the capital of the district in 1803. The canton gained the castle in 1804. Lenzburg became the economic center of the area in the 19th century. In 1875, Lenzburg was added to the railway system. Competition for trade became too much and Lenzburg became bankrupt only one year later. The town recovered from bankruptcy during the next 10 years.\n\nIn 1886, the German playwright, Frank Wedekind lived in the castle which his father had bought. It was sold in 1892 to August Edward Jessup from Philadelphia who spent a lot of money restoring the castle. He sold it to a Chicago banker, James W. Ellsworth in 1911. Ellsworth's son, Lincoln Ellsworth and Roald Amundsen used the castle to plan their polar explorations in the 1920s.\n\nThe main place to see in the town is the Lenzburg castle. It was built in the 11th century and has been added onto several times. Lenzburg is among the oldest and most important high-castles in Switzerland. Some of the city wall has been kept and is now under protection. Some interesting buildings are in the old part of town. These include:\n\nLenzburg is an important economic centre. It contains over 800 companies. Most of the businesses are small to medium sized, but some worldwide companies are established in Lenzburg, for example the global Asea Brown Boveri (ABB). About 6,000 people work in Lenzburg.\n\nLenzburg is a good place for transportation. It is about from Zürich with access to the A1, Switzerland's most important motorway. Two main axes of traffic cross in Lenzburg, one running from Waldshut to Lucerne and the other running from Zurich to Berne. \n\nSome of the trains from Zurich to Berne stop in Lenzburg. Lenzburg is part of the Suburban rail system of Zurich. Other trains connect the city to Brugg, Lucerne, Zofingen and Zug. The line to Wettingen was closed, because of low traffic. The trains were replaced by a commuter line from Zurich (which runs to Aarau). \n\nZürich International Airport is close to the town of Lenzburg. The local bus \"Regionalbus Lenzburg\" leads to the municipalities of Brunegg, Dintikon, Möriken-Wildegg, Schafisheim and Seengen. Lenzburg has an urban bus system as well.\n\nFor over 400 years, the youth celebration (\"Jugendfest\") is the largest event in Lenzburg. It takes place every year on the second Friday of July. In August, the \"Gauklerfestival\" takes place in the streets of the old part of town with food and entertainment on the streets of the city.\n\n", "id": "84962", "title": "Lenzburg"}

It is east of Basel. The name means the fields of the Rhine, as the town is on the Hochrhein. It is home to Feldschlösschen, the most popular beer in Switzerland. The city is across the river from Rheinfelden in Baden-Württemberg; the two cities were joined until Napoleon Bonaparte fixed the German–Swiss border on the Rhine in 1802 and are still socially and economically tied.\n\nThe old town of Rheinfelden is on the Rhine river. The Rhine can be traveled down by ship from Rheinfelden all the way to the North Sea.\n\nThe area around Rheinfelden was already settled about 10,000 years ago. At that time, people lived in the \"Hermitage\", a small natural cave next to the current highway. In the year 45 BC, a few kilometers west, the village Augusta Raurica was made, the first Roman town in Switzerland, near modern Kaiseraugst. Towards the end of the 4th century, a fort was built at the western settlement.\n\nDuring the 17th century, there was very little time during which the city enjoyed peace. During the Rappenkrieg (a peasant uprising that lasted from 1612 until 1614), the city was ruined. Between 1633 and 1638, the Thirty Years' War reached Fricktal, where Rheinfelden played a big role. On 15 July 1633, Swedish and French troops ruined the city. On 5 February 1638, the city was put under attack by Protestant troops sent by Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. On 28 February, the Battle of Rheinfelden began, as the city was attacked by the bigger Imperial and Bavarian troops sent by Johann von Werth and Federigo Savelli. The Protestants lost this battle and moved on. Bernhard brought them weapons, but in the second passage on 3 March they were defeated, as he and his men unexpectedly re-appeared on the battlefield, with Savelli and Werth falling into captivity.\n\nBy the end of the Thirty Years' War, the Austrians had built a fortress on the island to secure the southwestern border of the Breisgau. In 1678, French troops sent by François de Créquy fired at the city. In 1745, during the War of the Austrian Succession, the French made a fortress on the same ground and also ruined part of the city wall. On 17 July 1796, Rheinfelden was again occupied and looted by the French.\n\nBecause of the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, the Fricktal became a protectorate of the French, making the front line between the French Revolutionary and the Austrian troops in the War of the Second Coalition. On 20 February 1802, Rheinfelden was made the capital city of the new Canton of Fricktal, joining the Helvetic Republic in August, the point at which the city became mostly Swiss. The seat of the cantonal government was here instead of in Laufenburg. With the beginning of the \"Reichsdeputationshauptschluss\" (the German Mediatisation), Napoleon Bonaparte removed the canton of Fricktal. Since 19 March 1803, Rheinfelden has been the capital of the district of the same name, in the canton of Aargau.\n\n", "id": "84970", "title": "Rheinfelden, Switzerland"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85028", "text": "Origin of life\n\nThe origin of life is a scientific problem which is not yet solved. There are plenty of ideas, but few clear facts. The Miller's 1953 experiment shows that abiotic synthesis of organic molecules is possible. \n\nIt is generally agreed that all life today evolved by common descent from a single primitive lifeform. We do not know how this early form came about, but scientists think it was a natural process which took place perhaps 3,900 million years ago. This is in accord with a philosophy called naturalism: only natural causes are admitted.\n\nWe do not know whether metabolism or genetics came first. The main hypothesis which supports genetics first is RNA world hypothesis, and the one which supports metabolism first is Protein world hypothesis.\n\nAnother big problem is how cells develop. All existing forms of life are built out of cells.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Melvin Calvin wrote a book on the subject, and so did Alexander Oparin. What links most of the early work on the origin of life was the idea that before biological evolution began there must have been a process of chemical evolution. Another question which has been discussed by J.D. Bernal and others is the origin of the cell membrane. By concentrating the chemicals in one place, the cell membrane performs a vital function.\n\nMany religions teach that life did not evolve spontaneously, but was deliberately created by a God or several gods. Often they claim that this happened within the last few thousand years, which is much more recent than the fossil record suggests. The lack of evidence that this happened means that most scientists do not believe it. These theories are known as creationism.\n\nThe earliest claimed lifeforms are fossilized microorganisms (or microfossils). They were found in iron and silica-rich rocks which were once hydrothermal vents in the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt of Quebec, Canada. \n\nThese rocks are as old as 4.28 billion years. The tubular forms they contain are shown in a report. If this is the oldest record of life on Earth, it suggests \"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\" after oceans formed 4.4 billion years ago. According to Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe.\"\n\nA scientific study from 2002 showed that geological formations of stromatolites 3.45 billion years old contain fossilized cyanobacteria. At the time it was widely agreed that stromatolites were oldest known lifeform on Earth which had left a record of its existence. Therefore, if life originated on Earth, this happened sometime between 4.4 billion years ago, when water vapor first liquefied, and 3.5 billion years ago. This is the background to the latest discovery discussed above.\n\nEarliest evidence of life comes from the Isua supercrustal belt in Western Greenland and from similar formations in the nearby Akilia Islands. This is because a high level of the lighter isotope of carbon is found there. Living things uptake lighter isotopes because this takes less energy. Carbon entering into rock formations has a concentration of elemental δC of about −5.5. of C, biomass has a δC of between −20 and −30. These isotopic fingerprints are preserved in the rocks. With this evidence, Mojzis suggested that life existed on the planet already by 3.85 billion years ago. \n\nA few scientists think life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores. This idea, now known as panspermia, was first put forward by Arrhenius.\n\nUntil the early 19th century many people believed in the regular spontaneous generation of life from non-living matter. This was called spontaneous generation, and was disproved by Louis Pasteur. He showed that without spores no bacteria or viruses grew on sterile material.\n\nIn a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker on 11 February 1871, Charles Darwin proposed a \"natural process\" for the origin of life. \n\nHe suggested that the original spark of life may have begun in a \"warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. A protein compound was then chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes\". He went on to explain that \"at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed\". \n\nNo real progress was made until 1924 when Alexander Oparin reasoned that atmospheric oxygen prevented the synthesis of the organic molecules. Organic molecules are the necessary building blocks for the evolution of life. In his \"The Origin of Life\", Oparin argued that a \"primeval soup\" of organic molecules could be created in an oxygen-less atmosphere through the action of sunlight. These would combine in ever-more complex fashions until they formed droplets. These droplets would \"grow\" by fusion with other droplets, and \"reproduce\" through fission into daughter droplets, and so have a primitive metabolism in which those factors which promote \"cell integrity\" survive, those that do not become extinct. Many modern theories of the origin of life still take Oparin's ideas as a starting point.\n\nAround the same time J.B.S. Haldane also suggested that the Earth's pre-biotic oceans, which were very different from what oceans are now, would have formed a \"hot dilute soup\". In this soup, organic compounds, the building blocks of life, could have formed. This idea was called \"biopoiesis\", the process of living matter evolving from self-replicating but nonliving molecules.\n\nThere is almost no geological record from before 3.8 billion years ago. The environment that existed in the Hadean era was hostile to life, but how much so is not known. There was a time, between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago, which is known as the Late Heavy Bombardment. It is so named because many lunar craters are thought to have formed then. The situation on other planets, such as Earth, Venus, Mercury and Mars must have been similar. These impacts would likely sterilize the Earth (kill all life), if it existed at that time.\n\nSeveral people have suggested that the chemicals in the cell give clues as to what the early seas must have been like. In 1926, Macallum noted that the inorganic composition of the cell cytosol dramatically differs from that of modern sea water: \"the cell… has endowments transmitted from a past almost as remote as the origin of life on earth\". For example: \"All cells contain much more potassium, phosphate, and transition metals than modern ... oceans, lakes, or rivers\". \"Under the anoxic, CO-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of inland basins at geothermal fields would [be like the chemistry inside] modern cells\". \n\nIf life evolved in the deep ocean, near a hydrothermal vent, it could have originated as early as 4 to 4.2 billion years ago. If, on the other hand, life originated at the surface of the planet, a common opinion is it could only have done so between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago.\n\nLazcano and Miller (1994) suggest that the pace of molecular evolution was dictated by the rate of recirculating water through mid-ocean submarine vents. Complete recirculation takes 10 million years, so any organic compounds produced by then would be altered or destroyed by temperatures exceeding 300 °C. They estimate that the development of a 100 kilobase genome of a DNA/protein primitive heterotroph into a 7000 gene filamentous cyanobacterium would have required only 7 million years.\n\nOriginally, the Earth's atmosphere had almost no free oxygen. It gradually changed to what it is today, over a very long time (see Great Oxygenation Event). The process began with cyanobacteria. They were the first organisms to make free oxygen by photosynthesis. Most organisms today need oxygen for their metabolism; only a few can use other sources for respiration.\n\nSo it is expected that the first proto-organisms were chemoautotrophs, and did not use aerobic respiration. They were anaerobic.\n\nThere is no \"standard model\" on how life started. Most accepted models are built on molecular biology and cell biology:\n\nThe origin of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic chemicals from which life is thought to have formed are:\nMolecular oxygen (O) and ozone (O) were either rare or absent.\n\n\nBernal suggested that evolution may have commenced early, some time between Stage 1 and 2.\n\nThere are three sources of organic molecules on the early Earth: \n\nEstimates of these sources suggest that the heavy bombardment before 3.5 billion years ago made available quantities of organics comparable to those produced by other energy sources.\n\nIn 1953 a graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that showed how organic molecules could have formed on early Earth from inorganic precursors. \n\nThe now-famous Miller–Urey experiment used a highly reduced mixture of gases – methane, ammonia and hydrogen – to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids. We do know now that for more than the first half of the Earth's history its atmosphere had almost no oxygen. \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Sidney W. Fox studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might have existed early in Earth's history. He demonstrated that amino acids could by itself form small peptides. These amino acids and small peptides could be encouraged to form closed spherical membranes, called microspheres.\n\nSome scientists have suggested special conditions which could make cell synthesis easier. \n\nA clay model for the origin of life was suggested by A. Graham Cairns-Smith. Clay theory suggests complex organic molecules arose gradually on a pre-existing non-organic platform, namely, silicate crystals in solution.\n\nIn the 1970s, Thomas Gold proposed the theory that life first developed not on the surface of the Earth, but several kilometers below the surface. The discovery in the late 1990s of nanobes (filamental structures that are smaller than bacteria, but that may contain DNA in deep rocks) might support Gold's theory.\n\nIt is now reasonably well established that microbial life is plentiful at shallow depths in the Earth (up to five kilometers below the surface) in the form of extremophile archaea, rather than the better-known eubacteria (which live in more accessible conditions). \n\nGold asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory was that the flow of food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle. \n\nSelf-organization and self-replication are the hallmark of living systems. Non-living molecules sometimes show those features under proper conditions. For example, Martin and Russel showed that cell membranes separating contents from the environment and self-organization of self-contained redox reactions are the most conserved attributes of living things. They argue that inorganic matter like that would be life's most likely last common ancestor.\n\nIn this hypothesis, RNA is said to work both as an enzyme and as a container of genes. Later, DNA took over its genetic role.\n\nThe RNA world hypothesis proposes that life based on ribonucleic acid (RNA) pre-dates the current world of life based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), RNA and proteins. RNA is able both to store genetic information, like DNA, and to catalyze chemical reactions, like an enzyme. It may have supported pre-cellular life and been a major step towards cellular life.\n\nThere are some pieces of evidence which support this idea:\n\nThis idea suggests that proteins worked as enzymes first, producing metabolism. After that DNA and RNA began to work as containers of genes.\n\nThis idea also has some evidences which supports this.\n\nIn this scheme membranes made of lipid bilayers occur early on. Once organic chemicals are enclosed, more complex biochemistry is then possible.\n\nThis is the idea suggested by Arrhenius, and developed by Fred Hoyle, that life developed elsewhere in the universe and arrived on Earth in the form of spores. This is not a theory of how life began, but a theory of how it might have spread. It may have spread, for example, by meteorites.\n\nSome propose that early Mars was a better place to start life than was the early Earth. The molecules which combined to form genetic material are more complex than the \"primordial soup\" of organic (carbon-based) chemicals that existed on Earth four billion years ago. If RNA was the first genetic material, then minerals containing boron and molybdenum could assist its formation. These minerals were much more common on Mars than on Earth.\n", "id": "85028", "title": "Origin of life"}

Although he was blind from an early age, he became one of the most important Spanish composers of the 20th century. He wrote a lot of music for guitar, which helped classical guitar music worldwide to become more popular. His most famous work is a guitar concerto called \"Concierto de Aranjuez\".\n\nRodrigo became blind at the age of three after becoming ill with diphtheria. When he was eight he began to learn piano and violin. He also learned the guitar, but never became very good at it, although he was to compose some wonderful music for the instrument.\n\nAfter studying music in Valencia he went to Paris where he studied with Paul Dukas in Paris. After a short time back in Spain he returned to Paris to study musicology, first under Maurice Emmanuel and then under André Pirro. In 1925 he received Spain's National Prize for Orchestra for his pieces \"Cinco piezas infantiles\" (Five Children's Pieces). In 1947 Rodrigo became a professor of music history in Madrid, a job that was made especially for him.\n\nRodrigo’s most famous work, \"de Aranjuez\", was composed in 1939 in Paris. It is a concerto for solo classical guitar and orchestra. There are three movements. The middle movement is a slow movement with a tune which is played on the cor anglais. It has become one of classical music’s best-loved tunes.\n\nAfter the success of this piece several other musicians asked him to write concertos for them, e.g. the flautist James Galway, the cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and the guitarist Andrés Segovia, for whom he composed \"Fantasía para un gentilhombre\" in 1954. Another of his works is called \"Concierto Andaluz,\" for four guitars and orchestra.\n\nIn 1991, Rodrigo was raised to the nobility by King Juan Carlos; he was given the title \"Marqués de los Jardines de Aranjuez\" (Marquis of the Gardens of Aranjuez). He was given the Prince of Asturias Award in 1996, the highest honour a Spanish civilian can get. He was made Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 1998.\n\nHe married Victoria Kamhi, a Turkish-born pianist, in 1933. They had a daughter called Cecilia. Rodrigo died in 1999 in Madrid at the age of 97. Joaquín Rodrigo and his wife Victoria are buried at the cemetery at Aranjuez.\n\nRodrigo composed about 170 works. These include 11 concertos, lots of pieces for choir, songs, piano music and guitar music. Like Manuel de Falla in the early 20th century, Rodrigo became the leading figure in Spanish music in the later part of the century. His music is not like most of the music that was being written in Europe at the time. At first his music was influenced by that of Stravinsky, Ravel and Granados, but later his personality gave it a special Spanish character. He had a lot of knowledge and wrote articles about lots of different arts subjects.\n\n\n", "id": "85111", "title": "Joaquín Rodrigo"}

In the end, it is Feathertail, Stormfur's sister, who kills the mountain cat, but she dies on the way. After leaving the tribe, the five remaining cats go home but find that the clans are worse than they had thought. The cats are all starving because the humans are scaring away all the prey and destroying the land. Firestar finally manages to convince the other clan leaders, (Leopardstar of Riverclan, Blackstar of ShadowClan, and Tallstar of Windclan, though he was willing) to come with him, and the four clans travel to a new territory by a lake.\n\nBut even though the cats are now safe, the trouble is not over.

In order to save the three, Squirrelflight has to tell Ashfur an important secret - Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf are not her kittens. Ashfur wants to tell all the clans, so right before the gathering, he is found dead in a river. The cats think Sol did it, so some of them go on a trip to a Twolegplace, find him, and take him back to ThunderClan. Meanwhile, Jayfeather is trying to find out who his mother is. After finding some clues, he realizes that she is Leafpool, and his father is Crowfeather. Hollyleaf is very mad upon hearing this, and she herself tells the cats at the gathering about it.

It was the first binary asteroid to be found and is a member of the Koronis family of asteroids.\n\nIda was found by Johann Palisa on September 29, 1884 in Vienna. It is named after Ida, a Cretan nymph in Greek mythology who lived on a mountain that has her name (see Mount Ida, Crete).\n\nIda has a small moon, Dactyl, which was found on February 17, 1994 by \"Galileo\" mission member Ann Harch, while examining the delayed image downloads. The moon was given the designation S/1993 (243) 1 and later named (243) Ida I Dactyl. The pictures where it was first seen were taken on 28 August 1993, hence the designation. The moon was reported on 12 March 1994.\n\nDactyl is only 1.4 km in diameter. Some researchers believe that Dactyl formed from debris blown off from Ida because of cratering, while others suggest that Ida and Dactyl formed as a pair a billion or more years ago when Ida's parent body was disrupted. Both of these theories present difficulties that are unresolved at this time. Since Dactyl was found, other sightings have suggested that asteroid moons are common.\n\nAlthough Ida's dimensions, measured along the principal axes (based on its rotation) are 53.6×24.0×15.2 km, the best-fit ellipsoid measures 60.0×25.2×18.6 km. Since its mass is well known thanks to its little moon, one can calculate that its surface gravity can be between 0.0031 and 0.0324 m/s². The rotation axis is within one degree of the shorter dimension axis, which means the centrifugal effect can reach a value as high as 0.0042 m/s² — at the tips of its longest axes, Ida is actually under tension.\n\n\n", "id": "85130", "title": "243 Ida"}

It has a fairly elliptical orbit that takes more than four years to circle the Sun. This asteroid has an unusually slow rate of rotation, taking 17.4 days to complete a 360° revolution about its axis. It is a primitive C-type asteroid, which means the surface has lots of carbon; giving it a dark surface that reflects only 4% of the light that falls on it.\n\nThis asteroid was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433 Eros. The spacecraft took pictures a hemisphere of the asteroid, finding many big craters that have gouged out depressions in the surface. It is currently the biggest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft, and the first C-type asteroid to be so explored.\n\n253 Mathilde is very dark. The asteroid has a number of very big craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two biggest craters, Ishikari (29.3 km) and Karoo (33.4 km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have blown big volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters.\n\nThe density measured by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300 kg/m³, is less than half that of a normal carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile (an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision and pulled back together by gravity). The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the volume inside of 253 Mathilde has open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some big internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.\n\nMathilde's orbit is eccentric, taking it to the farther reaches of the Main belt. Nonetheless, the orbit lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; it does not cross the planetary orbits. It also has one of the slowest rotation periods of the known asteroids — most asteroids have a rotation period in the range of 2 – 24 hours. Because of the slow rotation rate, NEAR Shoemaker was only able to take pictures of 60% of the asteroid's surface. The slow rate of rotation may been accounted for by a moon orbiting the asteroid, but a search of the NEAR images revealed none bigger than 10 km in diameter out to 20 times the radius of 253 Mathilde.\n\n", "id": "85177", "title": "253 Mathilde"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85252", "text": "Christian right\n\nThe Christian right (known as the religious right in the United States) is the name for right-wing Christian political and social movements. Though they exist in other countries, such as Canada, it is most commonly used to talk about the United States. These groups are characterized by their strong support of conservative social and political values. Usually, this comes from a belief that the United States was founded on a strong belief in God, and that American laws and policies should be based on what is in the Bible. Though members of the Christian right can be from any branch of Christianity, including Catholicism, the religious right is most often used with Evangelical Christians, Fundamentalists (such as Born-agains) and Mormons. About 15% of Americans say they are part of the Christian or religious right.\n\nPeople who have been conservative due to their religion have been in the United States for hundreds of years. For example, the people who put John Scopes on trial would be called as members of the religious right. However, the term first came into use in the 1970s by Jerry Falwell. He and others felt that the country and its institutions (such as schools and colleges) were run by left-wing intellectuals who did not believe in God, and that in reality most people believed in God and did not care for left-wing intellectuals. The fight between left-wing intellectuals and the religious right is often called the \"culture wars\".\n\nThough Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were elected in part due to support from the religious right, the only President who was a member of the religious right was George W. Bush.\n\nIn addition to the Christian right, there is something known as the Christian left, but it is not as well-known or powerful.\n\nHere are some issues that the Christian right feel strongly about: \n\nThe Christian right largely came back into being in the 1970s under Falwell due to abortion, in response to the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court. Most members of the Christian right feel that life begins at conception, killing a fetus is murder, and therefore abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. This is called being \"pro-life\". Though the right has not been able to get rid of \"Roe\" (and it is now considered to be a precedent by most judges), they have been successful in making it harder to get abortions in some states.\n\nMany members of the Christian right believe that the Bible says it is bad to be homosexual (gay or lesbian). They used to support sodomy laws. Today, they are mostly against allowing gay marriage. They have gotten many laws and initiatives passed to stop gays from marrying (such as California's Proposition 8), but some of these have been found to be unconstitutional in the courts. To make stopping gay marriage constitutional, many have pushed for an amendment to the United States constitution to ban gay marriage.\n\nMany members of the Christian right do not believe in evolution, because it goes against the creation story of the Bible. They instead favor creationism or intelligent design. Most biologists believe that evolution is true and that arguments against evolution are weak. In a few places, they have been successful in teaching intelligent design alongside evolution in public schools.\n\nMany members of the Christian right want to allow prayer in public schools and display of things related to Christ in public or government places. As with gay marriage, this has been questioned in the courts, usually due to the freedom of religion clause in the First Amendment.\n", "id": "85252", "title": "Christian right"}

The cathedral is in Canterbury, Kent. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also one of the greatest example of mediaeval Norman architecture in Britain. The cathedral is the official 'seat' of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The archbishop is the leader of the Church of England.\n\nThe church was founded by Augustine of Canterbury in 597 AD. The present version was built on the remains of the old Saxon church by Lanfranc, starting in 1066. Lanfranc, the first Norman Archbishop, was put in position by William the Conqueror. His cathedral was dedicated in 1077. The architecture of the present cathedral is basically Romanesque, with many later repairs and additions. The nave (where the congregation sits) was rebuilt in the 14th century with newly discovered building methods. The new style of English Gothic architecture ('perpendicular') gave the building greater height and larger windows.\n\nThe cathedral area, called the precinct, has walls all around it, just as the centre of Canterbury was a walled city. Much of this is still standing. The cathedral precinct includes many other buildings: a school, a conference building, a number of houses and a Palace. The Deanery is where the Dean of Canterbury lives: he is the manager of the Cathedral. The Dean and Chapter (a committee) take the decisions; the Archbishop's job is to run the Anglican Church.\n\nThe cathedral costs £12,000 a day to run and repair, and there are no government grants. Because of this, fund-raising is one of the Dean's main jobs. The cathedral is a working church. On Sundays there are six services (of different kinds). On weekdays there are three services. These are free of any entry charge. Tourists visiting pay a fee to see the cathedral when there is no service.\n\nThe cathedral has seen every important change in English life for 1400 years. It was where Thomas Becket was murdered by the soldiers of Henry II, after Henry asked, supposedly, \"Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?\" Beckett was the second Archbishop of Canterbury to be murdered. The first was St. Alphege in 1012, the third was Thomas Cranmer, in 1533.\n\nCanterbury Cathedral, the ruins of St Augustine's Abbey and St Martin's Church were together named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. As a group, they are buildings which show the development of Christianity in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "85265", "title": "Canterbury Cathedral"}

After the city became a Roman colony in the 6th century BC, it was a place for activities or trades. Near the end of the 6th century, the city was captured by troops of the Lombardic king. The city did very well under the control of the Lombards. In 1177, Pistoia chose to become a free commune. In the following years, it became an important political centre. It built walls and several public and religious buildings.\n\nIn 1254 Pistoia was captured by troops from Florentine. Pistoia stayed a Florentine city except for few years in the 14th century, when Castruccio Castracani captured it for Lucca. It was annexed to (made a part of) Florence in 1530.

When vegetable oils are heated or when they are \"hydrogenated\", trans fats are made. Hydrogenation is the process of bubbling hydrogen gas through the oil to change its consistency. The bubbling raises the melting point of the oil. As the hydrogen passes through, the oil begins to become solid. By stopping the hydrogenation part of the way through, manufacturers obtain \"partially hydrogenated oil\". This is similar to butter, but much cheaper to produce. It is sold as \"margarine\", \"oleo\" or \"vegetable shortening\". The process allows cheaply adding a butter-like consistency to food products.\n\nTrans fat is bad for human health and has been tied to a number of problems including: coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, liver dysfunction, and infertility. Healthy oils are always liquid at the temperature of blood. Saturated and trans fats are not.\n\nThere has yet to be a study which shows that trans fat is good for human health in any way. Since scientists and nutritionists now know the health issues related to eating trans fats, trans fats are being used less but there are still some in commercial food products.\nFor some time, the US government's \"Food and Drug Administration\" allowed makers of food products to label their products as having \"0 grams of trans fat per serving\" as long as the amount of trans fat in the food product falls below 0.5 grams per serving. Since partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of trans fat, reading the \"ingredients\" label is the safest way to ensure that a food does not contain any trans fat at all. Fried foods will likely, but not necessarily, contain trans fat since fried foods are produced by using very hot oil. \n\nIn 2013, the Food and Drug Administration began to gradually stop the use of trans fats in all foods. It said there is no safe amount that should be in food eaten by humans.\n\nIn June 2015, the FDA issued a final statement. It says there is no agreement by scientists that artificial trans fatty acids are safe for any use in human food. Trans fat must be taken out of all food production within three years (by June 2018). The FDA says the ban will cost the food industry $6.2 billion over 20 years. The food industry must use new formulas and recipes using ingredients without trans fat. The benefits will be about $140 billion over 20 years. This will be mostly from lower health care costs. Food companies can issue requests to the FDA for permission to use partially hydrogenated oils. The companies must prove the oils' use is safe.\n", "id": "85366", "title": "Trans fat"}

Other species familiar in the aquarium trade are: the black ghost knifefish (\"Apteronotus albifrons\"), the glass knifefish (\"Eigenmannia virescens\"), and the banded knifefish \"Gymnotus carapo\". \n", "id": "85448", "title": "Gymnotiformes"}

Fishes that can generate such fields are said to be \"electrogenic\", those that can detect them are called \"electroreceptive\". Most electrogenic fish are also electroreceptive. Many fish, for example sharks, rays, and catfishes are electroreceptive. They cannot generate electric fields though, and are therefore not classified as electric fish. Most bony fish are neither electrogenic nor electroreceptive. \n\nElectrogenic fish have a special organ that can generate electricity. This organ is usually called an electric organ. It is usually near the tail of the fish. It is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells. When the organ produces electricity that is released this is called \"electric organ discharge\" (or \"EOD\" for short).\n\nBased on the strength of the EOD, the electrogenic fish can be classified into two types:\n\n\nIn total, there are 348 known species of electric fish, in about 56 genera. The only known species that lives in salt water are the electric rays, with 23 species.\n", "id": "85451", "title": "Electric fish"}

They usually serves as a platoon, troop, or group sergeant, or in a specialist position.\n\nA Lance-Sergeant (LSgt) was originally a Corporal doing the work of a Sergeant. The job is now used mostly in the Guards, where it is given to all Corporals. A Lance-Sergeant in the Guards and Honourable Artillery Company wears three chevrons, and is considered senior or higher up to \"normal\" Corporals. For most purposes, he still remains a Corporal rather than an acting Sergeant (e.g., he will typically command a section).

His stated purpose was \"to demand justice\" for the Armenian Genocide.\n\nArmenians hoped Yanikian's trial would provide a vehicle for proving the massacres in a court of law, while there were still surviving witnesses. Yanikian took the Armenian Genocide witness stand, accompanied by his friend and interpreter, Santa Barbaran Aram Saroyan, the uncle of famous author William Saroyan.

The part of the OLED that creates light is made of a very thin layer of organic compounds. One of the uses of OLED technology is for thin display panels used in notebooks. Because of the way they are made, OLEDs can be used to make displays that can bend. These can be used in many different ways. For example, they can be used in clothing.\n\nIn some ways, OLEDs are better for display devices than LCDs. There are also ways LCDs are better. OLEDs can make more colors and levels of brightness than LEDs. Unlike LCDs their colors do not change when viewed at an angle. They are also much cheaper to make. Most LCDs have to have an LED or Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light(CCFL) used as a backlight to be visible. LCDs also need to use filters to work properly. These filters block much of the light created by the LED/CCFL. Because of backlighting and filtering, OLEDs use far less power than LCDs for the amount of light made (\"Verify this\"). OLEDs also react faster to changes in electricity. They turn on and off much faster than LCDs.\n\nLEDs will last longer than OLEDs. This is the biggest problem with OLEDs. Currently most OLEDs used in displays will work for about 5,000 hours of use. LEDs normally work for 60,000 hours. This may change as experiments in 2007 created a type of OLED that worked for 198,000 hours. The organic compounds that make up OLEDs are also more easily damaged by water. \n\nOLED technology is currently patented by the Eastman Kodak company and several other companies. Because of this, a company must pay to be allowed to use it in their product.\n\nThere are several parts to an OLED:\n\nThe emissive and conductive layers are made of special organic molecules that conduct electricity. The anode and cathode connect the OLED to the source of electricity.\n\nWhen electricity is applied to an OLED, the emissive layer becomes negatively charged and the conductive layer becomes positively charged. Electrostatic forces cause electrons to move from the positive conductive layer toward the negative emissive layer. This causes a change in the electrical levels and makes radiation that has a frequency in the range of visible light.\n\nOLED, as with all diodes, can only work if electricity flows through them in the correct direction. The Anode, connected to the emmisive layer must be at a higher electrical potential (more volts, more \"positive\") than the cathode, connected to the conductive layer, for the OLED to work.\n", "id": "85518", "title": "Organic light-emitting diode"}

It appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the Main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter. Unlike the Hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids, Thule has a very low eccentricity - actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of Earth. Why it has this orbit is not clear, as is the reason for the absence of smaller bodies in similar 4:3 resonances with Jupiter.\n\nSome astronomers have argued that Thule's present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the Sun Thule does, in the same way (though with the reverse effect) as the Kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt. It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in a very low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only a bit different from that of Thule itself.\n\nIt is the main member of the Thule dynamical group.\n\nIt was found by Johann Palisa on October 25, 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule.\n\n", "id": "85527", "title": "279 Thule"}

He is a member of the Democratic Party and is from Wilmington, Delaware. Before becoming Vice President, he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware from 1973 to 2009. He had served in the Senate longer than any other Vice President. \n\nHe tried to become the Democratic candidate for President twice, in 1988 and 2008, but did not win. He is a Roman Catholic. Biden has received several awards. He has five honorary doctorates, including one from his alma mater and one from where he has taught law. He has also earned the \"Best of Congress Award\" and an award from the Pakistani government.\n\nJoe Biden was born on November 20, 1942 in Scranton, Pennsylvania to a family of Irish Catholics. His father, Joe Biden Sr., was a businessman. When he was young, his family moved to Wilmington, Delaware. In high school, Biden played football and baseball, but he was not a very good student. Biden attended college at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University. He did not have to fight in the Vietnam War because he was going to college and had asthma as a child. \n\nFor many years, Biden was a U.S. Senator from Delaware. Biden was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972 when he was 29 years old. His election was somewhat of a surprise. The other candidate, J. Caleb Boggs, had more experience and more money to spend on his campaign. He is one of the youngest people to become a U.S. Senator, because he was only two months older than the minimum age, 30, required to be one. \n\nBiden was re-elected to the Senate six times. Later in his time in the Senate, Biden served as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Foreign Relations committee deals with American issues in other countries. When Biden was chair, the committee dealt with the 1991 Gulf War, the 2003 War in Iraq, and several treaties. The Judiciary Committee dealt with the choice of Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, and others for the Supreme Court. Biden thought that Thomas and Bork should not be on the Court. Though Senators work in Washington, DC, Biden took the train home to Delaware every night.\n\nBiden ran for President three times, in 1984, 1988 and 2008. The first time he was viewed as a good choice early on, but quit after another candidate said he gave a speech that was copied from Neil Kinnock, a British politician. \nBiden tried again to get the Democratic Party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election. He ran mostly on foreign issues, especially getting U.S. troops out of Iraq. Many thought of him as a good choice for Secretary of State. He stopped his campaign on January 3, 2008 after he did not get many votes in the Iowa caucus. However, he later became Barack Obama's pick for Vice President due to what he knew about Iraq and because the working class liked him. \n\nWhen Biden was running for President, he criticized Obama, talking about his lack of experience, but later he supported Obama to become president. His opponent as Vice President was Sarah Palin, who had less experience but was seen as more interesting by the media. Before the election, there were debates between the different candidates running for president or vice president. In the debate between Biden and Palin, many people believed that he knew more about running America than Palin did. When Obama was elected President on November 4, 2008, Biden was elected Vice President.\n\nBiden became Vice President on January 20, 2009, and is the first person from Delaware and first Roman Catholic to be Vice President. When Biden became Vice President, he said he would do things differently from Dick Cheney, who had been Vice President before him. Biden has said that his vice-presidency will not be like any other. \n\nBiden's main role is as an advisor to Obama, mostly on issues of foreign policy and the economy. Obama has asked for Biden's input on most of his major decisions, such as who to put in his Cabinet and how to fight the War in Afghanistan. Obama has put him in charge of groups to deal with the problems of the working class, as well as to watch the money in his stimulus bill. Biden has also traveled to the Middle East several times on behalf of Obama and the U.S. while Vice President. In 2011, Biden lead talks on the budget and the debt. On November 6, 2012, Biden was re-elected for a second term as Vice President along with President Barack Obama. \n\nAfter winning the election, Biden served the Vice Presidency until January 20, 2017.\n\nIn August 2015, Biden said that he was looking for a possible chance of running for President again in the 2016 U.S. election. Biden formed a PAC for his possible run. On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and President Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not the enter the race for the Democratic nomination for the presidency for the 2016 election.\n\nWhile in college, he married his first wife, Nelia Hunter. They had three children, two sons (Beau and Robert) and a daughter (Naomi). After college, he became a lawyer and served on a County Council, a group of people who run a county. In 1972, Nelia and Naomi were killed in a car accident, and Beau and Robert were hurt very badly. Both survived the accident. Beau was the Attorney General in Delaware until January 2015 and served as a soldier in Iraq. Beau died from brain cancer on May 30, 2015 in Bethesda, Maryland. He was 46. Biden thought of resigning as Vice President because of his son's death.\n\nBiden married his second wife, Jill Tracy Jacobs Biden, in 1977. She is a teacher and the former Second Lady of the United States. In 1981, they had a daughter, Ashley, who is now a social worker. In 1988, Biden suffered from bleeding in his brain and needed brain surgery twice. Because of what he saw in his family and neighborhood, Biden does not drink alcohol.\n\nBiden has gotten honorary degrees from \nthe University of Scranton (1976),\nSaint Joseph's University (1981),\nWidener University School of Law (2000),\nEmerson College (2003),\nhis alma mater the University of Delaware (2004),\nSuffolk University Law School (2005), and his other alma mater Syracuse University (2009).\n\nBiden got the Chancellor Medal from his alma mater, Syracuse University, in 1980. In 2005, he got the George Arents Pioneer Medal—Syracuse's highest alumni award—\"for excellence in public affairs.\"\n\nIn 2008, Biden got the Best of Congress Award, for \"improving the American quality of life through family-friendly work policies,\" from \"Working Mother\" magazine. \nAlso in 2008, Biden shared with fellow Senator Richard Lugar the Hilal-i-Pakistan award from the Government of Pakistan, \"in recognition of their consistent support for Pakistan.\" In 2009, Biden got The Golden Medal of Freedom award from Kosovo, that region's highest award, for his vocal support for their independence in the late 1990s.\n\nBiden is an inductee of the Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association Hall of Fame.\n\n", "id": "85536", "title": "Joe Biden"}

The word is used in music to mean songs written by French composers of classical music from the mid-19th century to the present. The \"mélodie\" in French music is similar to the \"Lied\" in German music. \"\"Mélodie\"\" is not the same as \"chanson\" (the French word for “song”). The word \"\"chanson\"\" is used for folksongs or popular songs.\n\nIn Germany composers of classical music had been writing great songs from about 1800, but in France the \"mélodie\" became important about 50 years later. While some German \"Lieder\" were based on folksong, the texts of the \"mélodie\"s were usually poems by serious poets. \n\nHector Berlioz was the first composer to call some of his compositions \"mélodie\"s. His \"Les Nuits d'Été\" (1841) is one of the greatest of all song cycles. Charles Gounod wrote about 200 \"mélodie\"s. He used texts by famous poets such as Hugo.\n\nGabriel Fauré wrote more than 100 \"mélodie\"s, many based on poems by Verlaine.\n\nHenri Duparc wrote seventeen \"mélodie\"s. These are what he is known for.\n\nClaude Debussy and Maurice Ravel were very famous composers who wrote a lot of music, including \"mélodie\"s that are often sung today. Ravel’s melodies are unusual because they are often based on folksong. Other composers of \"mélodie\" at the time include Albert Roussel, Reynaldo Hahn and André Caplet.\n\n\"Mélodie\"s continue to be composed today, though perhaps the last really popular composer of them was Francis Poulenc, who died in 1963.\n\nIn the French \"mélodie\" the poet’s feelings are often suggested or hinted at rather than stated in an obvious way. There is a very close relationship between the text (words) and the melody. To sing \"mélodie\" really well a singer must know the French language very well and understand a lot about French poetry. The rules about singing in the French language can be quite complicated. It is important to know when to let the last sound of a word run into the next word (elision). Several books have been written about this.\n\nAlthough many famous singers are well known for singing French \"mélodie\", the most famous singer from the past was Pierre Bernac. He gave many song recitals with the composer Francis Poulenc who accompanied him on the piano. He wrote a book on how to sing \"mélodie\"s.\n", "id": "85575", "title": "Mélodie"}

When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he is moved up to the team's partner, the Oakland Athletics, which is a Major League Baseball team. \n\nThe Sounds played from 1978 to 2014 at Herschel Greer Stadium (the name of the stadium where they played baseball). In 2015, the Sounds began to play at a new stadium called First Tennessee Park. They have won the championship in their league three (3) times: 1979, 1982, and 2005.\n\nThe team is named \"Sounds\" because Nashville, the city where the team plays, is famous for making Country music.\n\nThe Sounds' first ballpark was Herschel Greer Stadium. They played baseball games their from 1978 to 2014. There were many changes to the ballpark since it was completed in 1978. It has seats for 10,300 spectators. Its best known feature is its giant 115.6 foot (35.2 m) scoreboard which is behind the left field wall. It has the shape of a guitar. After the construction of new and quite luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer had fallen below standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. Therefore, there were several renovations and upgrades to meet the Triple-A standards.\n\nIn 2014, the Sounds and the Nashville Metro Government agreed on a plan to build a new baseball stadium for the team. The Sounds began playing baseball at the new stadium, called First Tennessee Park, in 2015. It has space for 10,000 spectators.

The city is on the river Serchio in a very fertile plain near the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Lucca.\n\nLucca was founded by the Etruscans. It later became a Roman village in 180 BC. The Romans built an amphitheatre that is still seen in the Piazza dell'Anfiteatro. Lucca was an important city and fortress even in the 6th century, when Narses attacked it over and over again for several months in 553. During the 10th and 11th centuries, Lucca was the capital of the feudal territories of Tuscany, with more power about the Roman Emperor.\n\nAfter the death of Matilda of Tuscany, the city began an independent commune. For almost 500 years, Lucca remained an independent republic. There were many minor communes in the region between southern Liguria and northern Tuscany (which was filled by the Malaspina). Tuscany in this time was part of feudal Europe. Dante’s \"Divine Comedy\" was written to remember the days spent in his exile in Lucca. \n\nIn 1273 and again in 1277, Lucca was ruled by a Guelph (captain of the people) named Luchetto Gattilusio. In 1314, after internal problems Uguccione della Faggiuola of Pisa make himself lord of Lucca. The people of the city made him leave two years later and \"condottiere\" gain the leadership. In 1325, in the battle of Altopascio, Lucca soldiers defeated Florence's Guelphs with the help of Castracani, a leader of the city in time of war. After they won, Castracani was named \"Duke of Lucca\" by Louis IV the Bavarian. Until the French Revolution in 1789, Lucca was independent from Venice and Genoa. It was a city controlled by democracy or sometimes by oligarchy.\n\nLucca was the second largest Italian city-state (after Venice) with a republican constitution (\"comune\"). In 1805 Lucca was taken over by Napoleon, who put his sister Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi in the place reserved for the \"Queen of Etruria\". The city became a part of Tuscany in 1847 and later a part of Italy. \n\nThe walls around the old town are intact as the city grew and became more modern. This is unusual for cities in the region. A famous place is the house where Puccini was born. The house is open to the public.\n\nThere are many churches in Lucca:\n\nOther sights include:\n\nEvery year in Lucca there are two important festivals.

In non-technical usage, a 'cypher' is the same thing as a 'code'; but in cryptography, cyphers are distinguished from codes.\n\nOne 20th century source gives this explanation: a cipher is \"a method in which the basic unit of concealment is the letter.

The Hebrew name of the book is , which means 'people of the Word.'\n\nThe book begins with the words Moses spoke to the Israelites in the wilderness east of the Jordan. He told them that they had been very rebellious towards God, so God made them travel from place to place before reaching the land he promised them. This was the fortieth year they travelled.\n\nMoses told the Israelites what had happened throughout their journey. He scolded them for disobeying God, who made them go through a very hard journey. Moses then gave them the Law, teaching them what must be done, and what cannot be done. These laws were given to him by God. (See Ten Commandments.) The Law warns against worshipping other gods, and tells that all Israel, every one, must obey God alone. He warned them against worshipping idols, and commanded them to treat the poor, foreigners, and orphans well. If the Israelites obey God, they will prosper (be successful). But God predicted that the future generations will suffer because of their disobedience. One day, however the Israelites would return to God.\n\nGod then commanded Moses to write the Law on stone tablets for the Israelites to remember. Then Moses formally made Joshua, son of Nun, the new leader over the Israelites. God gave Moses a song to sing, and asked him to teach it to the Israelites. The song would remind them in the future about how they had gone against God.\n\nMoses was very old - 120 years - during that time. He knew he was going to die because God had told him it would happen. Therefore, before he died, he gave a blessing to all the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\nFinally God made Moses climb Mount Nebo and showed him all the land he was giving to Israel. Because Moses and his brother Aaron disobeyed God earlier on, Moses was not allowed to enter the land, only to see it. Moses died on Mount Nebo, and the Israelites mourned for him for thirty days. After that Joshua began to lead Israel under God's command.\n\n\n\n", "id": "85877", "title": "Deuteronomy"}

SCSI stands for Small Computer System Interface, although the \"small\" is historic; SCSI is used on both large and small computers. SCSI is usually pronounced as \"scuzzy\". \n\nFew peripherals (other than hard drives and tape drives) were made after the 20th century. Later ones used USB or in some cases Firewire.\n\nSCSI is realized by a bus slot on the motherboard. Just to put a card called host adapter to the motherboard. From this card is a managed data cable. This cable connects individual SCSI peripherals. Each of this peripherals has its own sequencer which is functional independent. Operation on data cable (bus SCSI) is controlled by the host adapter. This makes it possible to install internal or external components. Transferring data on the SCSI bus is managed by the host adapter. The CPU is not loaded by transferring data.\n\nEach peripheral has its own sequencer and host adapter. They can be used for communication with devices by a defined \"computer\" language. They could also cooperate with arbitrary peripherals of SCSI. At present there are hard disks, optical drives, tape adapter units, ZIP drives, scanners and printers using SCSI. \n\nSCSI is not restricted by conditions (for example: by data capacity). One of the main advantages of SCSI is a possibility to daisy-chain devices. There is some device on the bus SCSI which controls this. \n\nFor example, hard disk defines “head's of operations” etc. At the same moment the other device could send data to other devices, (scanner). Operations of other device are not cancelled with origin connection. After transferring data to scanner device could continues with transferring data to hard disk. SCSI is faster because of this fact even maximal speed of transferring is not so different to EIDE.\n\nEach peripheral of SCSI has to be identified. That is the reason why every peripheral must have a unique ID. This number is set by bond or shunt located on the case of components. In terms of a bus is enumerate from 0, hostname has as a rule ID 7. There cannot be two devices on the same bus with the same ID.\n\nBuses have to be finished with resistances, in terminology called terminators. On the last devices is necessary to install terminators.\n\nHost adapter has to be in connection with to assign system resources (addresses I/O, IRQ, DMA, reserved memory).\n\nSCSI has a long progression. That is why there are many kind of SCSI in the present day. They are different in data width (8 or 16 bits) and working frequency (from 5 MHz to 80 MHz). With 8-bit data width, the parallel SCSI bus can be connected to 8 devices (used a 50 pin connector); with 16 bits, the SCSI bus can be connected to 16 devices.\n\nIn addition to the parallel SCSI interface, there are also other interfaces that use the SCSI protocol but use different cables.\n\n", "id": "85919", "title": "SCSI"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86011", "text": "Philosophy of science\n\nPhilosophy of science is the part of philosophy that studies the sciences. \n\nPhilosophers who are interested in science study how knowledge is built up by scientists, and what makes science different from other activities. No doubt, modern science has advanced knowledge in a wide range of fields. How has it done this? To tackle this issue, a number of other issues have to be tackled also. \n\nIn earlier times, some have thought science was nothing but organised common sense. Thomas Henry Huxley thought this. However, as the twentieth century went on, science produced many ideas which were nothing like common sense. Then it was clear that science really was something different from commonsense knowledge. But what was it? This is called the demarcation problem.\n\nThe demarcation problem refers to the distinction between science and non-science (including pseudoscience). Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science. No account of the problem has got full agreement among philosophers; some regard the problem as insoluble or uninteresting.\n\nThe logical positivists tried to base science on observation. In their view, truth was achieved by verification. Non-science was non-observational and meaningless. \n\nAgainst that, Popper argued that the central property of science is falsifiability. All scientific claims can be proved false, at least in principle. If no such proof can be found despite sufficient effort, then the claim is likely true. Popper's ideas were applauded by many scientists (like Peter Medawar). However, sceptics noticed that theories were often not discarded when a prediction was refuted. The theory was simply adjusted to take into account the new findings. It was clear from this that, although falsifiability was important, it could not be a simple way to distinguish science from non-science. \n\nOther approaches were tried. One idea that science was a problem-solving process aimed at finding answers to questions. Of course, many other fields try to answer questions and solve problems. Another approach was to define science as the search for objective truth. But objectivity is very difficult to define, and whether science really is objective is open to question.\n\nWith biology, the situation was rather different. There were many thousands of published observations, and what was achieved by Darwin was to show that sense could be made of the observations if it were the case that evolution had taken place. In a natural history science (such as biology, geology or astronomy), one of the main jobs of science is to explain what has happened and what is seen. Obviously, explanations as well as observations and theories are part of the philosophy of science.\n\nBoth theory and observations are part of science, and they are tied together in a kind of cycle. A very clear example was the prediction of Einstein that a source of gravity (such as a star) would bend light passing nearby. An expedition was organised in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse. The observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed slightly from their normal expected positions. In effect, the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation. This confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity, published in 1915. This was the first solid evidence in favour of Einstein's theory. \n\nThe point here is that the observation and the theory were connected. The observation would not have been made but for the theory, and then the observation was convincing evidence in favour of the theory. The theory had passed a critical test. Since then, many more tests have been made of Einstein's ideas, and all have been consistent with his theory.\n\nAccording to common sense, science begins with observations: all scientific knowledge come from the facts of experience. Theories are produced by observation of these facts and are then tested by prediction.\n\nHere is a schema of this idea of science that some philosophers call a \"naive\" conception of science:\n\nThis naive conception is not held by many philosophers today. For one thing, it sees science as a one-way engine from 'facts' (what are they?) to theories and predictions. As shown by the Einstein example, where a theory led the other way round, the model does not fit much of science. In fact the relationship between the parts of a scientific philosophy are extremely complex.\n\nAccording to Pierre Duhem and W.V. Quine, it is impossible to test a theory in isolation. For example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in our solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets. Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century did not lead to the rejection of Newton's Law. Instead, it lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that there are only seven planets in our solar system. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, Neptune. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring out what that something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, etc.\n\nOne consequence of the Duhem-Quine thesis is that any theory can be made compatible with any empirical observation by the addition of extra (ad hoc) hypotheses. This is why science uses Occam's Razor; hypotheses without justification are eliminated. This led Karl Popper, to reject naïve falsification in favor of 'survival of the fittest', or most falsifiable, of scientific theories. In Popper's view, any hypothesis that does not make testable predictions is simply not science. Such a hypothesis may be useful or valuable, but it cannot be said to be science. W.V. Quine thought that empirical data are not enough to make a judgment between theories. In this view, a theory can always be made to fit with the available empirical data. However, this does not necessarily imply that all theories are of equal value, because scientists often use guiding principles such as Occam's Razor.\n\nOne result of this view is that specialists in the philosophy of science stress the requirement that observations made for the purposes of science be restricted to \"intersubjective\" objects. That is, science is restricted to those areas where there is general agreement on the nature of the observations involved. It is comparatively easy to agree on observations of physical phenomena, harder to agree on observations of social or mental phenomena, and difficult in the extreme to reach agreement on matters of theology or ethics (and thus the latter remain outside the normal purview of science).\n\nIs there any scientific method at all? Paul Feyerabend argued that no description of scientific method could possibly encompass all the approaches and methods used by scientists. Feyerabend objected to prescriptive scientific method on the grounds that any such method would stifle and cramp scientific progress. Feyerabend claimed, \"the only principle that does not inhibit progress is: \"anything goes\"\". \n\nThomas Kuhn denied that it is ever possible to isolate the hypothesis being tested from the influence of the theory in which the observations are grounded. He argued that observations always rely on a specific paradigm, and that it is not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. By \"paradigm\" he meant a consistent \"portrait\" of the world, one that involves no logical contradictions and that is consistent with observations made from the point of view of the paradigm. More than one such logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common ground from which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Neither is a standard by which the other can be judged. Instead, the question is which \"portrait\" is judged by some set of people to promise the most useful in terms of scientific \"puzzle solving\".\n\nFor Kuhn, the choice of paradigm was sustained by, but not ultimately determined by, logical processes. The individual's choice between paradigms involves setting two or more \"portraits\" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. In the case of a general acceptance of one paradigm or another, Kuhn believed that it represented the consensus of the community of scientists. Acceptance or rejection of some paradigm is, he argued, a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a number of observational anomalies (problems) in the old paradigm have made the new paradigm more useful. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. A new paradigm is chosen because it does a better job of solving scientific problems than the old one.\n\nThe fact that observation is embedded in theory does not mean observations are irrelevant to science. Scientific understanding derives from observation, but the acceptance of scientific statements is dependent on the related theoretical paradigm as well as on observation. Of course, further testing may resolve differences of opinion.\n\n\n", "id": "86011", "title": "Philosophy of science"}

Volterra was once one of the 12 cities in Etruria. In the middle ages it was an independent city until it was conquered by the Florentines and then the Medicis. It has its own cathedral, and is built on top of an ancient volcanic hill. \n\nThe city was a Neolithic settlement and an important Etruscan center. It became a \"municipium\" (a type of Roman city) in the Roman Age. Volterra was attacked and controlled by Florence many times. When the Florentian Republic fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family. It later became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nThe original Etruscan city walls remain in parts, and the remains of the Roman baths, aqueduct and amphitheatre (arena). Visitors to Volterra have to leave their cars outside the town walls, in car parks. \n\n\nThe Medici Villa di Spedaletto is located outside the city in direction of Lajatico.

That is why it is called “volatile”. If something is volatile, it runs away quickly.\n\nRefreshing DRAM means \"reading\" the data \"from\" the DRAM and directly \"writing\" them \"back\" to the DRAM.\nDRAM is made up of millions of very small capacitors. Each of these capacitors has a transistor to let energy in and out. The capacitor slowly loses energy, and if the DRAM is not refreshed, in the end one or more of the capacitors will let so much energy out, that for example a 1 will become a 0, so data will be lost or corrupted. Almost all computers refresh their DRAM many times per second. \n\nDRAM is often compared to SRAM (Static RAM). SRAM is able to store data as long as power/energy is used. There is no need to refresh it. SRAM can also be faster than DRAM. But SRAM is much more expensive than DRAM. Also, SRAM uses more electric power and heats up much faster than DRAM.\nDRAM and SRAM lose the data when the power to them is turned off, unlike non-volatile random-access memory. \n", "id": "86033", "title": "Dynamic random-access memory"}

They are now used in police stations, security industries and most recently, on computers.\n\nEveryone has marks on their fingers. They can not be removed or changed. These marks have a pattern and this pattern is called the fingerprint. Every fingerprint is special, and different from any other in the world. Because there are countless combinations, fingerprints have become an ideal means of identification.\n\nThere are four types of fingerprint scanners: the optical scanner, the capacitance scanner, the 'ultrasonic scanner' and the thermal scanners. The basic function of these three types of scanners is to get an image of a person’s fingerprint and find a match for this print in the database.\nThe capacitance scanner is better, because the images are more exact and precise. Scanners are used for scanning.\n\nThere are two construction forms: the stagnant and the moving fingerprint scanner.\n\nStagnant: The finger must be dragged over the small scanning area. This form is not as good as the moving form, but it’s cheaper. The image is not very good, because maybe the finger is not regularly dragged over the scanning area.\n\nMoving: The finger lays on the scanning area, while the scanner runs underneath.

It was found by Johann Palisa on February 25, 1892 in Vienna, making it one of the last big (diameter over 200 km) asteroids found. Apart from the near-earth asteroid Eros, it was the last asteroid which is \"ever\" easily visible with binoculars to be found.\n\nAlthough its very high orbital eccentricity means its opposition magnitude varies a lot, at a rare opposition near perihelion Bamberga can reach a magnitude of +8.0, which is as bright as Saturn's moon Titan. Such near-perihelion oppositions happen on a regular cycle every twenty-two years, with the last happening in 1991 and the next in 2013. Its brightness at these rare near-perihelion oppositions makes Bamberga the \"brightest C-type asteroid\", about one magnitude brighter than 10 Hygiea's maximum brightness of around +9.1. At such an opposition Bamberga can in fact be closer to Earth than any main belt asteroid with magnitude above +9.5, getting as close as 0.78 AU. For comparison, 7 Iris never comes closer than 0.85 AU and 4 Vesta never closer than 1.13 AU when it becomes visible to the naked eye in a pollution-free sky.\n\nOverall Bamberga is the tenth brightest main belt asteroid after, in order, Vesta, Pallas, Ceres, Iris, Hebe, Juno, Melpomene, Eunomia and Flora. Its high eccentricity (for comparison 36% higher than that of Pluto), though, means that at most oppositions other asteroids reach higher magnitudes.\n\nIt has an unusually long rotation period among the big asteroids. Its spectral class is between the C-type and P-type asteroids.\n\nAn occultation of Bamberga was seen on 8 December, 1987, and gave a diameter of about 228 km, in agreement with IRAS results.\n", "id": "86049", "title": "324 Bamberga"}

He was one of the most important composers of madrigals in the Renaissance period.\n\nWe know very little about his childhood. Even some of the things about his adult life we are not sure about. He was born in Flanders, possibly in Ghent. When he was a boy he was taken to Italy and he stayed there for the rest of his life.\n\nAs a boy he was a singer in the household of Maria di Cardona, Marchesa of Padulla, near Naples. As a young man he lived in Novellara. He married there, and he had at least six children.\n\nLater he went to live in Milan where he had the job of maestro di capella (music director). He stayed there until 1565. Some letters he wrote during that time have survived. They describe life at the court where he worked.\n\nIn 1565 he went to work for the Gonzaga in Mantua and became choir master at the ducal chapel of S. Barbara where he stayed until 1592. A lot of people were jealous of his good job, especially a man called Bonvicino who made life difficult for him. It was then found that Bonvicino was having a love affair with de Wert’s wife, so she had to go back to live in Novellara.\n\nDe Wert was becoming a very well known composer. He was offered a job at the emperor’s palace in Prague, but he did not take it. He travelled to work in various places such as Parma and Novellara. In Novellara his wife was found to have been plotting against the Gonzaga of Novellara. She was put in prison where she later died. There were long arguments in the law court about who should have her property. In the end, de Wert was given a third of her possessions, and he was given the right to let his children inherit the money.\n\nHe worked in Ferrara where he had a love affair with a lady who was of aristocratic birth. Since he was only a musician he was only a servant, so the lady was sent away from the court.\n\nIn his later years he worked for the court at Mantua where the music had become very good because the new ruler, Vincenzo Gonzaga, was very interested in music. De Wert composed music for the theatre. His health became poor. He suffered from malaria during the early 1580s. He died in Mantua and was buried in the crypt at S Barbara.\n\nDe Wert wrote over 230 madrigals and other secular works. These were later published in 16 volumes. He also wrote over 150 sacred pieces (motets, hymns etc.) which showed how well he could write counterpoint. \n\nHis madrigals were very modern for their time. The music was very daring in the way it described the words. He sometimes used small groups of singers to contrast with one another like a musical conversation. He was a great influence on later madrigal composers such as Monteverdi and Gesualdo. \n\n", "id": "86074", "title": "Giaches de Wert"}

It has been published every week since March 1952. It was the first British magazine to include a singles chart.\n\nThe magazine's first issue was published on 7 March 1952. It was first published in a non-glossy tabloid format on standard newsprint.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the magazine championed the new British groups emerging at the time. The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were frequently on the front cover a lot. These and other artists would also appeared at the NME Poll Winners Concert, an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the NME's readers. The concert also featured an awards ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards.\n\nThe later part of the 1960s, the magazine began to report about psychedelia as well as the continuation of articles about British groups of the time.\n\nIn early 1972, with the magazine on the verge of closure by its owners, But a new person became editor and the paper's coverage changed radically from an uncritical to something intended to be smarter, hipper, more cynical and funnier than any mainstream British music paper had previously been (an approach influenced mainly by writers).\n\nIn mid-1973, the paper was selling nearly 300,000 copies per week and was outselling its other weekly rivals, \"Disc\", \"Record Mirror\" and \"Sounds\".\n\nThe year 1976 saw Punk Rock arrive on the music scene and \"NME\", like other \"specialist\" publications, was slow in reporting and covering this new music phenomenon. In an attempt to boost sales, the paper advertised for a pair of \"\"hip young gunslingers\"\" to join their editorial staff. This resulted in the recruitment of two journalists who made sure the magazine was completely up to date on this new music style. Bands who a few months previously had been criticising the \"NME\" were now eager to be included.\n\nThe magazine also became more openly political during the time of Punk. Its cover would sometimes feature youth-oriented issues rather than a musical act.\n\nSales were dropping, and by 1985 \"NME\" had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing again. During this period, the editors at the magazine were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop, a genre that was relatively new to the UK, and those who wanted to stick to rock music. Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers.\n\nThe late eighties and early nineties had a generally weak rock scene in the UK and the paper was forced into giving a high profile to long forgotten bands like Kingmaker and the Railway Children.\n\nBy the end of 1990, although the magazine still supported new British bands, the paper was dominated by American bands, because that was what the music scene in general was about.\n\nAlthough the period from 1991 to 1993 was dominated by American bands like Nirvana, this did not mean that British bands were being ignored. The \"NME\" still covered the Indie scene a lot.\n\nBy 1992, some new British bands were beginning to appear. \"Suede\" were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy Grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new British music scene. Indie however was still the dominant force, but the rise of new British bands would become something the paper would focus more and more upon.\n\nIn April 1994 Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found dead, a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the \"NME\", but would see a massive change in British music. Grunge was about to be replaced by Britpop , a new form of music influenced by British music of the 1960s and British culture. The phrase was coined by \"NME\" after the band Blur released their album \"Parklife\" in the same month of Cobain's death. Britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after Cobain's death, and Blur's success, along with the rise of a new group from Manchester called Oasis saw Britpop gather popularity for the rest of 1994. By the end of the year Blur and Oasis were the two biggest bands in the UK and sales of the \"NME\" were increasing thanks to the Britpop effect.\n1995 saw the \"NME\" cover many of these new bands and saw many of these bands play the \"NME Stage\" at that years Glastonbury Festival where the magazine had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since 1993.\n\nThe new millennium saw the \"NME\" focus on new British bands such as Franz Ferdinand and the Kaiser Chiefs who emerged as \"indie music\" continued to grow in commercial success. This commercial success has led to bands such as the Arctic Monkeys being both successful in the extreme and being championed by the NME; a phenomenon not seen since Britpop.\n\nIn December 2005 accusations were made that the \"NME\" end of year poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons. These criticisms were rebutted by McNicholas, who claimed that webzine Londonist.com had got hold of an early draft of the poll.\n\nIn 2006 NME won the CocaCola best magazine this century award.\n\nIts first editor was Brendan Fitzgerald. Later Anthony Thornton redesigned the site, focusing on music news. The website was awarded Online Magazine Of The Year in 1999 and 2001 and Anthony Thornton was announced as Website Editor Of The Year on three occasions.\n\nIt was awarded 'Best Music Website' at the Record Of The Day awards in October 2005. In 2006 NME.COM celebrated with a party at London's KOKO featuring Leicester band Kasabian and was subsequently awarded the BT Digital Music Award for Best Music Magazine and the first 'Chairman's Award' from the Association of Online Publishers awarded by the Chairman, Simon Waldman.\n\nIn 2007 NME.COM was launched in the USA with additional staff and plans to launch its Breaking Bands contest and the NME Awards across the Atlantic.\n\nThe site now provides news, reviews, gig listings, and videos as well as featuring downloads, merchandising and message boards.\n\nThe website over the last year has shifted it focus to also include tabloid gossip alongside its traditional music news. With regular news articles entitled \"Daily Ligger\" and \"Tabloid Hell.\"\n\nIn 2007 NME.com had a free download from the Verve, and it was the first songs the Verve released since they got back together.\n", "id": "86230", "title": "New Musical Express"}

Its capital city has the same name, Pedernales.\n\nIt was created on 16 December 1957. It was a municipality of the Barahona province before being elevated to the category of province.\n\nThe province was named after the Pedernales river; this river forms the southern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And the river is named Pedernales because the mineral flint () is common in the region.\n\nSome native groups lived close to the coast and the River Pedernales before the conquest of the island by European people. But very few people has lived in the region, for most of its history, because it is a very dry region.\n\nIn his second travel to America, Christopher Columbus discovered and named part of the present island, including the Beata and Alto Velo islands, that are part of the province.\n\nUntil the 20th century, the only people living here were Haitians and many places have French names. Sometimes, during the Dominican-Haitian War (1844-1856), Haitian soldiers came across this region because there were not Dominican soldiers. The only fight between soldiers of the two countries in the territory of the present province was close to the \"El Can\" bay, near the town of Juancho, on 6 January 1856.\n\nSince colonial times, the territory was part of the Azua province until it was changed to the Barahona when Barahona became a province in 1881. The province of Pedernales was created in 1957 with the municipalities of Pedernales, its capital, and Oviedo.\n\nJuancho became a municipal district in 1998 and José Francisco Peña Gómez Oviedo in 2005.\n\nThe Pedernales province is in the southwest of the country. It is bordered to the north by the province of Independencia, to the northeast by Barahona, to the east, south and west by the Caribbean Sea. To the west Pedernales borders the Republic of Haiti.\n\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Pedernales province, and 20,345 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km².\n\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 32nd (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province, the province with fewest people living in it and with the lowest population density.\n\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 33,755 inhabitants.\n\nThe largest city of the province is Pedernales, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in ) of 13,077 inhabitants.\n\nThe Pedernales province has a total area of . It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 7th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.\n\nThe province is in the Barahona Peninsula. The \"Sierra de Bahoruco\" (\"Bahoruco mountain range\") is in the northern half of the province; its highest mountain, and the highest mountain of the province, is \"Loma del Toro\", above sea level, in the limits with the Independencia province.\n\nThe rest of the province is formed by savannas and plains of limestone rocks. The savannas are close to the coast, as the Sansón Savanna in Oviedo and the Pedernales Savanna around the city of Pedernales.\n\nSeveral small islands belong to the province. The main islands are Beata and Alto Velo.\n\nThe altitude of Pedernales, provincial capital, is above sea level.\n\nThe only important river is the Pedernales river, with its tributary Mulito. The Pedernales river marks the Dominican-Haitian border.\n\nThere are several lagoons (a lagoon is a small lake close to the sea) with brackish water. The most important is the \"Laguna de Oviedo\", on the eastern coast and near the town of Oviedo, with an area of . On the western coast, the most important lagoon is \"Laguna Salada\", with an area of .\n\nThe climate of the province is tropical, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains. It is very dry in the savannas and plains, with long droughts, but rains are common in the high mountains.\n\nThere are two municipalities and two municipal districts (M.D.) in the province.\n\nAs in all border provinces in the Dominican Republic, there is little economic development. The trade with Haiti is important, above all in the capital city. On the mountains, coffee and beans are important products. Potato, cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco.\n\nFishing is also an important activity in the province, mainly close to the Beata Island, where lobster, conch and several kind of fishes are caught.\n\nBecause of the beautiful beaches of the western coast of the province, like \"Bahía de las Águilas\" (\"Eagles Bay\"), tourism is becoming an important economic activity. There are two of the largest national parks of the country: the \"Jaragua National Park\" and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco National Park\".\n\nThe development of the province was produced by the mining of bauxite (an aluminium ore) but, since 1984, it has changed to the mining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory.\n", "id": "86235", "title": "Pedernales Province"}

The net went all the way across the harbour from Green Point, Watson's Bay to Georges Head on the other side. The boom was part of the Sydney Harbour defences which also included artillery batteries and patrol boats.\n\nIn January 1942, the Australian defence forces began to build the anti-submarine boom net; it was finished in August 1942. For more than three years, entry by boats, ships and ferries into Sydney Harbour was through one of three different gates that were a part of the anti-submarine boom net.\n\nOn 31 May 1942, during WWII, three Japanese submarines tried to get into the harbour. The first submarine to try and come in was the M27. Lieutenant Jahai Chuma was the man in charge of this submarine. The M27 followed a Sydney ferry through the gate on its way to Manly, but it got caught in the western end of the net's middle section. Lieutenant Chuma, tried to free his submarine by using a special tool that cuts metal, but this only made things worse. By 8:30pm the watchman for the Maritime Service Board, James Cargill, went to see what was happening. He used a boat to row across to where the submarine was stuck. Very surprised at finding a Japanese submarine, Cargill called naval headquarters with his two way radio. At first the navy did not believe that there was a Japanese Midget submarine caught in the boom net. It took him two hours to get them to believe him.\n\nBy 10:27pm, Chuma knew that he had been discovered, so he blew up the submarine using bombs, killing himself and his crew. The two other submarines got through the boom net, which at the time was not quite finished. They attacked shipping for many hours before they were destroyed as well.\n\nIn August 1945, the boom net was taken away. By early 1946, only the dolphin structure was left. The base of the winch house is the only remaining part of the anti-submarine boom net.

There are three types of hair iron: \n\nIn 1872, Marcel Grateau (a Parisian) used heated rods to straighten or style hair.\n\nSimon E. Monroe patented a hair straightener in 1906 that was like a metal comb.\n\nIn 1909, Issac K. Shero patented a hair straightener made of two irons that are heated and put together around the hair.\n\nYears later, Sharrell made heated metal tools, for example: hot combs. The hot metal straightener went easily through the hair, making less damage and dryness than the way things were done before. Later, ceramic and electrical straighteners were made, meaning people could adjust the heat settings and straightener size.\n\nAnother method of hair straightening is Japanese hair straightening, which was invented in Japan, and works like a perm, but to straighten instead of curl the hair. It is now given at many salons but is quite expensive and must be re-done after it stops working.\n\nSome better hair straighteners today have ceramic coated heating parts, which harm the hair less, and heat up faster than non-ceramic coated heating parts. Cheaper brands do not often have ceramic, but some have a paint-like coating that looks like ceramic plating. Cordless flat irons use lithium battery that can last up to 45 minnutes, and other is heated by thermacell butane gas cartridge.\n\nLots of more expensive hair straighteners use ionic and infra red technology, which helps to keep moisture and oils in the hair, and to stop static and frizz.\n\nDepending on the hair type, repeated use of hair straighteners, like most other heat styling tools, can cause varying amounts of damage such as split ends, thinning of the hair shaft and even causing hair to become brittle and prone to breakage. Generally, after extensive damage, hair will show signs of dryness and display an unhealthy appearance. However, many companies, such as L’Oréal and Tresemmé, have began to manufacture heat protection sprays and cream which aim to reduce the amount of damage that is caused by the use of straighteners.\n\nHair straighteners should only be used on dry hair, unless they are specially made with vents to let the moisture out. These sort of irons are usually called \"Wet Dry\" irons.\n\nBased on the materials used in the heating plates, hair irons can be classified as ceramic, tourmaline and traditional metal flat iron. Ceramic hair irons are believed to be gentle to the hair.\n\nHair straighteners work by breaking the hair's hydrogen bonds, which are what make the hair curly. After the bonds are broken, the hair is stopped from going back to its original, natural, curly form. The hydrogen bonds can re-form if moisture touches them, such as water or dampness.\n\n\n", "id": "86329", "title": "Hair iron"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86372", "text": "Maltese people\n\nThe Maltese people, or Maltese, are a nation and ethnic group native to Malta, an island country made of a group of seven islands in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nPeople have lived in Malta since around 5200 BC with the first people living there coming from Sicily. An important prehistoric Neolithic culture marked by Megalithic structures was on the islands, which were made a thousand years before the Pyramids of Giza, which means they were very old. The Phoenicians in the Mediterranean took over Malta from about 1000 BC, using the islands to expand their sea explorations and trade in the Mediterranean, until the Carthaginians took over and also expanded in the Mediterranean, but these were also defeated by the Romans in 216 BC.\n\nMalta was then ruled by Byzantine, a Greek group that took over almost all of the Mediterranean, from the 4th to 9th century. Sometime around this point, the Vandals, a German tribe, ruled the islands. The islands were at one point invaded by the Arabs in AD 870. They allowed the people to believe in Christianity, and did not have children with the population, so they did not change much on the island, but they showed them citrus fruits and cotton, and water-moving systems. They hardly had any effect on the island or its people while they were there, but one thing that they did effect was the language. The Maltese language gained a lot from this.\n\nFrom the advent of the Normans in 1090 to 1530, Malta was part of the 'Kingdom of Sicily'. This means that from 1091 to 1530, when the Order of St. John came to Malta, the original Sicilian population that moved there from Sicily in the beginning got bigger.\n\nThe French under the rule of Napoleon took over Malta in 1798. The British helped the Maltese to stop the French control two years later. The people of Malta were very happy that the British did this, and wanted Britain to rule it. As part of the 'Treaty of Paris' (1814), Malta became a colony in the British Empire.\n\nMalta became a separate country from everyone on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day). Under the 1964 rules, Malta originally kept Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Malta, with a Governor-General working on her behalf in Malta. On 13 December 1974 (Republic Day), it became a republic within the Commonwealth, with the President as head of state. Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 and joined the Eurozone on 1 January 2008.\n\nMalta\n\nHistorians and Geneticists currently do not know where the Maltese people came from. The answer is difficult to find because of several things, such as Malta's invasions, with long parts in time where the population got smaller, before other people from the Mediterranean moved to Malta and married the Maltese. One unusual example of this is the exile to Malta of all of the male population from the town of Celano (Italy) in 1223, the stationing of a Norman and Sicilian garrison on Malta in 1240, the expulsion from Malta of Arabs (presumably, those who refused to convert to Christianity) commencing in 1245, the arrival of several hundred Catalan soldiers in 1283, the European repopulation of Malta that began in the 13th century,\nthe settlement in Malta of noble families from Sicily and Aragon between 1372 and 1450, the arrival of several thousand Greek and Rhodian sailors, soldiers and slaves with the Knights of St. John, the introduction of several thousand Sicilian labourers in 1551 and again in 1566, the emigration to Malta of some 891 Italian exiles during the Risorgimento in 1849, and the posting of some 22,000 British servicemen in Malta from 1807 to 1979.\n\nHistorical and ethnic studies published and promoted by the various ruling classes during their governance over Malta provide little, if any, valuable guidance on the question of Maltese ethnicity, given that their conclusions appear to have been driven, in large part, by political expediency. Hence, Maltese history books published during the rule of the Knights of St. John, at a time when Malta and Gozo suffered repeated \"razzias\" at the hands of the Ottomans and Barbary corsairs, promoted the myth of a continuous, Roman Catholic, native Maltese population, that somehow survived despite the Arab conquest of Malta and the depopulation that followed. Studies and reports published during the British colonial period promoted the theory of Phoenician origins, in an attempt to distinguish the Maltese from their Sicilian and Italian neighbours, or in the case of the Catholic Church, to distinguish the Maltese from the Arab peoples that controlled Malta prior to the liberation of Malta by the Normans. By contrast, history books published during the Mintoff years following Independence began to question the earlier beliefs in a continuous, indigenous population of Christian Maltese and, in some cases, quietly promoted the theory of closer cultural and ethnic ties with North Africa. This new development was noted by Boissevain in 1991:\n\"...the Labour government broke off relations with NATO and sought links with the Arab world. After 900 years of being linked to Europe, Malta began to look southward. Muslims, still remembered in folklore for savage pirate attacks, were redefined as blood brothers.\"\nThis latter development coincided with and reflected dramatic new (but short-lived) developments in Maltese foreign policy: Western media reported that Malta appeared to be turning its back on NATO, the United Kingdom, and Europe generally; Libya had loaned several million dollars to Malta to make up for the loss of rental income which followed the closure of British military bases in Malta; Malta and Libya had entered into a \"Friendship and Cooperation Treaty\", in response to repeated overtures by Gaddafi for a closer, more formal union between the two countries; and, for a brief period, Arabic had become a compulsory subject in Maltese secondary schools.\n\nSome recent studies carried out by geneticists Spencer Wells and Pierre Zalloua of the American University of Beirut collected samples of Y-chromosomes from men living in the Middle East, North Africa, southern Spain, and Malta, places the Phoenicians are known to have settled and traded. According to the study, more than half (50 %) of the Y chromosome lineages that are seen in today's Maltese population could have come in with the Phoenicians. As to why there is such a significant genetic impact, Wells could only speculate, \"\"but the results are consistent with a settlement of people from the Levant within the past 2,000 years, and that points to the Phoenicians.\"\" \n\nThe Phoenician background of the Maltese suggests possible tenuous cultural, religious, and linguistic links to Lebanese Maronites, (whom are also descended from Phoenicians revealed during National Geographic's Special), who speak a variety of Arabic, and are Christian. .\n\nThis \"Phoenician origins\" theory has been contradicted by at least one major study, which found that \"\"the contemporary males of Malta most likely originated from Southern Italy, including Sicily and up to Calabria,\"\" and that \"\"[t]here is a minuscule amount of input from the Eastern Mediterranean with genetic affinity to Christian Lebanon.\"\" One of the authors of this study commented as follows on the Wells/Zalloua study:\n\"\"We are aware of conflicting conclusions published as an interview in the popular National Geographic magazine. Despite an intensive search we cannot find them reproduced in the mainstream scientific literature. We consider that data somewhat flawed, and furthermore, unsound. National Geographic is not a peer-reviewed academic journal and thus the weight of the evidence is poor compared to other peer-reviewed academic journals that are also in the public domain. One cannot be comfortable with data that have not passed the scrutiny of peer review...\"\n\n\"[I]t seems to me that the simplest explanation that cannot be excluded by any of the scientific data thus far available is that Malta was indeed barely inhabited at the turn of the tenth century.\"\n\n\"Repopulation is likely to have occurred by a clan or clans (possibly of Arab or Arab-like speaking people) from neighbouring Sicily and Calabria. Possibly, they could have mixed with minute numbers of residual inhabitants, with a constant input of immigrants from neighbouring countries and later, even from afar. There seems to be little input from North Africa.\"\"\n\n", "id": "86372", "title": "Maltese people"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86394", "text": "Dattatreya\n\nDattatreya is the God who is an incarnation of the Divine Trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. The word Datta means \"Given\", Datta is called so because the divine trinity have \"given\" themselves in the form of a son to the sage couple Atri and Anasuya. He is the son of Atri, hence the name \"Atreya.\"\n\nIn the Nath tradition, Dattatreya is seen as an Avatar or incarnation of the Lord Shiva and as the Adi-Guru (First Teacher) of the Adi-Nath sampradaya of the Nathas. Although Dattatreya was at first a \"Lord of Yoga\" with Tantric traits, he was adapted and assimilated into the more devotional cults; while still worshiped by millions of Hindus, he is approached more as a benevolent God than as a teacher of the highest essence of Indian thought.\n\nThough the Dattatreya of the Natha tradition coexisted and intermingled with the Puranic, Brahmanical tradition of the Datta sampradaya, here we shall focus almost exclusively on the earlier Tantric manifestation of Datta. Shri Gurudev Mahendranath had no doubt that Dattatreya was an historical figure. He stated that Datta was born on Wednesday, the fourteenth day of the full moon in the month of Margasirsa, though he does not mention the year.\n\nDattatreya left home at an early age to wander naked in search of the Absolute. He seems to have spent most of his life wandering in the area between and including North Mysore, through the Maharashtra, and into Gujarat as far as the Narmada River. He attained realization at a place not far from the town now known as Ganagapur. The original footprints of Datta are believed to be located on the lonely peak at Mount Girnar. The \"Tripura-rahasya\" refers to the disciple Parasurama finding Datta meditating on Gandhamadana mountain.\n\nThe \"Tripura-rahasya (The Secret of [the Goddess] Tripura)\" is believed to be an abbreviated version of the original \"Datta Samhita\" or \"Dakshinamurti Samhita\" traditionally ascribed to Dattatreya. This more lengthy work was summarized by Dattatreya's disciple Parasurama, whose disciple, Sumedha Haritayana, scribed the text. Thus, this text is sometimes referred to as the \"Haritayana Samhita\".\n\nThe \"Tripura-rahasya\" is divided into three parts. The first part, the \"Mahatmya Khanda\" or section on the goddess is concerned with the origin, mantra and yantra of the Goddess Tripura, also known as Lalita or Lalita Tripurasundari. The \"Jnana Khanda\" or section on knowledge elaborates on the themes of consciousness, manifestation, and liberation. The last part, \"Charya Khanda\" or section on conduct, has been lost and some believe destroyed.\n\nAnother work, the \"Avadhuta Gita (Song of the Free)\" is a wonderful, compete compilation of the highest thought given to and recorded by two of Dattatreya's disciples, Swami and Kartika. Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) held it in high esteem. Originally a work of seven chapters, a spurious and misogynistic eighth chapter may be a later attempt to append sexual morality to the Natha tradition by a conservative ascetic. Some of the ideas in this Gita are however common to both Shaivite and Buddhist Tantras.\n\nThe \"Markandeya Purana\" reports that Dattatreya, to free himself of all attachments, dove into a lake where he stayed for many years. By doing so, he also hoped to evade an assembly of Munis who remained on the banks of the lake awaiting his return. Datta emerged from the water naked in the company of a beautiful woman. The text relates that he made love with her (maithuna), drank liquor, and enjoyed singing and music. In spite of this, the Munis did not abandon him, and Dattatraya, accompanied by his shakti, continued to engage in these practices and was meditated on by those longing for moksha.\n\nIn the \"Bhagavata Purana\" Dattatreya enumerates a list of his twenty-four gurus: earth, air, sky / ether, water, fire, sun, moon, python, pigeons, sea, moth, bee, bull elephant, bear, deer, fish, osprey, a child, a maiden, a courtesan, a blacksmith, serpent, spider, and wasp. The image of the Natha ranged from that of a siddha living in the woods with animals, to that of a frightening, even demonic, being.\n\nIn \"The Pathless Path to Immortality\", Shri Gurudev Mahendranath writes:\n\n\"Shri Dattatreya was a dropout of an earlier age than the period when Veda and Tantra merged to become one simple cult. It was men like Dattatreya who helped to make this possible. Three of his close disciples were kings, one an Asura and the other two both belonging to the warrior caste. Dattatreya himself was regarded as an avatar of Maheshwara (Shiva) but later was claimed by Vaishnavites as the avatar of Vishnu. Not such a sectarian claim as it appears; Hindus regard Shiva and Vishnu as the same or as manifestations of the Absolute taking form.\"\n\nIndeed, the \"Dattatreya Upanisad\", which opens proclaiming Dattatreya's identity with Vishnu, ends with the mantra \"Om Namah Shivaya\", identifying Datta with Shiva. In the last portion of the third chapter, Mahesvara (Shiva) alone is said to pervade reality and shine in every heart of man. He alone is in front, behind, to the left, to the right, below, above, everywhere the center. Finally, Mahesvara is identified with Dattatreya, depicting the latter as an Avatar of Shiva.\n\nDattatreya is usually depicted with three heads, symbolising Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva; past, present, and future; and the three states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. He is portrayed sitting in meditation with his shakti beneath the \"audumbara\" (wish-fulfilling) tree. In front of him is a fire pit, and around him are four dogs. These are sometimes said to symbolise the four Vedas.\n\n\n", "id": "86394", "title": "Dattatreya"}

In 1904 he arrived in the capital St Petersburg. The Tsar and Tsarina talked many times with Rasputin and asked for advice as he became their spiritual guide.\n\nRasputin had a lot of influence over Tsarina Alexandra, the wife of Tsar Nicholas II, the emperor of Imperial Russia. Alexandra believed that Rasputin was the answer to her worries. Her only son, Tsarevich Alexei, the heir to the throne was very sick. He had hemophilia. It caused heavy bleeding and pain in his groin and legs each time he fell. Rasputin calmed the boy and the parents. From then on, Alexandra believed Rasputin was the only person who could heal her son with his prayers.\n\nBecause of this, the Tsar and his family began to trust Rasputin more with important decisions on politics. Rasputin did not support the Tsar when he decided to lead his country into World War I. In July 1914, during a stay in his home village, he was stabbed in his belly by a female conspirator Khioniya Guseva. After seven weeks, Rasputin recovered and went back to the capital. There he lived with his two daughters, who went to school in the capital. \n\nIn August 1915, the Tsar decided to lead the country's army himself, and replace his cousin Grand Duke Nikolai. Almost nobody supported him, except Alexandra and Rasputin. Many Russian politicians and nobles became very worried about Rasputin's influence. While the Tsar was at the front, Alexandra and Rasputin took many bad decisions. They proposed to the Tsar, extremely shy and weak-willed, the replacement of several ministers with ones that supported peace. At the end of 1916, Imperial Russia was in a chaotic state. In the big cities there was almost nothing to eat or heat. All the trains were used to supply the army. Some politicians in the parliament decided to attack Alexandra and Rasputin. Their goal was to go on with the war, even though there were heavy losses and a lack of weapons and ammunition.\n\nIn the night of 30 December 1916, Rasputin was led into the Yusupov palace's basement. He was offered wine. When he got drunk, he was shot twice by Prince Felix Yusupov. One shot went into his right kidney and then into his spine. He climbed some stairs and staggered out of the palace through a back door. Rasputin was shot again in the courtyard. To be sure he was dead, he was shot in the forehead at close range. (Nobody knows who fired that shot.) Grand Duke Dmitri drove the conspirators to the Neva River. There they dropped his body from the bridge. In the meantime, Prince Felix had killed his favorite dog, to cover the blood in the courtyard. A few days later Rasputin's body, completely frozen, was found stuck in the ice. The next day the corpse was buried in a park next to the Alexander Palace. After the February Revolution, the new leaders decided to dig up his body, to prevent it would become a place of worship, and burn it. \n\n", "id": "86412", "title": "Grigori Rasputin"}

The unique feature of this device is a smart-card interface which allows a single Simputer to be used by many users. User's private datas might be kept on a cheap smart-card. This device was constructed by Indian company- Simputer Trust. The name stands for \"Simple computer\".\n\nThe Simputer project was invented during the organization of the Global Village, an International Seminar on Information Technology for Developing Countries. It was conducted in October 1998. The discussion was about big need for a low-cost mass access device which will bring local-language IT to the masses. During inventing a name for new established original device, the purpose was to find complex acronym to fit the name Simputer. Thus Simputer is a Simple, Inexpensive, Multi-lingual comPUTER. Later it was expanded to Simple, Inexpensive Multi-lingual People's compUTER. Now it is also called \"computer for the masses\".\n\nIt is architecturally similar to the Linux Advanced Radio Terminal and the Intel StrongARM reference platform. It has processor Intel StrongARM 200+ MHz, 64MB of RAM, 32MB Flash ROM and may use cheap smart-cards with capacity 8KB. It has also USB connectivity and software modem so might be connect to the internet. 320x240 LCD interface in Simputer is with a touch panel overlay on liquid-crystal display.

Many famous people, such as Sir Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman were among those who made it. Stonewall is in London. Stonewall Scotland has offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow and Stonewall Cymru is based in both Cardiff and Bangor in North Wales.\n\nStonewall showed ideas for change to the government. It did not start out as a membership organisation. Since Labour came into power in 1997, however, it has now become active in developing policy (political ideas) to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nSome of Stonewall's best known early work was backing legal test cases in the European Court of Human Rights. These included:\n\nIn the last few years it was successful in parliamentary lobbying. Its previous director Angela Mason (1992 to 2002) was awarded an OBE \"for services to homosexual rights\". Under her direction, Stonewall persuaded parliament to change the 2002 Adoption and Children Bill so that lesbian and gay couples were treated the same as heterosexuals. Under its current Chief Executive, Ben Summerskill, it was closely involved in successful parliamentary campaigns to repeal Section 28 of the Local Government Act (2003); make attacks on gay people separate crimes (that is, \"anti-gay hate crimes\"), through the Criminal Justice Act 2003; introduce the Civil Partnership Act 2004 giving gay and lesbian couples \"civil union\" almost the same as a civil marriage; and introduce the \"2007 Sexual Orientation Regulations\" under the Equality Act 2006, to stop discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nStonewall helps 300 big employers across Britain by giving advice and support to lesbian and gay staff. These companies include IBM, Credit Suisse, the Inland Revenue and the Royal Navy. \n\nThe \"Education for All\" campaign was started in 2005. Stonewall and 70 other organsiations help to stop homophobic bullying in British schools. Section 28 of the Local government Act made any sort of teaching about homosexuality difficult, and the Education for All campaign started after section 28 was repealed.\n\nGrass-roots activists such as Peter Tatchell have accused Stonewall of allowing discrimination by holding regular meetings of celebrities and politicians. The meetings were supported by big businesses such as HSBC, even though HSBC is accused of dismissing someone because of their sexual orientation. \n\nStonewall supported the Civil Partnership bill. Many other groups did not, and they formed a group called the \"Coalition for Marriage Equality\", saying that the new Civil Partnership Bill made a separate yet equal system \"not unlike apartheid\". Many LGBT people who were not part of these groups liked the bill, and Stonewall got a lot of new members.

His name is pronounced \"CAB-ble\".\n\nCabell was born and lived most of his life in Richmond, Virginia. He spent the winters in Florida until the death of his first wife in 1949. He retired in Florida. \n\nCabell was born into a rich Virginian family. His father, Robert Gamble Cabell II (1847–1922), was a physician. His mother, Anne Harris (1859–1915), was the daughter of Col. and Mrs James R. Branch. Cabell's great-grandfather, William H. Cabell, was Governor of Virginia from 1805 to 1808. Cabell was the oldest of three boys . His brothers were Robert Gamble Cabell III (1881–1968) and John Lottier Cabell (1883–1946). His parents separated and were later divorced in 1907.\n\nHe went to the College of William and Mary in 1894 at the age of fifteen. He graduated in 1898. While an undergraduate, Cabell taught French and Greek at the college. Ellen Glasgow, a writer and close friend of Cabell said that he had a friendship with a professor at the college which some people thought was \"too intimate\". Because of this, Cabell had to leave the college. He was later allowed back and finished his degree.\n\nCabell worked from 1898 to 1900 as a newspaper reporter in New York City. He returned to Richmond in 1901. In Richmond, he worked several months for the \"Richmond News\". \n\nMany things happened to Cabell in 1901. His first stories were accepted for publication. It was believed for a short time that Cabell murdered John Scott, a rich person in Richmond. There was a rumor that Scott was \"involved\" with Cabell's mother.\n\nIn 1902, seven of his stories appeared in national magazines. Over the ten years, he wrote many short stories and articles. These were published in well-known magazines including \"Harper's Monthly Magazine\" and the \"Saturday Evening Post\".\n\nBetween 1911 and 1913, he worked for his uncle in the office of the Branch coal mines in West Virginia. On November 8, 1913, he married Priscilla Bradley Shepherd. She was a widow with five children from an earlier marriage. In 1915, Priscilla gave birth to a son, Ballard Hartwell Cabell. Priscilla died in March of 1949. In June 1950, Cabell married Margaret Waller Freeman.\n\nDuring his life, Cabell published fifty-two books. These included novels, genealogy, collections of short stories, poetry, and miscellanea. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1937. Today, the modern languages house and an endowed law professorship at the College of William and Mary are named for him. \n\nCabell died of a cerebral hemorrhage. He is buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. \n\nIn 1970, Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond named its main campus library \"James Branch Cabell Library\". In the 1970s, Cabell's library and personal papers were moved from his home on Monument Avenue to the James Branch Cabell Library. The collection includes some 3,000 volumes, manuscripts, notebooks and scrapbooks, periodicals, letters (including conversations with noted writers such as H.L. Mencken, Ellen Glasgow, Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser), newspaper clippings, photographs, criticisms, printed material, publishers' agreements and statements of sales. \n\nThe VCU undergraduate literary journal at the university is named Poictesme after the fictional province in his book \"Jurgen\".\n\nCabell published about fifty books. Most of these are not well known. His eighth book, \"Jurgen\", (1919) was the most popular. The hero, Jurgen, goes on a journey through ever more fantastic places. He even goes to hell and heaven. Everywhere he goes, he seduces the local women, even the Devil's wife. \n\nThe book was seen as being bad by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. They tried to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publishers won. Many of the things in the book were double entendres. They had one meaning which was bad and also had a decent meaning. It appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal infallibility. Cabell took an author's revenge. The new edition of 1926 included a 'lost' section which was not in the earlier version. In it, the hero is put on trial by the Philistines. A large dung beetle is the chief prosecutor.\n\nOther works include \"Figures of Earth\". This introduces Manuel the Redeemer. He took control of a realm by playing on others' expectations. His motto is \"Mundus Vult Decipi\". This means 'the world wishes to be deceived'. \"The Silver Stallion\" is a sequel. It deals with the adventures of the knights in Manuel's company after he left them. \n\nCabell is now forgotten by most people but his work affected later writers of fantasy fiction. Robert Heinlein's \"Job, A comedy of Justice\" has an appearance of the Slavic god Koschei (from \"Jurgen\"). Fritz Leiber's \"Swords of Lankhmar\" was also affected by Jurgen. Jack Vance's \"Dying Earth\" books show a similar style to Cabell's writing. Cugel the Clever in those books is very similar to Jurgen.\n\n\n\n", "id": "86441", "title": "James Branch Cabell"}

He is called Master Lu by his followers. Within his sect, he is also known as \"Living Buddha Lian Sheng\" (蓮生活佛, \"Liansheng Huófó\"). He is worshipped by his followers as a \"Living Buddha\".\n\nHis organization says that over five million students have taken Buddhist refuge under Lu. There are also more than three hundred local chapters of the True Buddha School, including thirty major temples, such as the Ling Shen Ching Tze Temple in Redmond, Washington, where he lives now. Many of his followers are from Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.\n\nLu is married to Lian Hsiang, who is also a vajra master. She is referred as \"Grand Madam Lu\". Lu and Lian Hsiang have two children. \n\nLu was born in Chiayi County, Taiwan in 1945. He was raised a Christian and attended a Protestant school. His post-secondary education was at Chung Cheng Institute of Technology. He graduated with a degree in Survey Engineering. In his early twenties he was both a survey engineer and a Sunday school Bible teacher. \nLu has written that he had a mystical experience in 1969. This lead him to seek out a total of twenty-one human gurus in Taoism, Sutra, and Tantra. In 1982, Lu moved to the United States, and lived in the state of Washington.\n\nTo date, Lu has written over 200 books in Chinese on various topics, including feng shui and poetry. \n\nAccording to his website, he went into hiding in Tahiti for six years starting late 2000 and lived in Taichung, Taiwan. Today he lives in the state of Washington.\n\nLu teaches the Mahamudra way of attaining enlightenment. His teachings follow the traditional stages of the practice of the Four Preliminaries, followed by Guru Yoga, Deity Yoga, the Vajra Practices, and finally Highest Yoga Tantra. Lu has written that his spiritual gurus included the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpe Dorje and Tai Situ Rinpoche.\n\nHe describes the state of enlightenment using the allegory of Padmakumara, whom he identifies with Amitabha Buddha and his own enlightened self.\n\nAccording to Noah Casey, Lu's teachings do not prohibit the consumption of meat and alcohol; however, \"The consumption of alcohol is limited to quantities not resulting in intoxication, and the eating of meat is restricted to animals not butchered especially for the person consuming. Before consuming either of these, or any other nutritional substance, a special prayer is required. For meats, the spirit of the animal must be delivered.\" This is consistent with the Vajrayana traditions of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nLu made headlines during an investigation by the Washington State Public Disclosure Commission into his cash donations to Chinese American politician Gary Locke, who Lu had hoped would run for President of the United States. Locke was cleared of any wrongdoing by the commission in 1998.\n\nHe was also sued in civil court by a former disciple, who called herself SHC, a 41-year-old Malaysian immigrant, over claims of sexual misconduct, after the King County, Washington prosecutor declined to file charges for lack of evidence. The case was dismissed by King County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Learned citing constitutional issues. In the case \"S.H.C. v. Sheng-Yen Lu\", the Superior Court of King County granted the Temple's motion for summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals later \"affirm[ed] the trial court's grant of summary judgment dismissing all claims against the Temple.\"\n\nLu has been criticized by Tsering Phuri, the president of TIBETcenter, who said \"People should not say, `I am a living Buddha'\".\nHowever, this title was called by his diciples or people who believed in him back to 30 or 40 years ago in Taiwan, and Lu also admitted that he is the incarnated body of the Buddha.\n\n\n", "id": "86447", "title": "Lu Sheng-yen"}

He was one of the most important composers of his time. He went to Italy when he was young and spent the rest of his life there. He belonged to the group of composers who lived and worked in Venice at the time, and who were known as the “Venetian School”. \n\nHe may have been born in Bruges which is now in Belgium, although we are not sure. One of his students, Gioseffo Zarlino, who became a well-known music theorist, said that Willaert went to Paris first to study law, but then decided to study music. In Paris he met Jean Mouton, the main composer of the French royal chapel, and studied with him. Mouton taught him to write music in the style of Josquin, whose music was very polyphonic with the voices imitating one another a lot.\n\nSometime around 1515 Willaert first went to Rome. There is a story, which is probably true, that Willaert was surprised to find the Pope’s choir singing something he had composed. The choir thought it had been composed by Josquin, who was very famous by then. When the young Willaert told them that he himself was the composer, the choir did not believe the young man, and refused to sing it again.\n\nIn July 1515, Willaert worked for the Cardinal Ippolito I d'Este of Ferrara. Ippolito liked to travel, and he often took Willaert and other musicians with him to places such as Hungary, where he probably spent two years, from 1517 to 1519. When Ippolito died in 1520, Willaert worked for Duke Alfonso d'Este of Ferrara. In 1522 Willaert had a job at the court chapel of Duke Alfonso; he stayed there until 1525.\n\nWillaert then got the most important musical job in the whole of Europe at that time: he became maestro di cappella (director of music) at the church of St. Mark's at Venice. The director who had been there before had not been very good, so Willaert made the music in that church really great again. He stayed in that job until his death. He was very famous and young composers came from all over Europe to study with him and learn how to be a composer.\n\nWillaert was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance and the most important composer in Europe between the death of Josquin and the time of Palestrina.\n\nHe wrote music in lots of forms, especially church music, madrigals and instrumental pieces called ricercar.\n\n", "id": "86450", "title": "Adrian Willaert"}

It is believed that the Gadigal people once lived in the area starting from the south side of Port Jackson (South Head, Watsons Bay), heading west in a semi circle cutting through Petersham. On the northern side of Sydney Harbour lived the Cammeraygal tribe. It was believed that the area on the southern side of the Parramatta River, just west of Petersham and through to Rose Hill, was owned by the Wanegal tribe.

It was released on September 12, 2006. The album is named after a song on the album; a cover of a song by American singer Tom Brosseau.\n\nThe album got mostly good reviews from important music critics, with some critics saying that the album was “, ”, and “genius”. The album got Thile a Grammy Award-nomination in 2007.\n\nFor a away from his band Nickel Creek, Chris Thile knew he wanted to form a five-piece string band that featured mandolin, violin, banjo, acoustic guitar, and double bass. Thile also wanted the band to feature his friend and fiddle player Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know what kind of band he wanted it to be. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado, Thile met banjo player Noam Pikelny and later said that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. At that time, Thile decided that he wanted “put [his] stamp” on the normal bluegrass band. Thile wanted to find five people to make the five-piece band he planned. He had already found fiddle, banjo, and mandolin players, so he just had to find double bass and acoustic guitar players. The bass player Thile was looking for turned out to be Greg Garrison, a friend of Noam Pikelny. Before this, Pikelny had played with Garrison in the band Leftover Salmon. The guitar player Thile needed became Chris Eldridge, famous as a member of the Infamous Stringdusters. The five people met up in Nashville on one day in 2005 and decided to “do something musical together”. A few days later, the group met again “to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and [talk] about our failed relationships”. That night, they formed a bluegrass band. \n\nA few months later, the group decided to record an album. The album was recorded in two days at \"Sear Sound Recording Studios\" in New York City. The album was not made digitally, but in the way: on tape. In an interview with the United States magazine \"Guitar Player\", Chris Thile talked about how \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was recorded: \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" was produced by Thile, and the only musicians on the album was the band that Thile chose. The band was later named the \"How to Grow a Band\".\n\n\"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" takes influence from several musical genres, “drawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer-songwriter traditions”. One music critic called the album “roots oriented”. Bluegrass mandolin player Ronnie McCoury became the album’s official “bluegrass ” to make sure that there was “someone who could make sure we didn’t do anything or ”. When discussing the album’s musical style, Chris Thile said that “All in all, \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\" is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me.” Much of Thile's work on the album was inspired by his divorce, and Thile said that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he \"got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me. I’ve always been able to talk to girls, but I’m scared of them. I just could relate to it.

At the age of sixteen, she was initiated into Buddhism by Guru Padmasambhava. Although she was originally one of the Queen consorts of Trisong Detsen, he gave her to Padmasambhava and she became his main spiritual consort. After many years of study she became enlightened. Yeshey Tsogyal was the main person who wrote down and collected Padmasambhava's teachings.

They formed a \"gang\", with other boys who lived nearby.\n\nDuring their teenage years, rock and roll became popular in England, as it did in America. Folk music and were also popular. Young people all over England formed skiffle bands, and played folk and rock songs. Lennon got a guitar from his mother. He and Shotton formed a band, the Quarry Men, with classmates from their school (named Quarry Bank), and other friends.\n\nShotton's role in the band was to play percussion on a , and to sing harmony. While Lennon had genuine musical talent, Shotton did not become a skilled musician, and did not enjoy playing music. After Paul McCartney joined the Quarry Men, he and Lennon began to work together on music. McCartney was very talented, and Shotton felt out of place in the band. He waited a long time, before he finally told Lennon.\n\nLennon \"fired\" Shotton from the Quarry Men after they played at a party. He took the washboard away and broke it over Shotton's head. All the same, they were still friends, and spent time together. When they finished high school, Lennon went on to art college, and Shotton trained to become a police officer. The Quarry Men changed from playing skiffle to playing rock and roll.

He went back to running his supermarket, and he and Lennon lost touch. After Lennon and Yoko Ono moved to America, Shotton visited them in New York City, and they enjoyed seeing each other again.\n\nJohn Lennon was murdered late in 1980. When Shotton heard the news, he drove to George Harrison's home, Friar Park, and spent the day with Harrison.

The piriform cortex is probably the area most closely associated with identifying the odor. The medial amygdala is involved in social functions such as mating and recognising animals of the same species. The entorhinal cortex pairs odors with memories. The exact functions of these higher areas is still being researched. \n\nLinda B. Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the olfactory system. By analyzing rat DNA, they estimated that there were about one thousand different genes for olfactory receptors in the mammalian genome. \n\nDamage to the olfactory system can happen through brain injury, cancer or toxic gases.

The first competition was held in 1891.\n\nThe French Open is known for being the only Grand Slam played on a clay court. On a clay court the ball bounces much slower and higher than on hard or grass courts. This makes it more difficult to win the point and rallies (the number of shots in a point) usually last longer. Players that excel on clay courts are called \"clay-court specialists\".\n\nThe tournament is played for two weeks. It starts in late May and finishes in early June.\n\nSometimes, the French Open is called the Roland Garros tournament. Roland Garros was a well-known aviator from World War I who had the main tennis court named after him.\n\nThe singles winners in 2016 were Novak Djokovic and Garbiñe Muguruza.

He was Flemish, but spent all his adult life in Italy. The name de Rore is a proper Flemish name, not a name that has been changed to look Italian. He was one of the most important composer of madrigals in the 16th century.\n\nThere is very little known about Rore's early life. He was born in a small town called Ronse (Renaix) in what is now Belgium. It is possible that he had music lessons in Antwerp. We think that he was taken to Italy by Margaret of Parma in 1533 as one of her servants. Margaret, who was an illegitimate daughter of Charles V, was very wealthy and she married into the Medici family. Rore probably continued to learn about music in Italy.\n\nIn his music publications de Rore is called a “disciple” of Adrian Willaert. We do not know whether this means that he had lessons from Willaert, or just that he learned to compose by studying Willaert’s music. His first book of madrigals was published in 1542, and then two books of motets were published. \n\nIn 1546 Rore went to Ferrara, where he was \"maestro di cappella\" (choirmaster) He wrote a great deal of music in Ferrara. He worked for the Duke Ercole II d'Este. He composed masses, motets, chansons, and lots of madrigals, some of which were about things that happened in the court at Ferrara. The duke awarded him an important honour. Rore also wrote music for Albrecht V of Bavaria who lived in Munich.\n\nHe left his job in Ferrara and went back to Flanders where he found his home town Ronse had been destroyed in a war. He went back to Ferrara, but could not get his old job back. After another visit to Flanders he returned to Italy and got a job in Parma, but the music in that town was not very good. For a short time he had a very important job of\n\"maestro di cappella\" at St. Mark's. Adrian Willaert had just died. However, Rore only kept this job for a year, returning to Parma in 1564 and dying there the next year.\n\nRore is best known for his Italian madrigals, but he also wrote a lot of church music, including masses and motets. He learned from studying the music of Josquin. His madrigals are based on the style of Willaert. He enjoyed writing thick counterpoint and making the voices imitate one another a lot. Most of the words he set were serious words, not lighthearted and amusing. He often used chromaticism. He developed his musical style a lot during his lifetime. His music was very important in the development of the Italian madrigal, and it led the way to the madrigals of Monteverdi.\n\n", "id": "86680", "title": "Cipriano de Rore"}

TFT technology can be used to give one of the clearest pictures of any flat screen display and it uses much less electricity than older screens. TFT displays are very fragile because they are made as thin and light as possible but this means they need far less space. Widescreen Displays (which have an aspect ratio of 16:9) are becoming the most popular form of television and monitor displays. Standard format (which have an aspect ratio of 4:3) was the most popular for a long time.\n\nThe number of pixels in a display screen is called the resolution.\nThe word resolution means the solution of a problem. Better resolution on a display screen describes how detailed a picture can be displayed. Each pixel is another detail on the screen. This is normally described as two numbers, (width) x (height).\n\nhan thpe older CRT displays.\n\nTFT dislays are also known as flatscreen, flat-panel, and liquid crystal display (LCD) but these types are not always TFTs.\n\nTFT displays are made with a special chemical technology called chemical vapor deposition. With this special technology very thin glass can be coated with electrically metal and still be transparent. Chemical vapor deposition makes the thinnest computer and television display screens possible. \n\nMost display screens have hundreds of thousands of pixels. Each pixel has to be set to the right colour (most display screens are capable of 16 million colours in each pixel). To make a clear picture, the screen might need to make millions of calculations. Any group of pixels that change to the same colour can be changed with one calculation, making the calculations much smaller. For example, if the picture to display was just a white screen, the screens processor would only calculate the colour once and use the same calculation for the whole screen. Changing one pixel at a time would take many more calculations. If the same picture was shown many times on the screen, the processor would calculate the picture once and then repeat it in whatever position and in different sizes, if needed. The processor can make very complicated calculations, but in the end it does less work. This is called rendering technology. Rendering technology in the most modern displays is like making a .\n\nA display with a resolution of 1600 x 1200 pixels has four times the number of pixels in an 800 x 600 resolution. Without rendering technology the 1600 x 1200 display would do four times as much work as an 800 x 600 display so rendering technology is very useful to make a bigger display with some of the same parts used to make a smaller display.\n\nThe response time is the length of time it takes between the processor receiving a signal from the computer or the television station and displaying something on the screen. Today's displays have a very low response time (very fast). It is hard to see response times but they can affect a clear picture. A low response time is best for clear pictures when playing games and watching movies on the screen. For office work and internet a fast response time is less important.\n\nTFT response time is measured as the average time it takes to change the pixels from one shade of grey to another shade of grey.\n\nChanging a pixel between colours takes more time than changing from black to white on a display screen. TFT is very fast for changing between colours which is more important for movies and games.\n\nPositive aspects of TFT displays:\n\n\nNegative aspects of TFT displays\n\n\nAt one time, there were some positive advantages of CRT displays, which are no longer true:\n\n\nNegative aspects of CRT displays:\n\n\nTN is an abbreviation for Twisted Nematic. This is a new kind of TFT technology. They offer higher resolutions (more pixels). TN panels have a lower response time (they react faster).\n\nSince this article was written, there have been further developments in the technology of producing LCD displays.

People are usually said to have BDD if they are extremely critical of their body, even though there may be nothing noticeably wrong with it. If there is something wrong with their body, it is usually so small that a person without BDD would not be unhappy about it at all. People claim that they are insecure, but BDD is far worse.\n\nMost people without BDD may not like some parts of their body, but people with BDD believe that they are so ugly, even though they are not, that they find it difficult to talk or exist with other people, or live normally, scared that other people will be mean to them because of the way they look. People with BDD often do not look for help because they are afraid others will think they are just vain, or they may feel too embarrassed to talk to other people as they think they are so ugly.\n\nBDD is a somatoform disorder. People with BDD may look at themselves in the mirror too much, or some people with BDD may actually try not to look in the mirror. Both of these are possible for a person with BDD. They usually think about their body for more than one hour per day, and in bad cases, can stop talking to other people, and may stay at home. People with BDD often have very low self-confidence, because they believe that a person's value is linked to what they look like, and because they do not think that they are beautiful themselves, they do not think they have much value.\n\n\nSigmund Freud had an important Russian person (Sergei Pankejeff) with him in the past, who would have been classified as having the disorder in modern times. Freud named him \"The Wolf Man\", to protect Pankejeff's identity. Pankejeff was so unhappy with his nose that he could not live a normal life.\n\nIt is unknown what the full cause of BDD is. However, research shows that a number of things may be the cause:\n\n\"The chemicals in the brain.\" If the amount of serotonin is too low, one of the brain's neurotransmitters which gives us 'mood' and 'pain', may help cause body dysmorphic disorder. Scientists can not explain this chemical problem in the brain, but it may be hereditary (passed down from parents to child).\n\n\"Obsessive-compulsive disorder.\" Many people with BDD also have OCD, where the person does things without wanting to. If people have had, or have a genetic link to OCD, the person may be more likely to have BDD.\n\n\"Generalized anxiety disorder.\" Many people with BDD also have generalized anxiety disorder. This disorder is where the person worries about things a lot, which makes them have anxiety about things in their life, for example, about their body, as in BDD.\n\nBDD usually develops in adolescence, a time when people usually worry about their appearance the most. However, many people with BDD suffer for years before they look for help. When they do look for help to Doctors, people with the problem often say they have other problems, for example, depression, social anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, but do not say their real problem is with the way they look. Most patients can not be convinced that the problem they have with their body is only 'imagined', and that they are seeing a 'changed' view of themselves, because people do not know much about BDD, compared to other mental problems, for example OCD or others.\n\nThe DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) IV says that a person must have the things written below if they have BDD:\n\nA person with BDD will often do these things:\n\nDr. Katharine Philips did research, with more than 500 people with BDD, on the percentage of patients unhappy with the most common parts of the body;\n\nsource: \"The Broken Mirror\", Katharine A Philips, Oxford University Press, 2005 ed, p56\n\nHowever, people with BDD often are unhappy about more than one part of their body.\n\nA German study has shown that 1-2% of the population has complete BDD, but a bigger percentage of people show some of the effects (\"Psychological Medicine\", vol 36, p 877).\n\nThe number of men and women with BDD is around the same, but there are slightly more women with it. However, the number of men and women who go to the doctor with it are the same.\n\nStudies show that BDD is common non-clinical places and clinical places. Research was done on 200 people with DSM-IV BDD. These people were aged 12 and older. They were interviewed. The people with BDD were found from 'mental-health doctors', advertisements, their friends and family, and non-psychiatrist physicians. 53 of the 200 people were receiving medication, 33 were receiving psychotherapy, and 48 were receiving both medication and psychotherapy. How bad each person's BDD was, was assessed using the \"Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale\", modified for BDD. Symptoms were assessed with the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination. Both tests were made just for BDD. The results showed that BDD is in 0.7% - 1.1% of community samples and 2%-13% of non-clinical samples. 13% of psychiatric patients had BDD. Research also found that some of the patients who were firstly diagnosed with OCD, also had BDD. 53 patients with OCD and 53 patients with BDD were compared to each other in research. Clinical features, comorbidity, family history, and population features were compared between the two groups. 9 of the 62 subjects (14.5%) of those with OCD also had BDD.\n\nIn most examples, BDD is not found even when people have it. In research done on 17 patients with BDD, BDD was 'found' in only five patients, and none of the patients had a proper diagnosis of BDD even though they all in fact had BDD.\n\nBDD can cause only a few problems for some people. However, for other people, it can cause many problems.\n\nIt can make it very difficult to have a normal job or family life. People who have a job or a family to care for would definitely find life easier and better if they did not have BDD. The love partners of BDD people can also suffer, as they may sometimes lose their loved one to suicide. Friendship, romance, and family is very hard to hold for a person with BDD, as the unhappiness with the looks of the person takes over their life, so they often do not bother with the other aspects of life as much. Also, the BDD stops the person from making these 'bonds' with people, as they always feel scared about the way they look, and therefore find it difficult to be themself with other people.\n\nPeople with BDD may often have little motivation for anything. This means that BDD people can appear to take a long time to get everything done. However, this is not exactly true, because BDD sufferers will often just stop what they were doing for a long time, so it is not just that they are slow, but find it difficult to concentrate on what they are doing. without being able to actually motivate themselves until it becomes completely necessary to get back up. This low amount of motivation can be in all parts of a person's life, for example, school, friends, love, family, or work.\n\nHowever, when the person is trying to do things to the way they look, such as combing their hair, or choosing clothes, it is common for the person to have an extreme motivation. Therefore, people with BDD can sometimes not feel motivated for anything in their life, but when they are working on their looks, they will have an extreme motivation that is not normal either.\n\nPeople with BDD have a very high suicide rate compared to all mental problems.\n\nPhillips & Menard did a lot of research in 2006 about BDD suicides.\n\nSome people say that there is a link between undiagnosed BDD and a higher than average suicide rate with people who had cosmetic surgery.\n\nAnother condition, Gender identity disorder (GID), where the person finds his or her gender as a male or female uncomfortable, often has BDD-like feelings that are only directed at the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics on their body, which disagree with the person's perception of their own gender since birth. People with GID may also have BDD-like traits or their condition may be mis-diagnosed as BDD. Most studies reported a pre- transition GID suicide attempt rate of 20% or more. The suicide attempt rate for patients with BDD is 15%. No studies are available showing overlap between GID and BDD suicide rate because BDD is excluded as a condition prior to GID diagnosis.\n\nBDD and GID are different conditions. One of the key differences is the fact that BDD responds to psychopharmacology, whereas GID does not. Furthermore, psychopharmacology or psychotherapy are often successful in convincing the BDD sufferer that their perceptions are distorted. Those with GID are rarely convinced that they are mistaken. GID (especially \"transsexualism\") also often manifests during early childhood, rather than during adolescence. It is standard practice in treating BDD to convince sufferers that surgical procedures are not necessary because eradicating their first perceived defect through surgery will only make them start obsessing about their next perceived defect, whereas those people properly diagnosed as \"transsexual\" under GID benefit greatly from surgical procedures specifically targeted at their primary or secondary sex characteristics. However, a person with GID may also have BDD if they obsess over perceived defects on their body that contradict or go beyond their gender identity.\n\nBDD is often wrongly thought of as a 'vanity' obsession, but it is actually the opposite, because people with BDD believe they are very ugly, even though people without BDD do not think they are. There is not usually actually anything wrong with the way the person with BDD looks, but to that person, there is. A person with BDD can spend hours looking in the mirror, but they are not being vain, as they do not think they are attractive. People with BDD usually realize that worrying about their looks so much is bad, but they can not help it.\n\nALSO a person with BDD may alternatively avoid mirrors at all costs. Or any reflective surfaces for that matter. Including spoons, windows, mirrors, etc.\n\nResearch found that talking as therapy, has not worked to stop BDD. However, Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) has been found to be more effective. In a study of 54 patients with BDD, some of them had Cognitive Behavior Therapy, and some had no treatment. BDD symptoms decreased a lot in those patients undergoing CBT. BDD was eliminated in 82% of cases at post treatment and 77% at follow-up. (8) Due to low levels of serotonin in the brain, another commonly used treatment is SSRI drugs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). 74 subjects were enrolled in a placebo controlled study group to evaluate the efficiency of fluoxetine hydrochloride, a SSRI drug. Patients were randomized to receive 12-weeks of double-blind treatment with fluoxetine or the placebo. At the end of 12 weeks, 53% of patients responded to the fluoxetine.\n\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder is a chronic disease that has symptoms that never subside. Instead, they get worse as time goes on. Without treatment, BDD could last a lifetime. In many cases, as illustrated in The Broken Mirror by Katharine Phillips, the social lives of many patients disintegrates because they are so preoccupied with their appearance.\n\n", "id": "86764", "title": "Body dysmorphic disorder"}

It was the first of three so-called \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley (the others being Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom). \n\nOld Kingdom was the best by the Third Dynasty through to the Sixth Dynasty (2686 BC – 2134 BC). Many Egyptologists also include the Memphite Seventh and Eighth Dynasties in the Old Kingdom as a continuation of the administration centralized at Memphis. The Old Kingdom was followed by a period of disunity and relative cultural decline that is called the First Intermediate Period by Egyptologists. \n\nThe royal capital of Egypt during the Old Kingdom was Memphis. During the Old Kingdom era the great pyramids were built to be burial tombs for the Pharaohs. Because Pharaohs were believed to be given authority from heaven, they wished to walk to Ra, their Sun-god, after death. King Zoser's adviser Inhotep designed the pyramid, hoping to easily reach Ra. The tombs were built on the west bank of the Nile where the sun seemed to set. For this reason, the Old Kingdom is sometimes called \"The Age of the Pyramids.\"\n\nKhufu, called Cheops, was the Pharaoh who built the Great Pyramid at Giza, near Cairo. He believed his soul never died, so they stored food, clothes, and things he owned in the rooms of the pyramid. The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the World: tall as a forty-story building, it took a hundred thousand men twenty years to build. With only ramps and physical energy, they had to move and lift into place 2,300,000 blocks of limestone that were about two and one-half tons apiece. Slaves, farmers, and gangs of men had to work on the Great Pyramid, and were paid with valuable things, not coins (Egyptians had no coins).\nTo guard the pyramids, a huge stone statue called the Great Sphinx was created and placed nearby. The Great Sphinx has a man's head and a lion's body, with paws 50 ft long.\n\nAt last, the priests overthrew the Pharaohs.

Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read.\n\nFormulae for predicting how difficult a sample of prose will be for readers are called \"readability formulae\". Some measure only the difficulty of the vocabulary: they are one-variable measures. Others include a measure of syntax such as sentence length.\n\nValidity of formulae can be judged by comparing them to each other, which is a kind of consistency check. More important is a check for how well they predict an independent (\"outside\") criterion of readability.\n\nOne way to do this is to use a set of graded test passages. There the correlation coefficient of the better formulae \"hovers around 70%\". There have been many dozens of experimental tests, summarised by Klare. Correlations between readability measures and comprehension scores on passages are usual, as are correlations between readability scores are grade levels as chosen by experienced teachers. Quite an important result was got by Murphy, who increased the readability of a farm journal and found the readership much increased.\n\nThe SMOG formula uses one variable to predict the difficulty of a passage of prose. It was developed G. Harry McLaughlin in 1969 to make calculations as simple as possible. Like Gunning-Fog the formula uses words which have 3 or more syllables as an indicator for hardness; these words are said to be polysyllabic.\n\nThe original formula was given for samples of 30 sentences. It is:\n\nThis can be adjusted to work with any number of sentences:\n\nMcLaughlin also created directions for an approximate version which can be done with just mental calculation. \n\nEdgar Dale, a professor of education at Ohio State University, was one of the first critics of Thorndike's vocabulary-frequency lists. He claimed that they did not distinguish between the different meanings that many words have. He created two new lists of his own. One, his \"short list\" of 769 easy words, was used by Irving Lorge in his formula. The other was his \"long list\" of 3,000 easy words, which were understood by 80 percent of fourth-grade students. In 1948, he incorporated this list in a formula which he developed with Jeanne S. Chall, who was to become the founder of the Harvard Reading Laboratory. \n\nTo apply the formula:\n\nRaw Score = 0.1579PDW + 0.0496ASL + 3.6365\n\nWhere: \n\nFinally, to compensate for the \"grade-equivalent curve,\" apply the following chart for the Final Score:\n\nIn 1995, Dale and Chall published a new version of their formula with an upgraded word list.\n\nThe formula for the Flesch reading-ease score is\n\nScores can be interpreted as shown in the table below.\n\nThe US Department of Defense uses the reading ease test as the standard test of readability for its documents and forms. Florida requires that life insurance policies have a Flesch reading ease score of 45 or greater.\n\nUse of this scale is so ubiquitous that it is bundled with popular word processing programs and services such as KWord, IBM Lotus Symphony, Microsoft Office Word, WordPerfect, and WordPro.\n\nThe Gunning Fog, sometimes called the Fog index, is a formula developed by Robert Gunning. It was first published in his book \"The Technique of Clear Writing\" in 1952. It became popular because the score is easy to calculate. \n\nThe formula has been criticized as it mainly uses sentence length. The critics argue that texts created with the formula will use shorter sentences without using simpler words. However, this criticism confuses \"prediction of difficulty\" with production of prose (writing). The role of readability tests is to predict difficulty; writing better prose is quite another matter. As discussed in prose difficulty, sentence length is an index of syntactical difficulty.\n\nWhere:\n\nThe Spache method compares words in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing.

He was one of the greatest composers of the Renaissance. He changed music from the sound of medieval compositions and developed the style which led to the great compositions of the 16th century Renaissance composers such as Adrian Willaert, Palestrina, Lassus and Byrd.\n\nJosquin was born ca. 1450-55 and died in 1521.\nThe name Josquin was a common name in Northern France and Flanders at that time. It was the name of a Breton saint who had lived in that area in the 7th century. The name Des Prez started off as a nickname in the family, and gradually it became the family name. The name Josquin des Prez is spelt in several different ways in old documents. He is often simply called “Josquin”.\n\nWe know very little about his life. We know very little about what people thought about him during his life, although after his death many people admired his music. Even his birthplace is uncertain. We do not know where he got his musical training. He was described as a “pupil of Ockeghem”, but that may just mean that he studied Ockeghem’s music.\n\nWe know that he became a singer in the chapel of Aix-en-Provence, the chapel of the Duke of Anjou. After the duke’s death in 1480 he worked for King Louis XI of France until he, too, died in 1483. We do not know where he worked after that, but he had some music published, including six chansons. He probably worked for some time in Milan.\n\nIn 1489 Josquin went to Rome and worked in the pope’s chapel. He stayed there at least until 1495, possibly later. There he wrote music for the chapel, including some motets. His music was becoming well known in some parts of northern Italy. It was a time of war in Italy. Several times the king of France invaded parts of Italy. Josquin seems to have written several pieces for the French royal court, including some funeral music on the death of King Louis XII in 1515.\n\nFor a year (1503-1504) he was maestro di cappella in Ferrara. He may have left that job because of an outbreak of the plague. A few months after he left the famous composer Jacob Obrecht took over the job. Obrecht was only paid half the salary that Josquin had been given. Very soon afterwards, Obrecht died of the plague.\n\nFrom 1504 until his death in 1521 Josquin was back in Northern France, where had the job of provost in Condé-sur-l’Escaut, which may possibly have been his birthplace. The church was a very important one, and it had an excellent choir.\n\nBefore he died Josquin paid a lot of tax to make sure that after his death his property did not go to the local lord of the manor but would be given to his church. After his death his house was sold, and the money was used for special church services to remember him. There was a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the wall of his old house, and when church processions passed by they stopped in front of it and sang Josquin’s motets \"Pater Noster\" and \"Ave Maria\".\n\nHis music is nearly all choir music. It consists mainly of church music: motets and masses, although he also wrote some secular (non-religious) music, including some chansons (French songs) and some instrumental music. One popular song is called \"El Grillo \". It means “the cricket” and it describes the sound of a cricket singing in the grass.\n\nJosquin was a master of polyphony. His name had become so famous that, after his death, many publishers printed music by other composers and pretended it was by Josquin so that more people would buy it. During recent years musicologists have studied many of these manuscripts very carefully and tried to decide which ones were really by Josquin.\n\n", "id": "86868", "title": "Josquin des Prez"}

He has worked in theatres and television.\n\nGrillo was born in Savignone, a small town in the Province of Genoa, Liguria. Grillo became a comedian improvising a monologue at an audition. Two weeks later he was discovered by Italian television presenter Pippo Baudo. He participated in the variety show \"Secondo Voi\" for two years (1977-78). Later, in 1979, he was in \"Luna Park\" and \"Fantastico\".\n\nIn 1984 he participated to \"Te la do io l'America\" (four episodes) and \"Te lo do io il Brasile\" (6 episodes). On these shows, he spoke about his visits to the United States and Brazil and talked about their culture and lifestyle.\n\nHis popularity grew more and more. He became the protagonist of another show called \"Grillometro\" (\"Grillometer\"). Soon after this, his performances started to have more and more political satire. He often insulted politicians. In 1987 during the Saturday night television programme \"Fantastico 7\", he made comments about the Italian Socialist Party and its leader Bettino Craxi who had just taken a trip to China. Grillo said, \"If the Chinese are all socialists, whom do they steal from?\" The Italian Socialist Party did not like this because he was calling them thieves. After this episode, Grillo slowly was banned from the publicly owned television. Grillo not back on television until the political party was forced to disband several years later.\n\nIn 1993, Grillo was allowed on public television one more time. This show was watched by 16 million of Italians. This was the most viewers ever for Italian television. \n\nGrillo has a daily blog where he speaks about alternative energy, globalization, and technology. Versions of the blog are in English, Italian and Japanese. Posts in the Italian version will commonly get thousands of comments and replies from people. His blog is one of the 10 most viewed blogs. He often gets letters from important people who support his blog. These people include Antonio Di Pietro (Italian Minister Of Infrastructures), Fausto Bertinotti (President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies), Renzo Piano, and even Nobel Prize Winners like Dario Fo, Joseph E. Stiglitz, Dalai Lama, Muhammad Yunus.\n\nGrillo commonly fights against corruption in his blog. He has used it to help create change in the Italian government. He wants any politician who have been found guilty of a crime to be removed from office.\n\nIn 1980, Grillo was found guilty of manslaughter for a car accident in which he was the driver. Three passengers lost their lives.\n\nGrillo never hesitates to name firms and people he believes are corrupt. He always supports his views with data and documents. This has caused him to be sued several times for libel by many people and organizations which he had exposed, such as Telecom Italia.\n\nGrillo is often criticized for his lifestyle. They do not think it is correct for him to own a motor yacht and a Ferrari when these things are against his ecological statements. Beppe Grillo said that he did own them, but that he had sold them since then. It is also said that he is just saying what is wrong about politicians based on the popular opinions of the people and does not give any other ways things should be done. \n\n\n", "id": "86869", "title": "Beppe Grillo"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86883", "text": "Legitimacy\n\nThe word Legitimacy means something which is good and right. Why the thing is right may be because it follows the law, a religion says it is right, or maybe it is naturally right. People may not agree about what is right, and because of this they may not agree what \"Legitimacy\" is and what is \"Legitimate\". There are two different uses of the word \"Legitimacy\"\n\nWhen a government is accepted by many people it is considered to have \"Legitimacy\". In the past, some different reasons were used to make people accept a government. In the Zhou Dynasty of old China the rulers said they were given the \"Mandate of Heaven\" which means that the ruler was chosen by God. This is similar to the divine right of kings doctrine in Europe, where kings would say they were chosen by God.\n\nIn the time of The Enlightenment, John Locke wrote that Legitimacy came from the agreement of the people under the government. In Western thinking, this has become the accepted meaning. Not all the people must agree, only most of the people. Most of the people must agree that the government is the best way to make laws and rule, if the government has Legitimacy.\n\nMax Weber said there are three kinds of political Legitimacy:\n\n\nIn common law, legitimacy is the status of a child who is born to parents who are legally married to each another. In the opposite, illegitimacy describes someone whose parents were not married. Such a person was called \"illegitimate\", literally means “not legal” (against the law). Virtually everyone alive today has ancestors who were born illegitimately. \n\nPeople’s attitude towards illegitimacy has varied in different parts of the world. In the Western world, especially in countries which were very religious, it was thought to be very bad for parents to have a child if they were not married. It was thought to be a sin. Illegitimate children were often called bastards. Historically, under English law, an illegitimate child was (a child of no one) and so could not get an Inheritance from his or her parents. In older times, such children were often brought up by other people, sometimes by relatives.\n\nToday people’s attitude has changed, and the laws have changed so that people born to unmarried parents are not discriminated against unfairly. In the United States, people are not described any longer as “illegitimate” but as “born out of wedlock” (“wedlock” means “marriage”). In the United Kingdom the idea of illegitimacy was stopped by law in 1991. Fathers now have a responsibility to their children, even if they were born out-of-wedlock. Many religions still maintain that sex outside marriage is a sin, although they no longer say that the child lives in a state of sin.\n", "id": "86883", "title": "Legitimacy"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86924", "text": "Lightning rod\n\nA lightning rod or lightning conductor is a iron rod that is used to make lightning strike it, rather than strike something else. It is part of a lightning protection system. Such a system is made of many such rods. These rods are usually placed at high points of buildings and structures. In addition, paths are made the electricity can take from the rooftop to the ground. \nLightning can damage structures made of most materials (masonry, wood, concrete and even steel). The huge currents involved can heat materials, and especially water to high temperatures. This will cause fire, loss of strength and explosions from superheated steam and air.\n\nThe church tower was usually the highest structure or building in medieval European towns and villages. It was also the building very often hit by lightning. Early on, Christian churches tried to prevent the damage of lightning by prayers. Priests prayed,\nPeter Ahlwardts (\"Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning\", 1745) said people who sought to protect themselves from lightning should go anywhere except in or around a church. \n\nIn Europe, the lightning rod was invented by a theologian and natural scientist, Václav Prokop Diviš, between 1750 and 1754. He is the inventor of the first grounded lightning rod, which he erected on 15 July 1754 in the garden of his home in Přímětice u Znojma. It consisted of 400 sharp metal spikes attached at the top of a 42 m tall supporting pylon. The structure was fastened by three metal chains, conductively attached to the iron grounding cones buried in the packed down soil. He described his 'weather machine' in the treatise 'Descriptio machinae meteorologicae'. The original idea was to continually sap the electricity out of the clouds and so actually \"prevent\" the lightning and the storms, only in case this failed, the machine should have also been able to directly attract the lighting and channel it to the ground. He proposed his machine to be used on church towers and ships. He was sending his observations regarding the machine operation to Jan Antonín Scrinci, the physics professor at the Charles University in Prague, who published them in 'Prager Postzeitungen', 'Brünner Intelligenz-Zettel' and in 'Stuttgartisches Journal'. The machine is also mentioned by Leonhard Euler in 'Lettres à une Princesse d' Allemagne'. In 1755 Diviš asked the Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria to let him build more machines on several places for the welfare of the people. The emperor let the mathematicians in Vienna judge the proposal, but they refused it. Abbé Marci, court mathematician and Diviš' friend commented: 'Blasphemant, quae ignorant' (condemning what they do not know). In 1756 the machine was damaged by wind and then rebuilt, and then on 10 March 1760, angry villagers of Přímětice tore down the structure, blaming Diviš for drought which struck the region that year. Later in the year, after the summer during which the thunderstorms did a lot of damage to the fields and vineyards, the people besought him to rebuild the machine, which he did in the precinct of Loucky monastery, and built another one on the top of the church tower in Přímětice.\n\nIn the United States, the pointed lightning rod conductor, often incorrectly referred to as the \"lightning attractor,\" was invented by Benjamin Franklin as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity. Franklin thought that, with an iron rod sharpened to a point at the end,\n\n\"\"The electrical fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before it could come near enough to strike [...].\"\"\n\nFranklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment. This experiment, in fact, took place because he was tired of waiting for Christ Church in Philadelphia to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it. There was some resistance from churches who felt that it was defying divine will to install these rods. Franklin countered that there is no religious objection to roofs on buildings to resist precipitation, so lightning, which he proved to be simply a giant electrical spark, should be no different. As an act of philanthropy, Franklin decided against patenting the invention.\n\nIn the 19th century the lightning rod became a symbol of American ingenuity and a decorative motif. Lightning rods were often embellished with ornamental glass balls (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has also been incorporated into weather vanes. \n\nBalls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method thought to prevent lightning strikes to ships. It is worth noting here not because it worked, which it did not, but because it reveals a lot about pre-scientific thought. Glass objects do not conduct electricity well. They are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, there must be something about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.\n\nNikola Tesla's was an improvement in lightning protectors. The patent was granted due to a fault in Franklin's original theory of operation; the pointed lightning rod actually ionizes the air around itself. This makes the air conductive, which in turn raises the probability of a strike. Many years after receiving his patent, in 1919 Dr. Tesla wrote an article for The Electrical Experimenter entitled \"Famous Scientific Illusions\", in which he explains the logic of Franklin's pointed lightning rod and discloses his improved method and apparatus.\n", "id": "86924", "title": "Lightning rod"}

The county seat (capital city) is Bay Minette.\n\nBaldwin County was made on December 21, 1809 ten years before Alabama became a state. Before this, the county had been a part of the Mississippi Territory until 1817 when the area passed into the Alabama territory\n\nThe borders of the county has often changed, and many armies have invaded.\n\nIn the first days of Baldwin County, the town of McIntosh Bluff (now in Mobile County) on the Tombigbee River was the county seat. Then the county seat moved to the town of Blakeley in 1810, and then to the City of Daphne in 1868. In 1900, by an Act of the Legislature of Alabama said that the county seat should move to the City of Bay Minette. The City of Daphne was not happy about this move, because being the county seat meant more people visit the city and businesses can sell more. To move the county seat to Bay Minette, some men from Bay Minette pretended that there had been a murder. When the sheriff and his deputy left the City of Daphne to look for the murderer the men from Bay Minette went to the City of Daphne. These men got the records from the Baldwin County Courthouse and took them back to the City of Bay Minette. A New Deal mural in the Bay Minette post office is a painting of this story.\n\nBaldwin County is close to the Gulf of Mexico. This is why it often has tropical weather systems which often are Hurricanes. Weather dameage can sometimes be very bad, and sometimes the county is made a \"disaster area\". For example, in September 1979 due to damage from Hurricane Frederic, in July 1997 due to Hurricane Danny, in September 1998 from Hurricane Georges in September 2004 due to damage from Hurricane Ivan and again in August 2005 due to damage from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of . of it is land and is water.

In the 1930s, he became a French citizen. He is famous for his theories about modernism in architecture. His plans included the improvement of housing for people in large cities. This was because many people lived in poverty at that time. Many of his designs have been built across the world.\n\nHe also liked to paint and was skilled at designing furniture.\n\nLe Corbusier grew up in La Chaux-de-Fonds, a small town in the north of Switzerland. In 1907, aged 19, he moved to the French city of Paris. He travelled across Europe, and learned a lot of new ideas. He learned to speak German and worked with famous architects, such as Peter Behrens.\n\nDuring World War I, Le Corbusier went back to Switzerland and became a teacher. Soon, he opened his own architectural business with his cousin, and they worked together until 1940. It was in 1918 that he met a painter, Amédée Ozenfant, who would become a great friend. They combined their ideas to create a new type of art called Purism.\n\nAfter the war, Le Corbusier concentrated on his art until 1922. After this, he began designing apartments that could be stacked on top of each other, to house people and meet their needs. This type of low-density housing was to deal with the problem of over-crowding in Paris. He said this transformation was needed, or a revolution could occur from the unhappy lower classes. He created a design for an ideal city (Ville Contemporaine) that was never built. It was a plan developed around a lot of skycrapers. He presented this plan to the French government, who refused it. This did raise their awareness of overcrowding in the city though.\n\nLe Corbusier began to dislike capitalism, and said that people's house size should depend on the size of their family, and not by how rich they were.\n\nLe Corbusier was not active in politics from 1942. Instead, he built \"unités\", smaller housing blocks around France. This is illustrated in the design below.\n\nThe name, Le Corbusier, is French. It is a different version of his grandmother's surname, Lecorbésier. The name translates in to English as \"the crow like one\". He chose this name in 1920.\n\nHe considered speed in architecture by saying that house is a machine to live in. This machine's purpose is to speed up the activities of the people who live in it.\nHe introduced an idea of building residence with just some slabs, columns, and, stairs. These three things can produce any kind for residence and for any class of people.\n", "id": "87034", "title": "Le Corbusier"}

It is useful in mathematics. \n\nA permutation can be changed into another permutation by simply switching two or more of the objects. For example, the way four people can sit in a car is a permutation. If some of them chose different seats, it would be a different permutation.\n\nThe factorial has special application in defining the number of permutations in a set which does not include repetitions. The number n! is precisely the number of ways we can rearrange n things into a new order. For example, if we have three fruit: an orange, apple and pear, we can eat them in the order mentioned, or we can change them e.g. an apple, then a pear and finally an orange. The exact number of permutations is then formula_1. The number gets extremely large as the number of items (n) goes up.\n", "id": "87068", "title": "Permutation"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87077", "text": "Group theory\n\nIn mathematics and abstract algebra, group theory studies a type of algebraic structure called a group. Group theory is often used in mathematics as a starting point for the study of many algebraic structures, and of addition and multiplication of numbers. Because group theory is also useful for studying symmetry in nature and abstract systems, it has many applications in physics and chemistry.\n\nA group is a set (collection) \"G\" whose members are called \"elements\". The elements can be numbers of some kind, or other abstract objects. The elements can even be material objects. There is also a \"binary operation\" which combines any two elements of \"G\" and results in another element of \"G\". This new element may be different from either of the original two, but it does not have to be. It only has to be an element of \"G\". To be a group, the following four conditions must be true of \"G\" and the operation defined over \"G\":\n\n\nAn important fact about groups is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements typically gives a different result. This means that we have many cases with \"a\" • \"b\" ≠ \"b\" • \"a\".\n\nHowever, if the order of a and b actually does not matter (for \"any\" a and b, we \"always\" have \"a\" • \"b\" = \"b\" • \"a\"), then the group is called an abelian group.\n\nA simple example of a group is the set of integers (called Z) with the addition operator +. This group is called \"G\" = (Z, +). Each required condition is true of \"G\", so \"G\" is a group. If we replace • with the + sign, then we can easily check these conditions:\n\nThe addition operator is also commutative: The order of \"a\" and \"b\" does not matter. For any two integers \"a\" and \"b\" in G, \"a\" + \"b\" = \"b\" + \"a\". For example, 7+3 is the same as 3+7. Thus, \"G\" is also an abelian group.\n\nCommutative operators are common in our daily lives. For example, 7 · 3 also is the same as 3 · 7. However, not all operators are commutative. For example, 7÷3 is different from 3÷7 (and neither of these results is an integer). And in particular, 7 is different from 3. Therefore, not all combinations of number sets and mathematical operations can form an abelian group, or even a group at all.\n", "id": "87077", "title": "Group theory"}

For example: C and E sound well together, or the chord C, E and G (a C major chord).\n\nA dissonant interval or chord is one which sounds unstable. It may even sound harsh by itself. The notes seem to clash. It cannot be the end of the piece of music (if the music is a normal, traditional tonal piece). It sounds as if it wants to move on to a consonant interval (this is called \"resolving\" onto a consonant chord). The notes C and Fsharp together make a dissonant interval. The chord C - Dsharp - Fsharp is a dissonant interval: it is full of tension, and it sounds as if it wants to \"resolve\" onto C - E - G.\n\nScientifically a consonant interval is one in which the two notes vibrate at frequencies which have a simple mathematical relationship, e.g. in two notes which are an octave apart the higher note vibrates exactly twice as fast. If they are a fifth apart the top note vibrates 1 1/2 times as fast as the lower note.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87185", "text": "Politics of Germany\n\nThe politics of Germany are based on a federal parliamentary democratic republic. The government is elected by the people in elections where everyone has an equal vote. The constitution is called the \"Grundgesetz\". As well as setting out the rights of the people, it describes the jobs of the President, the Cabinet, the Bundestag, Bundesrat and the Courts.\n\nThe President is the head of state. The Federal Chancellor is the head of government, and of the majority group in the legislature (law making body) which is called the Bundestag. Executive power is exercised by the government. The power to make federal law is given to the government and the two parts of parliament, the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The ministers of the government are members of the parliament, and need parliamentary support to stay in power.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1990, the main political parties were the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), with its \"sister party\", the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU). After the reunification of Germany the Green Party and Alliance '90(Bündnis 90/Die Grünen) became more important and was in government between 1999 and 2005. Other important political parties after reunification have been the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism) which was based on East Germany's Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It joined with The Left Party (Die Linkspartei) of western Germany. In 2007 Die Linke and WASG joined together under the leadership of Oskar Lafontaine\n\nAs Germany is a federal country, a lot of the work of government is done by the 16 states (\"Länder\"). Power is shared between the national (or federal) government and state governments. The national government cannot abolish the state governments.\n\nThe political system is set out in the 1949 constitution, the \"Grundgesetz\" (Basic Law), which stayed in effect after 1990's German reunification.\n\nThe constitution puts freedom and human rights first. It also splits powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative (law-making), executive (government), and judicial (courts) branches. The 1949 \"Grundgesetz\" was written to correct the problems with the Weimar Republic's constitution. The Weimar Republic collapsed in 1933 and was replaced by the dictatorship of the Third Reich.\n\nThe courts of Germany are independent of the government and the lawmakers. Senior judges are appointed by the Bundestag for a fixed term.\n\nThe \"Bundeskanzler\" (Federal Chancellor) heads the \"Bundesregierung\" (Federal Cabinet) and thus the executive branch of the federal government. He or she is chosen by and must report to the \"Bundestag\", Germany's parliament. Germany, like the United Kingdom, can thus be said to have a parliamentary system.\n\nThe Chancellor cannot be removed from office during a 4-year term unless the \"Bundestag\" has agreed on a successor. This Constructive Vote of No Confidence () is stop what happened in the Weimar Republic. There the government did not have a lot of support in the parliament. The small parties often joined together to vote against the government, but could never stay together and choose a new government.\n\nExcept in the periods 1969-72 and 1976-82, when the social democratic party of Chancellor Brandt and Schmidt came in second in the elections, the Chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party. Usually the largest party is helped by one or smaller more parties to get a majority in the parliament. Between 1969-72 and 1976-82 the smaller parties decided not to help the largest party, but the second biggest party instead.\n\nThe Chancellor appoints a Vice-Chancellor (Vizekanzler), who is a member of his cabinet, usually the Foreign Minister. When there is a coalition government (which has, so far, always been the case, except for the period of 1957 to 1961), the Vice-Chancellor usually belongs to the smaller party of the coalition.\n\nThe Chancellor is responsible for policy guidelines. This means he, or she, sets the broad ideas of what the government will do. To help carry out these ideas the Chancellor can change the make-up of the federal ministries whenever they want. For example, in the middle of January 2001, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture was renamed to Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture. This was to help fight the \"Mad Cow Disease\" BSE problem. At the same time some of the jobs (\"competences\") of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Health were moved to the new Ministry of Consumer Protection.\n\nReporting to the cabinet is the Civil service of Germany.\n\nThe duties of the \"Bundespräsident\" (Federal President) are mostly representative and ceremonial; The power of the executive is exercised by the Chancellor.\n\nThe President is elected every 5 years on May 23 by the Federal Assembly (\"Bundesversammlung\"). The Bundesversammlung only meets to elect the President. Its members are the entire \"Bundestag\" and an equal number of state delegates selected especially for this purpose in proportion to election results for the state parliaments.\nIn May 2004, Horst Köhler of the CDU was elected. The reason that the President is not directly elected by the people is to stop him from claiming to be more powerful than the government and the constitution, which happened in the Weimar Republic.\n\nGermany has a bicameral legislature, that means that the parliament has two houses. The \"Bundestag\" (Federal Diet) has at least 598 members, elected for a four-year term. Half of the members (299) are elected in single-seat constituencies according to first-past-the-post. The other 299 members are chosen from statewide party lists.\n\nThe total percentage of constituency members and regional list members a party has should equal the percentage of votes that a party gets. This is called proportional representation.\n\nBecause Voters vote once for a constituency representative, and a second time for a party Germany is said to have mixed member proportional representation.\n\nSometimes a party already has more constituency seats in a \"land\" (state) than it should have to keep the percentage of votes and seats equal. The party does not lose seats. Instead it gets no land seats. This means that the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members. In the current parliament there are 16 overhang seats, giving a total of 614.\n\nA party must get 5% of the national vote or win at least three constituency seats to be represented in the \"Bundestag\". This rule, often called the \"five percent hurdle\", was made to stop lots of small parties being in the Bundestag. Small parties were blamed for the problems of the Weimar Republic's Reichstag.\n\nThe first \"Bundestag\" elections were held in the Federal Republic of Germany (\"West Germany\") on August 14, 1949. Following reunification, elections for the first all-German \"Bundestag\" were held on December 2 1990. The last election was held on September 18 2005, the 16th Bundestag met on October 18 2005.\n\nThe \"Bundesrat\" (Federal Council) is the representation of the state governments at the federal level. The Bundesrat has 69 members who are delegates of the 16 \"Bundesländer\". Usually the 16 Ministers President are members, but they do not have to be. The \"Länder\" each have from three to six votes in the \"Bundesrat\", depending on population. \"Bundesrat\" members must vote as their state government tell them.\n\nThe legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction (it can make laws by itself) and concurrent jurisdiction with the \"Länder\" (the länder can also make laws). What laws and what type of laws are set out in the Basic Law.\n\nThe \"Bundestag\" does most law making.\n\nThe \"Bundesrat\" must concur (agree) to laws about money shared by the federal and state governments and those making more work for the states. Often this means that the \"Bundesrat\" often needs to agree to a law, because federal laws are often carried out by state or local agencies.\n\nSince the political make-up of the \"Bundesrat\" is often different from that of the \"Bundestag\", the Bundesrat is often the place for opposition parties to put their point of view, rather than for the states to look after their interests, as the constitution intended.\n\nTo limit, members of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat form a Vermittlungsauschuss which is a joint committee to try to reach agreement when the two chambers can not agree on a certain piece of legislation.\n\n\"More info: 16th German federal election, 2005\"\nThe Federal Council is composed by representatives of the State governments.\nGermany has had a court system that was free of government control for longer than it has had democracy.\n\nThis means that the courts have traditionally been strong, and almost all state actions are subject to judicial review (being looked at by the court).\n\nThere is the \"ordinary\" courts system that handles civil and criminal cases\n\nThis has four levels\n\nThere is also a system of specialist courts, that deall with certain areas of the law. These generally have a state court and state appeals court before coming to the federal supreme court for that area of law. The other federal supreme courts are\n\nUnlike the United States, all courts are state courts, except for the top level supreme courts.\n\nGermany also has another supreme court, the Bundesverfassungsgericht Federal Constitutional Court. The \"Grundgesetz\" says that every person may complain to the Federal Constitutional Court when his or her constitutional rights, especially the human rights, have been violated by the government or one of its agencies, and after he or she has gone through the ordinary court system.\n\nThe Bundesverfassungsgericht hears complaints about laws passed by the legislative branch, court decisions, or acts of the administration.\n\nUsually only a small percentage of these constitutional complaints, called \"(Verfassungsbeschwerden)\" are successful. Evenso, the Court is often angers both the government and the law-makers. The judges even say that they do not care about the reactions of the government, the Bundestag, or public opinion or about the cost of one of the court's decisions. All that matters is the constitution.\n\nThe Bundesverfassungsgericht is very high popular with ordinary people, because it protects them from government wrongdoing.\n\nOnly the Constitutional Court can handle some types of cases, including arguments between government bodies about their constitutional powers.\n\nOnly the Constitutional Court has the power to ban political parties for being unconstitutional. However so far the Constitutional court has only used this power twice, outlawing the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) and the SRP (Socialist Reich Party, a successor to the NSDAP) because both parties ideas went against the constitution.\n\nIn the 1998 election the SPD said they wanted to reduce high unemployment rates and said new people were needed in government after 16 years of Helmut Kohl's government.\n\nGerhard Schröder said he was a centrist \"Third Way\" candidate like Britain's Tony Blair and America's Bill Clinton.\n\nThe CDU/CSU said people should look at how well off they were because of Kohl's government, and that the CDU/CSU had experience in foreign policy.\n\nBut the Kohl government was hurt at the polls by slower growth in the east in the previous two years, which meant the gap between east and west widened as the west got richer and the east did not.\n\nThe final seat count was enough to allow a \"red-green\" coalition of the SPD with Alliance '90/The Greens (\"Bündnis '90/Die Grünen\"), bringing the Greens into a national government for the first time.\n\nThe first months of the new government had policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the SPD, and some voters got fed up. The first state election after the federal election was held in Hesse in February 1999. The CDU increased its vote by 3.5%. The CDU became the largest party, and replaced a SPD/Green coalition with a CDU/FDP coalition. The result was seen in part as a referendum on the federal government's ideas for a new citizenship law, which would have made it easier for long-time foreign residents to become German citizens, and also to keep their original citizenship as well.\n\nIn March 1999, SPD chairman and Minister of Finance Oskar Lafontaine, who represented a more traditional social democratic position, resigned from all offices after losing a party-internal power struggle against Schröder.\n\nIn state elections in 2000 and 2001, the respective SPD- or CDU-led coalition governments were re-elected into power.\n\nThe next election for the \"Bundestag\" was September 22 2002. Gerhard Schröder led the coalition of SPD and Greens to an 11-seat victory over the CDU/CSU headed by Edmund Stoiber (CSU). Two factors are generally cited that enabled Schröder to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before: good handling of the 2002 European floods and firm opposition to the USA's 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe coalition treaty for the second red-green coalition was signed October 16, 2002. There were a lot of new ministers.\n\nIn February 2003, elections took place in the states of Hesse and Lower Saxony, were won by the conservatives. In Hesse, the CDU minister president Roland Koch was re-elected, with his party CDU gaining enough seats to govern without the former coalition partner FDP.\n\nIn Lower Saxony, the former SPD minister president Sigmar Gabriel lost the elections, leading to an CDU/FDP-government headed by new minister president Christian Wulff (CDU).\nThe protest against the Iraq war changed this situation a bit, favouring SPD and Greens.\n\nThe latest election in the state of Bavaria led to a landslide victory of the conservatives, gaining not just the majority (as usual), but two thirds of parliamentary seats.\n\nIn April 2003, chancellor Schröder announced massive labour market reforms, called Agenda 2010. This included a shakeup of the system of German job offices (Arbeitsamt), cuts in unemployment benefits and subsidies for unemployed persons who start their own businesses. These changes are commonly known by the name of the chairman of the commission which conceived them as Hartz I - Hartz IV. Although these reforms have sparked massive protests they are now credited with being in part responsible for the economic upswing and the fall of unemployment figures in Germany in the years 2006/7.\n\nThe European elections on June 13, 2004 brought a staggering defeat for the Social Democrats, who polled only slightly more than 21%, the lowest election result for the SPD in a nationwide election since the Second World War. Liberals, Greens, conservatives and the far left were the winners of the European election in Germany, because voters were disillusioned by high unemployment and cuts in social security, while the governing SPD party seems to be concerned with quarrels between its members and gave no clear direction. Many observers believe that this election marked the beginning of the end of the Schröder government.\n\nIn September 2004, elections were held in the states of Saarland, Brandenburg and Saxony. In the Saarland, the governing CDU was able to remain in power and gained one additional seat in the parliament and the SPD lost seven seats, while the Liberals and Greens re-entered the state parliament. The far-right National Democratic Party, which had never got more than 1 or 2% of the vote, received about 4%, although it failed to earn a seat in the state parliament (a party must obtain at least 5% of the vote to achieve state parliamentary representation).\n\nTwo weeks later, elections were held in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony: once again, overall, the ruling parties lost votes and although they remained in power, the right to far-right parties made the big leaps. In Brandenburg, the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) re-entered the state parliament after winning 6.1% of the vote. In Saxony, the NPD entered a non-competition agreement with the DVU and obtained 9.2% of the vote, thus winning seats in the state parliament. Due to their losses at the ballots, the ruling CDU of Saxony was forced to form a coalition with the SPD. The rise of the right to far-right worries the ruling political parties.\n\nOn May 22, 2005 as predicted the SPD was defeated in its former heartland, North Rhine-Westphalia. Half an hour after the election results, the SPD chairman Franz Müntefering announced that the chancellor would clear the way for premature federal elections by deliberately losing a vote of confidence.\n\nThis took everyone by surprise, especially because the SPD was below 25% in polls at the time. On the following Monday the CDU announced Angela Merkel as conservative candidate for chancellorship.\n\nWhereas in May and June 2005 victory of the conservatives seemed highly likely, with some polls giving them an absolute majority, this changed shortly before the election at September 18, 2005, especially after the conservatives introduced Paul Kirchhof as potential minister of the treasury, and after a TV duel between Merkel and Schröder where many considered Schröder to have performed better.\n\nNew for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed Electoral Alternative for Labour and Social Justice (WASG) and the PDS, planning to join into a common party (see Left Party.PDS). With the former SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine for the WASG and Gregor Gysi for the PDS as prominent figures, this alliance soon found interest in the media and in the population. Polls in July saw them as high as 12%.\n\nAfter success in the state election for Saxony, the alliance between the far right parties National Democratic Party and Deutsche Volksunion (DVU), which planed to leapfrog the \"five-percent hurdle\" on a common party ticket was another media issue.\n\nThe election results of September 18, 2005 were surprising. They were very different from the polls of the previous weeks. The conservatives lost votes compared to 2002, reaching only 35%, and failed to get a majority for a \"black-yellow\" government of CDU/CSU and liberal FDP. The FDP polled a 10% of the votes, one of their best results ever. But the red-green coalition also failed to get a majority, with the SPD losing votes, but polling 34% and the greens staying at 8%. The left party alliance reached 8.7% and entered the German Parliament, whereas the NPD only got 1.6%.\n\nThe most likely outcome of coalition talks was a so-called \"grand coalition\" between the conservatives (CDU/CSU) and the social democrats (SPD), with the three smaller parties (liberals, greens and the left) in the opposition. Other possible coalitions include a \"traffic light coalition\" between SPD, FDP and Greens and a \"Jamaica coalition\" between CDU/CSU, FDP and Greens. Coalitions involving the Left Party were ruled out by all parties (including the Left Party itself), although the combination of one of the major parties and any two small parties would mathematically have a majority. Of these combinations, only a red-red-green coalition is politically even imaginable. Both Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel announced that they had won the election and should become next chancellor.\n\nOn October 10, talks were held between Franz Müntefering, the SPD chairman, Gerhard Schröder, Angela Merkel and Edmund Stoiber, the CSU chairman. In the afternoon it was announced that the CDU/CSU and SPD would begin formal coalition negotiations with the aim of a Grand Coalition with Angela Merkel as the next German chancellor.\n\nAngela Merkel is the first woman, the first East German and the first scientist to be chancellor as well as the youngest German chancellor ever. On November 22 2005 Angela Merkel was sworn in by president Horst Köhler for the office of Bundeskanzlerin.\n\n\n", "id": "87185", "title": "Politics of Germany"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87186", "text": "Musical notation\n\nMusic notation or musical notation is a way of writing down music so that anyone can play it. Many systems have been used in the past to write music. Today most musicians in the Western world write musical notes on a stave: five parallel lines with four spaces in between them. However, there are many others, some of which are in use today in different cultures.\n\nWriting music down makes it possible for a composer who makes up (compofishes) a piece of music to let other people know how the music is supposed to sound. That music can then be played or sung by anybody who can “read music”. If music is not written down, then people can only learn other people’s music by listening to it and trying to copy it. This is how folk music was traditionally learned.\n\nThe earliest kind of musical notation was written on tablets using a way of writing called cuneiform. Music from Nippur from about 2000 B.C. has been found which seems to give an approximate idea of how the music should be played. A tablet from 1250 B.C. has musical notation which shows the names of the strings of a lyre. They are the earliest records we have of written music.\n\nMusical notation from Ancient Greece showed the notes in more detail than the earlier cuneiform. It shows the pitch (how high or low the note is) and how long it lasts. It sometimes give an idea of the harmony. It was used from at least the 6th century BC until about the 4th century AD.\nWhen music started to be written down in Europe it was music for the Roman Catholic church. The monks who wrote it down used a system of dots and strokes called neumes. They gave an idea of how high or low the notes were, but did not show the length of the notes. They may have been used by people who knew the music already and just needed a reminder of when to go up and down.\n\nPeople gradually realized that it was necessary to find a system which showed the exact pitch of the note. The first stave was just one single horizontal line. Gradually this increased to four lines. Guido d’Arezzo, an Italian Benedictine monk who lived in the 11th century developed this system which soon led to the way of writing music that we know. By the 16th century everybody was using the 5 line stave. A system of bars (measures) was used everywhere by the end of the 17th century. At first the bar lines where there to show which notes should be played or sung together. Gradually the system we know today was developed in which each bar lasted the same length of time, and has a particular number of beats (counts) for each bar. By the end of the 17th century this was used by most musicians in European classical music.\n\nToday we use a five-line staff. The pitch (high or low) is shown by where the note is put on the staff. There may also be sharps or flats in front of some of the notes. The music is read from left to right.\n\nA staff of written music usually has a clef in front. This shows exactly which notes are to be played. Notes which are very high or low can be put on extra lines called ledger lines above or below the stave.\n\nAfter the clef there is usually a key signature which shows the key of the piece: it shows which sharps or flats are to be used regularly.\n\nAfter the key signature is the time signature. Bars (measures) divide the piece into regular groupings of beats, and the time signatures show these groupings.\n\nAbove the music there is usually a word, or words, to show the tempo (speed) At various places in the music there will be dynamic marks to show how loud or soft to play.\n\nFor vocal music, words are written underneath the notes.\n\nWhen music is played by a large group of instruments such as an orchestra the music is written in a \"score\". This shows the music played by all the instruments, so there are many staves written underneath one another. The conductor will need to have a score, but the players will play from a “part” which has just the notes that they play. All the parts needed for a piece of music is called a “set of parts”. \n\nInstruments such as guitars often play from a chord chart or just the names of the chords (C7, Em etc.) written underneath the music or under the words of a song.\n\nA system called tonic sol-fa was used by amateur musicians a century ago. This showed the names of the notes of a scale (doh, ray, me etc.).\n\nLute music in the Renaissance and Baroque periods used to be written in a system called tabulature. Some 20th century composers have also used tabulature.\n\nSome modern composers such as John Cage have written music by making drawings called graphic notation.\n\nMusic can also be written in Braille for blind musicians.\n\nToday computers are often used for making music. This has led to other forms of music notation which are used in different systems of software. The MIDI file format, stores information about the pitch, duration, speed, volume etc. of notes and can be used to control a MIDI instrument.\n\nThere are other systems in use today for some non-Western music.\n\n", "id": "87186", "title": "Musical notation"}

They can do this by studying music scores, or by looking for historical documents which tell us about musicians from the past.

Stefanie has sold over 10 million copies in Asia. After her release of her tenth album, she is said to be the most popular Mandarin female singer in Asia and the most successful singer from Singapore.\n\nStefanie Sun has an elder sister Sng Yee Kia and a younger sister Sng EeMei.\n\nStefanie wen to school at Saint Margaret's Secondary School, Raffles Girls' School and went on to attend Saint Andrew's Junior College. She later attended Nanyang Technological University, where she got a degree in Marketing. Her abilities were discovered by her music teacher at his music school.\n\nAmong Mandarin-speakers, Stefanie is known by her Mandarin name, Sun Yan Zi. She speaks the Teochew dialect, and in Teochew her name is pronounced as \"Sng Ee Tze,\" which is her official name. Most of her songs are sung in Mandarin, with several in English. Stefanie's ability to speak many dialects is shown in the songs she sings. \n\nIn the song \"Cloudy Day\" (called 天黑黑 in Chinese), she sings in both Mandarin and Min Nan (Taiwanese). \"Cloudy Day\" is an adaptation of a traditional Taiwanese folk song.\n\nHer album START! contains 6 songs in English: \"Venus\", \"That I Will Be Good\", \"Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough\", \"Silent All These Years\", and \"Hey Jude\"; and a song she wrote called \"Someone\".\n\nStefanie does most of her recording and performing in Taiwan, where most of her fans are. She also visits China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, where many of her fans are.\n\nHer first music album was released in June 2000, the self-titled YanZi, published by Warner Music. The album sold over 330,000 copies in Taiwan. Her next album, which was released in December of the same year was titled My Desired Happiness or 我要的幸福 in Chinese. My Desired Happiness sold over 380,000 copies in Taiwan. Both albums achieved great success – each album sold over 1,000,000 copies in mainland China.\n\nHer third album was released in early 2001, titled Kite, which sold successfully with 300,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 950,000 in China.\n\nIn January 2002 she released START, which was titled 自選集 in China. START was a collection of songs and cover versions. START! sold over 250,000 copies in Taiwan alone in less than a month and overall 1,000,000 copies sold in mainland China.\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Stefanie sang the official theme songs for Singapore's National Day Parade: We Will Get There (一起走到 in Chinese) and One United People (全心全意 in Chinese). One United People was included on the album Leave.\n\nIn early 2003, she released the album To Be Continued… which like her previous releases, was a success. It sold more than 250,000 copies in Taiwan and more than 1,000,000 in China. Only a few months later, she released her seventh album with six new songs mixed with fifteen of her old songs. By the end of 2003, Stefanie had sold over 7,000,000 copies in Asia with just seven albums.\n\nIn late 2003, she decided to take a one-year break from making music, because she wanted to find again her direction in her career. She returned in late 2004 with a new album titled Stefanie, which was meant to reflect her debut album (self-titled as well, but in Chinese). This was to symbolise her return with a fresh attitude. This album sold more than 2,300,000 copies in Asia; making it her most successful album. She also started her own company called Make Music.\n\nA Perfect Day was released on 2005, almost one year later. Reviews of this new album were mixed, but Stefanie said that all she wanted was to make quality music, instead of releases that sell well but have a lower level of artistic quality. This album was not her highest-selling, but it had still managed to sell over 1,000,000 copies in Asia.\nIn 2006, Stefanie had 4 full-house concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum. The performances were praised by the media as well as fans. Stefanie also returned to Singapore in a much-anticipated homecoming concert. However, at The Golden Melody Awards 2006 in Taiwan, while performing songs that were meant to be for male singers, she went off-key, due to having not enough sleep, jet lag, and not having enough time to practice. The media said she had shattered her image of a pop diva with great singing skills. Though she had been heavily criticized by the media, many think that she did not perform as bad, instead the media had over-emphasized on her singing that night.\n\nStefanie’s first album under the Capitol brand is entitled Against the Light or 逆光 in Chinese. It was released on 22 March 2007. Her decision to leave Warner after 9 albums was partly due to music executive Sam Chen, who now works at EMI. He had collaborated with Stefanie on 8 of her 9 albums.\n\nOn 26 February 2007, Stefanie returned from Cairo where she and her team were extorted by suspected local gangsters. Stefanie was in Egypt to shoot a PV for her new album. Two men disguised as government officials followed her and the crew and asked for money and even showing a handgun. The crew tried calling the police but the police didn’t believe them. The crew had to hand over a total of over 200,000 yuan in order to continue shooting.\n\nStefanie’s tenth album Against the Light, has been a major success in Asia. In Taiwan, it sold over 60,000 copies in the first 3 days it was released. In addition, over 500,000 copies were sold within a week in China.

He composes most of the songs in his albums. From his debut in 2003, he has produced several “hit” albums. For example, his album named No.89757, published in 2005, which mainly talked about the love between a robot and a girl a thousand years from now, sold more than 1,500,000 copies in just three months. His next album, known as Cao Cao, did even better. This album sold around 2,000,000 copies in just two weeks, a miracle in the Chinese Music Industry. Whenever JJ Lin publishes an album, it almost always becomes a hit. JJ’s songs can be heard throughout China and Taiwan in various TV programs, singing competitions, and radio channels. JJ Lin not only writes songs for himself but also for other famous celebrities, notably Ji De (Remember) for Taiwanese pop diva A-Mei and Fang Shou for his fellow label mate A-Do.\n\nJJ Lin’s undeniable talent in composing has earned him numerous awards every year. For instance, in 2004, he won the “Best New Artist” award in 15th Taiwan Golden Melody Awards. In the same year, he also won “Best New Act” in Singapore Hit Awards. In 2006 Beijing Music Awards, with his popular album Cao Cao, he swept several big awards including Most Popular Male Artist, Top Twenty Golden Melody, Best Album, Best Producer, and “True Hero” Award.\nIn 2011, with his latest album She Says, JJ Lin has earned himself Best Mandarin Male Singer Award in 22nd Golden Melody Awards.\n\n", "id": "87233", "title": "JJ Lin"}

Li Yin has been nicknamed the \"Chinese BoA\". She speaks both Mandarin and Korean, and has released music in both Korea and China. She also speaks English but has not yet released any records fully in English.\n\nLi Yin was born on 18 February 1989 in Sichuan, China. She grew up in a musical family, as both of her parents were professional violinists. As a child, her parents took her to their rock concerts and exposed her to a variety of music. At three years old, she began to learn the violin. Li Yin liked classical, American and European music so much that she says she never sang children's songs when she was a child.\nAs she grew older, Li Yin became more into pop music than rock music. She had to secretly listen to pop music because her parents were against it. When she was twelve, she went to a middle school founded by the Sichuan Music College after scoring the highest with her violin-playing, but she chose to become a singer instead. She was selected as one of the top-ten teenage singers in a national singing competition in Beijing. Eventually, her parents began to support her dream to become a singer.\n\nLi Yin was discovered by SM Entertainment. She started training in 2003 at the age of 13 and for 3 years, she special singing and dance training under SM Entertainment. While doing so, she discovered her R&B talent.\n\nLi Yin's debut was greatly anticipated not only in Korea, but the whole of Asia because of the promotion of her being \"The Next BoA\" and \"The Chinese BoA.\" Before her official debut, it was already known that her song was a duet with popular TVXQ-member Xiah Junsu, which caused even more excitement and anticipation among the general public.\n\nOn 8 September 2006, Li Yin released her first single, \"Timeless\" . On the first day of release, she ranked #2 on the online charts of SBS Inkigayo. The song was placed #1 on Daum's Music Video chart as well as hitting the highest search number on the famous Korean search engine Naver . The PV was ranked #1 on Melon's Video Chart for 30 days .\n\nIn early 2007, Li Yin promoted the second track of her debut single called \"Y (Why...)\", which is a power ballad. SM Entertainment also released a \"Timeless\" documentary version of her \"Y (Why...)\" PV. It featured her hardships while training, as well as many behind-the-scenes clips of her promotion of \"Timeless\", including never-before-seen footage of her and Xiah Junsu.\n\nShe also performed with boy-band TVXQ at their second Korean concert in Seoul, South Korea on 23 February 2007. She sang BoA's part in the song \"Try-Angle\", previously performed by BoA, TVXQ and The TRAX.\n\nShe also performed \"Timeless\" with Xiah Junsu at the Hallyu Expo in Korea on 8 March 2007. In July, along with Kangta, TVXQ, The Grace and Super Junior, she performed in Korea for the SMTown Summer Concert 2007.\n\nAfter a long year of absence without releasing any records, Zhang Li Yin announced during an interview early December 2007 that her long-awaited debut album will be released in February 2008 . The album is titled \"星愿 - I WILL\" (lit. \"Star Wish: I Will\" ). It has been released in Korea, China, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia.\n", "id": "87243", "title": "Zhang Li Yin"}

The Nyingma school is made up of several different lines that start with Padmasambhava, the legendary founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The word \"Nyingma\" means \"ancient\". Nyingma followers see themselves as holding the oldest teachings of Vajrayana. Some of these teachings can be found in the local Bön religion of Tibet.\n\nNotable modern Nyingma teachers include Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche (c. 1904–1987), Sogyal Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Khenpo Choga Rinpoche, filmmaker Khyentse Norbu (also known as Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche), and Penor Rinpoche.\n", "id": "87249", "title": "Nyingma"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87265", "text": "433 Eros\n\n433 Eros is the first Near-Earth asteroid (NEA) that was found. It was named after the Greek god of love, Eros (Greek Ἔρως). It is an S-type asteroid about 13 × 13 × 33 km in size, the second-biggest near-Earth asteroid (NEA) after 1036 Ganymed. It belongs to the Amors. It is the first asteroid that was known to cross inside the orbit of Mars. Eros is one of the few NEAs bigger than 10 km across. It is thought to be bigger than the asteroid that made the Chicxulub crater in the Yucatán and probably caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nOn January 31, 2012, Eros passed close to Earth at 0.1787 astronomical units (16.6 million miles). This is about 700 times farther from the Earth than the moon is. It had brightness of +8.1 visual magnitude. \n\nDuring rare oppositions, every 81 years, such as in 1975 and 2056, Eros will be directly away from the sun, as seen from Earth. Then, Eros can reach a magnitude of +7.1, which is brighter than Neptune and brighter than any main belt asteroid except 4 Vesta (and sometimes 2 Pallas and 7 Iris). At opposition, the asteroid actually appears to stop in place when compared to stars in the sky. Unlike most objects in the solar system, it never appears to be retrograde (back-track across the sky). \n\nEros was visited by the NEAR Shoemaker probe, which orbited it, taking many pictures of its surface. On February 12, 2001, at the end of its mission, NEAR landed on the asteroid's surface using its maneuvering jets.\n\nObjects in an orbit like Eros can exist for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is changed by the effects of gravity. Simulations suggest that Eros may evolve into an Earth-crosser within 2 million years (Michel et al., 1996).\n\nThe adjectival form which is not used a lot of the name Eros is \"Erotian\".\n\nSurface gravity depends on the distance from a spot on the surface to the center of a body's mass. The Erotian surface gravity changes a lot, since Eros is not a sphere but a stretched peanut-shaped (or potato- or shoe-shaped) object. The daytime temperature on Eros stays at about 100 °C and nighttime measurements at −150 °C. Eros's density is 2,400 kg/m, about the same as the density of Earth's crust. Its day lasts 5.27 hours.\n\nNEAR scientists have found that most of the bigger rocks scattered across Eros were blown from a single crater in a meteorite collision approximately 1 billion years ago. This impact may also be the reason why nearly half of the Erotian surface doesn't have small craters. It was first thought that the debris thrown up by the collision filled in the smaller craters (those less than half a kilometer across). A study of crater on the surface shows that the areas with the fewest craters are within 9 kilometers of the impact point. This includes the opposite side of the asteroid but still within 9 kilometers.\n\nEros was found on the same night (13 August 1898) by Gustav Witt in Berlin and Auguste Charlois at Nice. Witt was taking a 2-hour exposure of beta Aquarius to get astrometric positions of asteroid 185 Eunike.\n\nIn 1975, Eros became the first asteroid to be detected by radar.\n\nEros was one of the first asteroids to be visited by a spacecraft, and the first to be orbited and soft-landed on. NASA spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker entered orbit around Eros in 2000, and came to rest on its surface in 2001.\n\n", "id": "87265", "title": "433 Eros"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87272", "text": "Thelema\n\nThelema is the English spelling of the Greek noun : \"will\", from the verb \"θέλω\": to will, wish, purpose. Early Christian writings use the word to refer to the will of God, the human will, and even the will of God's opponent, the Devil.\n\nThelema is also a way of life first written about by François Rabelais (16th century) in his famous books of fiction, Gargantua and Pantagruel. The core of this way of life was summed up in the phrase \"\"Do what thou wilt\"\" (\"fay çe que vouldras\" in the original old French). This idea was later put into practice in the mid 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood at Medmenham. \n\nThis Thelemic Law of Rabelais was revived by Aleister Crowley in 1904 when Crowley wrote \"The Book of the Law\". This book contains both the word \"Thelema\" in Greek as well as the phrase \"Do what thou wilt.\" From this, Crowley took Thelema as the name of his own religion. Thus Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote that Rabelais, Dashwood, and Crowley must share the honor of perpetuating Thelema.\n\nThe core of Thelemic thought is \"Do what thou wilt.\" However, people understand and apply this in different ways. For example, some people accept Crowley as a prophet. Other people regard Crowley's system to be only one form of Thelema. Crowley himself shared this view:\n\nMany followers of Thelema learn and use other systems of spiritual thought, blending them according to their own will with Thelema. Most borrow freely from other traditions. For example, Nu and Had are thought to be the same as or similar to the Tao and Teh of Taoism, Shakti and Shiva of the Hindu Tantras, Shunyata and Bodhicitta of Buddhism, Ain Soph and Kether in the Qabalah. Like Crowley, other followers of Thelema make free use of the methods and practices of other traditions, including alchemy, astrology, qabalah, tantra, tarot, and yoga, according to their own wills.\n\nSome groups say that they are true to Crowley's system (such as A∴A∴ and Ordo Templi Orientis). Some groups build upon his teachings, expanding upon and extending them. For example, the Fraternitas Saturni (Brotherhood of Saturn), founded in 1928 in Germany, accepts the Law of Thelema, but extends it with the phrase \"Mitleidlose Liebe!\" (\"Compassionless love!\"). The Thelema Society, also located in Germany, accepts Liber Legis and much of Crowley's work on magick, while also including the ideas of other thinkers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles S. Peirce, Martin Heidegger, and Niklas Luhmann. In America, the writings of Maggie Ingalls (Nema) have started a movement called Maat Magick, along with a group called the Horus-Maat Lodge, founded in 1979. This movement combines elements of Thelema with Nema's system based on the Egyptian goddess Ma'at. She wrote her own holy book titled \"Liber Pennae Praenumbra.\" The HML aims to combine the current Aeon of Horus with the future Aeon of Ma'at in which mankind will achieve balance.\n\nMost of Thelemic writing was written by Aleister Crowley. He wrote many books. Many of them were on the subject of Thelema. During his time, there were a few other people who wrote on the subject, including Charles Stansfeld Jones and J.F.C. Fuller. Since his death in 1947 only a few new writers have written on the subject, such as:\n\nThelema has been attracting more attention in recent years from scholars of religion, especially those interested in new religious movements, contemporary Gnosticisms and Hermeticisms. References at the end of this article supply a few such sources. Perhaps the most unusual attempt was made by bishop Federico Tolli, in his German book \"Thelema – Im Spannungsfeld zwischen Christentum, Logentradition und New Aeon\" For Tolli, Thelema is to be regarded as the dialectical consequence of Christianity. Christianity for Tolli exists as a community in Christ, whereas Tolli sees Thelema as a necessarily individualistic response to the world. \n\nTaken from a 1938 theological dictionary (to the New Testament), the concept of 'salvation history' \"(Heilsgeschichte)\" has a great effect on Tolli's thought, and it is in this context that he discusses Crowleyan Thelema. Tolli regards Crowley's \"Heilsgeschichte\" as one in which the whole Universe (ergo the Will of God) is to combine (analogous to the Alchemical formula 'coagula'). \"Love\", in the form of combinatory attraction (\"Love is the law, love under will\"), is a universal principle – therefore akin to the concept of Natural religion. The main difference (for Tolli) is that in Christianity salvation of the entire Universe (\"Ganzheit\") cannot be made by 'solipsistic' man. The bishop sees Crowley as a failed – however talented – artist or \"Mystagogie\", but not as a \"Satanist\". The merit and contribution of bishop Tolli to Thelemic studies lies in the fact that it was he who first expresses that the genuine meaning and idea of Thelema does not necessarily contradict the teachings of Jesus, as Crowley himself affirms.\n\n\n", "id": "87272", "title": "Thelema"}

Daegu residents are also regarded by all other South Koreans as the widely ultra-conservative. Advisory to travelers: Do not display affections as a couple, if either resembles a Korean while the other a foreigner. In Daegu, this will be met with open hostility towards both persons by strangers.\n\nPalgong Mountain is north of Daegu. It is famous for Donghwa Temple and Gatbawi. Gatbawi is a statue of Buddha. \nApsan(Ap Mountain), also called Daedeok Mountain has many well known restaurants. It is a good place to hike. Many hikers visit the Apsan Mountain.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87393", "text": "Wave–particle duality\n\nWave–particle duality is perhaps one of the most confusing concepts in physics, because it is so unlike anything we see in the ordinary world.\n\nPhysicists who studied light in the 1700s and 1800s were having a big argument about whether light was made of particles shooting around like tiny bullets, or waves washing around like water waves. Light seems to do both. At times, light seems to go only in a straight line, as if it were made of particles. But other experiments show that light has a frequency and wavelength, just like a sound wave or water wave. Until the 20th century, most physicists thought that light was either one or the other, and that the scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong.\n\nIn 1909, a scientist named Geoffrey Taylor decided that he was going to settle this argument once and for all. He borrowed an experiment invented earlier by Thomas Young, where light was shone through two small holes right next to each other. When bright light was shone through these two small holes, it created an \"interference pattern\" that seemed to show that light was actually a wave. \n\nTaylor's idea was to take a photo of the light coming out of the holes with a special camera that was unusually sensitive to light. When bright light was shone through the holes, the photo showed an interference pattern, just like Young showed earlier. Taylor then turned down the light to a very dim level. When the light was dim enough, Taylor's photos showed tiny pinpoints of light scattering out of the holes. This seemed to show that light was actually a particle. If Taylor allowed the dim light to shine through the holes for long enough, the dots eventually filled up the photo to make an interference pattern again. This demonstrated that light was somehow \"both\" a wave \"and\" a particle.\n\nTo make matters even more confusing, Louis de Broglie suggested that matter might act the same way. Scientists then performed these same experiments with electrons, and found that electrons too are somehow both particles and waves. Electrons can be used to do Young's double-slit experiment.\n\nToday, these experiments have been done in so many different ways by so many different people that scientists simply accept that both matter and light are somehow both waves and particles. Scientists generally admit that even they do not fully understand how this can be, but they are quite certain that it must be true. Although it seems impossible to understand how anything can be both a wave and a particle, scientists do have a number of equations for describing these things that have variables for both wavelength (a wave property) and momentum (a particle property). This seeming impossibility is referred to as the wave-particle duality.\n\nWave–particle duality means that all particles show both wave and particle properties. This is a central concept of quantum mechanics.\nClassical concepts like \"particle\" and \"wave\" do not fully describe the behavior of quantum-scale objects. \n\nAn electron has a wavelength called the \"de Broglie wavelength\". It can be calculated using the equation\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2 is the de Broglie wavelength.\n\nformula_3 is Planck's constant\n\nformula_4 is the momentum of the particle.\n\nThis made the idea that electrons in atoms show a standing wave pattern.\n\nThe photoelectric effect shows that a light photon which has enough energy (a high enough frequency), can cause an electron to be released off a metal's surface. Electrons in this case can be called photoelectrons.\n\n", "id": "87393", "title": "Wave–particle duality"}

He was an excellent choirmaster and teacher. He spent most of his life working for the French royal court.\n\nThe name Ockeghem is found with many different spellings in old documents. He was almost certainly born in the town of Saint-Ghislain. His native language was probably French.\n\nLike many composers in this period, he started to learn about music by singing in a church choir, quite possibly in Saint-Ghislain and then in Mons. \n\nHis first important job was working for Charles I, Duke of Bourbon in Moulins, (France). Then in 1451 he went to work for King Charles VII of France. By this time he was well known as a singer and composer. He worked for the royal court for more than 50 years and was rewarded with promotions and honours. Charles VII gave him important jobs. After Charles VII’s death Louis XI became king. He reigned for a long time and Ockeghem was in favour with the king. He often travelled with the king, visiting places such as Cambrai and even as far as Spain. He met famous people including the composers Dufay and Binchois. He also had other jobs in Paris.\n\nLouis XI died in 1483. We do not kinow much about where Ockeghem went after that, but he probably died in Tours because that is where he left his will.\n\nOckeghem was not a composer who wrote lots of music, but it is hard to tell as some of it might have got lost. There are 14 masses that survive and other vocal works. His \"Missa pro Defunctis\" is the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem. Ockeghem based many of his masses on well-known tunes in a way that is called “cantus firmus technique”. Sometimes he put the borrowed tunes in the lowest part (he sang bass himself). This was rather unusual.\n\nOckeghem’s music influenced Josquin des Prez and other composers from Flanders and the Netherlands. \n\nWhen Ockeghem died Josquin Des Prez composed a motet called \"La déploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem\" in his honour. The music theorist Johannes Tinctoris described him as a great musician and one of the best singers he knew. Many younger composers used some of Ockeghem’s melodies as a base for their own compositions. In the Renaissance this kind of borrowing from the music ofc another composer was thought to be a great honour.\n\n", "id": "87418", "title": "Johannes Ockeghem"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87451", "text": "Pocahontas\n\nPocahontas (born around 1595buried on 21 March 1617) was an American Indian. She maintained relations between the Indians of Virginia and the colonists who built a fort and settlement on the James River called Jamestown in 1607. Legend says she saved John Smith's life when her father, Powhatan, was about to kill him. \n\nDuring a war with the Indians, she was captured and held for ransom. She was baptized Rebecca and improved her English language skills during captivity. In 1614 she married tobacco planter John Rolfe. They had a son Thomas. In 1616 the family went to London. Pocahontas became a celebrity. She died at Gravesend and was buried in England on 21 March 1617.\n\nThe year of Pocahontas's birth is unknown, but Camilla Townsend, author of \"Pocahontas and the Powhatan Dilemma\", suggests that she was born about 1597. Her father was Powhatan, the chief of an alliance of tribes in Virginia. Her mother was a woman of no social importance. Pocahontas was named Amonute. By the age of ten, the child was nicknamed Pocahontas, which means \"playful one\". She had a name known only to her parents. It may have been Makoata. \n\nHer girlhood was much like the girlhood of others in the alliance. She took care of siblings, she cooked, she tanned hides, she searched for berries and other edible foods, she tended the corn, beans, and squashes in the gardens of her people. In the evenings, she listened to songs and stories about the gods and her people's past. She wove cords from fibers while sitting at the fireside with girls.\n\nPocahontas was about ten years old when, in April 1607, colonist Captain John Smith arrived in Virginia. He and his men built a settlement called Jamestown. In December 1607, Smith was captured by an Indian party. He was taken to Powhatan's village. He enjoyed a feast and a talk with Powhatan. He did not meet Pocahontas. \n\nPocahontas made friends with Smith and the colonists. She often went to the settlement. When the colonists were starving, Pocahontas supplied them with food. As the settlement grew, the Indians felt their lands were threatened. Conflicts arose. In late 1609, Smith returned to England. The settlers told the Indians that Smith was dead. Pocahontas stopped visiting Jamestown. She later learned that he was alive in England. \n\nThe story of Pocahontas saving Smith's life by placing her head upon his own as her father was about to kill him is a fiction created by Smith in 1616. He wrote \"... at the minute of my execution, she [Pocahontas] hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was conducted to Jamestown.\" A romance between Pocahontas and Smith is also a fiction created by mythmakers in the early century.\n\nAs Jamestown expanded and settlements were built along the James, conflicts between the Indians and the English arose. In April 1613, Captain Samuel Argall learned Pocahontas was visiting a village on the Potomac River. He lured her aboard his ship and made her captive. Argall demanded the release of Powhatan's prisoners and the return of weapons and tools.\n\nPowhatan took no action. Pocahontas's captivity lasted about a year. She improved her English skills during this time. She embraced Christianity and the way of life. When her father released his prisoners and returned some tools, Pocahontas rebuked him for valuing axes and firearms more than his daughter. She told her people that she would rather remain with the English.\n\nHelen Rountree writes that Pocahontas began menstruating sometime in 1610. She then married a warrior and commoner named Kocoum. It is unknown where the couple lived or if they had children. This marriage ended by custom when she was captured by the English in 1613.\n\nPocahontas met 28 year old colonist John Rolfe during her captivity in Henricus. Rolfe was a widower and a successful tobacco planter. He was a gentle and pious man. He wrote a letter to the governor asking permission to marry Pocahontas. He expressed both his love for her and his belief that he would be saving her soul. He assured the governor that he was \"motivated not by the desire of affection (attraction), but for the good of this plantation, for the honor of our country, for the Glory of God, for my salvation.\"\n\nIn early April 1614, Pocahontas declared herself a Christian. She was baptized. Her name would be Rebecca. Pocahontas and Rolfe were married on 5 April 1614 at either the church in Jamestown or in Henricus. The couple lived at Rolfe's plantation on Hog Island. This plantation was located across the James River from Jamestown. They had one child, Thomas Rolfe. His birthdate and birthplace are not known. He could have been born in either America or England. The marriage created peace between the colonists and Powhatan's confederacy of tribes for years.\n\nThe English wanted to promote investment in the colony. Pocahontas was taken to England in 1616 with a few Indians. She served as a symbol of the tamed New World \"savage\", and the success of the settlement. John Smith did not meet Pocahontas in London, but he urged Queen Anne to treat her with the respect due a visitor. He suggested that if she were treated, she might spurn Christianity. In addition, England might lose the chance to gain a kingdom through her means. Pocahontas was then treated to events, balls and entertainments, and the company of well ladies.\n\nThe Bishop of London entertained her with pomp beyond what he offered to other ladies. Although Pocahontas was not a princess, she was presented as a princess to the public. Many English at this time recognized Powhatan to be the ruler of an empire, and they accorded to his daughter what they considered status. The cleric Samuel Purchas recalled meeting Pocahontas in London. He wrote that she impressed those she met by her bearing.\n\nIn March 1617, the Rolfes boarded a ship bound for Virginia. Pocahontas became ill. As the ship approached Gravesend, it was obvious she was dying. She was taken to an inn on shore and died on 21 March 1617. Her funeral was held the same day at St. George's Church, Gravesend. Rolfe then set sail for Virginia. His two year old son Thomas was ill. Rolfe thought the boy would not survive a voyage. He left the boy in the care of Sir Lewis Stukely, an official at Plymouth, England. Thomas was picked up by Rolfe's brother Henry. The boy never saw his father again. Pocahontas was buried under the chancel of St. George's Church. In 1727, the church burned. The bones of Pocahontas were reburied in a grave in the churchyard. In the 1920s, attempts to identify Pocahontas's bones were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n", "id": "87451", "title": "Pocahontas"}

The leadership of Rome was weak; there was a lot of instability as various power groups within the Roman armies kept trying to install their own Emperors, and murdering Emperors who belonged to other groups. This meant the invasions by the Germanic tribes were not successfully stopped.\n\nThe Emperor Diocletian tried to bring stability back into government by dividing the Empire into sections. These became the Western Empire which included Spain, France, England, Italy and parts of Germany, and the Eastern Empire which included Greece, Turkey, the Middle East and northern Egypt.\n\nRome ceased to be the capital from the time of the division. In 286, the capital of the Western Roman Empire became Mediolanum (modern Milan). In 402, the capital was again moved, this time to Ravenna.\n\nThis division did not help the Western Empire which came under increasing invasions from the north from the Ostrogoths, Huns, Franks, Visigoths,and Burgundians. The armies were brought back towards Rome, abandoning England and France The economy could not cope with the increased need for military spending which caused inflation. The citizens were unhappy with rising taxes and rising prices.\n\nIn AD 398, Alaric and his Visigoths began making attacks closer and closer to the capital. By 410 AD he had captured the city of Rome. In 455 CE, the Vandals captured Rome. In 476 AD the Goths captured the capital.\n\nThe fall of the Western Roman Empire took place in 476 AD when the leader of the Goths, Odoacer, removed Emperor Romulus.

The ideology, named from democracy where people have a say in government actions, supports a competitive economy with money while also helping people whose jobs don't pay a lot. This makes it easier for people to support themselves in society by having more protection if they lose their job with an emphasis on equal rights for everyone, and there is also plenty of either government ownership or regulation of various industries that make companies play by the government's rules. This way of governing is appreciated by people living in countries who have to battle the cold more than others, like the northern nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Iceland. The ideology's movement has seen some interest in other countries whose systems do not work this way, because it has worked well for those who have it.\n\nDespite a common belief that social democracy is socialist by principle, its policies keep capitalism in place. But the government has a focus on Keynesian economics, where the government should step in and help people without jobs. In social democracy entrepreneurs own the industries just like they would in a standard capitalist economy. In socialism the workers own them instead which is very different.\n\nIn practice no political theory works out in a simple way. The Soviet Union and its various satellites are a good example. The workers did not own either their place of work or their own homes, in any meaningful way. All power was concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of people at the top of the party. \n\nNeither were capitalist systems empty of help for the poor and the needy. A good example is England, where relief for the poor was available in every parish in the land, long before there were any government social services. The practice was known as charity. Also, Britain saw the growth of a an important middle class after industrialisation took hold. So it is not right to think of such societies as simply composed of owners and workers, or rich and poor.\n\nSocial democrats are divided in how they see their theory. Terms like \"market socialism\" and \"the third way\" are efforts to rethink what social democracy means today.\n", "id": "87537", "title": "Social democracy"}

Then it was made part of Groß-Berlin (Greater Berlin) and turned into a borough.\n\nAs a part of the changes to the boroughs of Berlin in 2001 Charlottenburg was joined with Wilmersdorf to make the new borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. In 2004, the new borough's districts were rearranged. The former borough of Charlottenburg was divided into the localities of Westend, Charlottenburg-Nord and Charlottenburg. In addition to that, Charlottenburg features a number of popular kiezes.\n\nCharlottenburg is best known for Charlottenburg Palace, the largest surviving royal palace in Berlin.\n\nCharlottenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary in 2005.\n\nCharlottenburg is located along the river Spree within the Berlin-Warsaw glacial valley, west of the Tiergarten park. The \"Straße des 17. Juni\" (17th June Street), former \"Charlottenburger Chaussee\", which runs through the park, connects it with the historic centre of Berlin.\n\nIn 1695, Sophia Charlotte of Hanover got the district of Lietzow from her husband Elector Frederick III, in exchange for her estates in Caputh and Langerwisch, near Potsdam.\n\nFrederick had a summer residence built for his wife by the architect Johann Arnold Nering between 1695 and 1699. In 1701, Frederick became the first Prussian King (Frederick I of Prussia), and he made the building much bigger\n\nJust after the death of Sophie Charlotte, the village near the palace was called 'Charlottenburg' and the palace itself \"Schloss Charlottenburg\", and the settlement was chartered as a town. The king was the town's mayor until Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720.\n\nFrederick's successor, Frederick William I of Prussia, rarely stayed at the palace. Frederick William even tried to end the town's privileges. It was not until 1740, at the coronation of his successor Frederick II (Frederick the Great), that the town's became important again. The eastern New Wing was built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1740 and 1747 as Frederick the Great's home. Later, Frederick II preferred the palace of Sanssouci, which he had partly designed himself.\n\nWhen Frederick II died in 1786, his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him, and Charlottenburg became his favourite residence, as it was for his son and successor Frederick William III.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Prussian army at Jena in 1806, Charlottenburg was occupied by the French. Napoleon occupied the palace, while his troops camped nearby.\n\nIn the late 18th century, Charlottenburg's development did not depend only on the crown. The town became a recreational area for the expanding city of Berlin. Its first real inn opened in the 1770s, in the street then called 'Berliner Straße' (now Otto-Suhr-Allee), and many other inns and beer gardens were to follow, popular for weekend parties especially.\n\nBeside the palace, Charlottenburg is also home to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on the Breitscheidplatz, the fomer West Berlin landmark, the Kurfürstendamm and the Zoo railway station as well as the Deutsche Oper Berlin, one of the three Berlin opera houses.\n\nCharlottenburg is twinned with\n", "id": "87569", "title": "Charlottenburg"}

Until the Berlin Wall fell, these were the last two numbers of the postal codes for the two areas.\n\nIt was a separate borough from 1920, when it became a part of Groß-Berlin, until the borughs were changed in 2001. Then it was joined with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Since these two localities are linked only by a single bridge over the Spree river, the Oberbaumbrücke, this joining seemed awkward to many residents. The two areas could not agree on where the new borough's town hall should be. Friedrichshain was chosen by tossing a five-Mark coin.\n\nKreuzberg is known to many for numerous Turkish immigrants from eastern parts of Turkey, and the yearly May Day riots. This is because before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Kreuzberg was isolated. Its eastern parts were almost entirely surrounded by the Wall. This area consequently had cheap rents and lower-income families as well as squatters from the radical left. The western part of Kreuzberg also bordered onto the wall, and it was here where Checkpoint Charlie was.\n\nKreuzberg got its name is from its highest point, the Kreuzberg (literally, \"cross hill\"). It is of above sea level.. The hill was a traditional place for weekend trips, and had a lot of small restaurants for the visitors. The hill got its name from a monument built in 1821 by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. It was to remember the wars against Napoleon I of France.\n\nAfter 1860 industry began moving into Kreuzburg. There was also an \"Exportviertel\" (export quarter) along Ritterstraße which had a lot of many profitable small businesses, and the \"press quarter\" along Kochstraße was the home of most of Germany's large newspapers as well as the Ullstein, Scherl, and Mosse book publishers.\n\nBoth of these industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed during World War II, with the bombings of a single night from 3 February 1945. To remember old tradition, the Axel Springer press company built its new headquarters at Kochstraße again, right next to the Berlin Wall.\n\nAfter World War II, Kreuzberg's housing rents were regulated by law, which made investments unattractive.

In some place private firms do this job instead, but it can be a big source of money for the trusts.\n\nBefore 1974 local councils used to run the ambulance service. Since then NHS regions and now ambulance trust have. On 1 July 2006 the number of ambulance trusts fell from 29 to 13.\n\nMost of the new Trusts follow government office regional boundaries. But on the Isle of Wight the local hospitals will keep running the ambulances. Also South East England and South West England were split into two Ambulance Trusts. This has meant that a lot of old trusts disappeared. The new Trusts are:\n\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service is a Special Health Board funded directly by the Health Department of the Scottish Government. In 2006 the service answered over 520,000 emergency calls.\n\nScotland also has Britain's only publicly funded Air Ambulance service. It has two Eurocopter EC 135 Helicopters (based in Glasgow & Inverness) and two Beechcraft B200C King Air fixed-wing aircraft (based at Glasgow & Aberdeen).\n\nThe Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) is the ambulance service that serves the whole of Northern Ireland, and was set up in 1995.\n\nAs with other ambulance services in the United Kingdom, it does not charge its patients directly for its services, but is funded through general taxation.\n\nTo answer medical emergencies in Northern Ireland, NIAS has over 270. The Service employs approximately 1044 staff based across 32 stations & sub-stations, 4 Control Centres and a Regional Training Centre.\n\nThe Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust (Welsh:\"Ymddiriedolaeth GIG Gwasanaethau Ambiwlans Cymru\") was set up on April 1, 1998 and has 2,500 staff providing ambulance and related services to the 2.9 million residents of Wales.\n\nIts headquarters are at the H.M.Stanley Hospital, St Asaph, Denbighshire and it is divided into three regions:\n\nPrivate ambulance services are becoming more common in the UK. They often providing medical cover at large events, either with, or instead of the voluntary sector providers. Some organisers use a private firm instead of a voluntary ambulance service because of wider availability during the week (sometimes difficult for a voluntary service to cover) or for a wider range of skills, such as provision of qualified Paramedics.\n\nThe most common use for private ambulances is for Patient Transport. Many trusts and hospitals choosing use a private company, instead of the NHS service. Private ambulances do not answer emergency (999) calls. Sometimes a private ambulance company is used as a follow-up, for stretcher transport or going non-life-threatening calls. Recently, some companies have been contracted to provide additional emergency crews and vehicles to supplement the core NHS staff at busy times (such as New Year).\n\nAll ambulance companies and the NHS Ambulance trusts must follow the same laws, so a private ambulance must have the same equipment and the people working in it be as qualified as the same type of NHS ambulance.\n\nAnother type of private ambulance are those operated by undertakers, who generally favour black vans, with the words private ambulance written discreetly on the vehicle. They are used for taking bodies between hospital, embalmer and chapel of rest, rather than use a hearse.\n\nThe main voluntary ambulance providers are the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance in England/Wales, Northern Ireland & The Islands, and St Andrew's Ambulance Association in Scotland. The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps. can sometimes be found in Northern Ireland also. These groups have been providing both emergency and non-emergency medical cover in the UK for over 120 years, including active service in both World Wars. This is before any government organised service.\n\nThe main activity of the organisations apart from training and education, is providing ambulance cover at events, as an extension of their First aid contract.\n\nDepending on their agreement, or agreements, with their local ambulance service trust (known as a Memorandum of Understanding or MOU), they may treat and transport certain categories of patient to hospital, although for more serious incidents, such as cardiac arrest it is likely that they would be expected to summon the assistance of the statutory ambulance service.\n\nBoth organisations also provide 'reserve' or 'support' cover to some, though not all, of the ambulance trusts (dependent on the local MOU), where ambulance crews from one of the organisations (who are usually volunteers, but in some instances may be paid staff) will attend 999, GP Urgent or PTS calls on behalf of the ambulance trust. In these cases the organisation is paid by the trust. This service is most often called on during major incidents, when there is a high level of staff absence or when there is an unusually high call volume, although in some areas, voluntary crews are regularly used to supplement full-time trust cover.\n\nBoth organisations have also provided cover for the public when NHS ambulance trust staff have held strikes or walk outs.\n\n\"Big White Taxi Service\" is a nickname sometimes used by NHS ambulance staff in the United Kingdom.\n\nThey use it because the 999 emergency number is often misused by people who do not need an emergency ambulance, but could go to their own local General Practitioner.\n\n\n", "id": "87693", "title": "Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom"}

Jansa and his staff had plans for defending Austria against a Wehrmacht attack. Hitler did not want this to happen.\n\nSchuschnigg realised that his new ministers were trying to take over from him. To get support Schuschnigg allowed socialists and communists legally to appear in public again. The parties had been banned on 12 February 1934 in the Austrian Civil War. The communists said they supported the Austrian government. The socialists wanted more promises from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him.\n\nOn 9 March Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on the independence of Austria for 13 March.\n\nTo help his side to win, Schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at 24. Many of those who supported Nazism and union with Germany were young, so this move was to stop them from voting.\n\nHitler said that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it. Also, the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order. Schuschnigg immediately said publicly that reports of riots were false.\n\nHitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March, saying that he must hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion.\n\nSchuschnigg resigned as Chancellor that evening. He could not persuade France or Britain to help.\n\nIn the radio broadcast when he announced his resignation, he said that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government in order to avoid bloodshed.\n\nMeanwhile, Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas refused to appoint Seyß-Inquart as Chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians instead. However, the Nazis were well organised. Within hours they managed to take control of many parts of Vienna, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs (controlling the Police). As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government and Seyss-Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government demanding German troops to restore order, Hitler became furious. At about 10 PM, well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion, Göring and Hitler gave up on waiting and sent a forged telegram pretending to be a request by the Austrian Government for German troops to enter Austria. Around midnight, after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested, Miklas finally appointed Seyss-Inquart Chancellor.\n\nOn the morning of 12 March, the 8th Army of the German Wehrmacht crossed the German-Austrian border. They were not stopped by the Austrian Army, instead the Wehrmacht troops were greeted by cheering Austrian Germans with Hitler salutes, Nazi flags and flowers.\n\nThis is why the annexing of Austria without one single shot being fired is sometimes called the \"Blumenkrieg\" (war of flowers).\n\nHitler's car crossed the border in the afternoon at Braunau, his birthplace. In the evening, he arrived at Linz and was welcomed at the city hall. Goering, in a telephone call that evening, said: \"There is unbelievable jubilation in Austria. We ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense.\"\n\nOn 2 April 1938, 200,000 Austrians gathered on the Heldenplatz (Square of Heroes) to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss. Hitler later commented: \"Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators.\"\n\nThe Anschluss was given immediate effect by a law on 13 March, subject to ratification by a plebiscite. Austria became the province of Ostmark, and Seyss-Inquart was appointed Governor. The plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 99.73% of the voters.\n\nMost historians agree that the result was not fixed, but the voting process was neither free nor secret. Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand (in contrast to a secret vote where the voting ballot is inserted into a closed box). In some parts of Austria the referendum on the independence of Austria on 13 March was held despite the Wehrmacht's presence in Austria (it took up to 3 days to occupy every part of Austria). For instance, in the village of Innervillgraten a majority of 95% voted for Austria's independence.\n\nAustria remained part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II when a preliminary Austrian Government declared the Anschluss \"null und nichtig\" (null and void) on April 27 1945. After the war, then allied-occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country, but was not restored to sovereignty until the Austrian State Treaty and Austrian Declaration of Neutrality, both of 1955, largely due to the rapid development of the Cold War and disputes between the Soviet Union and its former allies over its foreign policy.\n", "id": "87725", "title": "Anschluss"}

Several ways to earn ISK include mining, exploration, doing missions, trading, piracy, and bounty hunting (hunting criminals for money). \n\nEVE is hosted on 1 server cluster.

They were the first of the four races to develop ships capable of travelling space. Their main weapon type is a laser, which fire high-energy beams to the enemy to deal damage. They do not use ammunition like the other races, but instead use a type of ammunition called a crystal in order to focus the laser. The two subgroups of lasers are: Beam (long range), and Pulse (short range).\n\nCaldari\n\nThe Caldari is a race centered around corporations. They are a very military driven race, and specialize in both missiles and hybrid turrets (which require both ammunition to fire, and energy to fire it), railguns in particular, and can shoot further than other races.\n\nGallente\n\nThe Gallente happened to be located in the same place the Caldari were, and were the first race to create a democracy.

Seyß-Inquart was executed at the Nuremberg Trials for crimes against humanity.\n\nSeyß-Inquart was born in 1892 in Stonařov (\"Stannern\"), Moravia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to school principal Emil Zajtich and his wife Auguste Hyrenbach. The family moved to Vienna in 1907, where they changed the Czech Slavic name of \"Zajtich\" to the German \"Seyß-Inquart\". Seyß-Inquart later studied law at the University of Vienna. At the beginning of World War I in August 1914, Seyß-Inquart enlisted in the Austrian Army and served in Russia, Romania and Italy. He was decorated for bravery on a number of occasions, and while recovering from wounds in 1917 he completed his final examinations for his degree.\n\nIn 1911, Seyß-Inquart met Gertrud Maschka. The couple married in 1916 and had three children: Ingeborg Caroline Auguste Seyß-Inquart (born 18 September 1917), Richard Seyß-Inquart (born 1921) and Dorothea Seyß-Inquart (born 1928).\n\nHe went into law after the war, and in 1921 set up his own practice. During the early years of the first Austrian republic, he was close to the Vaterländische Front.\n\nAs a successful lawyer, he was asked to join the cabinet of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss in 1933.\n\nHe became a State Councillor in 1937 under Kurt Schuschnigg. He was not a member of the Austrian National Socialist party at first. But by 1938, Seyß-Inquart was the highest-ranking politician in the Austrian National Socialist Party.\n\nIn February 1938, Seyß-Inquart was appointed Minister of the Interior by Schuschnigg, after Hitler had threatened Schuschnigg. On 11 March 1938, Schuschnigg resigned as Austrian Chancellor and Seyß-Inquart was appointed to the position by Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas. Hitler's plan was to have Seyß-Inquart send a telegram asking for German help to stop riots, but President Miklas did not make Seyß-Inquart chancellor until after Hitler's invasion of Austria. On 13 March 1938, Seyß-Inquart joined the National Socialist party.\n\nHitler was going to leave Austria independent, but after the welcome the invading German troops got during the Anschluß he decided to make Austria a new part of the Third Reich, called \"Ostmark\" (or \"eastern boundary\") . Seyß-Inquart wrote the statute which made Austria a province of Germany, and signed it into law on 13 March.\n\nSeyß-Inquart became \"Reichsstatthalter\" or Governor of the so-called Ostmark. Ernst Kaltenbrunner was chief minister, and Burckel Commissioner for the Reunion of Austria (concerned with the \"Jewish Question\").\n\nSeyß-Inquart was made an SS Gruppenführer, and in May 1939 Minister without portfolio in Hitler's government.\n\nAfter the invasion of Poland Seyß-Inquart became governor of Southern Poland, but before he started work there the General Government was created, and Seyß-Inquart became a deputy to Governor General Hans Frank.\n\nAfter Germany invaded the Low Countries, Seyß-Inquart became Reichskommissar for occupied Netherlands in May 1940. His job was to organize civil administration, create close economic ties with Germany and defend the interests of the Reich.\n\nHe supported the Dutch National Socialist Party (NSB) and allowed it to create a paramilitary \"Landwacht\", as an auxiliary police force. Other political parties were banned in late 1941, and many former government officials imprisoned at Sint-Michielsgestel. The administration of the country was largely controlled by Seyß-Inquart himself.\n\nHe introduced measures to combat 'terror', and when a widespread strike took place in Amsterdam, Arnhem and Hilversum in May 1943 special summary court-martials were held and a collective fine of 18 million guilders was imposed. Seyß-Inquart authorized the execution of around 800 people before liberation. Some people say it was not merely 800 but over 1,500, including executions under the so-called \"Hostage Law\" involving (among others) political prisoners who were close to being liberated, the Putten incident, and the reprisal execution of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader\" Hanns Albin Rauter. From July 1944 on, most of Seyß-Inquart's powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the Gestapo, but he was still an important and powerful political figure.\n\nThere were two small concentration camps in the Netherlands:\n\nThere was also a \"Jewish assembly camp\" at Westerbork, in addition to a number of other camps controlled by the military, the police, the SS or Seyß-Inquart's administration. These included a \"voluntary labor recruitment\" camp at Ommen. A total of around 530,000 Dutch civilians worked for the Germans, of whom 250,000 were sent to factories in Germany.\n\nSeyss-Inquart was an anti-Semite: within a few months of his arrival in the Netherlands, he sacked Jews from government, the press and leading positions in industry. Anti-Jewish measures escalated after 1941: approximately 140,000 Jews were registered, a ghetto was created in Amsterdam and a transit camp set up at Westerbork. In February 1941, 600 Jews were sent to the Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps. Later, Dutch Jews were sent to Auschwitz. As Allied forces approached in September 1944 the remaining Jews at Westerbork were sent to Theresienstadt. Of 140,000 registered Dutch Jews, only 44,500 survived the war.\n\nWhen Hitler committed suicide on 30 April 1945, Seyß-Inquart became the Foreign Minister in Admiral Karl Dönitz's new German government.\n\nThe Nazi regime had tried a 'scorched earth' policy, and also destroyed some docks and harbors. Seyß-Inquart agreed with Armaments Minister Albert Speer that destroying everything to keep valuable materials from Allied forces or a new government after the war was wrong. Seyß-Inquart also helped in the so-called 'hunger winter' of 1945 to distribute food, and allowed Allied airplanes to drop Swedish white bread for the hungry people of occupied northern Netherlands. He remained Reichskommissar until 8 May 1945, when, after a meeting with Karl Dönitz to confirm his blocking of the scorched-earth orders, he was captured in Hamburg.\n\nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Seyß-Inquart faced charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, starting and fighting wars of aggression; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.\n\nHis defence lawyer was Gustav Steinbauer. Seyß-Inquart was nonetheless found guilty of all charges except conspiracy. On hearing of his death sentence, Seyss-Inquart made it clear he accepted responsibility for excesses during the war, \"Death by hanging...well, in view of the whole situation, I never expected anything different. It's all right\". He was hanged on 16 October 1946, at the age of 54, together with nine other Nuremberg defendants. His last words were \"I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples. I believe in Germany\".\n\n", "id": "87849", "title": "Arthur Seyß-Inquart"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87862", "text": "Classical Athens\n\nClassical Athens refers to the city of Athens from 508 to 322 BC. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes, after the tyranny of the Peistratids and the rule of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC. Athens was one of the most powerful cities in ancient times. It was important because there democracy developed.\n\nIn 477 B.C. Athens began the Delian League to join the city-states for protection. Their rival was the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. The Delian League's money was kept in the temple of Apollo. \n\nIn the classical period, Athens was a center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's \"Akademia\" and Aristotle's \"Lyceum\". Athens was also the birthplace of Socrates, Pericles, Sophocles, and other philosophers, writers and politicians of the ancient world. It is widely referred to as the cradle of western civilization, and the birthplace of democracy. Its culture and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC had widespread effects.\n\nThe classical period is usually dealt with by its most important political events, as follows:\n\n\nWhen King Xerxes of Persia fought the Greeks of Asia Minor, Athens helped them. In time, the Persians attacked Greece and the Greco-Persian wars began.n\n\nOn the plain of Marathon, many Persians with bows and arrows fought the Greeks. Even though there were many more Persians than Greeks, the Greeks won because they had spears and swords of metal.\n\nThemistocles, a statesman of Athens, warned the Athenians that the Persians would return, so they should make their navy bigger. The people did so, and Sparta offered to help. The Persians arrived and attacked the Greeks, both on land and on sea. The Persians won the battle of Thermopylae but the battle gave the Greeks time to get ready.\n\nAlthough the city of Athens was burnt down before the Persians left, most of the people had run away to the nearby islands for safety. Themistocles ordered the Greeks to prepare for another attack. This time he told them to leave their ships in the Bay of Salamis. When the Persians arrived, they were surprised and confused by the harbor that was so full of ships they could not travel in it. In this battle of Salamis a few hundred Greek ships destroyed many, many Persian ships. Xerxes went away.\n\nThe next year, another battle happened, which 32,000 Greek hoplites and 50,000 other soldiers won. The Persians did not attack Greece again.\n\nEven though Sparta and Athens helped each other in battle, they were very different culturally. In 431 to 404 B.C., these two city-states fought in a conflict called the Peloponnesian War after the name of the lower part of the peninsula. Sparta had help from other states. Athens kept inside the city walls, but many people died because of a terrible sickness, including Pericles.\n\nAthens' navy was taken by Spartans who had been trained severely since they were children. In 404 B.C., Athens surrendered to Sparta.\n\nFor 30 years Sparta ruled, but many people did not like Spartan government, and Thebes, another city-state, helped Athens defeat Sparta. For nine years Thebes was the most powerful state.\n\nHowever, Greece was much weaker because of the wars inside her country. Philip of Macedonia began to move into Greek territory. Although Demosthenes warned Athens of the danger, Athenians did not care. At Chaeronea, Philip of Macedonia controlled Greece.\n\nWhen Philip died, his son, Alexander the Great, even though he was only 20 years, went out to capture the world. He won Asia Minor, Persia, Egpyt, and some parts of India, but he died when he was 32 because of an unknown ailment.\n\nThe people in Athens ate simply, usually barley cakes, onions, fish, and fruit. For clothes the men wore short pieces of cloth (tunics), aprons, and sandals for work. A woman wore a \"chiton\", which was a long, loose cloth that was attached to the shoulder. The loose garment was like a blouse because of a rope worn around the waist. Sandals were made by putting the foot on a piece of skin while the shoemaker made a covering for the foot.\n\nChildren liked to have pet rabbits and to play ball games. For fun, they also raced little chariots pulled by dogs. They were taught by slaves, and learned poetry, music, and dancing. Exercise was also important.\n\nWhen a young man became 18, he began two years of training for the army. After that he could join in the men's classes where javelin throwing was done. For protection in wrestling, he tied leather strips around his wrists. He also cut his hair. Teachers from many lands taught the young men.\n\nThe Greek hoplites fought so close together that their shields overlapped with each other. Their spears were very long.\n\nWomen in ancient and classical Athens were treated with little respect. They could not become citizens of Athens. This means they could not vote and did not have any direct say in what happened in Athens. They could not run for election. \n\nGirls could not be citizens. They left their home at the age of 14 to get married, sometimes with a man who was much older than she was (about 30 years old). Her marriage would be arranged by her father. On most occasions, the father would pick a rich husband for his daughter. The girl and her mother had no say in who she married, it was entirely the father's choice.\n\nContrast that with Sparta. Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, \"women took responsibility for running estates\". \n\nin the 4th century BC Spartan women owned approximately between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic Period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20, and unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Girls as well as boys received an education. Young women as well as young men may have taken part in the \"Gymnopaedia\" (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").\n", "id": "87862", "title": "Classical Athens"}

It tells the story of rabbits and their adventures concerning their warren at a hill in the north of Hampshire, England known as Watership Down.\n\nIn this fantasy book, rabbits with human intelligence are shown in their natural environment. They have their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry and mythology.\n\nIt was first published in the United Kingdom by Rex Collings Ltd in 1972 and has continued to be printed and is now available in 18 different languages.\n\n\nFiver, a rabbit with a gift for seeing the future, living at Sandleford Warren, sees his home being destroyed by a land developer in the future. He convinces his brother, Hazel to talk to the Chief Rabbit, Threarah about leaving the Warren, however, the Chief Rabbit has no intention of leaving. Hazel, Fiver, and nine other rabbits then set off in search of a new home (at the time, merely off of the basis of Fiver's dreams that a good home awaits them somewhere far away).\n\nThey travel through forests, fields, over rivers, and roads filled with hrududu's (cars) before tiredness forces them to stop at a warren headed by a rabbit named Cowslip. After much debate, the rabbits agree to stay at Cowslips warren. The warren however, feels wrong to them (especially Fiver) due to the other rabbit's strange customs.\n\nThey soon find out that the strange actions that Cowslip's rabbits are showing is due to the fact that they are merely being fed and taken care of by a farmer so that he kill them off, one by one, for food. They leave Cowslip's warren, although Bigwig nearly dies on the way.\n\nThey keep going until they arrive at the site of Watership Down, a high hill that is far from man and full of good food and safety. After a day or two at their good land that Fiver had promised them, Hazel is named the unofficial chief rabbit of Watership Down. However, Hazel realizes that there are no does (female rabbits) among them, and they cannot have a healthy warren of rabbits without does.\n\nHazel later rescues a big gull named Kehaar, who has been hurt by a cat. After nursing Kehaar back to health, Keharr agrees to help the rabbits for the time being in return for their kindness toward him. After being asked by Hazel to check out of the area, Kehaar finds a large warren called Efrafa to the South of their position. After hearing that Efrafa is large and too crowded, Hazel sends four rabbits to Efrafa to ask if they could bring back some does to their warren.\n\nHowever, Efrafa, being a large warren with too many rabbits, is tightly controlled by a rabbit named General Woundwort and his large military. Each rabbit is told when are where they are allowed to eat, sleep and more. Nothing happens without the General's ok, including leaving the warren. The four rabbits barely run away after playing a trick on an Efrafan Captain.\n\nAt the same time that the four rabbits are at Efrafa, Hazel leads a small group to look into Kehaar's report that there is a farm with a few caged rabbits, including does. After a few raids, the Watership rabbits break a few caged rabbits out of the farm, but Hazel is shot on the way out. Fiver has a vision where Hazel is, though, and Hazel is found and returned to health.\n\nNow hearing how Efrafa is, the weakened Hazel decides to free the rabbits from Efrafa. All of the Watership rabbits travel carefully to the edges of Efrafa. Pretending to be a wandering alone rabbit, Bigwig infiltrates Efrafa as an officer of their Owsla. Secretly, however, Bigwig is helping get rabbits to help with the break out. He meets Hyzenthlay and Thethunninnang, two does who tell him that, if he has a working plan, they and a few other rabbits will attempt the escape with him.\n\nAfter nearly having to fight General Woundwort, Bigwig and the does break out of Efrafa with Kehaar's help. Of course this break out is noticed by the guards, and soon the General himself and his small army catch up Bigwig and the runaway rabbits. They get away only because Kehaar attacks Woundwort. Woundwort keep chasing the rabbits to a stream, and the rabbits escape on a small boat. Two does die on the way to Watership Down, but most rabbits make it there safely.\n\nThe rabbits are glad to see the new rabbits. However, a field mouse warns the rabbits that General Woundwort and a small strike team are coming. The General then attacks the warren in the night as the Watership Rabbits head to their deepest burrows, blocking off the tunnels in an attempt to hold off the Efrafans.\n\nWhile in a burrow, Fiver passes out as too many visions come to him at once. Meanwhile, Hazel, has a vision of how to stop the Efrafans. Hazel tells Bigwig to stay there and fight and he takes Blackberry and Dandelion out of the burrow. Hazel's plan is to use the dog at the nearby Nuthanger farm to defeat the Efrafans.\n\nHazel's plan works, however Bigwig and Hazel are hurt in the process. General Woundwort disappears, never to be seen again. Captain Campion and the other attackers go back to Efrafa, where Campion becomes Chief Rabbit.\n\nHazel lives a long life as Chief Rabbit of Watership Down, while his warren does well and is peaceful. Fiver recovers and Bigwig becomes the respected captain of the guard.\n\n", "id": "87874", "title": "Watership Down"}

He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power. He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose, often shown spitting out jewels. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, which is a symbol of greed or hatred; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity.\n\nIn the Pāli writings of the Theravāda Buddhist tradition, Vaiśravaṇa is called Vessavaṇa. Vessavaṇa is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. Vessavaṇa's direction is the northern quarter of the world.\n\nVessavaṇa has the name \"Kuvera\" from a name he had from a past life as a rich mill-owner, who gave all the money he got from one of his seven mills to charity, and gave aid to the poor for 20,000 years.\n\nAs with all the Buddhist deities, Vessavaṇa is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual. Each Vessavaṇa is a human, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new Vessavaṇa. Like other beings of the Cātummahārājika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years, but other sources say nine million years.\n\nWhen the Buddha was born, Vessavaṇa became his follower. He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them.\n\nIn Japan, Bishamonten (毘沙門天), or just Bishamon (毘沙門) is thought of as a god of war or warriors who wears armor, and a punisher of people who do evil things, a view that is very strange when compared with the more peaceful Buddhist king described above. Bishamon is shown holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand. The Pagoda symbolises the divine treasure house, which holds things that he guards and gives away. In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Japanese Seven Lucky Gods.\n\nIn Tibet, Vaiśravaṇa is known to be a worldly protector of the Dharma. He is also known as the King of the North. As guardian of the north, he is often shown on temple wall paintings outside the main door. He is also a god of wealth. Vaiśravaṇa is sometimes shown carrying a citron, the fruit of the \"jambhara\" tree. The fruit helps pick him out from depictions of Kuvera.\n\n\n\n", "id": "87908", "title": "Vaisravana"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=87932", "text": "Purchasing Power Parity\n\nThere are two ways to measure GDP (total income of a country) of different countries and compare them. One way, called GDP at exchange rate, is when the currencies of all countries are converted into USD (United States Dollar). The second way is GDP (PPP) or GDP at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).\n\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP) is measured by finding the values (in USD) of a basket of consumer goods that are present in each country (such as orange juice, pencils, etc.). If that basket costs $100 in the US and $200 in the United Kingdom, then the purchasing power parity exchange rate is 1:2. \n\nFor example, suppose that Japan has a higher GDP per capita ($18) than the US ($16). That means that Japanese on average make $2 more than normal Americans. However, they are not necessarily richer. Suppose that one gallon of orange juice costs $6 in Japan and only $2 in the US; then $6 in Japan exchanges to only $2 worth of US goods, since the Japanese can only buy 3 gallons while the Americans can buy 8 gallons. Therefore, in terms of orange juice, the Americans are richer, and in this example the US has a GDP (PPP) of $2, since the $16 can buy 8 gallons of orange juice (by definition), while Japan has GDP (PPP) of only $6 since the $18 in Japan can only buy 3 gallons of orange juice, which represents only $6 of US goods.\n\nNow apply this to daily life. The orange juice represents the previously mentioned \"basket of goods\" which represents the cost of living in a country. Therefore, even if a country has a higher GDP per capita (individual income), that country's people may still live poorer if the cost of living is higher.\n", "id": "87932", "title": "Purchasing Power Parity"}

He travels widely in Europe, America, Australia and Asia.\n\nHe is the founder and spiritual leader of Rigpa, which is an international network of over 100 Buddhist centres and groups in 23 countries around the world. He is also the author of the best-selling book \"The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying\", which has been printed in 30 languages and 56 countries.\n\nRinpoche often speaks at major conferences in all areas of society, including medicine and healing, education, dialogue between religions, movements for peace and non-violence, the world of business and leadership, and the field of serving the dying and hospice care.\n\nSogyal Rinpoche was born in 1947 in the region of Kham in Eastern Tibet. Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö says that he is the reincarnation of Tertön Sogyal, a teacher to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. Jamyang Khyentse raised him as a son and made sure he got good training.\n\nWhen things got bad in Kham, Khyentse Rinpoche and his young student went to Central Tibet and Lhasa. In 1955, they met Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. They then went to India. They settled in Gangtok at the invitation of the king of Sikkim.\n\nRinpoche went to Catholic School in Kalimpong. Then he went to study at a university in Delhi before coming to the West. In 1971, he was granted a place to study comparative religion at Trinity College, Cambridge as a visiting scholar. He continued to study with many masters of all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, especially His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche and His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche.\n\nIn 1994, a $10 million civil lawsuit was filed against Sogyal Rinpoche. It was alleged that he had used his position as a spiritual leader to induce one of his female students to have sexual relations with him. The complaint included accusations of infliction of emotional distress, breach of fiduciary duty, as well as assault and battery. The lawsuit was settled out of court. Related allegations were later introduced by journalist Mary Finnigan, who was also the main author of the original article in 1995.\n\nRinpoche soon began teaching in Paris. He often translated for His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche. He also went with Dudjom Rinpoche to the United States in 1976.\n\nIn the summer of 1977, he started a centre in London, which he called Dzogchen Orgyen Chöling. Many great masters taught there: Dudjom Rinpoche, His Holiness Sakya Trizin, Gyalwang Karmapa, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and others.\n\nIn 1979, Sogyal Rinpoche chose the name Rigpa for his work. It means \"the innermost, essential nature of mind\". Rigpa soon set up a schedule of teaching events, referred to as retreats, with Sogyal Rinpoche and other teachers, with teachings in France every summer, California at Thanksgiving, Germany in Winter, followed by Myall Lakes in Australia, and then England at Easter. The first winter event at Kirchheim in Germany took place in December 1986, retreats in Tiona Park in Australia began in 1989, and the first Thanksgiving retreat in the US was in Oakland in 1988.\n\nIn 1987, Rinpoche became spiritual director of the centre in County Cork in the west of Ireland which was to become Dzogchen Beara, Rigpa’s first long-term retreat centre. In 1991, Sogyal Rinpoche opened the retreat centre of Lerab Ling near Montpellier in southern France. The first three-month retreat was held there in 1992. A centre in Berlin named Dharma Mati was opened in October 2007.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "87975", "title": "Sogyal Rinpoche"}

For example, rules against eating meat and drinking alcohol might be broken. Such a practice might require eating meat and drinking alcohol while having sex in a graveyard or cremation ground.\n\nPeople who follow the Left Hand Path in the West are not interested in giving up pleasure or the world in order to be spiritual. They are not interested in worshiping God or following rules made up by others. They seek to gain power and freedom by breaking through taboos, fears and restrictions.\n\nMany people link this term with Satanism and black magic, but they are not the same.

The crops had not been harvesting well that year and there may not have been enough to host the emperor. They were worried that the emperor would do bad things to them if they did not give him a feast, so they quickly put the food they had not yet eaten back into the pot, cooked it again (thus \"twice-cooking\" them) and served the food to the emperor.

He also studied to alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy.\n\nDee lived during a time when people were just learning the difference between science and magic. He was one of the most learned men of his time. He lectured to crowded halls at the University of Paris when still in his early twenties. Dee was an expert in mathematics, astronomy and navigation. He trained many of those who would go on voyages of discovery for England. In fact, he coined the term \"British Empire\".\n\nAt the same time, he was very interested in magic and Hermetic philosophy. He spent the last third of his life studying mostly these subjects. During his time, these subjects were not thought to be opposed to science. They were thought to be part of science.\n\nHe wrote \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\") in 1564 (about Kabbala and alchemy). He also wrote the preface to the first English translation of Euclid's works.\n\nJonathan Dee ( his real name) was born in London in a Welsh family. The last name Dee cames from the Welsh word \"du\", meaning \"black\". He graduated from St. John's College, Cambridge when he was eighteen. He was a founding fellow of Trinity College. He lectured for a little while at Cambridge. Then he left England to study in continental Europe and lecture in Paris and Louvain. He returned to England in the 1540s.\n\nIn 1555, he was arrested and charged with practicing black magic for having cast horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth; the charges were expanded to treason against Mary. Dee appeared in the Star Chamber and cleared himself. When he was released, he became a scientific advisor to Queen Elizabeth One, even deciding on the best date for her to be crowned in 1558.\n\nHe traveled to Europe with money from Elizabeth I. He was possibly acting as a spy for her. He became a close associate of many Elizabethan explorers and entrepreneurs such as Sir Humphrey Gilbert.\n\nIn 1564, Dee wrote the Hermetic work \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\") about a symbol of his own design which stood for the mystical unity of all creation. This work was highly valued by many people of Dee's time. However there was a secret about it which has been lost. This makes the book hard to understand today.\n\nHe published a \"Mathematical Preface\" to Henry Billingsley's English translation of Euclid's \"Elements\" in 1570. He wrote about how important mathematics was for the other arts and sciences. Because this book was written for the public, it was Dee's most popular work.\n\nDee was not satisfied with his knowledge. In the early 1580s, he started to use supernatural ways to get more knowledge. He wanted to get knowledge from the angels.\n\nHe met Edward Kelly in 1582 and Kelly became his companion. Kelly was a convicted forger. Kelly helped Dee to get visions from angels using a crystal ball. The angels gave them a language called Enochian and dictated several books through Kelly. Dee's crystal ball ended up in the British Museum. It went unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection. Most of the still existing papers of Dee are also in the British Museum.\n\nIn 1583, while Dee was away in Europe, his home and library at Mortlake were destroyed by a mob. Later, Dee came to believe that many of his books had been stolen by former friends and associates. He asked Queen Elizabeth for help. She made him Warden of Christ's College, Manchester, in 1592. He remained in this position until 1604.\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth One died in 1603, so did Dee's influence: he was forced to retire to his home at Mortlake where he died in poverty.\n\nAbout ten years after his death, the antiquarian Robert Cotton found some of Dee writings, mostly records of Dee's communications with angels. Cotton's son gave these writings to the scholar Méric Casaubon, who published them in 1659 as \"A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.\"\n\nThis was the public had heard about Dee's spiritual conferences. The book was very, very, popular and sold quickly. Because Casaubon wrote in his introduction that Dee was really dealing with evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels, Dee was thought of as a fool for some time.\n\nDee was married three times and had eight children.

It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch. The other hand controls the volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.\n\nThe sound of the theremin is associated with \"alien,\" surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds.

The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film \"Odna\". \n\n\n", "id": "88068", "title": "Theremin"}

He is most famous for his invention of the theremin, one of the first electronic musical instruments.\n\nLéon Theremin was born in Saint Petersburg - renamed Leningrad from 1924 until 1991 - and his family had French ancestry.\n\nHe invented the theremin (also called the \"thereminvox\") in 1919, when his country was in the midst of the Russian Civil War. Theremin also invented the first electronic burglar alarm, which he called a \"radio watchman\".\n\nTheremin moved to the United States, arriving December 30, 1927 with his first wife, Katia Constantinova. He performed the theremin with the New York Philharmonic in 1928. He patented his invention in the United States in 1928 and subsequently granted commercial production rights to RCA. Theremin set up a laboratory in New York in the 1930s, where he developed the theremin and experimented with other electronic musical instruments and other inventions.\n\nTheremin was interested in a role for the theremin in dance music. He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers' movements with varied patterns of sound and light. He worked with the American Negro Ballet. After the Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia, the inventor fell in love with and married the young prima ballerina Lavinia Williams. His marriage to the African-American dancer caused shock and disapproval in his social circles, but the couple remained together.\n\nTheremin abruptly returned to the Soviet Union in 1938. At the time, the reasons for his return were not clear. Some claimed that he was simply homesick, while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials. Beryl Campbell, one of Theremin's dancers, said his wife Lavinia \"called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio\" and that \"some Russians had come in\" and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country.\n\nTheremin was put to work in a secret research and development laboratories in the Soviet Gulag labor camp system. Theremin created the \"Buran\" eavesdropping system which recorded conversations in French and American embassies by measuring the window glass vibrations using a low power infrared beam from a distance. Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB then used Buran to spy on US, British and French embassies.\n\nIn 1945 Theremin invented the first covert listening device (or \"bug\") for spying. Theremin's device was embedded in a carved wooden plaque of the Great Seal of the United States. On August 4, 1945, Soviet school children presented the bugged carving to U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman, as a \"gesture of friendship\" to the USSR's World War II ally. It hung in the ambassador’s Moscow office until 1952, when the bug was discovered by a British radio operator who heard conversations on an open radio channel. The CIA found the device in the Great Seal carving. Peter Wright, a scientist and former MI5 counterintelligence officer, eventually figured out how it worked.\n\nAfter his release from the labor camp in 1947, Theremin volunteered to remain working with the KGB until 1966. By 1947 Theremin had remarried, to Maria, and they had two children: Lena and Natalia.\n\nAfter working for the KGB, Theremin worked at the Moscow Conservatory of Music for 10 years where he taught and built Theremins, electronic cellos and some Terpsitones. There he was discovered by a visiting New York Times correspondent, but when an article by Christopher Walker appeared, according to Lydia, the Vice President of the conservatory said \"The people don't need electronic music. Electricity is for killing traitors in the electric chair\", fired Theremin, closed his laboratory and had his instruments destroyed.\n\nAfter 51 years in the Soviet Union Léon Theremin started travelling, first visiting France in June 1989 and then the United States in 1991, each time accompanied by his daughter Natalia, where he was reunited with Clara Rockmore who performed a number of concerts at this time. He also made a demonstration concert at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in early 1993 before dying in Moscow in 1993 at the age of 97.\n\nLéon Theremin is the subject of the documentary movie, \"\", written, directed, and produced by Steven M. Martin. The documentary was a winner at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994. The movie features legendary thereminists Clara Rockmore and Lydia Kavina as well as electronic instrument pioneer Robert Moog, Nicolas Slonimsky, The Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson, and Theremin himself.\n\n\n", "id": "88073", "title": "Léon Theremin"}

The cloth was sewn very little, or not at all. The cloth was then put around the body and held in place by belts, fibulae, or other fastenings. The cloth was made from linen or wool.\n\nThe peplos (plural: \"peploi\") was a garment worn by women of ancient Greece. The peplos was a large square piece of cloth. The cloth was then folded over to create a double layer, called \"apoptygma\", in the upper part of the body. The cloth is then folded around the body, and fastened over each shoulder. \nThe \"ionic\" or \"laconic peplos\" was open on the side of the body, while the \"doric peplos\" was sewn shut like a tube. The peplos was worn in such a way that the opening was on the right side of the body. Usually a belt was worn over the peplos. The belt could be worn over or under the \"apoptygma\". \n\nIn Greece, the peplos was mostly worn before the 5th century.\n\nThe chiton was made from a large square piece of cloth. It was worn by both women and men.\n\nThe \"doric chiton\" was very simple. It was made with a large piece of cloth (usually wool). The cloth was folded and put around the body. It was fastened on the shoulders using brooches and then allowed to fall into folds. A belt, often called a \"gurdle\", was worn around the waist to hold the dress in place.\n\nThe \"ionic chiton\" was sewn like a tube. The material, usually linen, was folded and sewn with holes left for the head and arms. A belt was also worn on the Ionic style to keep it in position and to make it fall into folds from the waist down.\n\nThe himation (plural: \"himatia\") was a big cloth that was used as a cloak. It was worn by both men and women. The himation was usually put from the back over the left shoulder; the other part of the himation was put under the right arm, and then around the front of the body. The himation was so long that it went down to the knees, or it could also be longer. \n\nThe himation was usually made from a lighter cloth, so that it was used as a cloak against warm weather.\n\nThe chlamys (plural: \"chlamydes\") was a usually shorter cloak. It was a piece of cloth put over the left shoulder, and fastened over the right shoulder. The chlamys was typically worn by men or soldiers.\n\nWomen in Ancient Greece wore long dresses and cloaks. They wore the peplos and chiton, and the himation.\n\nCosmetics and make-up were used in Ancient Greece. White lead was used to whiten the skin. White skin for women was seen as a sign of beauty. Juice made from alkanet roots was used to give the cheeks a rosy colour (like rouge). Eye shadow (probably made from ashes) was popular. Lipstick was also used. Perfumes were also important.\n\nMen's clothing was even simpler than women's (if anything). The most important piece of clothing was a shorter version of the chiton, which was also belted at the waist. The top shoulder was often left bare if the man was exercising or doing hard work. The himation was also used, especially on long journeys. A long robe could also be worn with the right shoulder left not covered. Men usually wore no clothes training for military reasons.They wore no clothes when exercising\n\nAt home people went without shoes, but in the streets or when travelling they wore leather sandals. These were very simple and usually made to measure - the man or woman went to the cobbler's shop and put his foot on a piece of leather, and the sole was cut out round the foot. The sole was attached to the foot by leather thongs tied across the instep and round the ankle.\n", "id": "88122", "title": "Clothing in Ancient Greece"}

They are not controlled by the Federal Government or the State Governments. There are laws which say what sort of cases the courts can hear and pass judgment on, and what type of punishment a court can give. But no law or minister can say that a person is guilty. Only the courts can do this.\n\nCourts give protection to ordinary people from bad governments, they are also protected from bad governments themselves.\nGermany has had free courts for longer than it has been a democracy, although under the Nazis many judges ignored the law and did what the Nazi Party wanted. This is why they were tried at the Nuremberg Judges Trial\n\nGermany is a \"Rechtsstaat\". That means it is a government based on law. All citizens are guaranteed to be equal, and government decisions can be challenged in court.\n\nNo law or minister can say that a person, or group of people is guilty.\n\nFederal law sets out the structure of the judiciary. Running courts is up to the Länder. The Länder (\"States of Germany\") are run the lower levels of the court system; only the highest courts are paid for by the federal government.\n\nThis federal-Land split means that the Federation (that is, the Federal Government) can make sure laws are enforced equally throughout the country, because it says what courts must be set up. The Länder administer the courts, and this stops the federal government from being able to order the courts to do things, or to appoint the judges. This helps keep the courts independent.\n\nGermany has a system of Roman law. This is different from the United States and England which use the common law.\n\nIn a common law system courts rely on \"precedents\" (what was decided in similar cases earlier) . In Germany, courts look to a comprehensive system of legal codes. The codes set out legal principles or basic ideas, and have to decide each case by comparing the facts of the case to those principles, not to what another judges decided earlier.\n\nBecause the legal codes are very important and complicated, judges must be very well trained.\n\nJudges are not chosen from practicing lawyers, as in the UK and USA. Instead being a judge is a separate career\n\nAt the end of their legal education at university, all law students must pass a state examination before they can continue on to an apprenticeship that provides them with broad training in the legal profession over two years. They then must pass a second state examination that qualifies them to practice law. After the second exam a person must choose either to be a lawyer or to be a judge.\n\nThose who choose to be a judge start working at courts immediately. However they are on \"probation\" (a temporary training period) for up to four years before being appointed as judges for lifetime.\n\nGermany has three types of courts.\n\nThe are four levels of ordinary courts:\n\n\nSpecialized courts deal with administrative, labor, social, fiscal, and patent law.\n\nThe is a Federal Patents Court in Munich adjudicates disputes relating to industrial property rights. Patents are a federal issue, so now state courts have been set up.\n\nEach Land has a state constitutional court. These courts are administratively and financially independent from any other government body. For instance, a Land constitutional court can write its own budget and hire or fire employees.\n\nThese courts hear cases where the constitution and the rights it gives are in question.\n\nFor example, a criminal case might be appealed from the Bundesgerichtshof if a persons human rights are involved.\n\nThe Federal Constitutional Court, the \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\", can check that the way other courts look at the law to make sure they do not forget these basic rights. Sometimes the Federal Constitutional Court has overturned the decisions of other federal courts.\n\nThe \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\" protects people's rights under the constitution in another way. It is the only court that can ban a political party, if it is acting or says it will act against the constitution.\n", "id": "88216", "title": "Courts of Germany"}

He is an Institute Professor and professor emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \n\nChomsky created the theory of generative grammar. This is one of the most important contributions to the field of linguistics made in the 20th century. He also helped start the cognitive revolution in psychology through his review of B. F. Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior\". He challenged the behaviorist way of looking at behavior and language. This was the main approach used in the 1950s. His natural approach to the study of language also changed the philosophy of language and mind. He also invented the Chomsky hierarchy, a way of looking at formal languages in terms of their power to explain language. \n\nAccording to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar during the 1980–1992 time period. He was the eighth-most cited scholar in any time period.\n\nIn the 1960s he criticized the Vietnam War. Because of that, Chomsky became more widely known for his media criticism and politics. He is a key intellectual figure within the left wing of United States politics. Chomsky is widely known for his political activism, and for his criticism of the foreign policy of the United States and other governments. Chomsky often calls himself a libertarian socialist and an anarcho-syndicalist, and he has talked and written extensively on these subjects. He is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, following his father William Chomsky who was also a member.\n\nIn late 2015, Chomsky announced his support for Vermont U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in the upcoming 2016 United States presidential election.\n\n\n", "id": "88302", "title": "Noam Chomsky"}

He was one of the greatest composers of his time. He is best known for his church music, including many masses as well as motets and songs.\n\nObrecht’s father was a trumpeter. His mother died when he was about 2 years old and his father remarried. We know nothing about Obrecht’s musical education. He may have learned to play the trumpet like his father, who worked for the Burgundian court. Perhaps his father introduced him to people at the court, such as the famous composer Antoine Busnois. He certainly must have known Busnois’ music.\n\nFrom 1480-1484 he was a choirmaster at Bergen-op-Zoom. Then he got a very good job as choirmaster at Cambrai Cathedral. However, a year later he took another job in Bruges. He wrote a lot of church music during his years in Bruges. He travelled to Italy and went to the town of Ferrara where a lot of famous musicians worked. He stayed there for several months. This may have been the reason why he then lost his job in Bruges. His next job was in Antwerp where he worked from 1492 to 1498. He then got his old job back in Bruges. From 1501 to 1503 he once again worked at Antwerp where he was choirmaster at the church of Our Lady. In 1504 he got the job of maestro di cappella at Ferrara, but the following year he died of the plague.\n\nObrecht composed extremely quickly. He is supposed to have written one of his masses in one night. This was different to Josquin des Prez who spent a long time composing his pieces and making changes to them before he let anyone have copies. Obrecht was influenced by the music of Busnois and Ockeghem. Obrecht himself was a big influence on Josquin, even though Josquin was older than Obrecht.\n\nIn recent years musicologists have studied Obrecht’s music a lot and made many discoveries, including the correct dates for many of his works.\n", "id": "88368", "title": "Jacob Obrecht"}

He wrote church music, such as motets, as well as (non-religious) chansons. He was the most important composer of the late Burgundian school after the death of Guillaume Dufay.\n\nWe do not know where Busnois was born. It might have been in the tiny village of Business in the Artois district. Maybe he took his name from the village.\n\nNothing is known about his musical education. We know that he got into trouble in 1461 because he was said to be in a group of people who beat up a priest on five occasions. At that time he was a chaplain in Tours cathedral. While the attack was being investigated he went to mass. This led to him being excommunicated, but later the pope pardoned him.\n\nIn 1465 he moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of St. Martin, also in Tours, where he became a subdeacon. Johannes Ockeghem was treasurer there, and the two composers seem to have known each other well. Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers, where he not only became \"maîtrise\" (master of the choirboys), but managed to get lots of good singers from the region. By this time he was famous as a singing teacher and composer. However he left the job for some reason in 1466 and then moved to Burgundy.\n\nBy 1467 Busnois was a composer at the court of Burgundy. Soon Charles the Bold was on the throne. Charles fought many wars, and sometimes took Busnois and other musicians on his military journeys. In 1477 Charles was killed at the Battle of Nancy. Busnois continued to work for the Burgundian court until 1482. Nothing is known about what he did after that. He died in 1492.\n\nHe was very well known as a composer and his music was sung in many parts of Europe. \nHe was the probably the best-known musician in Europe between the time of Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem. \n\nBusnois wrote and music. It is likely that a lot of his music is now lost. Two of his masses and eight motets have survived. The style of his music is somewhere between the simple homophonic music of Dufay and Binchois, and the more elaborate imitation of Josquin..\n\nBusnois may have been the composer of the famous tune \"L'homme armé\", one of the most popular tunes of the Renaissance. The tune was often used as a cantus firmus for mass composition. He may have been the very first composer to write a mass based on \"L'homme armé\". This mass was a big influence on many composers.\n\nBusnois is remembered today for many of his chansons (French secular songs). Some of the tunes were used by later composers in their masses.\n\n", "id": "88380", "title": "Antoine Busnois"}

The word \"robosexuality\" comes from combining the words \"robot\" and \"sexual\".\n\nA robosexual can be heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or pansexual. This is because the robot may have sexual features. Many robots in the world do not show male or female qualities, so a pansexual-robosexual would feel attracted to these, if the robot appeared human. If a person is attracted to a robot that does not appear human it is called paraphilia.\n\nRoughly 50% of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% in Australasia and 1% in Africa.\n\n40% of all robots in the world are found in Japan.\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, ideas of future robots have been mainly positive. The number of robots in Japan means more people in Japan are likely to have a love of gadgets. Manga and anime series in both countries often show love or sex between robots and humans. This would mean more robosexuality.\n\nJapanese religious beliefs allow the idea that robots have souls. This also makes the idea of love between humans and robots more acceptable or ordinary.\n\nThe idea of physical sexuality is less accepted in the west than in Japan. Western societies are more likely to be against, or even fear the development of robots. This is because a lot of films and books show robots as replacing humans instead of helping them. Also, the religious beliefs in this area of the world (Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) show robots to be wrong, because they are doing God's part in creating, which they say only God should do.\n\n'RealDoll' is a lifesize sex-doll sold in America, that can be sold with robotic implants.

The name \"Moulin Rouge\" means \"Red Windmill\". In the late 1800s there was a real windmill where the nightclub stands near Montmartre in Paris. Now there is a large model of a windmill on the roof of the building. Since 1889 this nightclub has been famous for its dancing, in particular for the \"can-can\", a very lively dance in which the dancers, wearing long frilly skirts, kick their legs very high and show their underwear. (In the 1890s, women wore long dresses, to their ankles.) Even though this entertainment was not thought of as very polite, it was very popular and the \"can-can\" became a symbol of Paris. The \"Moulin Rouge\" is still very popular.\nThe word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia. The word was then used for poor artists and writers, who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money by their painting or writing. Paris was a famous town for both painters and writers to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the \"Moulin Rouge\". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art.\n\n\"La bohème\" means \"the Bohemian\". It is the name of a famous opera written by Giacomo Puccini. It is about a young man who lives in a group of poor artists and writers, and who meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl. The opera is very well known and Baz Luhrmann deliberately used parts of the story in his movie. The plot of the movie is very much like another opera called \"La traviata\" written by Giuseppe Verdi. It is also thought that Luhrmann may have got the idea to make \"Moulin Rouge!\" after watching \"Dil Se\". This movie was made in 1998 and directed by Mani Ratnam. It is a love story set in India.\n\nThere have been four previous movies called \"Moulin Rouge\". The earliest was a silent movie made in 1928. The latest was made in 1956 and was about the life of the painter, Toulouse-Lautrec. Baz Luhrmann used Toulouse-Lautrec as an important character in his movie.\n\nBaz Luhrmann had directed another movie in which a love story is set against a background of dance, costumes and colourful scenes. This is \"Strictly Ballroom\" made in 1992. In \"Moulin Rouge!\", he chose the colourful life of Paris in a time often called \"the Naughty Nineties\" as a background. But Lurhmann's plan was not to make a movie about history. He wanted to make a movie that the people of today would enjoy, just as much as the people of Paris had enjoyed the can-can in the 1890s. So Luhrmann did not use the music, dance-styles and lighting of the 1890s. He used popular modern music that young people already knew, and he used modern lighting, special effects and costume ideas to create a movie that young people would think was very entertaining.\n\nKate Winslet, Charlize Theron, Renee Zellweger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones were all thought of for the part of Satine. Courtney Love was almost cast in the role, but lost out to Kidman at the last minute because Luhrmann felt that Love would not fit into the movie well. Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman, and Russell Crowe were all considered for the part of Christian.\n\nProduction on the movie began in November 1999 and was finished in May 2000, with a budget of just over $50 million. Nicole Kidman reportedly wasn't interested in doing the musical until she heard Baz Luhrmann would be directing it. Filming generally went smoothly, with the only major problem being when Nicole Kidman injured her knee while filming one of the more complicated dance sequences. The production also overran in its shooting schedule and had to be out of the Fox Studios in Sydney to make way for \"\" (in which Ewan McGregor also starred). This meant some parts had to be filmed in Madrid, Spain.\n\n\nThe movie is set in the year 1900. Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) is a British writer who came to the village of Montmartre in Paris in 1899, when the Bohemian movement was at its most popular. He sits in a flat looking down on the closed-down theatre called the Moulin Rouge while writing on a typewriter. The story he is writing is about the woman he loved, Satine (played by Nicole Kidman).\n\nIn 1899, Christian arrives in Paris, and makes friends with a group of Bohemians who visit the Moulin Rouge regularly. They are trying to produce a musical called \"Spectacular Spectacular\", which the owner of the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (played by Jim Broadbent), plans to show at the cabaret. The Bohemians' leader, Toulouse-Lautrec (played by John Leguizamo), is pleased with Christian's talent at writing and insists that he write their musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". Once they find out that Christian is an amazing writer, they come up with an complicated plan of presenting Christian to Satine, who is a beautiful courtesan, in the hopes that she will be impressed with him and persuade Zidler to hire Christian as the writer of the musical.\nSatine understands what her work involves, although she hopes of leaving the Moulin Rouge to become a \"real\" actress. Through a series of misunderstandings, she mistakes Christian for the rich and powerful Duke who will invest in the musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". She is enchanted by his poetry. She declares that she has fallen in love with him, but is shocked to realize he's actually a poor Bohemian poet. \n\nAfter a bit, the real Duke (played by Richard Roburgh) finds Christian and Satine together. They manage to trick him into believing that they were working on the musical, \"Spectacular Spectacular\". The main cast arrive and improvise the plot of the show on the spot: a beautiful Indian courtesan has her kingdom invaded by an \"evil maharaja\". She sets out to seduce him to save her kingdom, but accidentally seduces and then falls in love with a penniless sitar player. The two must hide their love and avoid the maharaja, though it is implied that one of them may die at the end of the story. (It is soon realized that the theme of their play foreshadows what happens in the movie's plot.) The Duke agrees to support the show. But, he quickly shows that he is a violently jealous man who will shut down the Moulin Rouge if he does not get Satine to himself. Nevertheless, he accepts that Satine will be busy with rehearsals and in close contact with Christian, the writer of the musical.\n\nChristian and Satine fall in love, while Zidler struggles to keep the Duke interested in the musical \"Spectacular Spectacular\" even though Satine has not yet slept with him. Harold Zidler also discovers that Satine is dying of a disease called tuberculosis, but does not tell anyone because of his motto, \"The show must go on\". Meanwhile, Christian continues to work on the play, in which the courtesan and the penniless sitar player end up together. The Duke, however, does not appreciate the ending and tells the cast that the courtesan must end up with the maharaja. To convince the Duke to change his mind, Satine finally agrees to spend the night with him. Christian is overcome with jealousy while Satine has dinner with the Duke, who offers her everything she has dreamt of. However, when Satine spots Christian on the street below, she refuses the Duke's offer, and he tries to rape her. After she escapes, Satine and Christian plan to run away.\n\nBy now, the Duke has realized Satine's tricks, and tells Zidler that, if the \"maharaja\" does not get his \"courtesan\", he will have the \"penniless sitar player\" killed. Nonetheless, Zidler must inform Satine of her final condition before she agrees to give up on the escape plan. She goes to Christian and lies to him, convincing him that her love was an act in the hopes that this will make him want to leave Paris and therefore save his life.\n\nAs the show opens, Satine performs tiredly, knowing that her life is almost up. Christian, refusing to give up on Satine, confronts her backstage. When she tries to force him off again, he takes the place of the show's hero, throwing money at her feet to \"pay his whore\", and storming off the stage. Satine confesses her love for him in the form of his secret song, and Christian and Satine get back together in full view of the audience and the Duke. The Duke attempts to shoot Christian, but Zidler forces him off. The audience applauds what they think is a good drama, but backstage, Satine is overcome by her illness and dies in Christian's arms. As her final wish, she asks Christian to tell their story.\n\nA year later, still in his flat overlooking the empty red windmill, Christian finally types the last page of his work, ending it with the couplet, \"The greatest thing you will ever learn, is just to love, and be loved in return.\" \n\nThe following is a list of some of the songs featured in the movie along with the artist that popularized them.\n\nElephant Love Medley\n\nTwo soundtrack albums were released, with the second coming after the huge success of the first one. The first volume featured the smash hit single \"Lady Marmalade\", performed by Christina Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Mýa and Pink. The first soundtrack, \"Moulin Rouge! Music From Baz Luhrmann's Film\", was released in May 2001, with the second \"Moulin Rouge!

Out of the entire human population in the world, 19% are Han Chinese. Han Chinese have the highest concentrations in the Eastern Provinces of China, particularly in the Hebei, Jiangsu, and Guangdong regions. The United States is home to the largest overseas Han Chinese community, exemplified in the group's prominence in New York City's Chinatown. \n\nThe name \"Han\" comes from the Han Dynasty that united China as one country. During the Han Dynasty, many tribes felt that they belonged to the same ethnic group. Also, the Han Dynasty is said to be the high point in Chinese civilization. During the Han Dynasty, China was able to increase its power and influence to other parts of Asia.\n\nThere are some slang words and different names for Han amongst some Han people, especially in southern China and in Vietnam. In languages like Cantonese, Hakka and Min Nan, the word \"Táng Rén\" is also used. \"Táng Rén\" is written as \"唐人\" and it literally means \"the people of Tang.\" It is pronounced \"Tong Yan\" in Cantonese. \"唐人\" comes from another Chinese dynasty, the Tang Dynasty. The Tang Dynasty is also another peak point of the Chinese civilization. Within English-speaking Han communities, the word \"Chinatown\" in Chinese is \"Táng Rén Jiē\" which means \"street of the Tang people.\"\n\nAnother phrase used by the Han people, especially overseas Chinese, is \"Hua Ren\" (). It comes from \"Zhong Hua\" (), a poetic name for China. The translation of this is \"ethnic Chinese\".\n\nHan China is one of the world's oldest civilizations. Chinese culture dates back thousands of years. Some Han people believe they share common ancestors, distantly related to the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor, who existed thousands of years ago. Hence, some people of Han call themselves \"Descendants of the Yan Emperor\" or \"Descendants of the Yellow Emperor.\"\n\nThroughout the history of China, Chinese culture has been influenced by Confucianism. Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China's history, and becoming a professional of Confucian texts was needed to be part of the imperial bureaucracy.\n\n\n", "id": "88517", "title": "Han Chinese"}

It is sold on these networks:\n\nCanada:\n\nPeru:\n\nUK:\n\nUSA:\n\nAs of July 2006, Australian Telecommunications giant Telstra is offering the V3x Blue (as well as Pink) version for $0 upfront on a $20 plan.\n\nThe dark blue version available from Tesco in the UK is a V3r with no memory slot or iTunes, (and more difficult to unlock).\n\nAt October 30, 2006, the phone was sold with a tattoo design on it on T-Mobile in USA. The tattoo designs were made by Ami James from the TLC reality television show, Miami Ink.\n\nAfter the \"RAZR V3\", Motorola sold the RAZR V3i. This newer version of the phone improved some of the things that were bad about the original phone, for example, it had a better (1.23 megapixel) camera with 8x digital zoom, better screens, and allowed people to use memory cards in them. The V3i software is very similar to the Motorola V635.\n\nThe V3i can has iTunes music player, which has a 50 or 100 song limit on the phone, depending on where the phone was made.\n\nThe Motorola RAZR V3i was on most networks in the world in 2005–2006. In the U.S. the phone was released through Cingular Wireless on September 6, 2006, with a new activation price of $299.\n\nThis was the original color.\n\nAt December 8, 2005 Motorola worked with Dolce & Gabbana, the Italian fashion company, to produce a special version of the RAZR V3i, the \"Motorola RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana\". The phone was gold in color. Only 1,000 of the original limited version phones were made and sold.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, Motorola and Dolce & Gabbana started selling the RAZR V3i Dolce & Gabbana again. This version had a D&G leather holder, Bluetooth headphone, and FM earphones. It was sold at all big Motorola shops and some D&G shops.\n\nA red version was sold for the (PRODUCT)RED charity. A percentage of the profit went to the charity to help fight AIDS in Africa.\n\nThe RAZR V3r and RAZR V3t are different versions the RAZR V3i. Instead of having iTunes, they have Motorola's Digital Audio Player (DAP) music player, which has no song limit, but takes longer to load, and uses more battery. However, it takes considerably longer time to load and uses the V3's battery at a much faster rate than iTunes does.\n", "id": "88618", "title": "Motorola RAZR V3"}

However, Buddhism did not grow strong until much later. In the 8th century, an Indian teacher called Padmasambhava brought Buddhism to Tibet again while Trisong Detsen was king of Tibet. Padmasambhava (more commonly known as \"Guru Rinpoche\") merged Buddhism with the local Bön religion to create Tibetan Buddhism. He also wrote a number of important texts. \n\nTibetan Buddhism had a strong effect on the peoples of Central Asia in the 11th century CE, especially in Mongolia and Manchuria. It was made the official state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty and the Manchu Qing dynasty that ruled China.\n\nSince the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1959, Tibetan Buddhism has spread to many Western countries.\n\nTibetan Buddhism has four main schools. Two of these schools hold practice as more important and two hold scholasticism (study of philosophy) more important.

The people who are in the band all came from Magdeburg in Germany. The youngest, the Kaulitz twins, were born two months before the Berlin Wall was taken down.\n\nTokio Hotel was started by singer Bill Kaulitz and guitarist Tom Kaulitz, who are identical twin brothers. Their step father owns a music school named \"Rock School\". The drummer is Gustav Schäfer and bass-guitarist is Georg Listing. The four met in 2001 after a live show in a Magdeburg club, where Listing and Schäfer, who knew each other from music school, watched from the audience while Bill and Tom Kaulitz played on the stage. Using the name \"Devilish\", the band began playing in talent shows and small concerts. After Bill Kaulitz took part in a children's Star Search in 2003 at age thirteen (which he lost in the quarter-final), he was discovered by music producer Peter Hoffmann. Devilish changed their name to \"Tokio Hotel\": \"Tokio\", the German spelling of the Japanese city Tokyo, because they love the city, and \"Hotel\" because of their constant touring and living in hotels. Soon after Sony BMG took them under contract, Hoffmann hired David Jost and Pat Benzner into the team of creators and authors. They guided the teens on songwriting and instrument playing; most of the songs of the first album were written by Hoffmann, Jost, Benzer, and Bill Kaulitz (including the singles \"Scream\" and \"Rescue me\" which were completely written by them). Only the single \"Unendlichkeit\" was written completely by Tokio Hotel themselves. However, shortly before release of their first album, Sony ended their contract. In 2005, Universal Music Group took Tokio Hotel under contract and developed a marketing plan. The band has now become one of the biggest acts from Germany.\n\nBill Kaulitz (born September 1 1989, in Leipzig, Germany) is the lead singer of Tokio Hotel. He is the twin brother of Tom Kaulitz. Bill is ten minutes younger than Tom. They used to live in Magdeburg, Germany. Before making Tokio Hotel, the band was called Devilish. Bill was on the German star search but he lost in 2001. Because of Bill going on the Star Search he came to be known by Peter Hoffman. Tokio Hotel soon got a job with Sony but in 2005 Sony ended it. After the first European tour, Bill lost his voice and found out he had cyst on his vocal cords. He had surgery and it took three weeks to get better. He then went back to having concerts with the band.\n\nTom Kaulitz was born on September 1 1989, in Leipzig ten minutes before his identical twin brother, Bill. He is from Magdeburg in Germany. Tom and Bill now live in Berlin, Germany. As of September 2007, Tom is using Gibson guitars. He has stated his musical influences to be Aerosmith and German hip-hop such as Samy Deluxe. \n\nGeorg Listing was born on March 31 1987. His hometown is Halle. He began playing bass when he was thirteen years old, as of September 2007, uses a Sandberg bass. He has said that his playing style was heavily influenced by Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers, and other musical influences include Die Ärzte and Oasis.\n\nGustav Schäfer was born on September 8 1988, in his hometown of Magdeburg, and has an older sister. Gustav has been playing the drums since he was five. His musical influences include Metallica, Joe Cocker and Rod Stewart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "88666", "title": "Tokio Hotel"}

Where its name came from is not known; it may be named after the mythical Hercules, or after an unknown woman of that name. Most of the asteroids found by Wolf around this date were named for characters in operas, but if this name was also drawn from such a source, no explanation has been recorded.\n\nHerculina is one of the twenty or so biggest members of the main asteroid belt.\n\nIt has often been noted for its complex lightcurves, which made finding its shape and rotation somewhat hard. A set of 1982 speckle inferometry observations led to a simple preliminary model of Herculina as a three-axis object, perhaps 260 by 220 by 215 km. 1985 analysis of this data concluded there was a nonspherical shape with one bright spot, whilst a 1987 photometric astrometry study concluded the object was spherical with two dark spots (and rotated around a completely different pole), which was in turn negated by a 1988 thermal study which showed the object could not be spherical. By the late 1980s, the generally accepted model was a three-axis object with major albedo or topographical features.\n\nRecent (2002) modelling of photometric data shows that Herculina is not spherical, but a blocky shape not unlike a battered cuboid - or, as the analysis described it, it \"resembles a toaster\". This analysis indicates the presence of many big craters, similar to 253 Mathilde, but no major changes in albedo. The approximate ratios of the axes were suggested as 1:1.1:1.3, broadly consistent with earlier models if a bit more stretched.\n\nFollowing anomalous sightings during an occultation of the star SAO 1220774 in 1978, Herculina became the first asteroid to be \"confirmed\" to have an asteroid moon, with the parent asteroid estimated at a 216 km diameter and a moon of about 45 km orbiting at a distance of around 1,000 km. However, careful studying in 1993, using the Hubble Space Telescope, could not locate a moon.\n\n", "id": "88711", "title": "532 Herculina"}

It tries to persuade organisations in the UK and abroad to communicate with the public simply. In 1990, Plain English Campaign created the Crystal Mark, its \"seal of approval.\" This is a symbol printed on documents which the Plain English campaign thinks are very easy to understand. According to the Plain English Campaign, the symbol appears on over 20,000 documents worldwide.\n\nThe Plain English Campaign also gives out an annual \"Foot in Mouth Award\" for \"a baffling comment by a public figure.\" The name of this award comes from a humorous English idiom. If a person has their \"foot in their mouth,\" that means they are speaking badly and not paying attention to what they are saying. The plain English Campaign also gives out a \"Golden Bull Award\" for \"the worst examples of written tripe\". The name of this award also comes from a common English idiom. \"Bull\" is short for \"bullshit,\" which literally means the excrement of a bull, but is often used to mean stupid, dishonest or unbelievable speech or writing. The word \"tripe,\" similar to \"bullshit,\" has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Literally, it means a food made from an animal's stomach lining. As it is used here, \"tripe\" means something very close to \"bullshit.\"\n\nIn other words, the Plain English Campaign's \"Foot in Mouth Award\" is given to someone famous who speaks stupidly. The \"Golden Bull Award\" is given to someone famous who writes stupidly. Both awards are sarcastic. They are different from normal awards because they criticise, rather than honor, the people they are given to. Famous winners of the Foot in Mouth Award include George W. Bush and Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nPlain English Campaign has worked for many organisations. Many UK forms and bills carry the Crystal Mark, including the British passport application form. Plain English Campaign is often described in the media as a \"pressure group.\" \n\nIt regularly makes public comments about language-related news stories and about jargon. For example, in 2006 its supporters voted Bill Shankly the author of the greatest football quotation of all time. Plain English Campaign did a survey in 2004 and announced that ‘At the end of the day’ was considered the most irritating cliché.

Tau would be equal to two times pi, or about 6.283.\n\nThese people want to use Tau because they think it would be easier for everyone to understand. There are many reasons in math why Tau could be useful or helpful. One of the simplest is that it would make learning about radians easier.\n\nA radian is a way of measuring the angle of a circle. It says that the number of radians in an angle is equal to the length of the outside of the circle, or the 'Arc length', that is covered by an angle, divided by the Radius, or distance from the point in the center of a circle to anywhere on the outside. There is a picture down on the bottom right that shows this.\n\nIf the distance covered around the outside of a circle is equal to the radius, than one radian is being covered. Around the whole outside of a circle, there are about 6.283 radians - or, Tau radians (Tau is just a number, like 0, or 7, or 100).\n\nThe advantage of this is that if you turn one quarter of a circle, you will have turned Tau / 4 radians. If you turn one half of a circle, you have covered Tau / 2 radians. This might make more sense. You can see a drawing of this in the bottom right of the page.\n\nNot many people use Tau yet, but more and more are.\n", "id": "88843", "title": "Tau"}

He began by saying that most Americans could not understand the article. He referred to a study by John P. Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading. He mentioned the continuing decline in newspaper sales, and referred to a guess by Leonard Riggio, CEO of Barnes & Noble, that 50% of books sold by his company were never read. He quoted Samuel Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book. Sherman went on, in his article, to mention the growing need for skillful commmunication in American business but also the decreasing quality of the same activity. He quoted Monsanto CEO Richard Mahoney on the importance of reading in helping a business manager to see connections between events. He described print media as being first among different media with respect to (1) the amount of information conveyed by so few widely understood symbols, (2) portability, (3) suitability for the user's own speed of use, and (4) economical distribution of broad and deep information which can be used immediately.\n\nSherman said that Motorola was making preparations to pay $5,000,000 to teach workers reading and other basic skills, and that, since 1982, Ford Motor Company had already sent 32,000 workers on a similar program. He said that Simon & Schuster predicted a market of $500,000,000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations.

It was written by Adam Smith in 1776. It looks at division of work, following self-interest, and freedom of trade.\n\nThe book was the beginning of classical economics, and market economics. Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves, the result would be best for society. Before that, economics was about the king's personal interests, and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king's treasury. Smith said what's important is what's best for the whole nation, and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation. He wanted to discover how wealth can grow, and how people could do things to support that growth. Smith's book said land, labor, and capital were the three \"factors of production\" and the main contributors to a nation's wealth.\n\nPrices naturally adjust to having more or less of something: supply and demand. If there is too much of something (more supply), prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it. If a lot of people want something (high demand), there may not be enough of it (scarcity); there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it, and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want, and prices go up. \nSmith said markets should be free. At the time, some big companies (like the East India Company) were controlled by the government. Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers. For example, in the American colonies, colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it. They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing, then buy it back after it was finished. Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society. He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference. Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price. This way if people did what was best for them, it would end up being best for society as a whole, almost like an \"invisible hand\" was guiding everything.\n", "id": "88861", "title": "The Wealth of Nations"}

He has won many art prizes in China dealing with Chinese traditional art, his pieces are mostly landscapes, people, and close-up flowers and bamboo. \n\nYuHuan was an only son of Aixinjueluo Pu Shu Ming who has lived in the Prince Gong Mansion for some time after the Qing Dynasty was overruled.

In Junior High School, he has already started publishing his own comics on the newspapers, he became more and more interested in the arts, he eventually applied and was accepted by the Arts Department of the Beijing Normal University. The art he was taught at the Beijing Normal University was Western art although he was used to Chinese paintings.\n\nArtist YuHuan was also a sanxian musician, his lessons with traditional Chinese instruments started when he was a child, and still living in the Prince Gong Mansion. At his death, he had already mastered many difficult pieces and he played until his late 60s.\n\nAt the age of eight, he started to learn the sanxian, a 500-year-old Chinese three-string, plucked instrument.

It was created by the Scottish sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi in London, 1952. Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Roy Lichtenstein are examples of pop artists.\n\nPop art has themes and techniques drawn from popular mass culture, such as advertising and comic books. Pop art employs images of popular as opposed to elitist culture in art.\n\nThe Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1951, is regarded as the starting point of the pop art movement. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of \"fine art\". The group discussions centered on popular culture implications from such elements as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology.\n\nAt the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled \"Bunk!\" that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947–1949. This material consisted of 'found objects' such as, advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics that mostly represented American popular culture. One of the images in that presentation was Paolozzi's 1947 collage, \"I was a Rich Man's Plaything\", which includes the first use of the word \"pop″, appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. After Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.\n\nThe artists use mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques which downplay the expressive hand of the artist.\n\nPop artists went for absolute clarity. Most forms were bordered with black lines as in comic books. The objects are often plain like a poster, and without perspective. The colours are clear, achromatic and primitive colours.\n\nObjects of the everyday life get isolated and modified or processed in collages. Pop art is a connection between reality and art, handled with abstract means. Some of their catchwords are: popular, consumable, cheap, funny and outstanding.\nMuch of pop art is rather academic, as the unconventional organizational practices used often make it difficult for some to understand. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be the last modern art movements and so the precursors to postmodern art, or some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "88901", "title": "Pop art"}

In the 2001 census, 233,700 people lived there. At that time, Derby was the 18th largest place in England.\n\nThe city has Roman, Saxon and Viking origins. \n\nThe Roman camp of 'Derventio' was probably near to Derby. The site of the old Roman fort is at Chester Green. Later the town was one of the 'Five Boroughs' of the Danelaw.\n\nThe town name is seen as 'Darby' or 'Darbye' on early modern maps, such as that of Speed (1610).\n\nModern research into the history and archaeology of Derby has shown that the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons probably co-existed, occupying two areas of land surrounded by water. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (c. 900) says that \"Derby is divided by water\". These areas of land were known as Norþworþig and Deoraby, and were at the \"Irongate\" (north) side of Derby.\n\nIn World War I, Derby was targeted by German Zeppelin air bombers. They killed five people in a 1916 raid on the town.\n\nAll Saints Church was designated as a cathedral in 1927. That showed that the town was ready for city status.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, slums were cleared out and people were moved to new council estates in the suburbs. There were also houses for sale there. Rehousing, council house building and private housing developments continued on a large scale for some 30 years after the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nDerby became a high profile town internationally in sport following the appointment of Brian Clough as manager of Derby County F.C. in 1967. Promotion to the Football League First Division was achieved in 1969, and County won of the English league three years later. Following the Clough's resignation in 1973, his successor guided County to another league title in 1975, but this is the club's last major trophy to date; relegation followed in 1980 and top flight status was not regained until 1987, since when Derby have spent a total of 10 seasons (across two spells) in the top flight. The club moved from its century-old Baseball Ground in 1997 to the new Pride Park Stadium.\n\nDerby was awarded city status on 7 June 1977 by Queen Elizabeth II. Until then, Derby had been one of the few towns in England with a cathedral but not city status.\n\nDespite its strategic industries (rail and aero-engine), Derby suffered comparatively little damage in both world wars (contrast Bristol and Filton).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89040", "text": "Sound recording\n\nSound recording is the storage of sound so that a person can hear the same sound more than once. It is a process wherein sound waves are captured by a machine. The machine converts the waves into electrical signals or digital data, that are then stored on recording media (such as gramophone records, cassette tapes, compact discs or computer hard drives). The sound can then be played back by reversing the process.\n\nMost recordings are of music, people speaking or singing, and sound effects. They are usually used for entertainment (fun), or for scientific and historical reasons.\n\nSound is recorded onto a medium by different methods. The ways that recordings are made have changed a lot since sound was first recorded.\n\nThe first machines for recording sound were mechanical, not electrical. The phonograph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1877. Phonographs have a spinning cylinder covered in a soft material such as tin foil, lead, wax, or amberol. Sound waves shake a small needle so that its motion carries the waves. As the cylinder turns, the needle draws the motion of the sound waves in the soft coating. This made the cylinder a recording of the sound that was in the needle.\n\nThis recording is played back by tracing another needle through the groove in the cylinder. This recreates the small vibrations in the playback needle. These vibrations could be amplified (made louder) to create louder, more audible sound.\n\nThe phonograph was useful for making single recordings, but a big disadvantage was the difficulty of making copies of the cylinders.\n\nThe problem of copying recordings got better with the invention of the gramophone (also called the \"phonograph\" in American English) around 1888. The gramophone works in much the same way as the phonograph, but instead of a cylinder, the needle's grooves are etched into a disk record which turns on a spinning table. Because the record media was flat, copying recordings was much simpler. Pressing the original recording onto a plate of shellac created a negative master, where the grooves were bumps on the surface instead of being scratched into the surface. The master could be used to produce many copies through the opposite process.\n\nThe first records were made mostly of rubber or shellac, but later records were made of vinyl.\n\nOriginally, records spun at a rate of 78 rotations per minute, or 78 rpm. As technology got better, records could spin more slowly, but still reproduce sound better and play for longer amounts of time. 45 rpm became common in the middle 20th century, and by the late 1900s most records were 33 rpm. \n\nIn the late 1930s the tape recorder appeared. Tape recorders use a magnetic tape as a medium, with a \"recording head\" to store the sound on the tape. Sound waves are converted into an electrical signal inside the recorder. This signal goes into the head, where it changes the polarity of very small magnets. Tape moves past the head at a constant speed, and its magnetic particles are rearranged by these magnets to a pattern that represents the sound wave. These magnetic patterns are much like the small grooves of a cylinder or disc record in the way that they represent the vibration energy of sound waves.\n\nWhen a tape is played back, it runs past a \"playback head\" which reads the magnetic patterns off the tape and converts them back into an electrical signal. The electrical signal can then be converted into sound waves or copied to some other kind of sound-processing machine.\n\nA magnetic tape is divided into several \"tracks\". Each track uses up part of the width of the tape, and can store a completely different recording that can be played back at the same time as the other tracks. A two-track tape has one track on half of the tape and another track on the other half. A four-track tape has four tracks all lying next to one another, like a highway with four lanes. Most tape recordings today are stereophonic (or \"stereo\"), meaning that they have two tracks which are meant to be played together. Usually one is played on the listener's left side and the other is on the listener's right side, to match the listener's two ears.\n\nEarly tapes were wound flat on a storage reel and transferred to a \"take-up reel\" as they were recorded or played. After recording or playback, they were \"rewound\" so that they were stored only on the storage reel. This kind of system is usually called \"reel to reel\" today. It is still used today for some professional recording and playback, but for home use reels were mostly replaced with other kinds of tape in the 1970s. Cassettes are small cartridges containing two reels inside. Cassettes move a four-track tape in either of two directions, corresponding to their \"side A\" and \"side B\" labels. The reel on the left contains the unplayed or unrecorded tape, and the reel on the right contains the tape that has already passed the recording or playback head. When you turn the cassette over, the tape still moves from left to right, but this is really the opposite direction. The \"side A\" recording plays two tracks as stereo, and the \"side B\" recording plays the other two.\n\nEight-track tapes were popular for a while in the 1970s and 1980s. Eight-tracks work much like cassettes, but the tape is a loop: it repeats after being played all the way through. Because it has eight tracks, there are four \"programs\" to select from, each in stereo. Eight-tracks are not very popular anymore, but can still be found in hobbyist collections.\n\nProfessional tape-recording systems may have even more tracks, or might use them differently. Usually a system like this is designed to allow someone to mix the tracks in different ways than they were originally recorded. However, there is a kind of recording called quadraphonic that uses four-track tape to play four different tracks at the same time. A good quadraphonic recording can sound much more \"real\" than stereo or monophonic recordings.\n\nTape recording technology was used from the early days of computing to store digital information. As computer technology improved, so did magnetic tape technology. In the 1980s Digital Audio Tape (DAT) technology emerged. DAT is designed to work much like cassette, except DAT's magnetic patterns represent digital data instead of sound vibrations. This digital data is a digital audio recording which can be copied and reproduced with many different computer systems. Moving to digital takes the medium one step farther from the original sound. Instead of being a sound medium, the DAT is a data medium, and the data is a sound medium. This is more technically complex, but also more flexible. DAT has been used for many kinds of data recording, in addition to sound.\n\nThe compact disc (CD) medium was developed in the 1980s as a new way to bring digital recordings of music to the market. Except for the introduction of the CD-ROM and several kinds of recordable CD, the CD has not changed much since then. Like DAT, it is a data medium rather than a way of recording vibrations directly. It was introduced to provide music in a way that is cheap for manufacturers but relatively high-quality, but it has since been adapted to meet many data-storage needs. Like DAT, the CD requires computer technology to record and to play.\n\nBy the 1990s, CDs had replaced cassettes and records as the main kind of commercial music media. Today, although CDs are still very popular, \"online\" digital recordings like MP3s are gaining fast.\n\nThe earliest methods of recording sound involved the live recording of the performance directly to the recording medium. This was an entirely mechanical process, often called \"acoustical recording\". The sound of the performers was captured by a diaphragm with the cutting needle connect to it. The needle made the grooves in the recording medium.\n\nTo make this process as efficient as possible the diaphragm was located at the apex of a cone and the performer(s) would crowd around the other end. If a performer was too loud then they would need to move back from the mouth of the cone to avoid drowning out the other performers. As a result of this, in early Jazz recordings a block of wood was used in place of the bass drum.\n\nThe introduction of electrical recording made it possible to use microphones to capture the sound of the performance. The leading record labels switched to the electric microphone process in 1925, and most other record companies followed their lead by the end of the decade. Electrical recording increased the flexibity and sound quality. However once the performance was still cut to the recording medium, so if a mistake was made the recording was useless.\n\nElectrical recording made it possible to record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts to a second disc. This is called \"over-dubbing\". The first commercially issued records using over-dubbing were released by the Victor Talking Machine Company in the late 1920s. However overdubbing was of limited use until the introduction of analog audio tape. Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by Les Paul and is called 'sound on sound' recording. In this way performances could be built up over time.\n\nThe analog tape recorder made it possible to erase or record over a previous recording so that mistakes could be fixed. Another advantage of recording on tape is the ability to cut the tape and join it back together. This allows the recording to be edited. Pieces of the recording can be removed, or rearranged. See Audio editing\n\nThe introduction of electronic instruments (especially keyboards and synthesisers), effects and other instruments has led to the importance of MIDI in recording. For example, using MIDI timecode, it is possible to have different equipment 'trigger' without direct human intervention at the time of recording.\n\nIn more recent times, computers (digital audio workstation) have found an increasing role in the recording studio, as their use eases the tasks of cutting and looping, as well as allowing for instantaneous changes, such as duplication of parts, the addition of affects and the rearranging of parts of the recording.\n\n", "id": "89040", "title": "Sound recording"}

They believe the Republic of Lakotah should be treated as a separate country, but at the moment, no other country in the world agrees that it is.\n\nWhen white people first came to North America from Europe, the Lakotah people, who are a native tribe, had already been living there for thousands of years. The Lakotah legally had nothing to do with the USA until they made treaties (agreements) with each other in the 1800s.\n\nSince then, the Lakotah people have lived inside the borders of the USA. On December 17, 2007, the Lakotah Freedom Delegation said that Lakotah should become a separate country again, as it was before they made treaties with the USA.\n\nThey drew up borders, which includes bits of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana. At the moment, most people consider these regions still to belong to the USA.\n\nIn December 2007, the group traveled to Washington, D.C. and spoke to the government. They announced that the Lakotah were withdrawing from the treaties they had with the USA. They said the USA had not been following the treaties and this had been causing problems on Lakotah land.\n\nFor example, the USA and the Lakotah made an agreement called the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which meant the Lakotah could keep the Black Hills. The Black Hills is a very sacred and special place for the Lakotah. But the USA broke the agreement and invaded the Black Hills when they found out that gold was buried there. Now the Black Hills is home to the famous mountain carvings of Mount Rushmore.\n\nThe group says that the Republic of Lakotah is not a new country, but a country that has just been revived. But some members of the Lakotah tribe complain that they were not told about the plans. Many of the leaders of the Lakotah tribe were not asked beforehand. Traditionally, a vote needs to be held if a treaty is going to be changed, and 75% of Lakotah males need to vote in favor of the change. But a vote was not held when the plans for the Republic of Lakotah were being made.\n\nThe group argues that Lakotah is allowed to be its own country, by law. They use the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article Six of the United States Constitution and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to back up their plans.\n\nThe Lakotah Freedom Delegation say they might follow the example of the Philippines or the Marshall Islands, countries which used to belong to the United States but then achieved independence.\n\nAnyone is allowed to be a citizen of the Republic of Lakotah as long as they give up their citizenship of the United States. The group plans to make its own passports and driving licenses.\n\nThe government will be run in the traditional Lakotah way. The elderly people, who receive a lot of respect in Lakotah tradition, will choose leaders to run the country.\n\nAt the moment, supporters of the Lakotah Freedom Delegation are arguing over the name of the country. Some people like the name \"Republic of Lakotah\", but others prefer \"Lakotah Oyate\". \"Oyate\" is the Lakotah word meaning \"nation\".\n\nThe government plans to use solar energy and wind power to make electricity, because these methods do not hurt the environment.\n\nA place does not exist as a country until other countries in the world recognise its borders or its government, and treat it as a separate country. The Lakotah Freedom Delegation has contacted the embassies of Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile and South Africa, asking to be recognised as an independent country. The group has also mentioned Russia, Finland and Iceland, and said that Ireland and East Timor are interested in the plans. But at the moment, no other country in the world is treating Lakotah as a separate country.\n\nThe US government is unlikely to support the Republic of Lakotah because it means the USA will lose some land.

The word is often used in music to mean any song with French words, but it is more often used when talking about songs in which lyrics have been set to music by French classical composers.\n\nVery often \"chansons\" refers to the French songs that were sung in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. People who sang these chansons were called \"chansonniers\". They had various forms, including ballade, rondeau and virelai. Some composers at the time liked to set popular poetry to music. The earliest chansons were for two, three or four voices, many of them being for three voices. By the 16th century most were for four voices. Sometimes, the singers were accompanied by instruments. \n\nThe first important composer of chansons was the medieval composer Guillaume de Machaut. In the Renaissance Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois wrote many simple chansons. Later Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez composed chansons which had lots of imitation between the voices. Clément Janequin wrote more simple, homophonic chansons. He worked in the area around Paris. Later composers such as Orlando de Lassus were influenced by the Italian madrigal. The style of music started to be used in music for instruments.\n\nThe first book of sheet music printed from movable type was \"Harmonice Musices Odhecaton\", a collection of 96 chansons by many composers, published in Venice in 1501.\n\nDuring the 16th century French songs started to be composed with lute or keyboard accompaniment. In the 19th century many composers wrote songs with piano accompaniment. These chansons were often called mélodies.\n\nIn France today \"chanson\" often refers to the work of more popular singers such as Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, Édith Piaf, Camille, Olivia Ruiz.\nFrench chansons of Jacques Brel have been translated and are interpreted in English by Arnold Johnston, Professor at West Michigan University. More than 100 chansons of Brel, Brassens, Barbara, Bécaud, Ferrat, Aznavour, Trenet et Ferré have been translated and are interpreted in German language by the Duo Stéphane & Didier (see www.deutsche-chanson-texte.de).\n\n", "id": "89091", "title": "Chanson"}

He is known for his music made with tape recordings, and instrumental music with a steady beat (such as Music for 18 Musicians).\n\nHe also wrote pieces that used what is called a phasing technique. With phasing technique, two parts might be playing the same part but at slightly different speeds. It is almost like a canon, or round. He wrote pieces like these for piano, violin, and, again, for tape recordings.\n\nHe also composed such pieces like In C and Different Trains, some of his most popular works. Others include, Drumming, City Life and The Cave. \n\nThe critic Kyle Gann has said Reich \"may...be considered...America's greatest living composer.\"\n\nOn January 25, 2007, Reich was named the 2007 recipient of the Polar Music Prize, together with jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins.

It suggests the American female pop singing groups of the late 1950s and early 1960s. They were hugely successful for a time, between the decline of early rock and roll and the British Invasion. Many of them were influenced by doo-wop style.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the groups were mostly self-organised, girls who knew each other and often grew up together. The Chantels, for example, were four girl choristers from a Catholic high school in the Bronx, 1957. The Ronettes were two sisters and a cousin. The Supremes were girls from a public housing estate in Detroit, Michigan. They were, and still are, America's most successful vocal group of all time. These groups had managers, of course, because they needed someone to deal with the music industry. But the managers did not set up the groups; they came after the groups were formed.\n\nLater, almost all groups were created by public relations professionals to meet a market need. The Spice Girls were a good example of this. They were put together in the mid-1990s by a family management team. Their managers' idea was to create a girl group to compete with popular boy bands that dominated the pop music scene in the mid- to late-1990s. The Spice Girls sold most albums, and had the best-selling album of all time.\n\nOne obvious difference between the earlier groups and the later ones was in their social backgrounds. Earlier American groups, having grown up together, were all of the same social origin and colour. What is more, they had usually sung together, and socialised together, before they formed up as a group. This is also true of most of the earlier British boy groups. The later groups, on the other hand, were deliberately chosen for variety. This was done so that all sections of the audience would have at least one member they could identify with. They had not sung together, or maybe met each other, until their PR manager introduced them.\n\nWith the changing times, the marketing of popular music changed greatly, so that direct comparison of sales is not simple. but in many parts of the world digital sales are now the most important.\n", "id": "89124", "title": "Girl group"}

After appearing on television during the 1990s, Ledger began working in Hollywood movies. He starred in many movies, including \"The Patriot\", \"Monster's Ball\", and \"Brokeback Mountain\". He played The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\". Ledger died in New York City on January 22, 2008. However, the final movie he was in, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, came out in 2009.\n\nHeath Ledger was born in Perth, Western Australia. Ledger's mother is descended from the Clan Campbell of Scotland. Heath (Heathcliff) and his sister Katherine were named after the two main characters in Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\". Ledger attended Guildford Grammar School, where he had his first acting experiences. He starred in a school production as Peter Pan at age 10.\n\nAt sixteen, Ledger graduated school early to become an actor with girlfriend Jenna Sorrell. With his best friend, Trevor DiCarlo, Ledger drove across Australia to Sydney. He returned to Perth for the television series \"Sweat\" (1996). In this series, he played a gay cyclist.\n\nIn 1996, Ledger was involved in the short lived Fox Broadcasting Company fantasy-drama \"Roar\". In 1999, Ledger starred in the teen comedy \"10 Things I Hate About You\". He also had the lead role in the Australian movie \"Two Hands\", directed by Gregor Jordan.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005 he starred in \"The Patriot\", \"Monster's Ball\", \"A Knight's Tale\", \"The Four Feathers\", \"Ned Kelly\", \"The Order\", and \"The Brothers Grimm\". In 2001, he won a ShoWest Award for the \"Male Star of Tomorrow\" for on his work in \"The Patriot\" and \"A Knight's Tale\". In 2003, he was named one of Australian GQ's \"Men of the Year\" for acting.\n\nLedger received \"Best Actor of 2005\" awards from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle for his acting in \"Brokeback Mountain\". In this movie he plays Wyoming ranchhand Ennis Del Mar, who is in love with rodeorider Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He also received a nomination for Golden Globe \"Best Actor in a Drama\" and a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor for this acting.\n\nAlso in 2005, Ledger played a version of Giacomo Casanova in \"Casanova\". The movie was a romantic comedy. It co-starred Sienna Miller.\n\nIn 2006, Ledger was asked to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 2007, he was one of six actors to play different sides of singer Bob Dylan in the movie \"I'm Not There\".\n\nLedger played comic book villain The Joker in \"The Dark Knight\". This is the sequel to the 2005 movie \"Batman Begins\". The movie was released on July 18, 2008.\n\nLedger started a record company with singer Ben Harper. In 2006, Ledger directed three music videos: \"Cause an Effect\" and \"Seduction Is Evil (She's Hot)\" for Australian hip-hop artist N'fa, as well as \"Morning Yearning\" for Ben Harper.\n\nLedger had problems with paparazzi photographers. It is said that he spat at and assaulted a photographer in Sydney in 2004. A relative of his also is said to have spat on a photographer in 2005. Ledger said this was not true.\n\nLedger caused problems after he was quoted in January 2006 in Australia's \"Herald Sun\" as saying that West Virginia had banned \"Brokeback Mountain\" (which it had not). He also said the state had lynchings as recently as the 1980s. These statements have been said to not be true by historians, who said that the last non-legal public hanging in West Virginia happened in 1931.\n\nFrom August 2002 to April 2004, Ledger had a relationship with actress Naomi Watts. They met during the filming of \"Ned Kelly\". Before that, he had dated actresses Lisa Zane and Heather Graham.\n\nLedger was engaged to actress Michelle Williams, whom he met while filming \"Brokeback Mountain\". Their daughter, Matilda Rose, was born on October 28, 2005 in New York City.\n\nIn August 2007, \"Us Weekly\" said that Ledger and Williams ended their relationship. Neither Ledger nor Williams said the rumor was true at that time. In September 2007, Williams' father, Larry, told the \"Sydney Daily Telegraph\" that Ledger and Williams had separated.\n\nLedger was found dead in his apartment in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City on January 22, 2008. Ledger's body was found by a housekeeper and a massage therapist, who entered the bedroom to find him face down on the floor with sleeping pills on a nearby table. Police said that there were \"no obvious signs\" of suicide. They also did not think his death was caused by someone else.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, Ledger's parents and sister appeared outside Ledger's mother's house in Applecross, a Perth suburb, and read a short statement to the media:\nAustralian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd released a statement saying, \"It was with great sadness that I have learned of the passing of Heath Ledger... It is tragic that we have lost one of our nation's finest actors in the prime of his life.\"\n\n\n", "id": "89132", "title": "Heath Ledger"}

The metic did not have the same citizen rights as a citizen who was born in the state he was living in.\n\nThe term 'metic' was especially used in ancient Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries BC. A notable metic was Aristotle, who was born in Stageira but lived in Athens for a long time.\n\nRegardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city, metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift. This was rarely done. Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay, which could be significant to working people. During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens. None of these rights were available to metics. They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica, whether farm or house, unless granted a special exemption. \n\nMetics shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges. Like citizens, they had to perform military service and, if rich enough, were subject to special tax contributions. Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics. More common was the special status of \"equal rights\" (\"isoteleia\") under which they were freed from the usual liabilities. \n\nThe system came to an end in Hellenistic Athens, when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent. The census of 317 BC gave 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves in Attica. \n\nIn the Greco-Roman world, free people (non-citizens) living on the territory of a polis were called \"paroikoi\" (see etymology of parish), in Asia Minor \"katoikoi\".\n", "id": "89173", "title": "Metic"}

Women, slaves, metics and children were not allowed to become citizens.\n\nCitizens could be involved in the running of Athens and could be elected for important positions.\n\nAthens had a direct democracy. This meant that each citizen had an equal say and opportunity in the governing of Athens. All of the citizens of Athens would meet on a hillside (the Pnyx) 30 to 40 times a year to discuss how to run the city better. \n\nAll democratic countries now have an indirect democracy. This means members of parliament are elected to make decisions concerning government. There are now too many people in different countries for them to meet on a hillside, and many people are too busy to be able to go 50 times a year.\n\nAll citizens could attend fifty meetings a year. Meetings were held on a hillside called the Pnyx. People would stand on a raised platform called the bema to speak. Speakers wore a garland whilst speaking. Any citizen could speak.\n\nAll decisions concerning the running of Athens were decided here – taxes, war, policy, etc. Any decisions were made by a show of hands.\n\nA black pig would be sacrificed to the gods at the start of the meeting to make sure the meeting went well.\n\nCleisthenes, a democratic reformer, divided Attica into ten tribes in 510 BC.

Gucci is seen as one of the most famous, successful, and easily recognizable fashion brands in the world. Gucci is now owned by the French conglomerate company, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR).\n\nBusinessWeek magazine says that Gucci made more than US$7 billion in 2006, and was 46th in the magazine's yearly \"Top 100 Brands\". For this reason Gucci is the second biggest selling fashion brand after LVMH. Most importantly Gucci is the biggest selling Italian brand in the world. Gucci has about 425 shops in the world and it sells its products to other shops by franchisees and department stores.\n\nGucci was started in 1906 by Guccio Gucci. In 1938, Gucci grew bigger, and a small shop opened in Rome. Guccio Gucci designed many of the company's famous clothes. In 1947, Gucci made the bamboo-handle handbag, which is still used. In the 1950s, Gucci also made the striped webbing (a type of material), and the suede and metal moccasin shoes.\nGuccio Gucci's wife, Aida Calvelli had a large family, with six children, but only their sons (Vasco, Aldo, Ugo, and Rodolfo), not their daughters help lead the company. After Guccio's death in 1953 , Aldo helped lead the company to being a major fashion shop in more than one country, opening the company’s first small shops in London, Paris, and New York. Even in Gucci’s younger years, the family was well known for its arguments. Arguments about inheritances, stock holdings, and day-to-day operations of the shops often divided the family, and caused alliances to be made. Gucci grew in other countries. Gucci decided to grow a lot in East Asia in the late 1960s, opening shops in Hong Kong (China), Tokyo (Japan), and Korea. At that time, the company also made its famous GG logo (Guccio Gucci's initials), and the Flora silk scarf (worn most by Hollywood actress Grace Kelly), and the \"Jackie O shoulder\" bag, which was made famous by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n\nGucci stayed as one of the biggest luxury clothes companies in the world, until the late 1970s, when some bad business decisions and family arguments almost made the company bankrupt. At the time, the brothers 'Aldo' and 'Rodolfo' controlled equal 50% shares of the company, but contributed less to the company than Guccio Gucci and all his sons did. In 1979, 'Aldo' made the 'Gucci Accessories Collection', or 'GAC', which was meant to increase sales for the Gucci Parfums sector, which his sons controlled. GAC sold small accessories, such as cosmetic bags, lighters, and pens, which were cheaper than the other items in the company’s accessories catalogue. Aldo relegated control of Parfums to his son Roberto in an effort to weaken Rodolfo’s control of the overall operations of the company.\n\nAldo Gucci grew into new markets, such as an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC), so that in 1972 AMC Hornet small \"Sportabout\" car became one of the first American cars to give a special luxury made by a famous fashion designer. The Gucci cars had striped green, red, and buff material inside, as well as the Gucci's logos and outside color selections.\n\nThe \"Gucci Accessories Collection\" was popular, but it brought the Gucci strength down. After a few years, the \"Parfums section\" started to sell better than the \"Accessories section\". The newly-made wholesaling business brought the once-exclusive brand to over a thousand stores in the United States alone with the GAC line, deteriorating the brand’s standing with fashionable customers. \"In the 1960s and 1970s,\" writes Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, \"Gucci had been at the pinnacle of chic, thanks to icons such as Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, and Jacqueline Onassis. But by the 1980s, Gucci had lost its appeal, becoming a tacky airport brand.\"\n", "id": "89229", "title": "Gucci"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89236", "text": "Ghoul\n\nA ghoul is a monster from ancient Arabian folklore. Ghouls live in burial grounds and other uninhabited places. The English word comes from the Arabic name for the creature: الغول \"ghūl\", which literally means \"demon\". The \"ghul\" is a devilish type of jinn believed to be sired by Iblis.\n\nThe female form is given as \"ghouleh\" in Muhawi and Kanaana (see ref below). The plural is \"ghilan\".\n\n\"Ghoul\" is also a shapeshifting demon that lives in the desert. The demon can take the form of an animal, especially a hyena. It lures unwary travellers into the desert. It will then kill and eat them. The creature also preys on young children, robs graves, and eats the dead. Because of this habit, the word \"ghoul\" is sometimes used to refer to an ordinary human such as a grave robber, or to anyone who likes the macabre. \nThe star Algol takes its name from this creature.\n\nIn Iranian mythologies, Ghouls are creatures very similar to humans, but larger. Usually they are less intelligent and not necessarily evil.\nMost Persian speakers use Ghoul to describe large people (figuratively \"giants\"). This may or may not be considered an insult, depending on the situation.\n\nGhouls and ghoul-like creatures have been portrayed in different ways in fiction, including a series of dark fantasy, short stories by Brian McNaughton, a Michael Slade novel, \"Ghoul\", Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" series, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", the works of Caitlín R. Kiernan, Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, and Jim Butcher's The Dresden Files.\n\nMorlocks are a fictional species of cannibalistic ghouls, created by H. G. Wells for his 1895 novel, \"The Time Machine\". The Morlocks, as well as another supposed offshoot of humans, the , exist in the future world in the year 802,701 A.D. in \"The Time Machine\".\n\nBram Stoker's 1897 novel \"Dracula\" has a character that acts much like a ghoul. The character is named Renfield. Under the vampire's influence, Renfield becomes his willing slave. He develops a craving to eat living creatures in the hope of obtaining their life-force for himself. After being confined to an asylum, he considers eating a human hospital orderly, but finds he can only capture and consume flies, spiders, and the occasional bird.\n\nIn the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, a ghoul is a member of a nocturnal race that lives underground. Some ghouls were once human, but a diet of human corpses, and perhaps the tutelage of proper ghouls, changed them into horrific bestial humanoids. In the short story \"Pickman's Model\" (1927), the first of Lovecraft's ghoul stories, they are unutterably terrible monsters; however, in his earlier novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\" (1926), the ghouls are somewhat less disturbing, even comical at times, and both helpful and loyal to the protagonist. Richard Upton Pickman, a noteworthy Boston painter who disappeared mysteriously in \"Pickman's Model\", appears as a ghoul himself in \"Dream-Quest\". Similar themes appear in \"The Lurking Fear\" (1922) and \"The Rats in the Walls\" (1924). Both of stories claim there are subterranean clans of degenerate, cannibals or carrion-eating humans.\n\nIn modern and contemporary fiction, ghouls are often confused with other types of undead, usually the mindless varieties of zombies. Although modern fiction (post-1954), particularly 1954's \"I Am Legend\", suggests that the latter beings share cannibalistic habits with ghouls, it is nonetheless generally believed that vampires and zombies prefer live prey.\n\nIn 's Dune series, a \"Ghola\" is a deceased person who has been brought back to life, via a secret, almost illegal Tleilaxu technology. Traditionally, the \"Ghola\" is stripped of memories from his or her past life and taught new skills. \"Ghola\" are often sold to nobles by the Tleilaxu as servants and retainers. Given their highly superstitious nature, Fremen are distrustful of ghola, despite the potential usefulness of the living dead. The ambiguity as to whether or not latent memories of the \"old self\" are still present in the ghola's mind is a long-drawn debate throughout the story. It has been suggested that the term \"ghola\" originates in Arabic, as do other terms in the Dune series.\n\nAlthough many screenplays have featured ghouls, the first major motion picture of this theme was the 1933 British movie entitled \"The Ghoul\". The actor Boris Karloff plays a dying Egyptologist who possesses an occult gem, known as The Eternal Light, which he believes will grant immortality if he is buried with it, and thereby able to present it to Anubis in the afterlife. Of course, his bickering covetous heirs and associates would rather keep the jewel for themselves. Karloff vows to rise from his grave and avenge himself against anyone who meddles with his plan, and he keeps this promise when one of his colleagues steals The Eternal Light after his death.\n\nIn 1968, George A. Romero's movie \"Night of the Living Dead\" combined reanimated corpses (zombies) with cannibalistic monsters (ghouls). With this, it created new movie monsters more terrifying than either of the two alone. The term \"ghoul\" was the one actually used in the movie. The term zombies came later, after the movie was released. Romero had never thought of them that way; he said he thought of the Caribbean creatures, when he heard the term \"zombies\".\n\nThe 1976 Turkish movie 'Milk Brothers' (original story by H. Rahmi Gurpinar's 'Ghoul') is a Turkish comedy. Here, a ghoul is a monster with extra power. Ghoul is a monster that was used to frighten little children in the old times, so here the ghoul is used to frighten not only little children, but as well big people.\n\nThe 1975 British movie \"The Ghoul\" (unrelated to the Karloff movie) stars Peter Cushing as a defrocked missionary whose son has developed a taste for human flesh while traveling in India. As the son's mind and body degenerate, Cushing has several young people dispatched and prepared as food for his offspring, whom he keeps locked up in the attic.\n\nThe 1975 anthology movie \"The Monster Club\" featured a scene where a village of ghouls stumbled upon by an unwary traveller (Stuart Whitman), who temporarily escapes the creatures with the help of one half-human girl, but he is recaptured when it turns out that the ghouls have representatives inhabiting our normal human world.\n\nIn the anime and manga series \"Hellsing\", ghouls are zombie-like creatures that are created when a \"chipped\" (technological) vampire drains a victim to death, or, in the Manga, where a vampire drains the blood of someone who is not a virgin. If fatally wounded, they instantly crumble to dust. They are under the control of the vampire who bites them, eat human flesh, and are intelligent enough to use firearms. It is not rare to see a vampire make a small army of Ghouls for attack or defense.\n\n\"The Ghoul\" is the stage name of Cleveland-area horror television host Ron Sweed.\n\nThe Batman comics-based franchise, including the 2005 movie, \"Batman Begins\", has an antagonist named, Rā's al-Ghūl, whose name derives from the original Arabic name for the star Algol in the constellation Perseus meaning \"the monster's (i.e. Medusa's) head\".\n\n\n", "id": "89236", "title": "Ghoul"}

It is shown on the satellite and cable channels Living, Living2 and Virgin 1 (Formerly Ftn), mainly for the UK market. It is also shown in the United States on the Travel Channel and on the W Channel in Australia. It is made by Antix Productions, and is led by Yvette Fielding and her husband Karl Beattie.\n\nThe show will start their 10th series on February 19, 2008.\n\nThe team travel around the UK, and also Ireland, the Netherlands and the United States, investigating possible paranormal 'hotspots' for 24 hours.\n\n\n\nMost Haunted has a main presenter, a psychic medium and a parapsychologist. The parapsychologist's role is to be the skeptic, and to give possible scientifical suggestions for the paranormal activity that happens during the night. These are supported by some of the production crew, who appear in the show and generally have some involvement with many parts of the investigation as they are performing their normal crew role. Most of these on-screen crew members also take part in séances.\nThe show has also featured guest mediums. So far these have been Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito, Gordon Smith, Uri Geller and Kevin Wade. Some episodes have also included at least one celebrity. So far celebrities have included Vic Reeves, Nancy Sorrell, Gaby Roslin, Scott Mills, Mark Chapman, Simon Gregson, Sue Cleaver, Carol Thatcher, Paul O'Grady and Lee Ryan.\n\nThe following is a list of former team and crew members who have given a lot of their time to the show.\n\nMany times, former \"psychic medium\" Derek Acorah was possessed by a spirit, sometimes evil or sometimes \"lost and confused\". One such case that exposed Acorah was at Bodmin Gaol, Cornwall. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation about a non-existent ghost of Kreed Kafer by the show parapsychologist Dr. Ciaran O' Keeffe. During the investigation, which was later broadcast, he presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghost. O'Keeffe later revealed Kreed Kafer is an anagram of 'Derek Faker' in a national newspaper. Even though O' Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O' Keeffe had exposed the rest of the \"Most Haunted\" team. O'Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and NOT \"Most Haunted\". The show's presenter and executive producer, Yvette Fielding said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.\n\nAlthough not mentioned by O'Keeffe, the \"Mirror\" article also brought into question unedited footage which appeared to show Fielding and Karl Beattie faking 'paranormal' occurrences such as ghostly bumps and knocks. Fielding denied the claims. Thus far none of this footage has come to light, leading to the belief that the \"Mirror\"'s claims were false. Videos purporting to show the team faking paranormal activity have often popped up on the web but are conclusively show nothing damning.\n\nFurther controversy centred on Derek Acorah again in the West Country, this time in Devon. On the first night filming \"Terror in Torbay\", Acorah mentioned a woman incarcerated by her jealous sister in the cellar of Lupton House, even coming up with the names Margaret and Eleanor. In this case, the facts were right, but the location was wrong. This is the well-known legend of Berry Pomeroy Castle which was to be the last night's location. On the final night, at Berry Pomeroy, Fielding reminded Acorah that he had mentioned the incarcerated sister two nights prior. Acorah glossed over his mistake and changed the subject.\n\n\n", "id": "89240", "title": "Most Haunted"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89423", "text": "Opera\n\nOpera is a drama set to music. An opera is like a play in which everything is sung instead of spoken. Operas are usually performed in opera houses. The singers who sing and act out the story are on the stage, and the orchestra is in front of the stage but lower down, in the orchestra pit, so that the audience can see the stage.\n\nAn opera is normally divided into two, three, four or even five acts. In older operas the music was mostly recitative and arias. During the recitative things would happen in the story. The aria was a song for a solo singer, a setting of a lyric. As well as recitative and aria there would be choruses. The chorus were a group of singers who sing in the crowd scenes. The opera would start with an overture for the orchestra. The overture would usually include tunes that are going to be heard later in the opera. \n\nIn operas from the 19th century onwards there is often little or no difference between recitative and aria. Composers like Wagner wanted to get away from operas which had lots of separate arias in which the singers showed off, with the audience clapping loudly after each one. He wanted continuous music so that the mood would not be broken.\n\nSometimes operas have a lot of dancing in them. French opera especially would often have one act which was full of dances.\n\nNot all operas have music all the time.\n\nGrand opera is opera which is all set to music.\n\nOpéra buffe (French) or Opera buffa (Italian) is comic opera. The story is very light-hearted and funny.\n\nOpéra comique is a French term for opera which has some spoken words. Surprisingly it does not mean a “comic” opera. An opera like \"Carmen\", which is a tragedy, is still an opéra comique due to the fact that it uses spoken dialogues instead of recitatives.\n\nSingspiel is a German term for a type of opera with lots of magic and fantasy in the story. There were spoken words between the songs. Mozart’s \"Magic Flute\" is an example.\n\nOperetta is a short opera which is light-hearted and usually has some spoken words.\n\nOpera singers have to have powerful voices as well as a good technique. Most opera houses are very big, and the singers need to be heard at the back. They also need to be good at acting. They need to be able to learn their music quickly and to sing from memory. It is a help to be good at languages because operas are often in Italian, German, French, English or Russian etc. Some opera companies, like the English National Opera, sing their operas in English. Others, like the Royal Opera House, sing operas in whatever language they were composed in. Translations are printed on a screen above the front of the stage (\"surtitles\") so that the audience can understand what is being sung.\n\nAlthough singers train to get a wide range (good top and bottom notes) they cannot be expected to sing any role in their voice range. For example: some sopranos may have big, dramatic voices, suitable for parts like Tosca in Puccini’s opera \"Tosca\". Some may have a very light and high voice, called “coloratura”, suitable for parts like the Queen of the Night in Mozart’s \"Magic Flute\". Some may have a medium range, called mezzo-soprano, suitable for parts like Carmen in Bizet’s opera \"Carmen\".\n\nVery often in opera the heroine is a soprano and the hero is a tenor. Basses may often have the part of a powerful king, or he may be the bad guy.\n\nThe 18th century lexicographer and critic Dr Johnson described opera as an “exotic and irrational entertainment”. By “exotic” he meant that it came from a foreign country (which in those days was true: all opera at the time came from Italy). By “irrational” he meant that the things which happened in the stories were strange and not like real life. A play can be like real life, but an opera is being sung, so things are not going to happen like they normally do in real life. A singer might be singing “I must go, I must go!” and he may stand on the stage and sing this for several minutes before at last he goes! A singer may be pretending to die, and will sing a beautiful song before he or she finally dies. These things are “conventions”, which means that they are a kind of habit we have to accept when watching and listening to opera. Another convention of earlier operas was to have the part of young men sung by women. This is sometimes called a breeches role or trouser role. They are often small parts such as page boys, or teenagers who flirt with older women, such as the part of Cherubino in Mozart’s \" The Marriage of Figaro\" or Oktavian in Richard Strauss’s \"Der Rosenkavalier\". It should be remembered that in the 18th century it was usual for the main female part to be sung by a man who was a castrato. That seems a very strange (and cruel) convention to us now.\n\nThere are lots of famous operas, and the best ones have some of the greatest music ever written. The music could not have been written like that if it had not been written for opera. For example: Mozart is very clever at writing music where maybe six people are all singing different things at once because they all have different ideas about the situation in the story.\n\nThe first opera ever written was performed in 1597 in Florence in Italy. It was called \"Dafne\" and the composer was Jacopo Peri. This opera is now lost, but three years later, in 1600, he worked together with another composer called Giulio Caccini to write an opera called \"Euridice\". The music for this still exists. It was nearly all recitative. This kind of writing was new, but if opera was to tell a story it was important to have a solo voice singing words that could be heard. They were trying to produce something like an ancient Greek tragedy. It was performed at a kind of club, called “camerata”, for intellectual (clever) people to a small audience. It was not great music, but the amazing thing was that there was a composer of genius around. His name was Claudio Monteverdi, and only seven years later, in 1607, he wrote the first really good opera: \"Orfeo\", which was produced in Mantua. Monteverdi must have realized that opera had the possibilities of putting poetry, music, scenery and acting all together. He took the kind of songs that were popular at the time and joined them with speaking or recitative. Later in life he joined these so that the music flowed more dramatically.\n\nIn 1637 the first public opera house was opened in Venice. Soon lots of theatres in Italy started to produce operas. The stories were usually about ancient times, like the Roman Empire or Greek myths. They started to put in comic (funny) bits to make people laugh. Soon there was opera in Paris, Vienna, Hamburg and in the small courts of Germany which in those days was lots of little countries, each with their own prince who ruled and who kept musicians at court. The composers who are best remembered today include Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632-1687) who was an Italian who moved to France and wrote operas for the French king, and George Frideric Handel (1685-1759) who was a German who moved to England and wrote operas for the opera houses in London. In Italy there were composers like Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676) who had been a choirboy in Monteverdi’s church choir in Venice, and Alessandro Scarlatti 1660-1725 who lived in Naples.\n\nDuring this period, known as the Baroque period, the opera was an entertainment for the upper classes who went to the opera to be seen in public. Opera was a social occasion where you could meet people and talk, even during the music. Both the singers and the audience behaved in ways that we would think were bad manners.\n\nChristoph Willibald Gluck was a composer who tried to make people take opera more seriously. In 1762 he wrote an opera called \"Orfeo\" which was performed in Vienna. It had lots of choruses and ballet numbers, like French opera, but the words were in Italian and the music really concentrated on the story rather than being just a display for clever singers to show off. Some of its music is very famous today, e.g. the \"Dance of the Blessed Spirits\" which is played on a flute, and Orfeo’s aria \"Che faró senza Euridice?\" (\"What shall I do without Euridice?\").\n\nMozart learned from Gluck’s ideas about opera. This can be seen in his opera \"Idomeneo\" which is about a Greek story. Other Italian operas by Mozart include: \"Don Giovanni\", \"Le Nozze di Figaro\" and \"Cosi fan tutte\". He also wrote operas in German: \"The Abduction from the Serail\" and \"The Magic Flute\". These are Singspiel: operas which tell magic and fantasy stories.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) only wrote one opera: \"Fidelio\". It is a story of a woman who rescues her lover from prison. Rescue operas were popular in France, but this one is in German. It is a serious opera about how a woman can save a man by being true and faithful.\n\nIn the 19th century Richard Wagner (1813-1883) continued Gluck’s ideas. Wagner had very personal ideas about how his operas should be performed, and he liked to train the singers himself. He wanted them to take the drama of his operas seriously instead of treating the music as a way of showing off their voices. He always wrote the libretti (words for the opera) himself, and they were always in German. They are mostly about serious subjects from German folklore and myths, although he did write one comic opera: \"The Mastersingers of Nürnberg\". Wagner used “leitmotifs” which means that there are tunes which are used for particular characters or ideas in the opera. This allows the music to develop with the story, and can be used in interesting ways. For example: when Sigmund (in the opera \"Die Walküre\") says that he does not know who his father is, we hear his father’s tune in the orchestra! The audience, of course, know (this is called: dramatic irony).\n\nIn Italy Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) wrote lots of operas. There was no difference in style between his comic and his serious operas. Often the same overture was used for both. He wrote exactly all the notes that the singers were to sing, he did not want to leave it to them to improvise their own ornamental notes. Everything was carefully thought out. Musicians are not sure whether to call him a Classical or Romantic composer. Composers like Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1835) and Gaetano Donizetti (1797-1848) are definitely Romantic. They had the ability to write lovely lyrical tunes. The most famous Italian opera composer of the 19th century was Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901). His music is not always continuous like Wagner’s. Sometimes it stopped for the audience to applaud. Verdi had a wonderful sense of drama, and could write beautiful melodies which captured people’s hearts. He loved Shakespeare, and based several of his operas on Shakespeare plays: \"Otello\", \"Macbeth\" and \"Falstaff\". \n\nThe 19th century was the time when Nationalism was important. Composers were writing music typical of their own countries. Wagner, as we have seen, took German myths for his opera stories. In Spain they had their own kind of opera called “zarzuela”. In Russia Mikhail Glinka (1804-1857) wrote \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" which was based on a Russian fairy tale. Other Russian composers include Alexander Borodin who wrote \"Prince Igor\", and Modest Mussorgsky (1839-1881) who wrote \"Boris Godunov\". Both these operas are about stories from Russian history. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908) wrote a fairy tale opera \"Sadko\", and Pyotr Tchaikovsky (1840-1893) used some very Russian tunes in \"Eugene Onegin\" and \"The Queen of Spades\". \n\nCzech composers wrote national operas. The most famous Czech opera composers were Antonín Dvořák (1841-1904), Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884) and Leoš Janáček (1854-1928). In France the most famous composer was Charles Gounod (1818-1893) who wrote an opera called \"Faust\".\n\nIn the 20th century composers had many different styles of composing. This was true of all kinds of music, including opera. Richard Strauss (1864-1949) was really a Romantic, although almost all his operas were written in the 20th century. His harmonies show that he had studied Wagner’s operas. \"Der Rosenkavalier\" (1909) has lots of romantic tunes, although it is a story about Vienna in the Classical period. In Italy composers like Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) wrote operas in the verismo style. This meant operas with stories that felt like real life. The characters in the stories were usually from the lower classes. \n\nAlban Berg (1885-1935) also wrote operas about poor or simple people. He wrote an opera called \"Wozzeck\" which is the tragedy of a man who is too simple to understand that people are being unkind to him and using him. Berg’s music is often built on the twelve tone series which he had learned from Schoenberg. Stravinsky’s (1882-1971) \"The Rake's Progress\" is in yet another style called Neo-classical because the music is made to sound a bit like music of the Classical Period. In England Britten wrote many great operas like \"Peter Grimes\" and \"Billy Budd\". Most of them are about unfortunate people who want to be part of society but are not accepted. \n\nMore recent composers who wrote operas include the Hungarian György Ligeti (1923-2006), the Polish Krzysztof Penderecki (b.1933), the English Sir Harrison Birtwistle and the Americans Philip Glass (b.1937) and John Adams (b.1947).\n", "id": "89423", "title": "Opera"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89514", "text": "WWE World Championship\n\nThe WWE Championship is a professional wrestling world championship in WWE. It is the original world title of WWE, and is largely considered the highest-ranking title in WWE. It is widely regarded as the most prestigious championship in Professional wrestling with its title bouts attracting millions of world wide viewers.\n\nThe WWE World Championship was introduced in 1963, with Buddy Rogers becoming the first world champion on April 29. Its introduction is said to have come about because of events in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), a promotion with many branches (also known as \"territories\") in North America and worldwide. In the 1950s, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was an NWA territory, and by 1963, CWC executives had a large amount of control over NWA. During this time, Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, the world title of the NWA, until Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship on January 24, 1963. After a dispute over the result, CWC left the NWA and created a new promotion, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). This new company then created a backstory for its new title, claiming that the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship had been spun off from the NWA World Championship, and that a tournament had been held in Rio de Janeiro to crown a new champion. Buddy Rogers was billed as the winner of this tournament, having defeated Antonino Rocca in the finals. (In reality, no such tournament took place.) Affiliated with the NWA once again, the WWWF was renamed to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. After WWF broke ties again with the NWA in 1983, this time for good, the championship became known as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and later simply as the WWF (World) Championship by the 1990s.\n\nIn 1991, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), another NWA territory, established the WCW World Heavyweight Championship alongside the NWA world title. WCW then left the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF. Both groups became popular with the general public, and then were involved in a television ratings war, dubbed the Monday Night Wars. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline, which ended in March 2001 with the WWF's purchase of WCW. With this purchase, WWF now owned the video library of WCW, select talent contracts, and championships, among other assets. The slew of former WCW talent joining the WWF roster began \"The Invasion\" which effectively phased out the WCW name. Following this, the WCW World Championship was unified with the WWF World Championship, at Vengeance 2001 in December. At the event, Chris Jericho defeated The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WCW World Championship and WWF World Championship respectively. Consequently, Chris Jericho was named the final WCW World Champion and the subsequent Undisputed WWF World Champion as the WWF Championship became the Undisputed World Championship in professional wrestling.\n\nBy 2002, the WWF roster had doubled in size due to the overabundance of contracted workers from the original WWF, as well as those who had come across from WCW and ECW. As a result of the increase, the WWF divided the roster through its two main television programs, Raw and SmackDown!, assigning championships and appointing figureheads to each brand. This expansion became known as the Brand Extension. In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the championship became known as the WWE Undisputed World Championship. Following these changes, the WWE Undisputed Championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as competitors from both brands could challenge the WWE Undisputed World Champion. Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of the Raw and SmackDown brands respectively, Stephanie McMahon contracted then-WWE Undisputed World Champion Brock Lesnar to the SmackDown brand, leaving the Raw brand without a world title. On September 2, after disputing the brand designation of the Undisputed Championship, Eric Bischoff announced the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship, spun off from the Undisputed Championship. Immediately afterward, the WWE Undisputed World Championship returned to being known as the WWE World Championship or just the WWE Championship. In 2011, There were two WWE Champions, John Cena and CM Punk, on August 1st edition of Raw the Chief operating officer Triple H, announced a match to determine who will be the WWE Champion between John Cena and CM Punk. At Summerslam CM Punk defeated John Cena to be the only WWE Champion. However, that same night Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank and become the new WWE Champion.\n\nOn December 15, 2013, Randy Orton beat John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship at . He was already WWE Champion when he won the championship and unified the World Heavyweight Championship with the WWE Championship to make the \"WWE World Heavyweight Championship\". The World Heavyweight Championship was then retired the next day.\nThe title was renamed the WWE World Championship due to the fact that it's now exclusive to Smackdown and the WWE Universal Championship is on Raw\n\nFollowing the events of the WWE Brand Extension, an annual WWE Draft was established, in which select members of the WWE roster are reassigned to a different brand. After three years on the SmackDown brand, the WWE Championship switched brands during the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery, in which the WWE Champion John Cena was drafted to Raw while the World Heavyweight Champion Batista was drafted to SmackDown. On June 11, 2006, Rob Van Dam used his Money in the Bank contract at ECW One Night Stand for a WWE Championship match against the WWE Champion John Cena. The holder of the contract is guaranteed a WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship match at anytime of their choosing. Rob Van Dam defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship, moving the title to the ECW brand, a WWE brand established from purchased assets of the Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion. On July 3, Edge defeated John Cena and Rob Van Dam in a Triple Threat Match to win the WWE Championship. However, with Edge being a member of the Raw brand at the time, the title returned to Raw due to the circumstances. After the 2008 WWE Draft the WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown, moving the WWE Championship to the SmackDown brand. The following year, the title returned to Raw after Triple H was drafted back to the brand during the 2009 WWE Draft, and remained exclusive to the Raw brand since. When SmackDown's Batista won the title from Raw's John Cena at Elimination Chamber, it remained exclusive to Raw while Batista was transferred to the Raw roster.\nIn July 2011, CM Punk was involved in a storyline, where he vowed to leave WWE with the WWE Championship when his contract expired on July 17, 2011 (the date of the 2011 Money in the Bank pay-per-view). At the event, Punk succeeded in defeating the defending champion, John Cena to win the championship, and legitimately left the company with the physical title belt. With the championship seemingly vacated by Vince McMahon the following night on Raw, Rey Mysterio won an 8-man Championship Tournament by defeating The Miz in the finals on the July 25 episode of Raw to be crowned the new WWE Champion, only to subsequently lose it later that night to Cena, for the latter's record ninth reign. However, following Cena's win, Punk returned to WWE with his own title belt, thereby creating both an ambiguity and a dispute in WWE over the presence of two WWE Championships. On the July 29, 2011 episode of SmackDown new WWE COO Triple H announced that CM Punk's claim to the WWE Championship was legitimate, meaning \"there were two WWE champions.\" At the subsequent SummerSlam pay-per-view, Punk defeated Cena to solidify his claim on the title, only to lose the title moments later to Alberto Del Rio, who opportunistically cashed in his Money in the Bank contract after Kevin Nash attacked.\nOn August 29, 2011, all WWE TV programming became so-called \"Supershows\" that feature wrestlers from both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". This means that the WWE Championship can now be defended at any WWE event.\n\nSpecial custom belts have been created to match the gimmicks of some champions:\n\nA much larger version of the belt was created for André the Giant before WrestleMania III, although he never wore it as champion. A custom championship belt was designed and constructed for The Rock which featured his trademark Brahma Bull logo in the center, but it was lost and thus, never appeared on television. Similarly, Edge had originally designed an entirely different custom belt than the \"Rated R Spinner\" design he used for his second reign, however the plans were scrapped due to time constraints.\nThe \"Spinner\" belt's design has become the WWE Championship's primary design since April 11, 2005, although, since No Mercy 2007, the centerpiece no longer spins. The physical belt itself originally indicated the brand it was designated to. When it was first introduced, it featured a unique side plate design that read \"SmackDown\", though it was then replaced with one that read \"Mon-Nite Raw\" when John Cena was drafted to the Raw brand. When the title once again became SmackDown's primary championship after Triple H was drafted to the brand in 2008, the \"Raw\" plate was replaced with a second \"WWE Champion\" side plate. Furthermore, the belt also features a silver tip on the end of the leather strap.\n\nThe current champion is Jinder Mahal.\n\n", "id": "89514", "title": "WWE World Championship"}

It used to be a part of Poland. It was also known as Sofievka or Zofiówka in Polish, named after Sofia, a Russian princess who donated land for the Jewish settlement. \n\nTrochenbrod was founded in 1835, at first a farming colony which grew into a small town. The population grew from around 1,200 (235 families) in 1889 to 1,580 in 1897.\n\nDuring the Polish-Soviet War, the town was captured by Poland. By 1938 the town's population, which was only Jewish, had grown to at least 3,000. Most of the people worked in farming, dairy farming, or tanning. \n\nThere were seven synagogues in Trochenbrod. In 1940, the town, along with the rest of Western Ukraine, became part of the Soviet Union (see Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). The rabbi at this time was Rabbi Gershon Weissmann. The Communists exiled him to Siberia after accusing him of being involved in underground salt trading.\n\nWhen the Nazis later occupied Ukraine, they created a ghetto at Trochenbrod, bringing in Jews from nearby villages and towns. The Jews in the Trochenbrod ghetto were killed by the Nazis in August and September 1942. Most of the Jews of Trochenbrod as well as of the neighbouring village Lozisht were killed, as were the other Jews of Volhynia. The local Ukrainian police force helped to round up the Jews. Fewer than 200 Jews from the Trochenbrod ghetto and nearby areas lived through this killing. The village itself was burned. Now only fields and a forest can be found there.\n\nA few of the people escaped the execution and destruction. At the end of the war, the number of people left was between 33 and 40; most were found in the area near Lutzk.\n\nA fictional version of the shtetl, \"Trachimbrod\", was featured in the 2002 novel \"Everything Is Illuminated\" by Jonathan Safran Foer as well as in the 2005 film based on the novel.\n\nSafran Foer's story describes fictional events in the village between 1791, the year in which the shtetl was first named, and 1941, when it was destroyed in the war. The main character of the book (who goes by the author's name and also by the name \"The Hero\") comes to Ukraine to look for a woman named Augustine, who saved his grandfather in the war.\n\n\n", "id": "89546", "title": "Trochenbrod"}

Lassus and Palestrina are the two most famous composers of that time who were writing church music in a polyphonic style. \n\nHe was born in Mons in the province of Hainaut in the Low Countries which is mostly what is today the south part of the Netherlands and Belgium. We know very little about his childhood. There is a story that, when he was a choirboy, he was abducted three times by another church who wanted him to sing in their choir because he had a beautiful voice. There is no proof that this story is true.. At the age of twelve he left his country and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later to Milan in Italy and then to Naples where he worked until the early 1550s. Next he moved to Rome, where he worked for the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had a large household there. In 1553, he became \"maestro di cappella\" of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome. This was an excellent job for a man who was only 21 years old. However, he only stayed there a year. Later, in 1555, Palestrina took that job. Lassus left Rome to go home to the Low Countries to see his parents who were ill, but by the time he got home they were both dead.\n\nWe are not sure what he did between then and 1554. He may have gone to France and England. In 1555 he returned to the Low Countries and had some of his first works published in Antwerp. In 1556 he joined the court of Duke Albert V of Bavaria who was very keen on music and was trying to make music in his country as good as the music in Italy. Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He seems to have been happy in Munich and he stayed there. In 1558 he married the daughter of a maid of honour of the Duchess; they had two sons who both became composers. By 1563 Lassus had been made \"maestro di cappella\". He stayed there for the rest of his life, although several other kings and aristocrats offered him jobs in other places. He had many honours, including being knighted by the Pope.\n\nIn 1590 his health started to be bad. In 1594 his employer decided it was costing him too much to employ Lassus, so he wrote a letter to him to say that he was dismissed (that he no longer had a job). Lassus never saw the letter, because that very same day he died.\n\nLassus composed a lot of church music. He had to compose masses for the morning and evening services. Many of these are parody masses, which means they were based on tunes from other compositions. Others were influenced by composers from Venice. \n\nHe wrote many motets which were probably sung at services as well. In some of these motets he shows a sense of humour. For example, one of his motets makes fun about bad singers: the music stops and starts and stutters. It was a kind of musical joke. Sometimes he had to write music for special occasions. He had visited Italy several times and learned the Italian way of writing polyphonic music.\n\nLassus also wrote many songs in French (chansons) as well as German (Lieder). He also wrote madrigals. He even wrote drinking songs.\n\nHe never wrote anything that was strictly instrumental music.\n\n", "id": "89740", "title": "Orlande de Lassus"}

It was made in the Soviet Union by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Every member of the Party was supposed to follow these rules. So was every member of the \"Komsomol\" (a Communist group for young people ages 14-28).\n\nThe Moral Code was written at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961. It was part of the third CPSU Program, which was a plan for how to make the entire Soviet Union communist as part of the new Party Programme.\n\nSome popular Soviet cliches are written in the Code. In fact, the Code was written to include special phrases, either invented by Soviet thinkers, or borrowed. (For example, the famous quote \"'One for all, and all for one\" (\"каждый за всех, все за одного\") was taken from \"The Three Musketeers\" by Alexandre Dumas, père.)\n\nThe Moral Code of the Builder of Communism (as reported on Wikisource), with simple English explanations below, is:\n\n1. Devotion to the cause of Communism, love of the socialist Motherland and of the socialist countries.\n2. Conscientious labor for the good of society: he who does not work, neither shall he eat.\n3. Concern on the part of everyone for the preservation and growth of public property.\n4. High sense of public duty; intolerance of actions harmful to the public interest.\n5. Collectivism and comradely mutual assistance: one for all and all for one.\n6. Humane relations and mutual respect between individuals: man is to man a friend, a comrade, and a brother.\n7. Honesty and truthfulness, moral purity, unpretentiousness and modesty in social and private life.\n8. Mutual respect in the family, concern for the upbringing of children.\n9. Irreconcilability towards injustice, parasitism, dishonesty, careerism, and profiteering.\n10. Friendship and brotherhood among all peoples of the USSR, intolerance of national and racial hatred.\n11. Intolerance towards the enemies of communism, peace, and freedom of nations.\n12. Fraternal solidarity with the working people of all countries, and with all peoples.\nThese rules may be compared to the Ten Commandments or the Bible. For example, the Bible says: \"he who does not work, neither shall he eat\" (2 Thessalonians 3:10). This line was used in the Soviet Constitution of 1936 as well as the Moral Code. Another example is the Commandment \"you shall not commit adultery.\" This is similar to the Code's rule about \"mutual respect in a family, concern about the upbringing of children.\"\n\nThe Ten Commandments focus more on personal virtue - what a person should do, and how to treat other people. The Code talks about how people should act as members of the society they live in.\n\nA Russian legislator and Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said the moral code could be compared to the Sermon on the Mount.\n", "id": "89785", "title": "Moral Code of the Builder of Communism"}

She was crowned queen when she was only 6 days old.\n\nShe married three times. Her first husband was King Francis II of France. They were both young when they were married as part of an alliance between their countries. They had no children. Francis died from an ear infection that had spread to his brain, leaving Mary a widow shortly before her 18th birthday. \n\nWhen Mary returned to Scotland after spending her youth in France, she found that she was not popular in her kingdom. She had been brought up as a Catholic, but many people in Scotland had become Protestant. It was difficult for Mary to avoid siding with either the Catholics or the Protestants. As Mary was now free to marry again, there were lots of noblemen who wanted to become her husband. For her second husband, she chose an English lord named Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who was of royal blood. Darnley was good-looking and charming, but he was often very childish, and he was jealous of Mary's secretary, an Italian named David Rizzio. \n\nMary became pregnant. While she was expecting the baby, Darnley and his friends got drunk one night and decided to kill David Rizzio. They came into Mary's private rooms at Holyrood Palace while she was talking with Rizzio and they stabbed him to death. Darnley got away with the murder because he was the queen's husband, but Mary never forgave him for murdering her friend Rizzio. When her baby was born, it was a boy, who would later become King James VI of Scotland.\n\nA powerful Scottish nobleman, the Earl of Bothwell, was loyal to Mary and hated Darnley. When Darnley was murdered, he was suspected. Mary then agreed to marry the Earl of Bothwell. This was not a wise move, because Bothwell had many enemies. Mary's enemies forced her off the throne and made her young son king in her place. Mary was put in prison, but she escaped and crossed the border into England, which was ruled by her cousin, Elizabeth Queen of England.\n\nMary hoped that Elizabeth would help her to get her throne back, but Elizabeth did not. She kept Mary a prisoner for many years. Mary was eventually accused of making plans to murder Elizabeth.

He was the most important composer of his time. He belonged to the group of composers known as the Burgundian School. He had more influence on music in Europe than any other composer of the 15th century.\n\nFrom what it says in his will it seems likely that he was born in Beersel which is near Brussels in what, today, is Belgium. He was the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman called Marie Du Fayt. When he was small, Dufay moved with his mother to Cambrai where they stayed with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there. Dufay soon showed musical talent, and he was given a musical education at the cathedral. He sang in the choir there. When he was only 16 he was given a benefice as chaplain near Cambrai. He travelled to Konstanz for a meeting.\n\nFrom November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral. In 1420 he left Cambrai again, and worked in Rimini in Italy at the house of a rich family. In 1424 he returned to Cambrai because the relative in whose house his mother was staying was ill. After the relative died he went back to Italy. He worked in Bologna for a Cardinal. He became a deacon and then a priest.\nWhen the Cardinal was made to leave Bologna in 1428 Dufay went to Rome to work for the pope. He became a member of the Papal Choir. In 1434 he was made \"maistre de chappelle\" in Savoy. He seems to have left Rome when the papal choir had money problems. Yet in 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel, but this time it was in Florence. In 1436 Dufay composed the festive motet \"Nuper rosarum flores\", one of his most famous compositions, which was sung at the dedication of Brunelleschi's dome of the cathedral in Florence.\n\nDuring this period Dufay also began his long association with the d'Este family in Ferrara, some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance. He may have got to know them during his first stay in Italy. Rimini was not far from Ferrara, and he spent time in both towns where he got financial support.\n\nAt this time the arguments between the Pope and the Council of Basel continued. Dufay thought he might find himself without a job, so he went back to Cambrai. In order to be a canon at Cambrai, he needed a law degree, which he got in 1437; he may have studied at Turin University in 1436. One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated December 27, 1440, when he was given 36 lots of wine for the feast of St. John the Evangelist. We do not know how long he took to drink it.\n\nDufay stayed in Cambrai during the 1440s. At the same time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy. While in Cambrai he worked with Nicolas Grenon on completely renewing the cathedral collection of music. This meant that he had to write a big collection of polyphonic music for services. He also worked in the administration of the cathedral. In 1444 his mother died, and was buried in the cathedral; and in 1445 Dufay moved into the house of the person who had been canon just before. He kept this home for the rest of his life, although he did spend six more years in Italy where he wrote many of his compositions. When he returned again to Cambrai he was made canon of the cathedral. He was the most famous composer in Europe by that time. He often composed music for the court of Burgundy, and he met many younger composers who were becoming famous, such as Busnois, Ockeghem, Tinctoris, and Loyset Compère. During this period Dufay probably wrote his mass based on the song \"L'homme armé\", as well as the chanson based on the same song. Maybe he wrote this when Philip the Good called for a new crusade against the Turks, who had recently captured Constantinople. He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460, which is lost.\n\nAfter an illness of several weeks, Dufay died on November 27, 1474. He had asked for his motet \"Ave regina celorum\" to be sung for him as he died, with pleas for mercy to be read between some of the movements, but there was not enough time for this to be arranged, so it was sung at his funeral instead. Dufay was buried in the chapel of St. Etienne in the cathedral of Cambrai; his portrait was carved onto his tombstone. In later years the cathedral was destroyed, and the tombstone was lost, but it was found in 1859 (it was being used to cover a well), and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille.\n\nDufay’s music was performed all over Europe. People who wanted to perform his music had to write it out by hand. There was no music printing in those days.\n\nDufay wrote church music including masses, motets, Magnificats, hymns, simple chant settings and antiphons. His secular (non-religious) music includes rondeaux, ballades, virelais and a few other kinds of chanson. His style of composition laid the foundation for the next generations of Renaissance composers. Some of his techniques were old-fashioned. He used isorhythms in his motets, which had been popular in medieval music. He used a way of harmonizing chants which became known as fauxbourdon. He was popular because he was skilled at writing melodies which were beautiful to sing.\n\n", "id": "89826", "title": "Guillaume Dufay"}

Today there are populations of Romanis found all over Europe, although the largest populations are in Eastern Europe.\n\nIndividual groups can be classified into big groups of groups:\nthe Roma of East European birth; the Sinti in Germany and Manouches in France and Catalonia; the Kaló in Spain, Ciganos in Portugal and Gitans of southern France; and the Romanichals of Britain.\n\nThe Roma language is made official by many countries of Europe under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.\n\nThe 18th-century idea about the Indian birth of the Roma is based on the likeness between Romani and languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent and is now supported by genetic evidence. The origins of the Roms were not known until 1763, when a theology student named Stefan Vali met Indian medical students. He noticed that they were physically similar to the Roms he saw in Hungary. He also noticed that they were using similar words.\n\nIt is believed to have been around the 11th century that Roms left India to go northwest, through Persia and the Middle East. Around the 15th century, the Roma reached the Balkans. From there, they dispersed through Europe. The first arrivals were well accepted. European people thought they were Christian pilgrims. The local people of Europe were fascinated by their nomadic way of life and their new sciences. The Roms were often recruited as mercenaries, horse trainers and circus artists. Roms were crossing Europe aboard large caravans which contained their luggage.\n\nRoms also left a great musical heritage. Guitars and violins are part of their traditions. They influenced a lot of musical styles in Europe, such as flamenco, rumba, jazz, etc. During World War II, Roma people suffered from the Nazis' discriminative policies. Statistics show that about 500,000 Roms died in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nOn 8 April 1971, the Roms' nationality was legally recognised in Europe. Since this day, 8 April is the Roms national day.\n\nEven though they have been recognised, they still suffer from discrimination. Some countries still apply discriminative attitudes towards Roms, especially in workplaces and schools, where they are not accepted. The main reason why they are not accepted is that they kept their nomadic lifestyle, which is against the law in some countries like France. Their squatting communities irritate locals. The Romani created an association in 1978 to defend their rights.\n\n", "id": "89852", "title": "Roma people"}

Scrublands are sometimes known as heathlands. Scrublands may develop naturally or as result of human activity. They may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as a major fire. \n", "id": "89871", "title": "Scrubland"}
