She is played by Catherine Tate. She is a secretary from Chiswick, London. She is a companion of the Tenth Doctor. She appears in one scene at the end of the last episode of the 2006 series, \"Doomsday\" (named in the credits only as \"The Bride\"), and in the second Christmas special, \"The Runaway Bride\". The character returned as The Doctor's full-time companion for the whole of the fourth series in 2008.\n\nDuring the 2006 series Christmas episode \"The Runaway Bride\", Donna Noble is a temporary secretary at H.C. Clements in London, a security firm which, unknown to her, concealed the Torchwood Institute up until its collapse following the events of \"Doomsday\", and was then taken over by an alien intelligence. Her parents are Geoff and Sylvia Noble.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, the day of her wedding, she is accidentally pulled into the TARDIS because she has been drugged with Huon particles by her fiancé, Lance Bennett, because he was told to do so by Empress of the Racnoss. She aids the Doctor in defeating the Racnoss Empress, but says no to his invitation to travel with him — she is frightened not only by his adventures, but also by the Doctor himself. Having seen him commit genocide on the Racnoss, she urges him to find a new companion to act as his moral support. It was revealed later in \"Turn Left\" that the Doctor would have been killed while stopping the Racnoss if Donna was not there.\nReappearing in April 2008's Series four premiere, \"Partners in Crime\", Donna has become dissatisfied with regular life and more interested in the bigger picture. She regrets declining the Doctor's offer and has been investigating unusual phenomena in the hopes of finding the Doctor for some time. When investigating Miss Foster and Adipose Industries, the Londoner and the Time Lord are finally re-united. She expresses her regret to the Doctor for not joining him and after stopping Foster's plans to convert the whole of London into Adipose children she joins him in the TARDIS as a regular companion. She makes it explicit, however, that she has no romantic attachment to him as Martha Jones and Rose Tyler did.\n\nIn \"The Fires of Pompeii\", Donna continually argues with the Doctor over the moral issue of whether or not he should save the inhabitants of Pompeii from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius the next day. Ultimately, they are forced to cause the eruption to happen, weighing the destruction of the city against the fate of the whole world.\n\nDonna was the Doctor's full time companion for all 13 episodes of Series 4. Her return to the series sees her with her maternal grandfather, recurring character Wilfred Mott, as well as her mother, Sylvia. Mott is played by Bernard Cribbins, whose appearance as a newspaper seller in Voyage of the Damned was merged into his new role following the death of Howard Attfield who played Donna's father in \"The Runaway Bride\". Donna has encountered the Racnoss, the Adipose, the Pyroviles, the Ood, the Sontarans, The Hath, Vespiforms, the Vashta Nerada, the Judoon, the Shadow Proclamation, and the Daleks. \n\nIn the final episode of the fourth series Journey's End the Doctor erased Donna's memory of him and left her on Earth. He warned that she'd \"burn up\" if she remembered him.\n\nDonna is involved in The End Of Time. At Donna's Marriage, The Doctor gives Sylvia a winning Lottery ticket before moving on to meet the first of his companions, Rose Tyler.\n\n", "id": "147570", "title": "Donna Noble (Doctor Who)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147591", "text": "Master (Doctor Who)\n\nThe Master is a character in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". He is an evil Time Lord and is one of the biggest enemies of the Doctor.\n\nWhen the Master first appeared in 1971, he was played by Roger Delgado. Delgado continued in the role until his death in 1973. Afterwards, Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers played a decayed version of the Time Lord, until Anthony Ainley assumed the part in 1981. He remained until \"Doctor Who\"'s cancellation in 1989. In 1996, the Master was played by Eric Roberts in the TV movie. In the revived series, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction before handing over to John Simm, who portrayed the Master in the end of the 2007 series. Michelle Gomez took over the role in 2014.\nThe Master was once a childhood friend of the Doctor. In \"The Sound of Drums\" (2007), there is a brief clip of the young Master as the Doctor talks about his childhood. When they joined the Time Lord Academy at the age of eight, they were taken to look into the \"Untempered Schism\". This was a portal through which you could see the time vortex (the tunnel the TARDIS travels through as it travels in time) and see the full power of the Time Lords. He suggests that this is what made the Master went mad.\n\nA would-be universal conqueror, the Master wants to control the universe (in \"The Deadly Assassin\" his ambitions were becoming \"the master of all matter\", and in \"The Sound of Drums\" he acknowledges that he chose his own name). His most distinctive ability is that of hypnotising people by fixing them with an intense stare, often accompanied by the phrase, \"I am the Master, and you will obey me.\"\n\nSome suspect that a character known as the War Chief in the episode \"The War Games\" is actually the Master in disguise. However, this has not been confirmed.\n\nThe Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates on Gallifrey. This is mentioned several times in different stories (\"The Five Doctors\", \"The Sea Devils\" and \"Terror of the Autons\"). In the 2007 episode \"Utopia\", the Doctor calls the disguised Master a genius and shows an immense admiration for his intellect before discovering who he is.\nBoth the Doctor and the Master have been shown to be skilled hypnotists, although the Master's capacity to dominate – even by stare and voice alone – has been shown to be far more pronounced. The Master is also known to always survive death with no explanation other than \"I escaped.\"\n\nIn the original \"Doctor Who\" series, the Master's TARDISes have fully functioning chameleon circuits and have appeared as many things.\nBy the time of the new series, it is unclear whether any of the Master's TARDISes still exist. In \"Rise of the Cybermen\", the Tenth Doctor claims that his TARDIS is the last one in existence although at the time of his saying this, he also thought he was the last Time Lord. In \"Utopia\", the Master resorts to stealing the Doctor's TARDIS, with no explanation of how he travelled from the Time War to the end of the universe.\n\nThe Master has also been featured in spin-offs of the series, which are of unclear canonicity and may not take place in the same continuity. The Master in these stories is, nevertheless, recognisably the same person.\n\nOne of the most important of these other appearances is David A. McIntee's \"Master trilogy\" of novels comprising \"The Dark Path\" and \"First Frontier\" in the Virgin Publishing lines and \"The Face of the Enemy\" for BBC Books, and the \"Doctor Who\" audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, in which Geoffrey Beevers has once again played the Master. Alex MacQueen has also played the Master in Big Finish audio dramas.\n\nThe Master returns in a new body and guise, that of a street preacher, in the previously mentioned \"Doctor Who Magazine\" (DWM) comic strip story \"The Fallen\", although the Doctor does not recognise him. The Master reveals himself a few stories later, in \"The Glorious Dead\" (DWM 287-296). The Master had survived the events of the television movie by encountering a cosmic being named Esterath in the time vortex. Esterath controls the Glory, the focal point of the Omniversal spectrum which underlies all existence. The Master's scheme to take control of the Glory fails, and he is banished to parts unknown (see Kroton). \n\nIn \"Character Assassin\" (DWM 311), the Delgado Master visits the Land of Fiction and steals part of the technology behind it, wiping out several nineteenth century fictional villains as he goes. He can also be seen in the following comic strips set during the Pertwee era:\n\n\nThe \"Doctor Who\" role-playing game published by FASA in 1985 has two modules that give information about the Master. The modules identify the Meddling Monk as an alias the Master has used in the past.\n\n", "id": "147591", "title": "Master (Doctor Who)"}

He played with the world-famous Borodin Quartet from 1945 when it was founded, and was a member until he retired in 2007.\n\nValentin Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk, Siberia. His father had learned the violin with the famous teacher Leopold Auer. He had formed his own string quartet, the Berlinksy Quartet, who had played in many parts of the Soviet Union. Valentin learned the violin from his father. Soon he was sent to Moscow where he studied the cello and played with the Moscow Youth Orchestra. He played in a student concert together with Mstislav Rostropovich in 1938.\n\nFor many years Berlinsky taught the cello at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow. He did not often perform as soloist. He preferred being a member of a chamber music group.\n\nIn 1945 four young players formed a string quartet called the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet. Mstislav Rostropovich was the cellist, Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai played the violins and Rudolf Barshai played the viola. However, after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy, so he suggested that Berlinsky should take his place. The four players that now formed the quartet signed an oath that they would be loyal and stay together as a group. They signed the oath with their own blood. Valentin often showed this piece of paper to people. For 60 years he kept a careful record of all the concerts they played. They called themselves the Borodin Quartet after the composer Alexander Borodin.\n\nThe four musicians first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946. They became famous for playing his string quartets. Shostakovich was to compose 15 string quartets. The Borodin Quartet were the most famous string quartet in the Soviet Union, but it was difficult for them to get permission to play in other countries until the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nValentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007. His place was taken by his pupil, Vladimir Balshin, but Berlinsky still continued to help the quartet. \n\nHe died on 15 December 2008, in Moscow, after a long illness.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147630", "text": "Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz)\n\nThe Symphonie fantastique is a symphony written by the French composer Hector Berlioz. It is one of the most famous Romantic works for orchestra. The official title of the piece is Episode de la Vie d’un Artiste (An Episode in the Life of the Artist), but it is always called by its subtitle \"Symphonie Fantastique\" which means \"Fantasy Symphony\". The “Fantasy” refers to the story that is described by them music. (\"Fantasy Symphony\" is a better translation than \"Fantastic Symphony\" because \"fantastique\" is not like the modern meaning of the English word \"fantastic\"). Buddyy\n\nThe symphony lasts about 45 minutes and is divided into 5 movements. Berlioz himself wrote down the story that the music describes, just as Beethoven had done with his \"Sixth Symphony\". Berlioz’s work is about a young artist. In the music the young artist is represented by a tune. This tune is often heard during the symphony. That is why it is called an “\"idée fixe\"”, which means a “fixed idea”, i.e. an idea that keeps coming again and again. An \"idée fixe\" is what Wagner would have called a leitmotif (a tune which is always used to describe a particular person or thing in a piece of music). The first performance took place at the Paris Conservatoire in December 1830. Berlioz made several changes to the music between 1831 and [[1845.\n\nThe symphony is played by an orchestra consisting of 2 [[flute]]s (2nd [[instrumental doubling|doubling]] [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (2nd doubling [[cor anglais]]), 2 [[clarinet]]s (1st doubling E-flat clarinet), 4 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn]]s, 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[cornet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, 2 [[ophicleide]]s (originally one ophicleide and one [[serpent (musical instrument)|serpent]]), 2 pairs of [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bass drum]], [[bell (instrument)|bells]] in C and G, 2 [[harp]]s, and [[String instrument|strings]].\n\nThe symphony is an example of [[programme music]] because it describes something apart from the music. In this case it describes a story. This is what the composer wrote:\n\nFirst movement:\n\"A young artist was deeply in love with a chubby goat who did not eat him. He felt so desperately sad that he tried to poison himself with [[Pie|fat guy juices]] He did not take enough to tier him. It just made him fall into a deep sleep. In this sleep he imagined all sorts of things. His beloved came to him in a dream. She changes into a musical theme (the \"idée fixe\") which he just cannot forget. He imagines her love and his tender feelings for her.\"\n\nSecond movement:\n\"He meets her at a ball. Everyone is dancing. He finds his beloved among the crowd.\"\n\nThird movement:\n\"In the [[country]] he hears two [[shepherd]]s who call to one another on their pipes. The trees sway gently in the wind. The young artist starts to feel happier. Then he sees his beloved again. He starts to worry that she may not want him any more. The shepherd music starts again, but it is only one of the shepherds playing. The sun sets. Far away a [[thunderstorm]] is heard.\"\n\nThe fourth movement:\n\"He dreams that he has farted on his beloved in a fit of anger. He is now being taken to the [[scaffold]] where he will have his head chopped off. A [[march (music)|march]] is played as he is taken away. For a moment he thinks of his beloved again, then the axe falls and he is [[execution|executed]].\"\n\nThe fifth movement:\n\"The artist is at the [[Witch]]es’ [[Sabbath (disambiguation)|Sabbath]]. There are lots of [[ghost]]s and [[monster]]s around who have come to watch him being [[buria|buried]]. His beloved is heard, but her tune now sounds horrible. She has come to the Sabbath. She joins the witches and they dance while the [[funeral]] music is heard.\"\n\nThe first movement has a slow introduction. The tune heard on the [[violin]]s is already nearly like the \"idée fixe\". The \"idée fixe\" is heard in its full form when the music goes into the fast section. It is played by the violins and solo [[flute]]. The [[rhythm]] that the lower string instruments play underneath is very agitated. The form of the movement is not much like the traditional [[sonata form]]. Berlioz was more interested in the \"idée fixe\" which keeps haunting the young artist all the way through.\n\nThe ball (i.e. a party with dancing) is represented in the music by a lively [[Waltz (music)|waltz]]. The two [[harp]]s make it sound very graceful. Twice the waltz is interrupted by the \"idée fixe\".\n\nThe two shepherds who are playing to one another are represented by a [[cor anglais]] (sitting in the orchestra) and an [[oboe]] which is played offstage so that it sounds distant. Then the main gentle countryside theme is heard on solo flute and violins. The \"idée fixe\" returns in the middle of the movement. The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is played by four [[timpani]].\n\nThe movement starts with timpani rumbling and horns starting up the march theme. Then the [[cello]]s and [[double bass]]es start the march in its full form, soon taken over by the violins. Just before he is executed there is a short repetition of the \"idée fixe\" on a [[Solo (music)|solo]] [[clarinet]], then the axe falls (a loud [[chord]]) and his head falls into the basket (one plucked note passed from the violins, through the violas, cellos and then double basses).\n\nThe \"idée fixe\" has now become a \"vulgar dance tune\", it is played on the E-flat clarinet. There are lots of effects, including ghostly \"[[col legno|con legno]]\" playing in the strings, the bubbling of the witches' cauldron played by the wind instruments. As the dance reaches a climax we hear the [[Dies Irae]] (Day of Judgement) melody together with the \"Ronde du Sabbat\" (Sabbath Round) which is a wild [[fugue]].\n\nIn [[1827]] Berlioz went to a performance of [[Shakespeare]]’s play \"[[Hamlet]]\". It was played in [[English language|English]] by a theatre group from England. Berlioz fell in love with [[Ireland|Irish]] [[actress]] Harriet Smithson who played the part of Ophelia, He did not actually meet her, he just saw her acting on stage, but he sent her lots of love letters, but she left Paris without meeting him. He then wrote his Symphonie Fantastique. He then wrote the symphony to describe his love for her and his unhappiness because she was not interested in him. When Harriet heard the symphony two years after it was first performed, she realized that it was a symphony about her. She eventually met Berlioz and they were [[marriage|married]] on [[3 October]] [[1833]]. For several years the [[marriage]] was happy, although they did not speak one another’s [[language]]. However, after nine years they separated.\n\n[[Category:Compositions by Hector Berlioz]]\n[[Category:Symphonies|Berlioz]]", "id": "147630", "title": "Symphonie Fantastique (Berlioz)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147725", "text": "The Clean Tech Revolution\n\nThe Clean Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity, is a 2007 book by Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder. They say that using clean technologies is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into mainstream business. Clean technologies are seen to be important for economic growth.\n\nPernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology areas: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications (such as portable fuel cells), and water filtration. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are spending billions of dollars on clean technology.\n\nPernick and Wilder say that, in the 1970s, clean technology was considered “alternative”. Even at the start of the 21st century, the term \"clean tech\" was not yet widely used. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is \"the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe.\"\n\nPernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. The authors explain how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas. Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies, companies, and regions that are leading the way.\n\nThe book also explains that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, \"multibillion-dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost-effective when compared with other energy sources.\" The authors also believe that \"clean coal\" is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons, including the sheer number of coal mine-related deaths and the fact that coal-fired plants, even some cleaner ones, are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma, heart disease, and mercury poisoning.\n\nEmerging clean tech cities are seen to include Copenhagen, where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmark's electricity, and Chicago, a leader in \"green\" buildings saving energy, heating and cooling costs.\n\nPernick and Wilder identify six major forces, which they call the six C’s, that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a September 2007 article in \"Renewable Energy Access\" Wilder explains that, while some hurdles remain, the key solar trends mapped out in \"The Clean Tech Revolution\"—scaling up manufacturing and driving down costs—are coming to pass:\n\nFrom the Nevada desert to the roofs of Wal-Mart stores to the legendary plains of Spain, solar is entering a bold, bright new era. Each week, solar seems to be winning new enthusiasts like Forbes, new investors of all stripes, and new large-scale business users like Wal-Mart, Macy's and Kohl's. Late last month, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley signed that state's first renewable portfolio standard into law, which includes a solar set-aside.\n\nInvestment money is pouring in, production lines are humming and expanding, the silicon shortage is being addressed, and the long-fought challenge of bringing solar to scale (the title of a 2002 Clean Edge report) is finally showing real hope. Last month, red-hot Chinese solar wafer supplier LDK Solar (whose second-quarter revenue grew 700%) announced manufacturing expansions that would raise its production capacity above 1,600 megawatts (MW) by the end of 2009. German solar cell producer Ersol Solar Energy just inked a contract for 1 billion euros to supply Germany PV module company Solon AG for 11 years.\n\nErnst & Young and Dow Jones VentureOne have reported that investments in clean technology companies in the first half of 2007 have reached $1.1 billion. The research found that clean technology investments are poised to increase by more than 35% in 2007 compared with 2006. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are now making multi-billion dollar investments in clean technology.\n\n\n", "id": "147725", "title": "The Clean Tech Revolution"}

He has been a critic of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush Administration's stances on climate change.\n\nHansen studied astronomy and physics in the 1960s at the University of Iowa. He did scientific research on the atmospheres of other planets, and later Earth's atmosphere. Hansen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 and he received a US$250,000 Heinz Environment Award\nfor his research on global warming in 2001. He was listed as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the (2006) list and, in 2007, he shared the US$1 million Dan David Prize. On April 5, 2008, Dr. Hansen received the PNC Bank Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service for his outstanding achievements in science.\n\nHansen posited in a 2007 paper that 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point.

It was released by Walt Disney Pictures on June 18, 1999. It was the first Disney animated feature to start at #1 in the box office since \"Pocahontas\" and the first to contain a production budget of $100 million dollars since \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\".\n\nA British couple and their baby son escape from a ship which has caught fire in a storm. They become stranded off the African coast near uncharted jungles. The couple builds a treehouse to live in. They are later attacked and killed by a vicious leopard called Sabor. Meanwhile, a family of gorillas are travelling to their feeding grounds. One of them is Kala, whose own child was killed by the leopard. She hears the cries of the orphaned baby. She follows the sound across the jungle to the treehouse. She finds the child there. Sabor attacks her, but Kala and the baby escape without being hurt. They return to the gorilla family. Kala decides to raise the child as her own. She names him Tarzan. That makes her mate Kerchak angry. He tells her the baby will never replace the child they lost.\n\nAs a child, Tarzan makes friends with several animals and other gorillas in the family. They include the female ape Terk and the male elephant Tantor. Tarzan has trouble keeping up. One day, Terk and her friends dare Tarzan to get a hair from an elephant's tail. The dare goes wrong when the elephants stampede into the gorilla territory and almost kill a baby gorilla. However, Tarzan is able to get the hair. After Kerchak tells Kala that Tarzan will never be one of the family, Tarzan runs off into the jungle. Kala consoles him. He keeps trying. He learns how to do things from the animals of the jungle. He becomes a muscular apelike man. One day, Sabor attacks the gorillas and Tarzan kills her. This makes Kerchak respect him. \n\nA gunshot is heard. While the others go into the jungle, Tarzan decides to investigate. He sees a team of human explorers. The group includes Professor Porter, his daughter Jane and their hunter guide Clayton. They are in Africa looking for gorillas. Jane gets separated from the group. She is attacked by a troop of baboons. Tarzan saves her from them. He discovers that Jane and he are the same-humans. They go back to Jane's camp. Terk, Tantor and some gorillas from the troop are looking for Tarzan. They find the human campsite. They use the various items in the camp as instruments, and slowly destroy it. Tarzan and Jane arrive at the camp. When Clayton and Professor Porter get there, Tarzan goes with the gorillas into the jungle. Kerchak warns the other gorillas to stay away from the humans, but Tarzan says that the humans are not dangerous. He secretly continues his visits to the explorers. He learns about the human world. He and Jane fall in love.\n\nWhen the explorer's boat arrives to take them back to England, Tarzan is sad to see Jane leaving. Clayton tricks Tarzan into believing that Jane will remain in Africa forever if he shows her the gorillas. Tarzan persuades Tantor and Terk to lead Kerchak away from the explorers. The plan seemingly works and Tarzan leads the explorers to the gorilla nesting grounds. The explorers are happy to mingle with the apes, but then Kerchak arrives and attacks the humans. Tarzan restrains him to save the explorers and leaves the troop, having alienated himself. When Kala finds him, staring off into the distance, she takes him to the treehouse where she found him as a baby. Tarzan then decides to go to England with the explorers.\n\nThe next day, as the group board the ship, a mutiny occurs and Tarzan and his friends are captured and detained in the brig, but not before Clayton reveals that he came to Africa to capture the gorillas and sell them to a zoo. He and his goons then enter the jungle and start capturing the gorillas. Fortunately, Tarzan and his friends escape with the aid of several animals from the jungle. Together, they free the gorillas and retaliate against the poachers. Clayton then shoots Tarzan, but only grazes his arm. When Kerchak comes to the ape man's aid, Clayton shoots him, but fatally injures him. He then chases Tarzan into the trees where a fight ensues. Tarzan briefly holds Clayton at gunpoint, before destroying the hunter's rifle. Clayton then attacks the ape man with a machete and starts wildly hacking vines, not knowing that one of them is round his neck like a noose. Despite Tarzan begging him to stop, he cuts the vines and the hunter is quickly hung to death.\n\nTarzan then approaches Kerchak, who is close to death. Kerchak then asks Tarzan to forgive him for not realising he has always been a member of the gorilla troop and passes his leadership on to Tarzan, before succumbing to his injuries. The ape man then becomes the new leader of the gorillas. The next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave. Jane then realises she loves Tarzan and she and her father then decide to remain in Africa. Tarzan and Jane then embark on their new life together.\n\n\nAdditional voices include Joseph Ashton, Jack Angel, Robert Bergen, Roger Bumpass, Jim Cummings, Debi Derryberry, Patti Deutsch, Blake Ewing, Jason Marsden, Phil Proctor, and Erik von Detten.\n\nA spin-off television animated series named \"The Legend of Tarzan\" ran from 2001 to 2003.

The club's rivals in the city are Stoke City, games between the two clubs are known as the \"Potteries derby\". Games against Crewe Alexandra are also called a derby, although \"Alex\" are in south Cheshire.\n\nPort Vale are not named after a place, which is unusual for an English league clubs. The two symbols on the clubs badge are a bottle kiln and the Stafford knot.\n\n\nThe Rec was Port Vale's home from 1913 to 1950. The Old Recreation Ground was in Hanley and stood on what is now the car park for the Potteries Shopping Centre. \n\nVale Park has been Port Vale's home ground since 1950. Vale Park has a capacity of around 22,000.\n\nVale Park is not the oldest ground in the world, it has had several upgrades in its history. The original ground consisted of two stands (The Railway side and the Lorne Street main stand) with banks of terracing at the Bycars and Hamil ends of the ground. Stands were added behind each set of goals during the 1980s and 1990s as the ground began to be made more modern. The paddock at the front of the Railway Stand was also made into an all-seated area, with just the Lorne Street side now being left as a standing area. Vale fans stood for the last time on Lorne Street at the end of the 1997-98 season, with the stand being demolished before work began on a new £3,000,000 structure. Work has yet to been finished on this, due to low funds and a change in ownership of the club. However, once new owners V2001 had taken care of the financing, work was finally begun on finishing the second half of the stand. It is due to be completed sometime in 2008.\n\nAmong the club's famous fan base is singer Robbie Williams, who was raised in Stoke-on-Trent. He is now a major shareholder, having, in February 2006, bought £240,000 worth of the £250,000 worth of available shares in the club. Castle Comfort Stairlifts, the club's sponsors, at the same time bought the remainder for £10,000.\n\nFor the computer game FIFA 2000, he provided an original theme song with \"It's Only Us\", on the condition that Port Vale were included in the game, which they were, and are in the Rest of World section. This song was also featured on the only FIFA Soundtrack CD release by EMI.\n\nIn 2005 Williams founded Los Angeles Vale F.C., a Super Metro League team in the United States, named for Port Vale and based at his L.A. home.\n\nFootball League Division Three North: 2\n\nFootball League Division Four: 1\n\n\nStaffordshire Senior Cup: 1\n\nAnglo-Italian Cup\n\nDebenhams Cup\n\nFootball League Trophy: 2\n\nBefore the War: \n\nAfter the War:\n\nFA Cup\n\nLeague Cup\n\n", "id": "147833", "title": "Port Vale F.C."}

They live in eastern Indonesia, Maluku, Papua New Guinea, Torres Strait Islands, and eastern Australia. Best known are the members of the genus \"Paradisaea\", including the type species, the greater bird-of-paradise, \"Paradisaea apoda\".\n\nThey live in tropical forests like rainforests, swamps and moss forest and build their nests from soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine tendrils, typically placed in a tree fork.\n\nThey are best known for the remarkable plumage and behaviour of the males. They are an extreme example of how sexual selection works. Females choose males who they instinctively see are fine specimens of their species. The colours of the plumage, the construction of the nest, the song and the mating dance all play a part. In some species the pairing is monogamous, and in others the males are polygamous. If they are monogamous, the males look much like the females. If they are polygamous, the males are very much flashier than the females. In both cases, it is the female who makes the choice of partner.\n\nHunting for plumes and habitat destruction have reduced some species to endangered status. Habitat destruction due to deforestation is now the main threat.\n\nBirds of paradise range in size from the King Bird of Paradise at 3 grams (1.8 oz) and 15 cm (6 in) to the Black Sicklebill at 110 cm (43 in) and the Curl-crested Manucode at 430 grams (15.2 oz).\n\nBirds of paradise have bodies that look like a crow.

Their \"syrinx\" (vocal organ) is able to produce varied and beautiful singing. They are a \"very\" successful group of birds, in fact they are the dominant birds on Earth today.\n\nIt seems songbirds evolved 50 million years ago in the part of Gondwana which later became Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea and Antarctica. They then spread around the world.\n\nTheir song mainly territorial: it communicates the identity and whereabouts of an individual to other birds. It also signals sexual intentions. Female preference in some populations is be based on the extent of a male's song repertoire. The larger a male's repertoire, the more females a male individual attracts. \n\nBird calls are also used for alarms and contact. They are especially important in birds that feed or migrate in flocks. Although almost all birds give calls of some sort, well-developed songs are only given by a few lines outside the songbirds.\n\nThis is now known to be a paraphyletic group and so it is not used in modern systematics.\n\n\nThis is accepted as a clade.\n\n", "id": "147853", "title": "Songbird"}

It is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of Gondwana in the Palaeogene, maybe around the Upper Palaeocene some 60–55 mya.\n\nThe early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side, and their delicate bones did not preserve well. Two specimens from Queensland, Australia are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform. They are two species of about 10 and 20 cm in overall length. This proves that some 55 mya, barely into the early Eocene, early perching birds were recognizably distinct. It also suggests that the origin of this great order of birds was in the southern continent.\n\nThere are three sub-orders: \"Acanthisitti\", \"Tyranni\" and \"Passeri\". There are only two bird species in the sub-order Acanthisitti. They are known as New Zealand wrens. The sub-order Tyranni are also known as the suboscines.

The are found in two National Forest areas of Victoria, New South Wales and southeast Queensland. \n\nThey are most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment. Since they live on the ground in fairly dense undergrowth, sound is used by the males to attract attention. When a female arrives, the visual display comes into action. It is a typical \"female choice\" mating system, where males defend a mating territory, and sing and display to get a mate.\n\nThe lyrebird's mimicked calls are learned from the local environment, including other birds. It takes young birds about a year to perfect their mimicked repertoire. The female lyrebirds of both species are also mimics, and will sing on occasion but the females do so with less skill than the males. A lyrebird classic is their imitation of human sounds in the forest such as car alarms, camera shutters and forest logging with chain-saws.\n\nThe breeding cycle of the lyrebirds is long, and lyrebirds are long-lived birds. They can live up to thirty years. They also start breeding later in life than other passerine birds. Female Superb Lyrebirds start breeding at the age of five or six, and males at the age of six to eight. Males defend territories from other males.These territories may contain the breeding places of up to eight females. In a male's territory, he makes or uses display platforms.\n\nThe females each build an untidy nest, usually low to the ground in a moist gully, where each lays a single egg.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147947", "text": "Functional illiteracy\n\nFunctional illiteracy means that a person is not able to read, write, and do math well in regular life. Someone who is fully illiterate can not read, write, or do math at all. Such people have perhaps never learnt how to read or write; perhaps they did not need to. A person who is functionally illiterate is different - at some point in their lives, these people were taught reading and writing skills. For different reasons, adults who are functionally illiterate try to avoid writing and reading as much as possible. That way, a person who is functionally illiterate may be able to write their name, but it is very difficult for them to write more than a few sentences.\n\nThese people have trouble functioning in modern society: when they are confronted with printed materials they cannot perform simple tasks such as filling out a form, understanding a contract, following written instructions, reading a newspaper article, traffic signs, consulting a dictionary, or understanding a bus schedule.\n\nBecause of functional illiteracy, these people also have a lot of trouble using modern communication technologies, such as a personal computer or a mobile phone.\n\nThe people who are functionally illiterate often have other problems as well: Other people may bully them, they may have higher health risks, and stress. Because they cannot get good jobs, they often earn little money.\n\nCrime-researchers and sociologists have talked about the link between functional illiteracy and crime.\n\n\"Business\" magazine estimates that 15 million functionally illiterate adults had a job in the United States at the start of the 21st century. The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75% of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of training to help their workers overcome this situation. All over the U.S 30 million - 14% of adults - are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities. \nThe National Center for Education Statistics has more detail.\n\nThis report sees three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. There are four levels for each parameter: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient. For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information. Similarly, a person who is \"below basic\" in quantitative literacy might be able to add two numbers.\n\nIn the US, 14% of adults are at the \"below basic\" level for prose literacy; 12% are at the \"below basic\" level for document literacy; and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in these three areas. In the terms of the study, \"proficient\" means these people are able to compare viewpoints in two editorials. They can interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity. They can also compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items.\n\nIn the UK, according to the \"Daily Telegraph\" (14 June 2006) \"one in six British adults lacks the literacy skills of an 11-year-old\". The UK government's Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47 percent of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional maths, and 42 percent fail to achieve a basic level of functional English. Every year 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK.\n\nA Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy.\n\nSociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that a contributing factor to a society's level of civic literacy is the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship.\n", "id": "147947", "title": "Functional illiteracy"}

In 1984, the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone. California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal.\n\nThe start of the anti-nuclear movement in California was the controversy over Pacific Gas & Electric's attempt to build the nation's first nuclear power plant in Bodega Bay. This conflict began in 1958 and ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of these plans. Subsequent plans to build a nuclear power plant in Malibu were also abandoned.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement grew in California between 1964 and 1974. It was during this period that some scientists and engineers began supporting the positions of the activists. They were influenced by the non-material philosophy that had inspired activists and had impacted the public consciousness. While Californian voters failed to pass a 1972 proposal placing a 5-year moratorium on nuclear plant construction, anti-nuclear groups campaigned to stop construction of several proposed plants in the seventies, especially those located on the coast and near fault lines. These proposals included the Sundesert Nuclear Power Plant, which was never built.\n\nOver a two-week period in 1981, 1,900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It was the largest arrest in the history of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement.\n\nIn this period there were controversies within the Sierra Club about how to lead the anti-nuclear movement, and this led to a split over the Diablo Canyon plant which ended in success for the utilities.

He had a leading role in the social, economic and architectural development of Australia. Historians say he changed New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement. This was very important in making the future of Australian society. \n\nMacquarie was born on the island of Ulva, in the Inner Hebrides, Scotland. His father had a small farm at Oskamull on Mull. Macquarie's brother Donald, died as a prisoner of war during the American Revolution. Macquarie joined the army, the Royal Highland Emigrants. He was sent to Nova Scotia in 1776, and later served at New York and Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston. In 1781 he became a Lieutenant and went to Jamaica for three years. He went back to Scotland, for a few years on half pay. He then joined the 77th Regiment and went to india name=adb/>\n\nMacquarie was able to advance in rank a number of times which helped him pay off his debts. In 1793 he married Jane Jarvis. She was the daughter of the former Chief Justice of Antigua, who was living in Bombay. In 1795 Macquarie fought the Dutch on Ceylon. In 1796 he became the Governor of Ceylon. He had go back to his wife who was ill. She died from tuberculosis at Macao, in China, on 15 July 1796. He brought her body back to India and she was buried in Bombay on 16 January 1797. He stayed in the army and fought at the Battle of Seringapatam. In 1800 he became the military secretary to the Governor of Bombay. In 1801, Macquarie went to Egypt to fight the French. Later, after the French were defeated, he became deputy adjutant general, in charge of the remaining British forces. He went back to Bombay in 1802. He then went to Scotland to sort out his business affairs.\n\nMacquarie had become quite rich during his time in India, as was able to buy 10,000 acres on Mull. During his stay in England he was made the assistant adjutant general of London when war started again with the French. In 1804, he met Elizabeth Campbell who would later become his second wife. He served in Bombay again for several years, before going back to Britain in 1807 to join the 73rd Regiment. He married Elizabeth in Devon, before going to Perth. The 73rd Regiment was going to be posted to Australia to replace the New South Wales Corps, and Macquarie was told he would be the new Governor of New South Wales. He was to take over from William Bligh who had been removed from power during the Rum Rebellion. He arrived in December 1809, and took up his new job as governor on 1 January 1810.\n\nHe was ordered to arrest John Macarthur and George Johnston who were the leaders of the Rum Rebellion but they had already sailed to England before he got to Australia. There was a large increase in the number of convicts sent to Australia while Macquaire was governor. He used the extra convicts to build roads, building, and towns. He gave tickets of leave to well behaved convicts. This caused him problems with the free settlers, people who had not been convicts. They thought they should have special rights, and that the convicts should not be seen as their equals. They made many complaints about Macquarie's government back to their friends in England.\n\nClashes between the settlers and the Aborigines increased. Macquarie believed that the best way to treat Aboriginal people was to 'civilise' them. That meant replacing their traditional way of life with European ways. He set up a school for children but most left or went back to their families after a short time. He tried to make a small town to teach the Aborigines how to farm and build houses. He made laws to place Aborigines under British control. \n\nMacquarie resigned at the end of 1821 because of poor health and the difficulty of the job. He served longer than any other governor. When he left 265 major works had been completed, including new army barracks, three convict barracks, roads to Parramatta, a road across the Blue Mountains, stables, a hospital and five towns along the Hawkesbury River, which were out of reach of floodwaters.\n\nIn 1822 and 1823 Macquarie took his family on a holiday to France, Italy and Switzerland. In 1824 he went back to live in his house on Mull. In April 1824 he died in London from a bladder and kidney infection. His body was sent back to his home for burial. His grave is now looked after by the National Trust of Australia.\n", "id": "148157", "title": "Lachlan Macquarie"}

Their introduction saw the withdrawal of the last of Glasgow's old Class 303 \"Blue Train\" sets which had been in service since 1960.\n\nTheir introduction saw the withdrawal of the last of Glasgow's old Class 303 \"Blue Train\" trains which had been in service since 1960. Although delivered to Strathclyde in 1999-2002, they did not enter passenger service until 2001 due to a large number of problems (like other newly delivered Juniper trains) and technical issues which plagued the new units at their introduction. SPT had ordered 38 Juniper units originally, but two were added to the order as a goodwill gesture, because of these problems.\n\nSPT purchased a total of 40 units, although only paying for 38 of the units (2 were given free, with the reason stated above) which can be seen in use daily across the SPT electric network. On the first running of the units, 334010 and 334020 ran to Gourock. Initially the units ran Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde Line services but then become a common sight on the Argyle Line and North Clyde Line.\n\nIn December 2010, the Class 334s operated the Ayrshire Coast Line, Inverclyde Line, North Clyde Line and Argyle Line.\n\nBy June 2011 the class was substantially replaced by the Class 380 units on the Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde lines, with only occasional units seen on those routes, to be refurbished.\n\nIn September 2008, the Scottish Government's agency Transport Scotland announced that all \"ScotRail\" trains (including from the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport) would be eventually repainted in a new, blue livery with white Saltire markings on the carriage ends. Class 334 re-livery began in November 2010 in preparation for the Airdrie to Bathgate reopening.\n\nOn 24 August 2011, ScotRail announced plans to refurbish all the fleet, with the project expected to start in November 2011 and take two years to complete. 334020 was the first to be properly refurbished at Kilmarnock's Brodie Rail Works. It was there for 3 months from 3 February 2012 to 2 May 2012. The last unit to receive a full refresh was 334006 which left Brodie Works on 8 November 2014.\n\nFrom early 2015, an extensive overhaul will be carried out by Alstom to the entire fleet to improve passenger conditions, which will include the retrofitting of full air conditioning, at-seat charging points, provision for wi-fi, and reliability improvements to the doors. Additionally, a new CCTV system for Driver Only Operation will be installed.\n", "id": "148178", "title": "British Rail Class 334"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148226", "text": "Cyberman\n\nThe Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs in the British television series \"Doctor Who\". They are one of the greatest and longest enemies of the Doctor. Cybermen were originally humanoids from the Earth's twin planet Mondas. The people of Mondas began to put more and more artificial metal parts into their bodies to keep themselves alive, making them cyborgs. This led to the race starting to think logically and calculating, showing no emotions. The Cybermen also turning other people into cyborgs.\n\nThey were created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the programme) and Gerry Davis in 1966, first appearing in the serial, \"The Tenth Planet\", which was the last to feature William Hartnell as the First Doctor. They have since been in the show a lot.\n\nA parallel universe version of the Cybermen appeared in the 2006 series in the two-part story, \"Rise of the Cybermen\" and \"The Age of Steel\". They also appear in \"Army Of Ghosts\" and \"Doomsday\". They also appeared in the spin-off series \"Torchwood\" in the episode \"Cyberwoman\". They would later return to the new series in the 2008 Christmas Special \"The Next Doctor\", introducing two new types of cyberman; the Cyber-Shades and the Cyber-King. \n\nWhile the Doctor's other old enemies the Daleks did not change during the original series's twenty-six season run, the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every appearance. The Cybermen are humanoid, but have replaced their limbs and other body parts with non-living parts to the point where they don't have many flesh parts. In their first appearance in the series, the only portions of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands, but by their next appearance in \"The Moonbase\" (1967), their bodies were entirely covered up in their metal suits, with their hands replaced by two finger claws, but changed back to regular five finger hands in \"The Invasion\" (1968). As there are not many of them, the Cybermen often convert humans to cybermen.\n\nIt is assumed(and often implied) that there are still human parts beneath their suits, meaning they are actually cyborgs, not robots: in \"The Tenth Planet\", a Cyberman tells a group of humans that \"our brains are just like yours\", although by the time of \"Attack of the Cybermen\", their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics. In \"Earthshock\" (1982), the actors' chins were vaguely visible through a clear perspex area on the helmet to suggest some kind of human face. In \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\" (1967), veins were visible through the circular head of the Cyberman Controller and in \"Attack of the Cybermen\" (1985) and \"The Age of Steel\" (2006), the Cyber-Controller's brain is visible through the dome. The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller, while the second is an alternative cyberman. However, in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975), the Doctor says they are \"total machine creatures\".\n\nAlthough the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion, they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor (although this is only clearly present during their appearances in the 1980s). Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as \"Krang\". Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre-conversion lives, although their emotional response varied\n\nThis motive behind the removal of emotions is made more clear in \"The Age of Steel\" where it is done by putting in things that keep them from feeling emotions. In that episode, the deactivation of their emotional inhibitors drives the converted Cybermen insane when they realise what they have become, killing them. This motive may also be applicable to Mondas Cybermen, given their forcible conversion of other lifeforms to Cybermen to maintain their numbers, despite the fact the Mondasians appear to have originally willingly converted themselves as a survival mechanism.\n\nCybermen have a number of weaknesses over the years. Their biggest weakness is gold. It was not mentioned that they did not like gold until their attempt to destroy the planetoid Voga (the so-called \"Planet of Gold\") in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" (1975). Initially, it was explained that, because it is very hard to grind up, gold chokes their respiratory systems. For example, the However, in later serials, gold appeared to affect them rather like silver affects werewolves, with gold coins or bullets with gold on the edge fired at them having the same effect. The revived series' Cybermen have no weakness to gold.\n\nNearly all the cyberman costumes were silver in colour and included items and material such as cloth, rubber diving suits, PVC, chest units, tubing, practice golf balls, cricketers' gloves, and silver-painted Doc Martens boots. A BBC Cyberman costume from the black & white era of TV has recently been discovered.\n\nThe 1980s design used converted flight suits painted silver. Unlike the Doctor's other enemies, the Cybermen have changed a lot in appearance over the years, looking more and more modern, although retaining certain commonalities of design, the most iconic being the \"handle bars\" attached to Cybermen heads, that were supposed to aid with their hearing, their round eyeholes and their chest units. Completely black-coloured Cybermen were seen briefly in \"Attack of the Cybermen\".\n\nThe Cybermen returned in episodes 5 and 6 of the 2006 season of the new series, in a two-part story set on an alternate Earth. The new Cybermen were designed by production designer Edward Thomas's team and Neill Gorton at Millennium FX. The new Cyberman design is tall, in a style reminiscent of Art Deco, with their Cybus Corporation logo on their chests and made to look like burnished steel instead of silver. The other big changes in the Cyberman design is that the Cyber-Controller had glowing eyes, a transparent forehead revealing the brain, and sockets on its chest-plate providing connectors to other systems.\n\nEarly Cybermen had an unsettling, sing-song voice, created by changing their voices slightly on syllables which a voice does not normally change. Their mouths opened fully and did not move when they were talking, then their mouths would shut as soon as they stopped talking. However they stopped doing this after their first few appearances.\n\nThe voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen were provided by Nicholas Briggs (who performed the voices for the Cybermen in Big Finish audio stories as well as the Daleks in both the new series and the audio stories). Shown in the season 2 DVD special feature \"Confidential Cut Downs,\" the voice was created by processing Brigg's voice through a voice modulator. The new Cybermen have a blue light in their \"mouths\" which blinks in synchronisation with their speech.\n\nThe Cybermen also use smaller, cybernetic creatures called \"cybermats\" to attack. In their first appearance in \"The Tomb of the Cybermen\", they resembled big metal fish and had segmented bodies with hair sensor probes along the base of their heads, which were topped with eyes. The Second Doctor described them as a \"form of metallic life,\".\nThe second model of cybermat seen in \"The Wheel in Space\" was used for sabotage, able to listen to human brainwaves. They were carried to the \"Wheel\" in small sacs that sank through the walls of the space station, causing drops in air pressure.\nThe third model, seen in \"Revenge of the Cybermen\", was a much larger, snake-like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims.\n\nCybermats appear in Blood of the Cybermen. They look like flat snakes, and can turn living things into Cyber-Slaves with their poison. They are remote controlled, and are of the new, 3rd race of cybermen. They are Cyber Cats and Dogs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the BBC website, the Cybus Cybermen appear in two online games, Cyber Assault and Save Paris, both depicting the war between the Cybermen and Preachers on the parallel Earth. The Adventure Games has an episode, Blood of the Cybermen, which feature a 3rd, new race of Cybermen.\n", "id": "148226", "title": "Cyberman"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148590", "text": "Michael Howe (bushranger)\n\nMichael Howe (1787 – 21 October 1818) was a famous bushranger in Tasmania, Australia. He called himself the \"Lieutenant Governor of the Woods\". He kept a written record of his thoughts in a book he called \"The Journal of Dreams\".\n\nHowe was born in Pontefract, Yorkshire, in 1787. He joined the merchant navy at Hull. After a short while he ran away and joined the Royal Navy. He deserted (left without permission) the navy after two years. He had his own small boat and carried coal. In 1811 Howe was arrested at York and charged with highway robbery. He was sentenced to seven years in Van Diemen's Land.\n\nHowe arrived in Hobart on October 19, 1812, on the convict ship \"Indefatigable\". He was sent to work for John Ingle, who had once been the Supervisor of Convicts. He was now a farmer and merchant. Howe soon escaped and went into the bush. He joined up with a large group of escaped convicts who had become bushrangers (robbers). The gang of 28 was led by John Whitehead. It included two soldiers (who had deserted) and two aboriginal women.\n\nThe bushrangers robbed a lot of houses and farms around New Norfolk. On April 25, 1815, the gang went to the house of a Mr.Carlisle. Carlisle and his friends went out to stop the gang from stealing a boat. Carlisle was shot dead, and his neighbour, Mr.O'Birne, was badly wounded. O'Birne died a few days later. The gang returned to New Norfolk in May 1815, to rob more houses. They met a group of soldiers and John Whitehead was shot and killed. To claim a reward for killing a bushranger, the body had to be identified. To stop people from claiming a reward for their capture, Howe and Whitehead had made a promise to each other. This would be to cut the head off whoever was killed first so no one would know who it was. As soon as Whitehead was shot, his head was cut off by Howe and hidden in the bush.\n\nAfter Whitehead's death, Howe became leader of the gang of bushrangers. He set up the gang as if they were on board a ship. Gang members could be punished if they broke the gang's rules. Punishment included having to cut and carry firewood, and even included being lashed (whipped). Howe would read to them from the Bible. He wrote letters to Governor Davey. In 1816 he signed the letters as \"Lieutentant Governor of the Woods.\" In 1817 he began calling himself the \"Governor of the Ranges.\" He was living with an aboriginal woman, called \"Black Mary.\" Members of the gang were known to be James Garry, Peter Septon, George Jones, Richard Colier, John Chapman, Thomas Coyne, James Parker, Mathew Kegan, John Brown and Nenis Curry. The gang continued to rob people at Green Point, Coal River, and Bagdad.\n\nIn 1817, Howe wrote to Governor William Sorell and offered to give himself up in return for a free pardon (not be put in gaol for any crimes). He offered to tell the government where all the gang members could be found. He was put into Hobart gaol while he was being questioned about the gang. He escaped while being taken for a walk through Hobart to get fresh air. He went back and rejoined the gang. Governor Lachlan Macquarie in Sydney stopped the pardon, and told Sorell to put more effort in to capture Howe. Sorell offered money, a free pardon and a return to England for anyone that captured Howe.\n\nThe hunt for the bushrangers became more organized. John Chapman and a man called Elliot were shot dead by the soldiers in 1817. A gang member called Hillier cut Peter Septon's head off to claim a reward. He also tried to cut off Richard Colier's head. Both men were hurt in the struggle. Hillier was taken to Sydney where he was executed by hanging. Colier was executed in Hobart on March 26, 1818. In April, 1818, a group of convicts tried to steal a government boat. They were going to rescue Howe and take him to America. John Brown, James Parker, Thomas Coyne and Mathew Kegan gave themselves up to the military. They were all taken to Newcastle, New South Wales where they were given the lash (whipped) and sent to gaol.\n\nIn September 1818, a group came from Sydney to join in the hunt for Howe. They wanted the reward. One member of the group was the famous aboriginal tracker, Mosquito. They nearly caught him. They did get his guns and his knapsack (a backpack). In the knapsack they found his \"\"Journal of Dreams\"\". It was a book made from kangaroo skin and Howe had written in it using kangaroo blood as ink. In it Howe wrote about his fear of being killed by the aborigines, his dreams of his sister, and lists of vegetables and flowers he would grow in a house in the forest. As he escaped, Howe thought Black Mary was slowing him down, so he tried to shoot her. \n\nOn October 10, Howe was captured by two people he knew and trusted, Watts and Drewe. He managed to untie himself and stabbed Watts and shot Drewe dead. Watts died later from the injuries. On October 21, 1818, Black Mary led another two men, a convict, Thomas Worrall, and a soldier, William Pugh, to where Howe was hiding near the Shannon River. Worrall had been a sailor who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land for his part in the naval mutiny at the Nore (mouth of the Thames) in 1797. He wanted the reward so he could be free and return to England. All the men shot at each other, but after a fierce fight, Pugh and Worrall bashed Howe to death with their muskets (guns).\n\nHowe was buried by the river, but his head was taken back to Hobart where it was put on public display.\n\nMuch of the information comes from a book by Governor Sorell's secretary, Thomas Wells. The book was called \"Michael Howe, the Last and Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemen's Land\" and printed in 1818 in Hobart. This was the first work of general literature printed in Australia.\n", "id": "148590", "title": "Michael Howe (bushranger)"}

It is in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area of the Unorganized Borough. There were 97 people living in the city in 2000, and 105 people living there in 2010.\n\nAllakaket's coordinates are (66.562610, -152.64756) (Sec. 14, T020N, R024W, Fairbanks Meridian.) It is in the Fairbanks Recording District. (In Alaska, the \"Recorder's Office\" is a part of the government that keeps track of who owns land. The \"Recording District\" is the area that a particular Recorder's Office is in charge of. Allakaket's Recording Office is in the city of Fairbanks, Alaska.)\n\nAllakaket is on the bank (side) of the Koyukuk River. It is south of the place where the Koyukuk joins the Alatna River. The city is about northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. It is about up the river from Hughes, Alaska. The village of Alatna, Alaska is on the other side of the Koyukuk River from Allakaket.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau says that Allakaket's size is . It has of land and of water. 17.05% of the city's area is water.\n\nThe area around Allakaket has a cold, continental climate.

The highest temperature ever was . The lowest temperature ever was . \n\nAllakaket gets about of precipitation every year. \"Precipitation\" is any kind of water falling from the sky to the earth. Rain, sleet, and snow are all kinds of precipitation. The city usually gets about of snow every year. When it is cold, the Koyukuk River will have ice on it. There is usually no ice from June until November.\n\nThere are different Native American groups that live or used to live around Allakaket. Some of these are the Koyukon Athabascans and the Kobuk, Selawik, and Nunamiut Eskimos. The Koyukon did not live in one place. They liked to move around. They moved to different camps when the seasons changed. They moved to new places by following the wild animals and fish. After 1851, the groups started making settlements. \n\nA mission was built on the Koyukuk River in 1906. (A mission is a settlement where religious people try to make the local people because Christian.) The mission was called St. John's-in-the-Wilderness Episcopal Mission. A post office was built in 1925. In 1938, the name of the community was changed to Allakaket. \n\nThe first public school was started in 1957. In 1964 there was a big flood. Some ice got stuck (\"jammed\") in the river. 85% of the community was flooded. (This means that 85% of the city was under water.)\n\nIn 1975, the community was incorporated as a city. This means that there was an official government set up and the borders of the city are decided. The City covered both Allakaket and Alatna on the other side of the river. In September 1994, the city flooded again. The water destroyed almost all of the buildings, houses, and food. The people who lived in Alakaket built the city again near where the original city was. Some of the new buildings are outside of the City boundaries (borders). These buildings outside of the city limits are called New Allakaket and Alatna.\n\nThere is a federally-recognized tribe in the community. It is called the Allakaket Village. The people who live in Allakaket are mostly (95.9%) Alaska Native. Most of the people in Allakaket are Athabascan. The Kobuk Eskimos live in Alatna on the other side of the river.

It is located on the north coast of Alaska along the Arctic Ocean. There are about 2,100 kilometers between Barrow and the North Pole.\n\nBecause Barrow is located above the Arctic Circle, there are times of the year during which the sun never sets, and other times when it never rises above the horizon. Instead of dipping below the horizon every day, during the summer the sun circles around the sky above the horizon. The sun sets on November 18 or 19, and remains below the horizon for about 65 days — that is, until the end of January. In the middle of this polar night (December 21-22), the sky is completely dark all the time, except for about 3 hours of twilight.\n\nThe climate is very cold in Barrow. Temperatures are below freezing from early October until late May. The high temperature is above freezing for only about 120 days per year, and there are temperatures at or below on an average of 160 days per year. Freezing temperatures, and snowfall, can occur at any time during the year.\n\nAlthough Barrow is in the land of the North American continent, Barrow is isolated from any other city.

In 2002, there were 230 people living in Kaltag. Most of the people who live in Kaltag are native Americans.\n\nThe first people to live in the area were the Koyokon people, part of the Athabascan nation. They used Kaltag as a cemetery for surrounding villages. It is on an old walking track which led west through the mountains to Unalakleet. The Athabascans had many camps in the area. They moved as the animals they hunted for food moved to different areas. There were 12 summer fish camps on the Yukon River between the Koyukuk River and the Nowitna River.\n\nThe Russians named Kaltag after a Koyokon man named Kaltaga.\n\nIn 1839 smallpox killed many of the people who lived in the area.\n\nWhen the United States took over Alaska, the army built a telegraph line along the north side of the Yukon River. A trading post opened around 1880. There was a gold rush in 1884-85. Steamboats travelled along the river carrying supplies for the gold miners. In 1900 there were 46 steamboats on the river. Measles and food shortages during 1900 reduced the population of the area by one-third. The village of Kaltag began after this when the people who were left in three nearby villages moved to the area. \n\nBy 1906, most of the people looking gold had left for Fairbanks or Nome. The Galena lead mines opened 1919. Kaltag was down the river from the mines and grew as a point on the transportation route for the mines. It declined in the 1940s as mining declined.\n\nThe old cemetery was washed into the river around 1937. An airport and medical clinic were built during the 1960s.\n\nKaltag has a week long Stick Dance Festival every two years that draws visitors from many other villages. This festival is held by relatives of people who have died, to thank those who helped during their time of mourning.\n\nMost of the people in Kaltag live by hunting and fishing. Salmon, whitefish, moose, bear, waterfowl and berries are the main foods.\n", "id": "149716", "title": "Kaltag, Alaska"}

It is found in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in the Ain department in the east of France. It is 10 kilometers east of Macon, and about 400 km from Paris. In 1999, there were 1571 people living in the commune. It is built on an island made where the River Veyle separates into two branches. The Veyle then flows into the River Saône, which was made the border between the Kingdom of France and the German Empire in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun.\n\nPont-de-Veyle was first started by the Lords of Bage, and legally made a city by the Counts of Savoy in 1275. It only became French in 1601 under King Henri IV of France as part of the Treaty of Lyon.\n\nBecause it was close to the border, this city had to build a castle to defend themselves against the Lords of Macon, the Sires of Beaujeu and the Princes of Dombes. The castle had 14 towers, but today only one remains, the Clock Tower and a doorway from the 14th century, joined by brick walls. Today there is very little left of these walls. The castle was surrounded by a moat filled with water. From 1750 to 1800, they pulled down the city walls and towers that had become dangerous and were about to fall down.\n\nThere are many old and historic buildings from the Renaissance and later centuries. The \"Savoy\" or \"House of Lords\", whose facade was restored, is one of the most beautiful in the region. There is a priory of Saint Benedict with its Gothic doors. There are many half-timbered houses, such as \"The House of the Watchman\", which was redeveloped with great care and taste. There are also many spiral staircases of stone, including one at City Hall which was part of the former College of the Jesuits. The Jesuit style church was built in 1755. The hospital which was started in 1322, still has 18th century buildings.\n\nAfter the Reformation and the religious wars there was a large group of Protestants living in the city. When the Edict of Nantes, a law which gave them religious freedom, was overturned, they fled the city and went to live in Switzerland and Germany.\n\nJean-Louis Carra, a French journalist and revolutionary, was born in Pont-de-Veyle on 9 March 1742. He was executed by the guillotine in Paris on 31 October, 1793.\n", "id": "150258", "title": "Pont-de-Veyle"}

A person who skateboards is most often called a \"skateboarder\". \n\nSkateboarding can be a hobby, an art, a job, or a way of moving around. Skateboarding has been changed by many skateboarders over many years. A 2002 report by \"American Sports Data\" found that there were 18.5 million skateboarders in the world. Of those skateboarders, 85 percent were under 18 years old, and 74 percent were male.\n\nSkateboarding started when surfers in California wanted to take surfing to the street. Soon, the first skateboard was invented in the 1950s. From there, the new culture of skateboarding was created.\n\nThe basic tricks of skateboarding are ollies, kickflips, shuv-its, and 180s (\"one-eighties\"). These are the tricks that new skateboarders often try. An \"ollie\" is when someone pops the board and gets off the ground. A kickflip is done by doing an ollie and rotating the board. A \"shuv-it\" is done by turning the board 180° while staying above the board. A \"180\" is done by turning the board 180°, along with the skateboarder. There are also variations of these tricks, such as the \"tre flip\", which is a 360° shuv-it and a kickflip.\n", "id": "150318", "title": "Skateboarding"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=150508", "text": "Oddworld\n\nOddworld is a name given to a video game series that has won many awards. It was created by Oddworld Inhabitants and was founded by Lorne Lanning and Sherry McKenna. The name is for both the series and the fictional universe where the games in the series take place. The first game in the series, \"\" was first sold in 1997 and was the first game for the Oddworld Quintology. Between 1997 and 2005, a total of four different games have been sold and from 2010-2012 Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath games were made for PC and made in HD for the Playstation 3. The games have also been developed by several developers. GT Interactive developed Abe's Oddysee and Abe's Exoddus, Microsoft Gaming Studios developed Munch's Oddysee, EA Games developed Stranger's Wrath, and Just Add Water (Developments LTD) have developed Stranger's Wrath HD, Munch's Oddysee HD, and Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. The games themselves were set in the part of Oddworld called Mudos.\n\n\"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee\" was the first game in the series and the Quintology. It is a 2D flip-scrolling platform game. It was first sold in September 1997 for the PlayStation video game console and Microsoft Windows. In the game, the player plays as Abe who works in a meat processing plant called RuptureFarms. The game flips through different screens. Some screens have creatures from the Oddworld universe which are programmed to kill Abe. Each Abe game has a feature called GameSpeak where Abe can speak to his fellow Mudokons and take control of the Slig. This is done by chanting. Once the Slig is possessed, he can do what he could do whilst he was not possessed but he can shoot other Sligs and Slogs and unlock doors and electric walls The goal of the game is to save Abe's friends who are known as \"Mudokons\". There are 99 Mudokons in the game. Some of them are hidden in secret areas and when Abe lands in a secret area, the game will give the player an audio cue. The game has two different ways it ends. If, at the end of the game, the player does not save at least 50 native Mudokons, the bad ending will appear instead of the good ending. The game was re-released as Classics on PC in 2008 on Steam and then on PS3 on Playstation Network in 2009. A Gameboy version called Oddworld: Adventures was released in 1998 by Saffire Corporation and it was a shorter version of Abe's Oddysee.\n\nOddworld: Abe's Exoddus was the second game in the series . It was released in November 1998 for the PlayStation video game console and Microsoft Windows and was released as a bonus title. The game play is the same as Abe's Oddysee but with different levels and secret areas. It also has a better GameSpeak than the other game and Abe can have more than one Mudokons following by saying \"All o'ya!\" and Scrabs, Paramites and Glukons can be possessed. There are 300 Mudokons and the Mudokons have different emotions. They could become angry, depressed or sick, There are new Oddworld creatures as well as different versions of creatures from the first game, for example flying and crawling \"Sligs\". The game was re-released as Classics in 2008 for PC on Steam and re-released on Playstation Network for the PS3 in 2009. A Gameboy Color version was released in November 1999 by Saffire Corporation. This was a shortened version of the entire game.\n\nOddworld Munch's Oddysee was the second game to be part of the Quintology. When it was released in 2001, it was only for Xbox and can be played with Munch or Abe and the storyline continued after what happened in Abe's Exoddus. Munch was a new playable character and he was a Gabbit. There were more things to rescue in this game. Abe has to rescue his Native Mudokons. Munch has to rescue fuzzles and labour eggs The endings in the game were based on the Quarma. If the player had a good Quarma, the good ending movie will be played. If the player has a bad quarma, the bad ending movie will be played. A Game Boy Advance version was also released. The original PC port was released in 2010. The game was re-released on PS3 in high definition by Just Add Water in 2012 and was re-released on the PC by Square One Games with a new port in 2016 and was released on the Mac App Store in 2015. \n\nOddworld: Strangers Wrath was a game developed by EA games in 2005 that was set in the western side of Mudos. The game was all about a bounty hunter called Stranger. It was a third-person and first person platformer. It was released for the PS3 in HD in 2011 by Just Add Water and was ported to PC by Just Add Water in 2010 followed by a mobile port in 2014 and a macOS port in 2015. \n\nOddworld New 'n' Tasty is a re-creation and re-make of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. The game is a 2.5D side scrolling platform and the graphics are in 3D. The cut scenes were made in the game engine. In the new game, there are some new features that the original game didn't have such as QuikSave and having multiple Mudokons following Abe at once. First the game was set to released in the Autumn of 2013 and that was revealed at Eurogamer Expo 2012 by Stewart Gilray, the Development Director of Oddworld Inhabitants and Chief Executive Officer of Just Add Water. Then in November 2013 at the Playstation 4 launch event in the United Kingdom, Oddworld released a story trailer and the trailer said it will be released in Spring 2014. In a podcast by a reporter called TheSixthAxis, Gilray said that the reason why they had to delay the release window was because they switched to a new game engine called Unity nine months during development with the old engine. The game was released on July 22nd in North America and on July 23 in Europe on the Playstation Store for the PlayStation 4 in 2014. In 2015, the PC, Mac and Linux and PS3 ports were released. In 2016, the Wii U and PS Vita versions were released. The game also has leaderboards which give a list of best times for each level, the highest amount of Mudokons saved and best overall time.\n\nIn the most recent discussion with Lorne at the Game Developers Conference in California, Lorne told Eurogamer that if New 'n' Tasty sells 250,000 copies, he will have enough money to fund an HD re-make of Abe's Exoddus which is the next project in the series to have an HD Re-make. In 2016, it was confirmed that Oddworld: Soulstorm will be the sequel to w 'n' Tasty. The game is set to be released in 2017. Some footage of the game is yet to be shown.\n\nWhen Oddworld became digital only in 2010, they released a package for the PC called the OddBoxx. This package contains all four Oddworld games together and they can all be downloaded at once. It is also available on the PS3. In 2013 Oddworld released a bundle called the AbeBoxx for the PS3 which contains all two Abe games.\nThere are several creatures that live on Oddworld and they act as enemies in the games. These include:\n\nSligs are like security guards when if Abe is seen, the Slig shouts \"freeze!\" and kills Abe with it's machine gun. Some Sligs in the game don't say freeze at all and just shoot Abe. There are different variants with the Sligs such as flying Sligs and crawling Sligs. When Abe takes control of the Slig, he has the ability to shout \"Look Out!\" which makes the native Mudokons duck and it can say \"Here boy\" to a Slog so that the Slog can kill other Sligs or native Mudokons.\n\nScrabs are first seen in Scrabania and are creatures which like to kill Abe. They chop him up. They are related to Paramites.\n\nParamites were first seen in Paramonia which also like to chop up Abe as well.\n\nSlogs are dog-like creatures that live on Oddworld. Sligs train them so that if there is a Mudokon on sight, the Slog will eat him. \nThe Glukons are the main enemies in the game. They give orders to the Sligs in Abe's Exoddus and Mullock is the Glukon in the original game. \n", "id": "150508", "title": "Oddworld"}

The eighth animated movie in the Disney animated movie canon, the movie stars Nelson Eddy, Dinah Shore, Benny Goodman, and The Andrews Sisters.\n\nThe movie is made of ten parts, or segments.\n\n\nDuring World War II, much of Walt Disney's staff was drafted into the United States Army, and those that were still there were called upon by the U.S. government to make training and propaganda films. As a result, the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas. In order to keep the movie division alive during this difficult time, the studio released four package films including this one, made up of various unrelated segments set to music.\n\nTo date, \"Make Mine Music\" is the only movie in the Disney animated features canon not to gain a Region 4 and Region 2 DVD release. Its only home video release was on DVD on June 6, 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection title.\n\n\n\"Make Mine Music\" ended up being a slight disappointment itself, particularly from Walt Disney's point of view. It was not well received by the critics either. Years later, the segments were individually released as short subjects or used in various Disney television programs. \n\nThe movie was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n\n", "id": "150682", "title": "Make Mine Music"}

It could walk as well as swim. \"Ambulocetus natans\" lived from the early Eocene (50 to 48 million years ago). Its fossils have been found in Pakistan. When the animal was alive, Pakistan was a coastal region of India, which was then a large island in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt looked like a 3-meter (10-foot) long mammalian crocodile. It was clearly amphibious: its back legs are better adapted for swimming than for walking on land, and it probably swam by undulating its back vertically, as otters and whales do.\n\nAmbulocetids may have hunted like crocodiles, lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting prey. Chemical analysis of its teeth shows that it was able to move between salt and fresh water. \"Ambulocetus\" did not have external ears. To detect prey on land, they may have lowered their heads to the ground and felt for vibrations.\n\nScientists consider \"Ambulocetus\" to be an early whale because it shares underwater adaptations with them. It had an adaptation in the nose that enabled it to swallow underwater, and its periotic bones had a structure like those of whales, enabling it to hear well underwater. In addition, its teeth are similar to those of early cetaceans.\n\nOne mostly complete specimen and several partial skeletons have been found in Pakistan.\n\n", "id": "150683", "title": "Ambulocetus"}

He was very self-critical and destroyed any of his compositions that he thought were not really good. This is why we now only have a small number of his works. He wrote choral music and music for the organ. His most famous work is his \"Requiem\".\n\nDuruflé was born in Louviers, Haute-Normandie. In 1912, he joined the choir of Rouen Cathedral where he studied piano and organ. When he was 17 he went to Paris and had private organ lessons with Charles Tournemire. He became Tournemire’s assistant at the Basilique Ste-Clotilde, Paris until 1927. In 1920 Duruflé went to study at the Conservatoire de Paris. His organ teacher was Eugène Gigout. When he graduated he got first prizes in organ, harmony, piano accompaniment, and composition. \n\nIn 1929 Duruflé became organist at St. Étienne-du-Mont in Paris, a job he kept for the rest of his life. \n\nIn 1939, he gave the first performance of Francis Poulenc's Organ Concerto. In 1943 he became professor of harmony at the Conservatoire de Paris, where he worked until 1970. In 1947, Duruflé wrote his famous \"Requiem\" op. 9, for soloists, choir, organ and orchestra. In the same year Marie-Madeleine Chevalier became his assistant organist at St-Étienne-du-Mont. They married in 1953 after Duruflé divorced his first wife. The couple often travelled together to give organ recitals together. They always spent many hours practising on the organs on which they had to perform, often practising a lot of the time without the sound so that their fingers were really used to the feel of the organ.\n\nIn 1975 Duruflé was badly hurt in a car accident and had to give up performing. His wife, who was not so badly hurt in the accident, was still able to play and continued to play the organ at St-Étienne-du-Mont.\n\nDuruflé died in Louveciennes (near Paris) in 1986, aged 84.\n\nDuruflé only left a few of his works for publication. His two important organ works are the \"Suite, op. 5\" which has a famous Toccata as last movement, and his \"Prelude and Fugue sur le nom d'Alain\". His \"Requiem\" remains a favourite work for choirs. Duruflé’s music uses Gregorian plainchant, modal harmonies and polyphonic writing. He was a great admirer of the music of Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire and he made transcriptions of some of their improvisations.\n", "id": "150800", "title": "Maurice Duruflé"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=150814", "text": "Bobby Fischer\n\nRobert James \"Bobby\" Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American-Icelandic chess Grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion.\n\nAs a teenager, Fischer became well-known worldwide because of his skill at chess. He won the American championship of 1963/64, winning all eleven of his games.\n\nFischer was born in Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, Illinois on March 9, 1943. His birth certificate said that his father was Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, a German. His mother, Regina Wender Fischer, was a Polish-Jewish American citizen. Born in Switzerland, she grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and later became a teacher, a nurse, and a doctor. The two married in 1933 in Moscow, USSR, where Regina was studying medicine at the First Moscow Medical Institute. They divorced in 1945 when Bobby was two years old, so he grew up with his mother and older sister. In 1948, the family moved to Mobile, Arizona, where Regina taught in an elementary school. The next year, they moved to Brooklyn, New York.\n\nA 2002 article in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" said that Paul Nemenyi, a doctor, was Bobby's biological father, not Hans-Gerhardt. Regina and Nemenyi had had an affair in 1942, and he gave her money to help her raise her child every month, paying for Fischer's schooling until he died in 1952. Fischer later told the chess player Zita Rajcsanyi that Nemenyi sometimes came to his Brooklyn apartment and took him to places.\n\nFischer learned to play at the age of six. His sister Joan bought him a chess set. Bobby learned how to play from the instructions. Several years later, he began to play at the Manhattan Chess Club. He became well known around the world in 1956. He was 13 when he played a game against an American player named Donald Byrne. In the game, he sacrificed his queen and won. \"Chess Review\" called this game the \"game of the century\".\n\nFischer was 14 when he won the U.S. Championship for the first time. This would be the first of eight U.S. Championships he would win.\n\nIn 1972, he became the first and only American to win the World Chess Championship in the 20th century. In the 19th century, Paul Morphy was briefly the leading player. Wilhelm Steinitz was the first official world champion. He became an American citizen while he was champion. To win the title, Fischer beat Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union. The match was held in Reykjavík, Iceland. However, Fischer did not agree to a match to defend his title. He lost his title in 1975. The title of world champion was given to Anatoly Karpov.\n\nFischer did not play in any public matches or tournaments for nearly 20 years. In 1992, he defeated Spassky in a rematch in Yugoslavia. The United States Department of State had told him not to play there because of the events that happened after Yugoslavia began splitting into several new countries. Since he disobeyed this order, he could have been prosecuted if he returned to the U.S. In fact, he never returned there. Fischer's 1992 rematch against Spassky was the only time after becoming the world champion that Fischer played chess in public.\n\nAfter his match, Fischer promoted a new type of chess called \"Fischer Random Chess\", where the pieces were randomly shuffled before the game so they would be on different squares to start every game.\n\nIn July 2004, Fischer was arrested at an airport in Japan with a bad passport. The United States wanted Japan to send him back to go to trial for playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1992. The government of Iceland eventually decided to make Fischer a citizen of Iceland. Fischer was sent there, and he lived there for the rest of his life.\n\nFischer died of renal failure on January 17, 2008. He was buried at a small ceremony near the town of Selfoss, Iceland.\n\nFischer was born Jewish, but he rejected the religion. He used many racist and reasonable insults toward Judaism. Fischer denied the Holocaust. He read books such as \"Mein Kampf\" and \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". As a young man, Fischer joined the Radio Church of God. He later left this evangelical Protestant church with outspoken comments. Fischer had a Catholic funeral. It is unclear whether he became a Roman Catholic before his death.\n\nFischer, like Morphy, chose to stop playing when he was still young. He had a lifelong history of disputes, conflicts and controversy. He believed he was the victim of conspiracies. Fischer showed symptoms of the mental illness paranoia, similar to Morphy. In \"Bobby Fischer: The Wandering King\", authors Hans Böhm and Kees Jongkind write that Fischer's radio broadcasts show that he was \"out of his mind ... a victim of his own mental illness\".\n\nFischer has developed his own book to teaching chess. It uses a method called programmed learning.\n\n", "id": "150814", "title": "Bobby Fischer"}

Both men and women can become champion, but no woman has ever been a challenger for the title. There is, however, a separate championship for women. There are also separate championships for specific age groups. \n\nBefore 1886, there was no official championship held, but some players were thought to be pre-eminent. From 1948 on, the World Chess Federation FIDE held the championships. Between 1993 and 2006 there were two world champion titles, the FIDE one and the classical one.\n\nThe 2013 World Championship match took place between Anand and Magnus Carlsen (challenger) in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, where Anand grew up. Usually, world championships had been played on neutral ground. Fischer played Spassky in Iceland; Alekhine played Capablanca in Buenos Aires. The Soviets always played in Moscow. However, sponsorship is needed for these matches, and the decision to accept the Chennai bid was taken by FIDE. The Challenger was victorious winning 3 games and achieving the necessary 6.5 points to win the title at the end of game 10. Magnus Carlsen, 22 and from Norway is therefore the current World Chess Champion.\n\nThese players are included (pre-18th century) on little more than opinion, and (18th century) on the basis of more substantial information. Some authors of important early works on chess are noted.\n\nThese players are included on the basis of their winning matches against credible opponents. Champions are numbered from Steinitz onwards, because his match against Zukertort was publicly declared as a world championship and generally accepted.\n\nLong matches, initially best of 24 games.\n\nThese knock-out events are separately numbered.\n\nThese are matches of the traditional kind, and of 15 or 20 games.\n\nVariously, 12-game classical match format and double-round all-play-all tournament.\n", "id": "150820", "title": "List of World Chess Champions"}

The gas was used as a weapon during World War I. It is responsible for most of the deaths related to poison gas during the war. Today, phosgene is used as a tool. It is used for organic synthesis. When there is a small amount in the air, the smell is similar to that of freshly cut hay or grass. Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like May Blossom. When some compounds of chlorine burn or break down, small amounts of phosgene are given off. \n\nToday, most phosgene is used to produce isocyanates. The most important isocanates in this context are toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Both are precursors to polyurethanes. Large amounts are also used to produce polycarbonates. Polycarbonate is produced from its reaction with bisphenol A. Polycarbonates are an important class of engineering thermoplastic. They can be found in lenses in eyeglasses.\n\nPhosgene is a strong poison. Its smell may not be noticed. Signs of exposure may sometimes be detected slowly.\nPhosgene can be seen at 0.4 parts per million. This amount is four times the safe amount. Its high ability to poison doesn't come from the hydrogen chloride released by a process. It comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary sac of the lungs. The sacs are where the oxygen goes into the body. Their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon. This will make breathing very hard.

Savio Vega was first eliminated, meaning his tag team partner, Miguel Perez, had to leave too. Kurrgan illegally entered the ring to get revenge on Sniper and Recon for The Jackyl, Barry Windham also illegally entered to eliminate Bradshaw, and so his partner, Chainz, had to leave too. The final four teams stayed in the match for a while until Skull was eliminated by Phineas. When The Godwinns (Phineas & Henry) were thrown out, they returned and attacked the Legion Of Doom with buckets before leaving. New Midnight Express tried to keep Animal out of the ring while double teaming Hawk but once he re-entered the Legion eliminated Bob and Bart at the same time, leaving them the last team standing.\n\nThe second bout was a Light Heavyweight Championship match, with Taka Michinoku defending his title against Águila; this would be the first and only time the championship was defended at WrestleMania, though the title that came after it, the WWE Cruiserweight Championship would be. After throwing Taka out the ring and baseball sliding into him, Águila hit an moonsault outside the ring, but was soon hit by a springboard crossbody after Taka reversed a suplex from the end of the ring. Águila almost won the match with a moonsault crossbody into a pin but stayed on the offensive with a frankensteiner. Taka tried to land the Michinoku Driver but as Aguila flipped out and attempted a hurricarana, Taka reversed it into a powerbomb. Taka would soon stop Águila from hitting him with a high flying dive with a dropkick before before being able to do a Michinoku Driver and get the win. After the match, they shook hands and celebrated together.\n\nTriple H made his way to the ring with his theme song played by the DX Band. Before Owen Hart came to the ring, Commissioner Slaughter handcuffed himself to Chyna so that she would not get involved in the match, despite her saying that she didn't want to. The match began with Hart attacking Helmsley with his fists before sliding out of the ring, when Triple H tried to jump from the end of the ring he landed on the crowd barrier. After an powerbomb Hart tried to lock in the sharpshooter but Helmsley broke out of it and started some offensive attacks of his own, kicking Hart in the turnbuckle and delivering a suplex. Hart suffered a cut to the bridge of his nose from a boot to the face, after which Triple H began to only attack Hart's damaged ankle, dropping his knee onto it and stretching it. After not getting hit with another kick to the face and pulling Helmsley's crotch onto the ring post, and managed to take advantage, changing a powerbomb into the sharpshooter but Chyna, having to pull Sgt. Slaughter, pulled Triple H to the rope for the break. Chyna then threw white powder in Slaughter's face causing a worried Hart to check on him, as he turned round to face the ring, Chyna low-blowed him from outside allowing Triple H to win the match with the Pedigree. After she was freed from the handcuffs, Chyna shoved Slaughter into the crowd.\n\nMarc Mero and Goldust began the match but Goldust soon tagged in Luna Vachon, requiring Sable to be tagged in too. However, Vachon simple ran around the outside of the ring with Sable chasing her and tagged her partner back in. Wanting to get her hands on Vachon, Sable double teamed Goldust with a boot to the face after an Irish whip from Mero but could not get Vachon to enter the ring. An near pinfall came from a running crossbody from Mero and following this the two ran into each other, causing both men to crawl and tag in the women. Sable straddled Vachon and punched her round the face before kicking her in the mid-section and face in the turnbuckle and attacking Goldust, then running back to clothesline Vachon over the ropes. Vachon tagged Goldust in but before Sable would do the same, she struck him in the face, then letting Mero take over who had his TKO reversed into a DDT. Mero too would reverse the Curtain Call allowing him the chance to try a moonsault pin to a standing Goldust. After Vachon struck a running Mero with his knee, Mero went to punch her but ducked out of the way as Goldust ran to her rescue, causing him to inadvertently knock her off the apron. Mero then executed the TKO but Luna interrupted the pin count, jumping on Mero's back resulting in Sable tagging in as Mero wandered around the ring with Vachon on his back. Sable tried pinning Goldust but the referee was distracted and as he finally began to count, Sable leapt off Goldust so the interfering Vachon would inadvertently bodysplash Goldust. Sable then performed a powerbomb and Mero's TKO to win the bout.\n\nThe Intercontinental title fight began along the walkway with a brawl that saw Ken Shamrock whipped into the steel steps before coming inside the ring. Rocky Maivia then delivered his People's Elbow but could not secure a three-count. Shamrock then rolled out of the ring and grabbed steel steps and when the referee tried to take it off him, he threw the referee into the corner; The Rock quickly grabbed the steps and hit Shamrock with it as the referee recovered. Shamrock pushed out of the pin count and quickly gained the advantage, delivering a belly to belly slam off an Irish whip and then securing his ankle lock in the centre of the ring, making The Rock tap. The surrounding members of the Nation jumped into the ring but Shamrock quickly dispatched them all with suplexes, including the four hundred pound Henry, before reapplying the ankle lock to a bleeding Maivia. Faarooq then ran down from the back and jumped onto the apron, only to look on at The Rock with a smile, before walking away. Eventually a number of referees and officials appeared trying to subdue Shamrock, after being surrounded he suplexed a referee and then an official before calming down as The Rock was wheeled away on a gurney. Howard Finkel then announced Shamrock had been disqualified for not breaking his ankle hold causing Shamrock to chase Rock and fight him on the Chris Warren band stage.\n\nThe Tag Team Championship match began with Billy Gunn facing Chainsaw Charlie and Road Dogg exchanging blows with Cactus Jack. Trying a Cactus Elbow on Road Dogg, Cactus missed and slammed himself into the dumpster. The Outlaws then focused on Charlie, using a back toss to drop him into the dumpster and as he attempted to climb out they simultaneously slammed the lid shut on the hardcore legends' heads. With Cactus and Charlie both in the dumpster, the Outlaws shut the lid down on them but Cactus managed to get back up while the Outlaws were celebrating and pushed Road Dogg down to the ground with a mandible claw, pulling him into the dumpster. Both teams took time to recover and began to brawl with weapons in the ring, Cactus Jack pulling out a ladder and climbing it opposite Billy Gunn, only to be pushed off straight into the dumpster outside the ring by a falling Chainsaw Charlie. Road Dogg pulled his partner out and the two focused their efforts on Charlie, powerbombing him into the dumpster, however Cactus had managed to escape in the meantime. The fight found its way to the backstage area, with both Outlaws throwing Cactus into boxes and promotional toys but Jack replied with a chair shot to both of them and pulled Billy Gunn onto a wooden crate with a double-arm DDT. Charlie reappeared on a forklift and elevated the wooden crate as Jack dragged Road Dogg onto it too. Charlie then drove the forklift above a backstage dumpster and dropped both opponents inside as Cactus Jack closed the lid to win the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nBefore The Undertaker's match with Kane, baseball record-holder Pete Rose came to the ring as the special ring announcer. However, after insulting the home-town team and introducing Kane, the wrestler gave him a tombstone piledriver starting a tri-year tradition. The Undertaker was preceded by a league of torch-bearing druids to the tune of O Fortuna. The Undertaker cornered Kane and threw a fury of punches into him, ducking and reversing Kane's attempts until Kane hit him with a clothesline that he instantly sat up from. Kane then set Undertaker up in a tree of woe to begin his assault of punches and Irish whips and then suplexing Undertaker onto the ropes and delivering a flying club to the neck from the turnbuckle. As Undertaker began to fight back, Kane threw him into the ropes but his brother retaliated by jumping onto his back, which was met a face-first electric chair. Paul Bearer kept the referee distracted while Kane landed the steel steps onto Undertaker, and repeated the effort a second time while his opponent was lying onto the steps, crushing him between. As the referee tried to keep Kane in check, Bearer slapped Undertaker while walking past him. Kane caught his brother running and delivered a chokeslam but lifted his shoulders off the mat before the three count could be made, putting him into a sleeper hold that Undertaker eventually fought out of with a flurry of punches. Undertaker then dropped Kane on top of the ropes and punched him off the apron; he followed this with a over the top rope suicide dive that Kane managed to side-step, guiding him through the Spanish announce table. As Undertaker made it back into the ring, Kane hit him with a flying lariat. Undertaker was caught unawares by Kane, who lifted him into a tombstone piledriver position, but Kane managed to weigh himself backwards onto his own feet and deliver the tombstone himself. Undertaker kicked out and after landing his opponent with a clothesline, he chokeslammed Kane and then delivered a tombstone piledriver of his own; it would eventually take three tombstones with a guillotine leg drop and flying clothesline in between to stop Kane kicking out and sitting up but as soon as the match was over Bearer attacked Undertaker and ordered Kane attack him, which he did with a chair shot to the head and then a tombstone piledriver onto the chair. After Kane and Bearer left, Undertaker sat up and left the ring.\n\nWith Mike Tyson enforcing from ring side, the WWF Championship fight began with both superstars dancing around each other, engaging in a few light punches before Shawn Michaels escaped the ring and ran back in to take advantage of Steve Austin, but was met with a standing clothesline. Austin followed up by pulling down Michaels' trunks revealing his rear. Michaels tried to run at Austin but was flipped over the top rope into Triple H and Chyna. As Triple H threw Austin through the crowd barrier, the referee ordered him and Chyna to leave ringside but Austin followed and fought with them up to the entrance way. Michaels caught up with him and hit Austin with a cymbal from the bandstage, before Irish whipping him into the dumpster. As the match resumed in the ring, Austin met Michaels high-risk manoeuvre with a clothesline and then ran him into the turnbuckle and picking him up for an inverted atomic drop. Michaels attempt to pick up some momentum saw him picked up and dropped onto the ropes but Michaels managed to push Stone Cold away as he attempted a stunner. When he tried to escape the ring though, Austin shoved him forcing the champion to fall upon the announce table. After Stone Cold slowed the match down with a sleeper, Michaels tried to pull his knee into the ring post but was instead pulled into it himself. Austin then tried to rush at Michaels but was back tossed into the crowd and struck with the ring bell. Michaels used the momentum to take advantage inside the ring, delivering a snapmare and then a low kick to the grounded Austin but as he took time to offend the audience Stone Cold briefly picked up some speed throwing Michaels out of the ring but just as quickly lost ground as his opponent repeatedly worked on Austin's left knee, throwing it into the ring post and then kicking and dropping onto it back inside the ring. When Austin tried to recover outside of the ring, he was met with a baseball slide launching him over the announce table and was instantly thrown back into the ring by Tyson where he soon suffered a figure four leg lock that Michaels illegally elevated using the second and third ring rope. Austin's eventual counter was stopped by a rope break. Austin then tried to reverse a standing sleeper hold by throwing Michaels back into the turnbuckle but unwittingly trapped referee Mike Chioda who fell unconscious. With both men on the floor, HBK recovered with a kip-up and landed a high-flying elbow drop, getting in position to taunt for his finisher. As Austin eventually stood up, he ducked the super kick, attempting a stunner on Michaels as he turned round only to be thrown into the ropes and met again with a Sweet Chin Music which he grabbed, spinning Michaels round and finishing with a Stone Cold stunner. Tyson jumped into the ring to make a quick three count and the new champion celebrated by tossing the enforcer an Austin 3:16 t-shirt. When Shawn Michaels stood up, he confronted Tyson about his turn but was met with a punch that instantly floored him, and draped with Austin t-shirt.\n\n", "id": "150840", "title": "WrestleMania XIV"}

Plan 9 is currently used as a hobbyist's operating system, and in certain experimental fields, where the highly distributed nature of the operating system is valued. Plan 9 has novel features such as the 9P protocol for accessing local and remote resources as files, union mounts, an improved proc file system, and native unicode support throughout the system. In Plan 9, all system interfaces, including those required for networking and the user interface, are represented through the file system rather than specialized interfaces. It also has a graphical user interface built in, called rio, in anticipation of the graphical world.\n\nThe name Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a reference to the Ed Wood 1959 cult science fiction movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. Also, Glenda, the Plan 9 Bunny, is presumably a reference to Wood's film Glen or Glenda.\n\nPlan 9 was originally developed for research purposes, as Bell Labs was looking for a replacement for the venerable UNIX. It underwent mass testing, as all the computers at Bell Labs had Plan 9 installed, in lieu of UNIX, which was commonplace previously. It explored several modifications to the pre-existing UNIX system, primarily the distributed nature of the system, and the graphical user-interface. In 1992, Bell Labs released a public version, for universities, and soon after, a version for the general public. The highly restrictive nature of the licence at the time, and the steep 500$ licencing fee resulted in it being ignored, in lieu of Linux.\n\nWhen Lucent-Alcatel acquired Bell, in the 1990s, however, funding for the system was slashed, and in 2000, it was released into the world under a FOSSy licence.

Concerts continue to be given there including, more recently, concerts of popular music.\n\nZankel Hall, which seats 599, is now named after Judy and Arthur Zankel. At first it was simply called Recital Hall, then in 1896 it was renamed Carnegie Lyceum. It was used by the American Academy of Dramatic Arts from 1898. In 1959 it was changed into a cinema. Since 1997 it has been a hall for recitals. \n\nThe Weill Recital Hall is a small concert hall seating just 268 people. Since 1986 it has been named after Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Carnegie Hall's board, and his wife, Joan. At first it was called Chamber Music Hall, later Carnegie Chamber Music Hall).\n\nThe official opening night was on May 5, with an orchestral concert conducted by Walter Damrosch and the composer Tchaikovsky.

The music consists mainly of waltzes, polkas, mazurkas and marches. Sometimes other Austrian composers are included. In 2009, for the first time, music by Josef Haydn was played. It was the 4th movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 45, known as the \"Farewell Symphony\". It was performed because the year 2009 is the 200th anniversary of Haydn's death. \n\nThese concerts have been held in the \"Großer Saal\" (Large Hall) of the Wiener Musikverein since 1939.

The system then compares the fingerprint that is read with the one in the central database for authentication.\n\nMost biometric systems do not keep an image of the fingerprint but a template. A template is basically a number that is calculated based on various characteristics of the fingerprint. This is done so that persons may not sneak unauthorised images of fingerprints into the database. When a fingerprint is to be matched, its \"template number\" is computed and compared with that stored in the database. Most systems allow for dry, greasy, chaffed and minor cuts on the fingers.

Other names for the system are \"propositional calculus\" and \"sentential calculus\". The system is made of a set of propositions. Each proposition has a truth value, it is either true or false. Propositions can be joined together using logical connectives to make new propositions. Examples for logical connectives that are used often are logical and, logical or, logical if, logical if and only if and logical not.\n\nPropositional logic only looks at the propositions and how they are connected, it does not decompose the propositions. That way, the proposition \"All cats are dogs and the earth is a disc\" is made of two propositions, \"All cats are dogs\", \"The Earth is a disc\". These are joined together with AND. \n\nThere are other logic systems that build on propositional logic. One of these is Predicate logic, which defines logical predicates, and looks at how they can be applied to arguments. Another system is called modal logic. It introduces two new junctors \"it is possible, that\" and \"it is necessary, that\".\n\nA simple logic statement is \"If P, then Q\". For example, \"If it rains for an hour, then the ground will be wet\". Note that there are two logic errors that people often make from this:\n\n1) \"If Q, then P\". In our example, this would mean \"If the ground is wet, then it has been raining for an hour\".

In our example, this would mean \"If it has not been raining for an hour, then the ground is not wet\". However, the ground could still be wet for the reasons listed above.\n\nThe only correct inference that can be made is \"If not Q, then not P\".

Then TCP makes sure the data is put in the right order, and none of it is missing. TCP also helps to control traffic on the internet so it does not get overloaded. These protocols, which are kind of like languages that computers use, are designed so that any computer, and any program (such as a Web browser or e-mail client), can use them.\n\nTCP makes it easier for computer programs to communicate with each other, typically over a computer network. When a program wants to send a lot of data, TCP is in charge of dividing the data, sending it through the network, and putting it back together correctly on a different computer. In the process, IP chooses which wires and \"intersections\" get used to send all the data pieces in the fastest way. It does this using packets.\n\nIf there are a lot of people using the network, it can get overloaded. Also sometimes weather, power outages, and other problems can make communication hard. Routers on the Internet use something called \"load balancing\" to try to fix some of these problems. But still, information can be delivered out of order, get lost, or even duplicated. TCP is designed to notice all of these problems and try to fix them. This can take a while, which is why the Internet sometimes seems slow. Once the TCP receiver has finally reassembled a perfect copy of the data originally transmitted, it passes that data to the computer program that asked for it. In this way, the program does not have to know about the network, and TCP does not have to know about the program's data.\n\n\n", "id": "151618", "title": "Transmission Control Protocol"}

It grows to 5.5 metres long. The megamouth is found in the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans.\n\nThe megamouth shark has a sturdy body, and a fat, round and long head. The snout is very short and wide. The gill slits are quite long but can not reach the dorsal surface of the head. The mouth is wide, with the corners extending behind the eyes. The first dorsal fin is located more closely to the pectoral fins than to the pelvic fin, and the second dorsal fin is less than half the size of the first dorsal fin. Both dorsal fins are low. The pectoral fins of the adults are shorter than the head in length. \nThe dorsal surface of the body, the pectoral and pelvic fins, the dorsal fins, the center of the anal fin, and the caudal fin are blackish-brown. The belly is white.\n\nThe shark has around fifty rows of very small teeth on each jaw, but only three rows are usable. Females seem to have fewer teeth rows than males. The upper and lower jaws have a symphyseal (where the two halves of the jaw meet) toothless space, but it is larger in the upper jaw. A difference between the upper and lower teeth was recognized on a female specimen: the first five upper teeth are smaller than the first five lower teeth.\nThe maximum length reported for the Megamouth shark is 5.5 metres (18 feet). Males mature when they are 4 metres (13 feet) long, and females mature when the are 5 metres (16 feet) long.\n\nAlthough there has only been a total of 53 confirmed sightings of the Megamouth shark, this species is now known to be found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. As with the two other known filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark, this species has a widespread distribution. However, the megamouth shark is less active, and a poorer swimmer than the basking shark and the whale shark. Its slow movement is probably because of its fleshy body, soft fins, and asymmetrical tail.\n\nThe only confirmed register of a Megamouth shark predator is an event of when sperm whales where seen attacking a Megamouth shark. This occurred in Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia (30th August 1998) near midday, while some researchers were observing the whales. The base of the dorsal fin and the gills of the shark showed signs of the whales' attack.\n\nAlthough there have only been a few sightings of the megamouth shark, it is believed that this species of shark likes to live in the open ocean. The sixth specimen found was tagged and followed for two days, allowing insight into its habitat preference and behaviour. It stayed at a depth of 15 metres during the night, then dove to 150 metres at dawn and returned to shallow waters at dusk. So the megamouth is presumed to be a vertical migrator on a 24 hour cycle, spending the daytime in deep waters and ascending to midwater depths at night. This vertical migration may be a response to the movements of the small animals on which it feeds. The krill that make up part of the megamouth's diet also migrate from deep waters to the surface.\n\nThe megamouth shark is one of the three giant filter-feeding sharks in the sea. The other two are the basking shark and the whale shark.\n\nThe exact details of the feeding behaviour of the megamouth shark is unknown, due to the few observations on a live, feeding specimen. The megamouth has a huge mouth that extends behind the eyes. Scientists believe that this shark swims slowly through groups of krill and other small prey with its mouth open, and sucks them in. Then it closes its mouth, and this action decreases the pharyngeal volume and makes it possible for the shark to get rid of any water through the gill openings.\n\nAll the specimens of the megamouth shark which have been studied have had krill in their stomach, indicating a filter-feeding habit. The stomach of the first megamouth captured had only one type of krill, \"Thysanopoda pectinata\". The second megamouth's stomach had krill, copepods, and the jellyfish, \"Atolla vanhoeffeni\".\n", "id": "151645", "title": "Megamouth shark"}

The majority of these products work by strengthening the tooth enamel, thus easing discomfort and providing the teeth with a protective outer layer.\n\nTraditionally, toothpaste has a minty flavour, as this is said to allow a sense of freshness in the mouth. However, fruit and flavours have been popular in the past. Fruit toothpastes, however, are discouraged by dentists due to their acidic and tooth-eroding properties.\n", "id": "151660", "title": "Toothpaste"}

His music was largely forgotten for a long time after his death, but is now starting to be played much more.\n\nGoldmark came from a large Jewish family. He was one of 20 children. His father was a chazan to the Jewish congregation at Keszthely. He learned to play the violin and was sent to Vienna to study music. After the Revolution of 1848 the Conservatory had to close down and so he had to teach himself how to compose. He earned money by playing the violin in theatre orchestras and by teaching music. For a short time one of his pupils was Jean Sibelius.\n\nWagner's music was an influence on his compositional style. However, he could not form a proper friendship with Wagner because of Wagner's antisemitism.\n\nGoldmark composed six operas, including \"Die Königin von Saba\" (\"The Queen of Sheba\"). It was very popular during his lifetime and continued to be performed by the Vienna State Opera until 1938. His Violin Concerto No. 1 was also very popular indeed, then it lay forgotten for many years. It is very Romantic and sounds very Hungarian.\nOther works include a symphony called \"Ländliche Hochzeit\" (Rustic Wedding) and several other orchestral works, some chamber music and choral music.\n", "id": "151669", "title": "Karl Goldmark"}

His parents were both musicians. His father played the clarinet and his mother played the piano. They were often touring when Ferruccio was young. He spent most of his childhood in Trieste.\n\nBusoni was a child prodigy. He first played the piano in public at the age of seven. Two years later he played some of his own compositions in Vienna. The composer Franz Liszt heard him. He also met Liszt, Johannes Brahms and Anton Rubinstein.\n\nFor a short time he studied in Graz, then in Leipzig. He taught in several places including Helsinki, where he met Jean Sibelius as well as a young lady was to be his wife. In 1890 he won the Anton Rubinstein Competition with his Concert Piece for Piano and Orchestra. He taught in Moscow in 1890, and in the United States from 1891 to 1894 where he also toured as a virtuoso pianist.\n\nIn 1894 he went to Berlin where he stayed. He performed as a pianist and conductor and taught many gifted pianists. \nHe wrote a book called \"Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music\". He did not agree with the strict rules that were used by most teachers for teaching composition. He thought that music was \"born to be free\". His thinking influenced his composition pupils who included Percy Grainger, Kurt Weill and Edgard Varèse.\n\nDuring World War I, Busoni lived first in Bologna, where he was director of the conservatory, and later in Zürich. He refused to perform in any countries that were involved in the war. He returned to Berlin in 1920 where he gave master classes in composition. \n\nBusoni died in Berlin from a kidney disease. \n\nBusoni's music is based on the Romantic style, but it also starts to sound quite modern. He uses a lot of complicated counterpoint. Sometimes it is quite atonal. A lot of it is based on music of the past. He made many transcriptions, including piano transcriptions of several works by Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nBusoni was a virtuoso pianist, and his works for piano are difficult to perform. His \"Piano Concerto\" is extremely hard to play as well as being extremely long (about 70 minutes). The British pianist John Ogdon, who played it, called it \"the longest and grandest piano concerto of all\".\n\nSome of his best known works include his suite for orchestra \"Turandot\" which he made into an opera, and his opera \"Doktor Faust\" which he had not finished when he died. It was finished by his student Philipp Jarnach, but in the 1980s Anthony Beaumont made a better version of it.\n\nBusoni made a number of piano rolls, and a small number of these have been re-recorded onto CD. People who knew him disagree about whether these piano roll recordings show his playing at his best.\n", "id": "151696", "title": "Ferruccio Busoni"}

If you find the right climate and soil type, you can grow many of those herbs overseas. For instance, American Ginseng is grown in Wisconsin State.\n\nThe raw herbs available in retail have the following natural features:\nHow do people take the raw herbs? Raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them. The natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good. One hour of brewing should be good enough. Then you drink one or two cups a day. Honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad. The herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you. So an herbal package is really tailor-made for you only.\nRaw herbs can be dried and grounded into a powder then compressed into a tablet which is better than buying your own tablets or having to buy gel capsules\n\nRaw herbs can be made into capsules at home. All you need is a tailor-made package of raw herbs. Turn it into fine powder with a powerful grinder, and put the powder into empty gel capsules. When you swallow the capsules, your digestive system has to extract the essence out of the raw herb powder. Whereas if you drink the herb tea, the essence extraction is already done after brewing. The herbal solution will readily be absorbed by your body. Furthermore, the herb tea has a history spanning over two thousand years.

Graminei\n\n(1)The terms used here reflect typical TCM usage (as translated literally from individual Chinese characters), and may not reflect their meanings in TCM, namely, meanings that are normative, figurative or metaphorical when read in context. The meanings of these terms are therefore different from that in common English usage. In particular, they are not to be used for purposes of self-diagnosis, much less for self-medication. For example, \"Xia Huo\" means \"To reduce fire\", but \"fire\" here does not refer to combustion involving oxygen. Even within TCM, there are various meanings of \"fire\", and it can refer to \"real\" or \"false\" fire. The 3 herbs mentioned above cannot be used to reduce \"false fire\", or fires of yin deficiency in the zhang organs.\n\n(2) An example of the non-literal use of transliterated characters is \"long gu\" which literally means \"dragon bones\". This term cannot possible refer to Chinese dragons, since they do not exist. However, one can easily buy \"long gu\" from any TCM herbal shop. Another term that cannot be taken literally is \"di long\" which literally means \"earth dragon\".\n\n(3) Although the above herbs are common in TCM prescriptions, they cannot be purchased if we refer only to their Latin names. One likely reason is that TCM pharmacists rarely, if ever, use the Latin names of the herbs. The Chinese names, or the transliterated names (pinyin) should be used instead. For example, if we ask for \"flos Lonicerae\" we will almost certainly get a blank look. However, if we ask for \"Jin Yin Hua\" or 金银花 we will connect immediately, even though the pharmacist may speak any of the large number of Chinese dialects (such as Cantonese, where the herb is known as \"Kum Gen Fa\", or Golden Silver Flower, in Hong Kong). Wherever possible, use the written form (金银花) to avoid miscommunication and/or mis-pronunciation, since there is no dialect form of the written language.\n\n(4) There are a large number of synonyms of the herb names, in both Chinese, English and Latin. This makes it even more essential to use the written form of the Chinese names to ensure accuracy.\n\n(5) Some herbs are prone to adulteration, substitution, or both. For example, Ling Zhi Cao (Cordyceps) can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb. If an extract is first made with water, the herb will be tasteless when dried and re-used/recycled. On the other hand, the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter, but few consumers would know the difference, especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs. The pharmacists themselves may not be aware, as some may trust their suppliers implicitly, and do not conduct regular testing.\n\n(6) Animal-based \"herbs\" are prone to substitution or adulteration, including Xiong Dan (bear bile / gall bladder) which looks very much like Niu Dan (bovine bile /gall bladder) when the gall bladder is dried, although Niu Dan is far less bitter in taste. Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries. These include tiger parts, such as Hu Gu (tiger bone) which is substituted by bobcat bone, and Chuan San Jia (scales of the pangolin) which has no animal-based substitute. Niu Huang (bovine gallstone) is unavailable in many Western countries and Singapore because of its potential impact on pregnant women, although Niu Huang Pills with about 2% of Niu Huang are available in many Asian countries.\n", "id": "151714", "title": "Chinese herbology"}

Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion. In some cases (such as NASA rockets), the force created can be over .\n\nA garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force. When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still. The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine.\n\nSome rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels. Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called \"rocket motors\".\n\nLiquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move (and pressurize) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine. These machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures. Liquid oxygen is very cold (-223˚C) while the engine is very hot (3000˚C), and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure. Because of these conditions, liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials (metals, ceramics, etc.).\n\nSolid fuel rocket motors have the fuel (called propellant) as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel. An oxidiser supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning. The common oxidiser is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate, while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal. The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder. The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel. The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper, but they cannot be turned off or controlled, and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines. Solid rockets also provide a smaller specific impulse, hence must be heavier to launch the same payload.\n\nMilitary missiles commonly use solid rockets because they can be kept ready for many years. Many satellite launchers use solid rocket boosters when they start, but liquid rockets for the majority of the flight. \n\nHybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas. The two propellants are different states of matter, often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels. They are not used much, but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors\n", "id": "152310", "title": "Rocket engine"}

There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael. Samael is often thought to be both good and evil. It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome. \n\nSamael is often confused with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties. He is often considered a fallen angel, like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits. One of Samael's roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death. In this belief, he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lord's servants. As a good angel, Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven, although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven. \n\nThe website Catholic.org says Samael is a \"Power\", which means he is the chief of many warrior angels.\n\nPowers are warrior angels against evil, who defend the world and people. They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings. The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael, both angels of darkness.\n\nIn Jewish beliefs, Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death, the ruler of the Fifth Heaven, and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels; he resides in the Seventh Heaven. \"Yalkut I, 110\" of the Talmud says Samael is Esau's guardian angel. In \"Sotah 10b\", Samael is Esau's guardian angel.\n\nIn the \"Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer\", he is said to be the one who tempted Eve, then seduced and impregnated her with Cain. Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve; although, other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent. \n\nSamael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob, and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son.\nAccording to \"The Ascension of Moses\" (Chapter IV - Aggadah - The Legend of The Jews - By Louis Ginzberg) Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven:\n\n\"In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred parasangs in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, \"Anger,\" and Hemah, \"Wrath,\" whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them, but Metatron embraced him, and said, \"Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,\" and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes, at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe. \"This one,\" said Metatron, addressing Moses, \"is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.\" \"Whither goes he now?\" asked Moses, and Metatron replied, \"To fetch the soul of Job the pious.\" Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, \"O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.\"\n\nIn \"The Holy Kabbalah\" (Arthur Edward Waite, 255), Samael is described as the \"severity of God\", and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah. Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam. According to Zoharistic cabala, Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim, Na'amah, and Agrat Bat Mahlat - all angels of prostitution.\n\nSamael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael, an archangel of God, whose name means \"He who sees God\".\n\n\nSamael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series. The archangel is shown in the games as a blood-red serpent. He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana. \n\nIn the Silent Hill video games, Samael is the name of one of the town's gods. He is shown as an anthropomorphic goat.\n\nIn the film Hellboy, one of the main characters is a giant hell-hound called Sammael, who Hellboy nicknames \"Sammy\".\n\nIn Lucifer, the TV and Comic series, Samael is Lucifer Morningstar's name before he left Hell. \n", "id": "152340", "title": "Samael"}

The trailer features two women deficating into a cup, taking turns eating the fecis, and throwing it up into each other's mouths. \"Lovers Theme\" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout.\n\nThis one-minute video is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme among bloggers and message boards for its viewers reaction to the content. Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time.\n\nThe video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a \"compulsive fetishist\". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $420 yolo sweg. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter.\n\nThe first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text \"MFX 420\" (the product code for \"Hungry Bitches\") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process.\n\n2 Girls 1 Cup's spread because of the reactions it causes. Hundreds of videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video to their friends and recording their reactions. Even Joe Rogan, host of \"Fear Factor\", a show known for the nasty things its players eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring Kermit the Frog proved very popular on the Digg. In January 2008, \"Slate\" magazine wrote about the reaction video with a slideshow about the reactions.\n\nViolet Blue, an author, stated this website as becoming \"the new 'tubgirl' and goatse all in one nasty moment of choco-poo-love\" in a \"San Francisco Chronicle\" article.\n", "id": "152434", "title": "2 Girls 1 Cup"}

With UDP, computer applications can send messages, sometimes known as \"datagrams\", to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths. UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol. The protocol was designed by David P. Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768.\n\nUDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission. A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response.\n\nPorts 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named \"well-known\" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access.\n\nPorts 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports.\n\nPorts 49,152 through 65,535 (0xFFFF) are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers.\n\nThere are many uses for UDP, for example BitTorrent optionally uses it for peer-to-peer file sharing.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152574", "text": "Cache coherence\n\nA cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource. When there are several such caches for the same resource, as shown in the picture, this can lead to problems. Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data, and that the data in the caches makes sense (called \"data integrity\"). Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence.\n\nThere may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource, as data in the cache may no longer make sense, or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others. A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system. As can be seen in the figure, if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block, the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memory,without knowing. Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory.\n\nCoherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location. The caches are coherent, if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n\nThese conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously. However, this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture. A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made. The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors.\n\n\n\n\nDistributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.\n\nThe two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory-based. Each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping is not scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system. As the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (>64 processors) use this type of cache coherence.\n", "id": "152574", "title": "Cache coherence"}

He is Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the University of Western Australia. Marshall is well known for proving that bacteria \"Helicobacter pylori\" are the cause of most stomach ulcers. This changed years of medical belief which said that ulcers were caused by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid. He has recently taken a part-time position at the Pennsylvania State University.\n\nMarshall was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven. He went to high school at Newman College, Perth. At the University of Western Australia, medicine and surgery. He married his wife, Adrienne, in 1972. In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo-yo champion.\n\nIn 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital. At the hospital he met Robin Warren, a pathologist who was interested in gastritis. They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis. In 1982 they grew a culture of \"H. pylori\". They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer. Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach. Marshall said that \"Everyone was against me, but I knew I was right\". Other doctors said they wouldn't believe it until the \"H. pylori\" idea could be proved.\n\nMarshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984, but it did not work. Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria. He had stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting and bad smelling breath. On the 14th day of the infection, biopsies of Marshall's stomach did not show any bacteria. His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help. His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again. He did not develop antibodies to H.pylori. This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of H.pylori infection. His illness and recovery, showed the link between \"H. pylori\" and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcer. This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal.\n\nAfter this work at Fremantle Hospital, Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985-86) and at the University of Virginia, USA (1986-1996), before going back to Australia. He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998-2003. He is still looking at \"H. pylori\" and runs the H.pylori Research Laboratory at UWA.\n\nIn 2005, the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren for finding the bacterium \"Helicobacter pylori\" and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.\n\nMarshall was given other awards including:\n\nHe was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007.\n\n\n", "id": "152591", "title": "Barry Marshall"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152722", "text": "Sweetwater, Florida\n\nSweetwater is a city of Florida in the United States.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Miami-Pittsburgh Land Company bought land near Miami. They planned to build \"Sweetwater Groves.\" In 1926, a category 4 hurricane, (the Great Miami Hurricane), struck the area. Between the hurricane and problems with real estate value at the time, this construction never happened.\n\nIn 1938, Clyde Andrews bought most of the \"Sweetwater Groves\" land and began to sell it for homes. A group of Russian midgets were some of the people who bought the land. They were looking for a place to retire after their career in the circus. They built several homes on the land. These homes were not built for people of normal height. The homes were built smaller than normal so that the group would be comfortable living in them. This caused Sweetwater to be called the \"midget\" community for many years. Sweetwater became incorporated in 1941. . The first mayor of the town was the manager of the group of midgets. The town grew to a population of about 500 people by 1959. In 1970, Sweetwater was still a small town. It's population was about 3000.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Sweetwater began to grow quickly. In 1972, Florida International University began teaching students at its campus just south of the town. Two large highways were being built in the area. One north of the town and the other to the west of it. The area also got noticed by the Dade County Hispanic community. All of this caused the population of Sweetwater to double. The town had the largest growth of all cities in Dade County during the 1970s.\n\nThe City's population is currently over 14,200 people. Ninety-three percent of the population is of Hispanic origin.\n\n", "id": "152722", "title": "Sweetwater, Florida"}

West Palm Beach is the county seat of Palm Beach County, Florida. As of 2015, the population of West Palm beach was 106,779. \n\nThe city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was \"Westpalmbeach\", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the \"Calaboose\" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period.\n\nOriginally, Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze, he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead.\n\nIn the 1960s, Palm Beach County's first enclosed shopping mall, the Palm Beach Mall, and an indoor arena were completed. They led to a short revival for the city, but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown. Since the 1990s, developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district.\n", "id": "152742", "title": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}
