The vehicle is themed towards the board. Players no longer collect coins and stars. Instead, they collect Mini Stars. Mini Stars are collected by passing by a space with them. There are also spaces with Mini Ztars, which deducts a player's Mini Star amount. Mini-games are no longer played after the end of each turn. Instead, mini-games are played by landing on a mini-game space. At the end of a mini-game, players are ranked from first to last place. Players who earn high positions earn more Mini Stars.\n\nSeven boards are available. One of the boards must be unlocked. Boards now take a straight path. A game ends when the players go around the board once. After a game ends, the players face off against a boss. Each board has a different boss.\n\nTwelve characters are available to play as.

A Hamiltonian cycle is a Hamiltonian path, which is also a cycle. Knowing whether such a path exists in a graph, as well as finding it is a fundamental problem of graph theory. It is much more difficult than finding an Eulerian path, which contains each edge exactly once. The problem of finding a Hamiltonian path is NP-complete. There are two classes of graphs: directed and undirected graphs. In directed graphs, an edge can only be travelled in one direction, in undirected graphs it can be travelled in both directions. The Travelling Salesman Problem is an instance of this problem. Its task is to find the shortest Hamiltonian cycle, usually in a directed graph, with weight (or distances) attached to the edges. \n\nHamiltonian paths and cycles and cycle paths are named after William Rowan Hamilton who invented the Icosian game. This game is also known as \"Hamilton's puzzle\". It involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron. Hamilton solved this problem using the Icosian Calculus, an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternions (also invented by Hamilton). This solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs. However, despite being named after Hamilton, Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by Thomas Kirkman. \n", "id": "384399", "title": "Hamiltonian path"}

Several of the plants that he collected were named after him.\n\nNathaniel Wallich was born in a Jewish family in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1786 as Nathan ben Wulff. His father Wulff ben Wallich (or Wolff Wallich) was a rich merchant from Altona, a town near Hamburg, Germany, and then moved to Copenhagen late in the 18th century. Nathaniel changed his name to Nathan Wallich, later Nathaniel, as an adult.\n\nWallich got the diploma of the Royal Academy of Surgeons at Copenhagen in 1806. At the end of the year he was appointed as doctor in the Danish colony of Serampore, then known as \"Frederiksnagore\" in Bengal (now in West Bengal). He sailed for India in April 1807 and arrived at Serampore the following November.\n\nHe was an honorary doctor at the University of Copenhagen and member of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters.\n\nBecause of bad health, Wallich spent the years 1811-1813 in the more temperate climate of Mauritius, where he continued his studies. From August 1814, Wallich became an Assistant Surgeon in the East India Company's service. Wallich was later appointed assistant to William Roxburgh, the East India Company's botanist in Calcutta.\n\nBy 1813 he took great interest in the flora and natural vegetation of India. He also went on expeditions to Nepal, West Hindustan, and lower Burma. Wallich travelled to Nepal in 1821, one of the very first Englishmen to go there, and returned with many new plants. During 1837 and 1838, Nathaniel Wallich served as Professor of Botany in Calcutta Medical College.\n\nHe also published two important books, \"Tentamen Floræ Nepalensis Illustratæ\" (vols I-II, 1824–26) and \"Plantæ Asiaticæ Rariores\" (vols I-III, 1830–32).\n\nDr. Nathaniel Wallich took charge of the Oriental Museum of the Asiatic Society on 1 June 1814.

Brachiopods are easily distinguished from molluscs because they have (different) dorsal and ventral shells. Bivalves have mirrored right and left shells. \"Lingula\" and most brachiopods also have a stalk (or peduncle) that extends through a hole near the tip of one of its shells. Bivalves may be attached to a substrate with byssus filaments, that extend from between the shells.\n\nThe Lingulata brachiopods have existed from the Cambrian period to the present, a time span of over 500 million years!

This new idea was explored in detail for orchids. The field studies and practical scientific investigations were initially a recreation for Darwin, a relief from the drudgery of writing. The work developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments, and he was helped by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents.\n\nThe book was his first detailed demonstration of natural selection. It explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the co-evolution of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the long neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. \"Orchids\" was the first in a series of books on his investigations into plants.\n\nThe book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which had fascinated many naturalists. By showing how adaptations develop step by step, Darwin countered the view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features. such as the puzzle of \"Catasetum\", three completely different kinds of flowers. Darwin discusses how the Sack-Shaped Catasetum (\"Catasetum saccatum\"), a tropical South American species, launches its sticky pollen sacs with explosive force when an insect touches a hair (seta). His friend Thomas Huxley said \"Do you really think I can believe all that?\"\n\nIn the book Darwin made some famous predictions, including his proposal that the long nectary of \"Angraecum sesquipedale\" meant there must be a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when \"Xanthopan morgani praedicta\" was found in Madagascar.\n", "id": "384520", "title": "Fertilisation of Orchids"}

They were shot in Lawrence's car. The suspected perpetrator of the crime, Christopher Dorner, put out a manifesto one day after the crime.

Between the fairy disguised as a flower on the top of the cake, and the ring hidden within it, the children were able to make a wish for whatever they pleased if they were lucky enough to find it. After receiving the magical ring in her slice, Hulda is given the opportunity to make a wish. A fairy appears from the flower on top of the cake, and tells Hulda she will give her anything she wishes for. Unknowing of what her wish would bring, she asks for the fairy's wand. After handing Hulda her beautiful gold wand, the fairy is stripped of her powers and will ultimately be held at the will of her enemy if she doesn’t one day retrieve the wand. It could not be returned immediately, it had to be on a midsummers day. Until then, the fairy requested that Hulda keep it safe for her while she was gone. Days passed and the fairy had never returned, this left Hulda believing that the fairy had died. A dishonest guest paid a visit to Hulda and convinced her to trade the wand for a piece of his beautiful jewelry. After trading the wand for a bracelet with a bird clasp, Hulda realizes her visitor was actually a gnome. The gnome was the enemy the fairy had been worried about; with the wand in his possession he would make the fairy his slave. Hulda was aware she made a mistake, and did not rest until she retrieved the gold wand and returned it to the fairy. Not only did she give the fairy her powers back, but also in turn she saved her own life.\n\nA Lost Wand was written in the mid 1800s, pinpointing the date is difficult, but most publication of her work was done in 1865. The poems and tales she wrote are the reason why her fame is at the point of where it is now. A lot of Ingelow’s literature was influenced by the writings of Lewis Carroll and George Macdonald, and her stories were written specifically for children, not so much to teach a lesson; but for entertainment, which was a relatively new concept during this time period.\n\nHulda begins the story as a young girl at a party one winter’s night in Norway at her home. Her parents bring out a grand cake with a small ring baked into it, the person who gets the ring receives one wish from a fairy. Hulda receives this wish, she wishes for the wand the fairy has. But is then upset when she found out because of her wish the fairy loses her powers. Hulda spends the rest of her childhood guarding the wand until a poor peddler comes along and wants to trade it for one of his beautiful bracelets. Because Hulda had not seen the fairy in a long time she assumed that she has died, and proceeds to trade the wand to the peddler. She finds out that the peddler was actually a gnome who only wanted to get the wand in the first place. She spends the rest of her childhood looking for the peddler to try and get back her mother ring which he also stole that day she met him.\n\nThe fairy appears first at the beginning of the story to grant the children one wish, when Hulda wishes for the fairies wand, she is stripped of her magical powers and can no longer grant wishes. She becomes dim and soon disappears, but before she goes away for good she asks that the child keep good care of the wand for one day she may be able tor return for it. When the fairy comes back in the middle of the story she finds out that the wand has been traded to the evil gnome who dressed up like a poor peddler and tricked Hulda into trading it to him for one of his bracelets. Hulda thought the fairy was dead so she gave the wand away, when in fact the fairy tells Hulda she was in Africa far away from Europe because the gnomes can only come up in Europe, she was staying away so that she was not kept as a slave of the gnome. Once Hulda returns the wand to the fairy at the end of the story she is not seen or heard of again.\n\nThe Gnome who also plays the character of the poor peddler appears in the story after Hulda has become a bit older. He comes in searching for the wand that he knew was lost some where in the area she lived. He disguises himself as a poor man trying to sell off his jewelry and trinkets, when he comes to the door to find that Hulda’s parents are away from the home, he begins to spin a web of lies that Hulda gets caught in, and mistakenly winds up giving away the Fairies wand, because the peddler convinces her that because the sheen of the jewels is gone, it means the owner has died. He is delighted when he trades her the wand for a bracelet, so he leaves to go back underground. Years later he resurfaces and finds out about Hulda’s bad health, he goes back away until he knows she has passed. However She does not pass, due to the hot weather in the south she makes a full recovery. When the peddler goes to the garden area to try and sell some more jewelry, he is confronted by Hulda and runs back to go hind underground however he is stopped by Hulda, demanding her mothers ring back. He soon becomes confronted with not only Hulda but the Lizard as well, He seems frightened by the lizard and before she can even force him to give the wand and the ring back, Hulda has possession of them. He then disappears underground with the Lizard, never heard from again.\n\nNorway is full of incredible foods, of all different kinds. However, the most significant item displayed on the table is Hulda’s grandmother’s cake. It catches not only the eye if Hulda, but all the others who are present. The appearance of the cake is not what makes it special; the fairy taking the form of a flower on top of the cake is what makes it so magnificent. The lucky child who finds the ring in their slice, gets to make a wish. All wishes do not bring happiness; they can very well bring the opposite. Although the cake is beautiful, the wish that Hulda is granted is not what she thought it would be; beauty is not always what it seems.\n\nThe bracelet would not have been Hulda’s first choice as a trade for her little gold wand; in fact she liked most of the items a lot more. But just like the cake, not everything is what it seems to be. The bird clasp on the lovely bracelet turned out to be a loyal companion that led her way to find the peddler and in turn, save the fairy. This shows that those who deserve it receive the loyalty they need and kindness does not go unrewarded. The peddler and his greedy ways however, do not go unpunished. In the end, Hulda’s genuine intentions are turned into good deeds while the peddler is locked away underground away from the sunlight for eternity. The most beautiful objects aren’t always the best choice.\n\nA lizard; an animal often-found in hot, dry climates. This is why it is not unusual that the master of the gnomes, who happen to like hot weather, is a lizard. Most reptiles are perceived as slimy, nasty creatures. In this case, the Lizard is fair and considerate of all situations. She rewards those who deserve it and prosecutes those who do not. Just like everything else, not all is what it seems.\nAlthough it's small the power it contains is life saving, literally. Without it, the fairy cannot live her normal life. Her normal life is helping mortals, without that she does not want to live. Once it became dim and the jewels, which decorated it, were no longer beautiful, it still has power hiding behind it. To anyone else, it would be insignificant. To the fairy, it meant the world. It either meant her life would be back to normal, or turned into a life of misery and despair. Even the tiniest objects can have the biggest impact.\n", "id": "384567", "title": "The Lost Wand"}

Its remains were found in Brazil.\n\nThe fragmentary remains of this animal were found in the Parnaiba Basin of northeast Brazil. With an estimated length of 9 m (30 ft), \"Prionosuchus\" is the largest amphibian ever found.\n\nIt had an elongated and tapered snout, numerous sharp teeth, long body, short legs, and a tail adapted for swimming. \n\nCox and Hutchinson re-evaluated \"Prionosuchus\" in 1991 and thought it was synonymous with the genus \"Platyoposaurus\" from Russia. However, \"Platyoposaurus\" had a total length of only 2.5 meters (8.2 ft), which suggested that the two animals were at least different species. The age of the sediments suggested the two were not comtemporaries. Most paleontologists consider \"Prionosuchus\" as a valid genus.\n\n\"Prionosuchus\" lived in a humid and tropical environment as indicated by the petrified forest of the Pedra do Fogo formation in which the fossil was found. The strata of siltstones, shales and limestones were deposited in lagoonal and fluvial environments. Other animals discovered in the same rocks include fish (primitive sharks, palaeoniscids, and lungfish) and amphibians.\n\nIts general appearance was similar to a modern crocodile, such as the gharial. It probably had a similar lifestyle as an ambush aquatic predator feeding on fish and other aquatic animals.\n\nIt was one of a group known as the Archegosaurs. The archegosaurs were a group of temnospondyls that occupied the ecological niche of crocodiles and alligators during the Permian. The smaller European genus \"Archegosaurus\" is typical. The group went extinct at the end of the Permian. In the Triassic, the niche was filled by other temnospondyls and by reptiles such as the phytosaurs.\n", "id": "384675", "title": "Prionosuchus"}

It recognises all members of the armed forces and organisations who have died or taken part in the wars of the Commonwealth of Australia. The memorial includes a large military museum. Opened in 1941, it is one of the most significant memorials of its type in the world.\n\nThe Memorial is in Australia's capital, Canberra. It is the north end of the city's ceremonial land axis. This is a line from Parliament House on Capital Hill to Mount Ainslie. No roads directly link the two points, but there is a clear line of sight between Parliament House and the War Memorial.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial has three parts. The first is the Commemorative Area (shrine) including the Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. The second is the museum. The third part is the Research Centre. The Memorial also has an outdoor Sculpture Garden. The Memorial is open daily from 10am until 5pm, except on Christmas Day.\n\nAnzac Parade, while a part of the Memorial design, is maintained by the National Capital Authority (NCA).\n\nCharles Bean, Australia's official World War I historian, first thought of a museum memorial to Australian soldiers while observing the 1916 battles in France. The Australian War Records Section began in May 1917 to keep the records relating to the war being fought at the time. Records and items were first shown in Melbourne and later Canberra.\n\nA design competition in 1927 did not produce a winning entry. Two entrants, Sydney architects Emil Sodersten and John Crust, were asked to work together on a design. A limited budget and the effects of the Depression limited the project.\n\nThe building was completed in 1941, after the start of World War II. It was officially opened on Remembrance Day, 11 November 1941, by the Governor-General Lord Gowrie. Gowrie was a former soldier who had been awarded the Victoria Cross. The building has been extended to allow the remembrance of Australia's role in other more recent conflicts.\n\nRemembrance Nature Park, behind the War Memorial, is the Canberra end of the Remembrance Driveway, a system of parks, landmarks and road-side stops between Sydney and Canberra. It commeorates the 24 World War II and Vietnam War Victoria Cross recipients.\n\nANZAC Parade is a short, broad street named after the soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. It reaches from the north shore of Lake Burley Griffin to the Memorial, along the line of sight from Parliament House. It separates the residential suburbs of Campbell and Reid, and is used by a lot of traffic between northeastern Canberra (Dickson etc.) and Kings Avenue Bridge.\n\nOn each side of the Parade are monuments for military campaigns or services, such as the Vietnam War and Australia's wartime nurses. The monuments are mostly sculptures in styles from naturalistic to Modern.\n\nNear the lake are a pair of monumental sculptures in the form of large basket handles, donated to the Memorial by New Zealand. They are dedicated to Australia and New Zealand and are inspired by the Māori proverb \"Mau tena kiwai o te kete, maku tenei\", \"Each of us at a handle of the basket\". This symbolises the long tradition of cooperation and general closeness between the two Commonwealth countries.\n\nThe symbolic association of the two nations is also shown in the plants along ANZAC Parade. Long beds of New Zealand \"Hebe\" shrubs line the middle of the avenue. Behind the two rows of monuments are narrow bands of Australian eucalyptus trees. Behind the trees are narrow residential streets paralleling the Parade and separating it from the residential neighbourhoods. In the high summer, cicadas in the eucalyptus trees can be heard from several blocks away.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial is at the northern end of Anzac Parade. The commemorative area is in the open centre of the memorial building with cloisters on each side. There is the Hall of Memory under the building's central dome and the sculpture garden on the west lawn.\n\nThe heart of the commemorative area is the \"Hall of Memory\". This is a tall domed chapel with a small floor plan in the form of an octagon. The walls are lined with tiny mosaic tiles from the floor to the dome. Inside lies the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier.\n\nThree of the walls, facing east, west, and south, have stained glass designs showing qualities of Australian servicemen and women. At the four walls facing northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest are mosaic images of a sailor, a servicewoman, a soldier and an airman. The mosaic and stained glass were the work of the one-armed Australian artist Napier Waller. He had lost his right arm at Bullecourt during World War I and learned to write and create his works with his left arm. He completed his work in 1958.\n\nIn front of the Hall of Memory is a narrow courtyard with a memorial pool surrounding an eternal flame. On either side are paths and gardens, including plantings of rosemary for remembrance. Above the courtyard on either side are long cloisters containing the \"Roll of Honour\". This is a series of bronze plaques naming the 102,000 Australian servicemen and women killed in conflict. The plaques include names dating back to the British Sudanese Expedition, the Second Boer War, and the Boxer Rebellion. The entire long wall of the western gallery is covered with the names of the thousands who died in World War I. The eastern gallery is covered with the names of those who died in World War II and more recent conflicts.\n\nThe roll shows the names only, not rank or other awards, as \"all men are equal in death\". Visitors have put poppies next to the names of their relatives and friends. \n\nA small exhibit in the museum indicates that the famous Breaker Morant of the Boer War does not appear in the Roll of Honour. This was not because he was dishonoured, but rather because he was not actually a member of the Australian armed forces.\n\nWhen the Memorial closes each day, there is a ceremony at which visitors can gather at the entrance, hear a very brief explanation from a host, and listen as a recording of the \"Last Post\" is played. On significant days, a piper or a bugler descends from the gallery, playing the Last Post.\n\nThe commemorative area is the main place in Canberra where Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services are held. These services are normally attended by Federal parliament representatives and officials from foreign embassies and Commonwealth high commissions, most notably those from New Zealand. \n\nThe Memorial is a two-storey building with a floor plan in the shape of a cross. The building is of Byzantine architecture style with strong elements of Art Deco. In 2001, a new, broad annex called \"ANZAC Hall\" was added to the north of the original building. In order to preserve the view of the original building from Anzac Parade, ANZAC Hall was designed to be sunk into the grounds below, and hidden behind a wall.\n\nThe upper level has displays on World War I (the entire west wing) and World War II (the entire east wing). In the World War I area there is a lot material about the Gallipoli campaign. Between the wings lies \"Aircraft Hall\", which contains a number of complete aircraft, mostly from the World War II era.\n\nAlso between the wings is the \"Hall of Valour\", a display of 61 of the 96 Victoria Crosses awarded to Australian soldiers. This is the largest public collection of Victoria Crosses in the world. There is a display for the holder of each Cross shown there. The relatives of Australian VC holders often give or loan the Crosses to the Memorial for safekeeping and greater public awareness of their honoured kin.\n\nOn 24 July 2006 Kerry Stokes purchased the 60th medal at auction for a world record price of A$1,000,000 and asked that it be displayed in the Victoria Cross Gallery. This medal was awarded to Captain Alfred Shout for hand-to-hand combat at the Lone Pine trenches in Gallipoli, Turkey. The Victoria Cross Gallery now has all nine VCs awarded to Australians at Gallipoli. These were to Alexander Burton, William Dunstan, John Hamilton, Albert Jacka, Leonard Keysor, Alfred Shout, William Symons, Hugo Throssell and Frederick Tubb.\n\nThe lower level contains a theatre, a research area, displays for the colonial and post–World War II conflicts. There is also an area for special exhibitions.\n\nANZAC Hall is on the upper level of the memorial, used for the display of large military equipment. This includes a historic Lancaster bomber known as G for George, a Japanese \"Ko-hyoteki\" class midget submarine sunk during a raid on Sydney Harbour in 1942, German aircraft including the Me 262 and Me 163, and a restored Japanese A6M Zero, that was flown in combat over New Guinea.

Managed by the Football Association of Singapore, the squad marks the return of Singapore to the Malaysia football scene after leaving the Malaysia Cup in 1994. The name \"LionsXII\" is a special tribute to the fans, who is generally recognised as football's \"12th Man\".\n\nIn 2011, the Football Association of Singapore and the Football Association of Malaysia reached an agreement that would see greater cooperation between the two nations. One of the intended avenues would see the Under-23s play in the Malaysian Super League and Malaysia Cup from 2012 onwards, the first time a Singaporean team would be participating in Malaysian domestic football since 1994, when Singapore won the M-League and Malaysia Cup double. Although the new Singapore team would have the existing Under-23s forming its core, senior players were also called upon to guide the younger players. No foreign players were allowed to be part of the Singapore team as this project served as being developmental.\n\nThe LionsXII debuted in the 2012 Malaysia Super League on 10 January 2012 with a 1–2 loss to defending champions Kelantan FA. The LionsXII's first win was a 2–1 victory over Kuala Lumpur FA on 17 January. The LionsXII's first away win was a 1–0 victory over Sabah FA on 21 January. LionsXII began their 2012 Malaysia FA Cup quest on 18 February, with a 3–0 win over UiTM FC. The LionsXII made their way to the quarter-final with a 2–0 win over Betaria FC on 10 March 2012. However, they were beaten by Terengganu FA in the quarter-finals. On 16 June 2012, they defeated Sabah FA 9–0 at home, the biggest win in the MSL season. LionsXII finished second in the league behind Kelantan FA, and bowed out of the semi-final of the 2012 Malaysia Cup after losing in a penalty shoot-out against ATM FA.\n\nLionsXII were set a target of finishing in the top top five for the 2013 Malaysia Super League when a press conference was held before the start of the season. The five overage players included key members from the previous campaign such as Shahril Ishak, Isa Halim, and Baihakki Khaizan, but other key players such as Shahdan Sulaiman and Shaiful Esah no longer featured. The main aim was to develop the U-23 players and prepare them for the upcoming 2013 Southeast Asian Games that would be held at the end of the year, with the five seniors players serving to guide them throughout the campaign. As at the start of the campaign, 13 players were also undergoing National Service.\n\nLionsXII began their campaign by defeating ATM FA 1–0 away. In their first home match, they successfully edged out traditional rivals Selangor FA for the first time since joining the MSL. However, LionsXII stumbled to two losses against lowly T-Team FC and PKNS FC away. They also crashed out against in the first round of the 2013 Malaysia FA Cup against PKNS. Despite this, LionsXII went on a long unbeaten streak, securing important wins over Pahang FA (3–0), Kelantan FA (1–0), and ATM FA (3–1) at home. The opposing coaches even conceded the title to the LionsXII leading up to the end of the season, as the team chalked up the best home record in the league, winning 10 and drawing one (with the draw coming in Round 19 against title-contender Johor Darul Takzim FC.\n\nOn 2 July 2013, a 4–0 win over relegation-threatened FELDA United FC in the penultimate league game made LionsXII league champions. Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong was present for the match played in front of a sold-out crowd at the Jalan Besar Stadium. The MSL trophy was also brought to Jalan Besar Stadium as the LionsXII received it on home soil after the final whistle. LionsXII became the first foreign team to win the MSL, adding to the four Malaysian league titles it had won in 1979, 1981, 1985, and 1994. The title run was defined by a combination of good defence (13 goals conceded, the best record in the MSL) and goals from set-pieces (17 out of 32).\n\nLionsXII ground stadium is Jalan Besar Stadium in Singapore. The stadium can host 8,000 supporters in total.\n\nOn 30 October 2012, a new high-definition LED scoreboard was implemented at the Gallery to provide better quality to the spectators as it will be able replay video highlights of the action on the field.\n\nLionsXII boasts a lot of passionate supporters who will always turn up in red to support them in every home match. Their official fan group is called ExcluSinga accredited by the Football Association of Singapore. The group was formed from their news-providing Facebook page, Exclusive Singapore LIONSXII, which provides regular and exclusive updates which recognised by the Football Association of Singapore and has become their official fan club in April 2012 soon after the LionsXII was formed on 25 March 2012.\n\nMembers of ExcluSinga will make their appearances in LionsXII matches chanting and supporting the team throughout the whole 90 minutes.\n\nThey have over 1,000 members in their Facebook group up to date.\n\nOn 5 January 2012, Football Association of Singapore announced the appointment of StarHub as the Official Broadcaster and Principal Sponsor of LionsXII. As part of the partnership, StarHub will carry all LionsXII content on its pay TV, online and mobile platforms. Two days after the announcement of the kit, LionsXII sealed a second major sponsorship deal, with news that SilkPro will fund the Singapore outfit to the tune of S$1m during its debut season in Malaysia Super League. On 23 February 2012, LionsXII secured another sponsorship deal, with Shop N Save, a Singapore supermarket, coming on board as the 'Official Supermarket' for the Singapore outfit in its debut season in the Malaysian Super League.\n\n\"Updated on 3 July 2013\"\n\nUpdated on 1 May 2013\n\nMalaysia Super League<br>\nTotal goals scored: 32 <br>\nTotal goals conceded: 13\n\nMalaysia FA Cup<br>\nTotal goals scored: 0 <br>\nTotal goals conceded: 1\n", "id": "384802", "title": "LionsXII"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=384845", "text": "Burning Man\n\nBurning Man is a festival that happens every year at Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada, in the United States. It lasts a week, and it starts on the last Monday in August, and ends on the first Monday in September (which is also Labor Day in the U.S.). The festival is called Burning Man because a large wood sculpture of a man is set on fire on Saturday. The festival has been happening every year since 1990. Many people go to Burning Man; in 2012, over 55,000 people were there. The Black Rock desert is far from any cities or towns, and is very dry, so people who go to Burning Man have to bring their own water, food, and shelter. \n\nBurning Man started in 1986 at San Francisco. An artist named Larry Harvey made a wooden sculpture of a man, and decided to burn it a nearby beach as a bonfire for Summer Solstice. It was a success, so he did it again at the beach the next year, and then again a couple years after that. Each year the sculpture was made bigger. In 1987 “the Man” was almost tall, and in 1989 it was almost feet tall.\n\nIn 1990, the police stopped Harvey from burning the Man because Harvey did not have a permit. \nAround the same time, two people named Kevin Evans and John Law were planning a group trip to a dry lake, called The Playa, in the Black Rock Desert. They were members of a group of Dadaists named the Cacophony Society. Harvey decided to take the sculpture, which had been taken apart, to the desert to be burned. Since that time the festival has happened in the desert.\n\nJohn Law knew how to make neon signs, so starting in 1991 neon lights have been added to the Man.\n\nOne of the members of the Cacophony Society is named Michael Mikel, who uses the name “Danger Ranger”. He was worried about people getting lost in the desert, which can be very dangerous. He started a group named the Black Rock Rangers to help keep people safe, and to help break up conflicts.\n\nStarting in 1991, Harvey got a permit from the Bureau of Land Management (who take care of land owned by the US government) to hold the festival. The festival was becoming more popular every year. In 1991 about 250 people were there. In 1995 about 4,000 people were there, and in 1997 it was about 10,000. In 2000 attendance was about 25,000, and by 2010 it had reached over 50,000 people. The festival has become so large, sometimes it is called \"Black Rock City\" because it is like a small city.\n\nHarvey wrote 10 principles to suggest how he thought people at Burning Man behave. These principles are:\n\nEveryone who goes to Burning Man must have a ticket. Tickets must be bought before the festival starts.\n\nBurning Man is designed for pedestrians and people on bicycles. Most cars can only be used for entering or leaving the festival. Because there have been many car accidents in the past, cars are only allowed to go 5 miles per hour.\n\nMoney is only allowed for a few things at Burning Man. It can only be used to buy ice, to buy coffee and other drinks, to pay for recreational vehicle services, to pay for emergency services like an auto mechanic or a locksmith, and a few other things.\n\nGuns, fireworks, and dogs, are not allowed.\n\nMany artists choose to show their art at Burning Man. Because the dry lake where the festival happens is so empty, it is like a white canvas. \n\nEvery year since 1996 Harvey has chosen a theme, which is a word or idea that some of the artists use as part of their artwork. For example, in 2011 the theme was “Rites of Passage”, while in 2013 the theme was \"Cargo Cults\". \n\nPeople who want to bring motor vehicles to drive around while at Burning Man must get permission before they arrive. The group that gives permission is called the \"Department of Mutant Vehicles”, or DMV. The cars, trucks, and buses must be changed to look very different from normal. These are called \"Mutant vehicles\". Mutant vehicles often have complicated lights. Some mutant vehicles have loudspeakers for playing music, and some have flames and other pyrotechnics.\n\nThe city that is built for the festival is named \"Black Rock City\", or \"BRC\" for short. Because it is so big, some volunteers start building about 3 weeks before the festival starts. Some people also stay as long as 4 weeks after to clean-up and take everything apart. \n\nThe city has streets which are planned in the shape of a clock. There are streets that go towards the Man, which are named after times on a clock (12:00, 12:30, 1:00, and so on). There are also streets that curve in a circle around the Man. These streets are given new names every year. The area closest to the Man doesn't have any buildings or tents. This area only has different works of art. The street that runs along the inside of the circle surrounding the Man is called the Esplanade.\n\nA small airport is also built every year, away from the rest of the city. \n\nThe Sierra Club has said that all of the cars and trucks coming and going to the desert produces too much carbon dioxide gas, which causes global warming. A group of people at Burning Man started a group called Black Rock Solar. This group built solar panels for schools in a nearby town, so that less carbon dioxide needs to be produced. \n\n", "id": "384845", "title": "Burning Man"}

It roughly means that the operation can be carried out again and again without changing the result.\n\nThe word idempotence was made by Benjamin Pierce because he saw the concept when studying algebra.\n\nThe meaning is different if we are talking about different kinds of operations. It can also be used to describe elements than an operation can take:\n\n\nWe say that an element \"c\" in the domain of \"f\" is an idempotent element if \"f(f(c)) = f(c)\". This means that \"f\" is idempotent if every element of its domain is an idempotent element.\n\n\nWe say that an element \"c\" which \"*\" can take is an idempotent element for \"*\" if \"c * c = c\". For example, the number \"1\" is an idempotent element for multiplication because \"1\" times \"1\" is \"1\".\n\nIf a call button inside an elevator is pressed then the elevator will go to the floor that is on the button. If it is pressed again then it will do the same thing. This means that the operation of pressing a button to make the elevator change floors is an idempotent operation.\n\nIf we mix two pots which have the same liquid in them into a new pot then we will have the same liquid in that pot. If we only care about \"what\" kind of liquid is in the pot (not how much) then mixing liquids is an idempotent binary operation.\n\nThe face of a clock looks the same if 12 hours have passed. So for the operation of \"letting time pass on a clock\" we see that letting 12 hours pass is an idempotent element (this is also true for all multiples of 12 like 24, 36, 48, ...).\n", "id": "385368", "title": "Idempotence"}

Today the word is often used to refer to a dish containing lamb and leeks, but historically it was made with either salted bacon or beef, potatoes, carrots and other vegetables. Cawl is widely considered to be the national dish of Wales.\n\nThe meat in the dish was normally cut into medium-sized pieces and boiled with the vegetables in water. The stock was thickened with either oatmeal or flour. It was then served, without the meat or vegetables, as a first course. The vegetables and slices of the meat would then be served as a second course. Cawl served as a single course is today the most popular way to serve the dish. Cawl is similar to \"lobsgows\", cawl's north Wales equivalent. \"Lobsgows\" differs in that the meat and vegetables are cut into smaller pieces. The stock is not thickened.\n\n\"Cawl cennin\", or leek cawl, can be made without meat but using meat stock. In some areas cawl is often served with bread and cheese. These are served separately on a plate. The dish was traditionally cooked in an iron pot or cauldron over the fire. It was eaten with wooden spoons. The word \"cawl\" in Welsh is first recorded in the 14th century, and is thought to come from the Latin ', meaning the stalk of a plant, a cabbage stalk or a cabbage.

He was the first American composer to be paid for his songs. The publishers paid him for being able to publish his music. He was born in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania which is now part of Pittsburgh. His parents were more wealthy than others in the city. His most well-known and successful song is \"Oh! Susanna\". It was first performed in the Eagle Ice Cream Saloon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1847. \n\nIn July 1850, Foster married Jane Denny MacDowell. They had one daughter, Marion. The marriage was troubled and the couple separated. Foster moved to New York City to pursue professional songwriting. He died in New York City on January 13, 1864, aged 37.\n\nFoster wrote mainly in three musical genres: plantation songs (\"Oh! Susanna\", \"Camptown Races\"), parlor songs (\"Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair\", \"Beautiful Dreamer\") and Civil War songs (\"We Are Coming, Father Abraham\").\n\nStephen Collins Foster was born on July 4, 1826 to William Barclay Foster (September 7, 1779 - July 27, 1855) and Elisa Clayland [Tomlinson] Foster (January 1788 - January 1855). Stephen Collins was born in his father's home, \"The White Cottage\", at Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh.\n\nHe was baptized on April 22, 1827 in Trinity Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of the Foster children, and was named for Stephen Collins, a child friend of the family who died at age 12, and for William Collins, a family friend and well known attorney.\n\nThe Fosters were married on November 14, 1807 in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. William Barclay Foster was a leader on the western frontier of Pennsylvania. He had settled near Pittsburgh. The Fosters had several children: Charlotte Susanna (1809), Ann Eliza (1812), Henry Baldwin (1816), Henrietta Angelica (1818), Dunning McNair (1821), Morrison (1823), and Stephen Collins (1826). A son was born in 1829, but died in 1830. \n\nWilliam Barclay Foster had sired an illegitimate son before his marriage. This boy was raised in the Foster family. The Fosters lived in an elegant cottage high on a hillside above the Allegheny River in Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh planned and developed by William Barclay Foster.\n\nStephen's great-grandfather, Alexander Foster, migrated from Londonderry, Northern Ireland to the American colonies in 1725. He settled in Little Britain Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. His son, James Foster, married Ann Barclay and moved to Virginia. Their son, James, Jr. served in the American Revolution, and sired Stephen's father William Barclay Foster in 1779. \n\nAfter the Revolution, many of the Scots-Irish families of Virginia (including the Fosters) migrated to western Pennsylvania. William Barclay Foster settled near Pittsburgh. He was a merchant who sometimes traveled as far away as Louisiana. He returned to Pittsburgh via New York City or Philadelphia after buying supplies for his Pittsburgh store. \n\nHe met his wife, Eliza Clayland Tomlinson, in Philadelphia. She was a Scots-Irish aristocrat of Wilmington, Delaware. The couple were married in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and traveled 300 miles overland to Pittsburgh. The couple were among the social elite of the frontier and associated with the best families.\n\nWilliam Barclay Foster had serious financial troubles. In 1827, The White Cottage and other Foster properties were seized by the government when Foster failed to pay the mortgages. Stephen thereafter was moved about, sometimes living with relatives. His mother remembered him later in her life as a boy marching about with a feather in his cap and pounding on a drum while whistling \"Auld Lang Syne\". She noted that there was something \"original\" about the boy.\n\nStephen's eldest sister died in October 1829. The morbid sorrow that afflicted the Foster family at this time probably marked Stephen's view of dead young women for the rest of his life. Beautiful dead young women appear in some of his best songs including \"Little Annie\", \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\" and \"Beautiful Dreamer\".\n\nStephen was five when he attended an \"infant school\". In 1833 he went to the Alleghany Academy, a school for the social elite founded by the Presbyterian clergyman Rev. Joseph Stockton. In 1834, Stephen went to a black church with Olivia Pise, a mulatto servant. In 1836, the family left The White Cottage for ever and moved to Allegheny City when Stephen's father was appointed Collector of the Pennsylvania Canal.\n\nFamily legends say Stephen picked out harmonies on a guitar at age two, and played a flageolet with perfection in a music store at age seven. At age nine, he sang and performed with other boys in their own neighborhood theatrical productions. African melodies had just become the fashion and Stephen sung these tunes with gusto.\n\nThe creation of the American minstrel show is credited to Thomas Dartmouth \"Daddy\" Rice, an actor whose performance of the song \"Jump Jim Crow\" in the dress of an aged African American created an overnight sensation in Pittsburgh. The tune was written down and given a piano accompaniment by W. C. Peters, a music shop owner in Pittsburgh.\n\nFor many years, minstrels performed with circuses and traveling zoos. In the 1830s, they organized themselves into quartets, bands, and other ensembles and performed in theatres and other halls. One Nelson Kneass performed as a minstrel, but disbanded his group in Pittsburgh about 1845. He opened a hall with a stage at one end, and served refreshments for the price of a ticket. \n\nPrizes were offered for the best riddles, etc. and a silver cup for the best African song. Foster was living in Cinncinati in 1846 and 1847, but his brother Morrison wrote him asking for a song. Stephen sent him \"Way Down South, Where the Cane Grows\". The song did not win the contest but set Foster on the road to minstrel songwriting.\n\nFoster wrote 28 songs for the minstrel stage. They differ substantially in subject matter and musical style from his household songs. They are written in a negro dialect and their accompaniments suggest banjo-picking. Their musical style is sourced to African American music and the traditional and folk music of British Americans. Many of these songs were written for minstrel groups of the period such as the Sable Harmonists and the Christy Minstrels. \n\nA typical minstrel song by Foster is set for solo voice with a four or five part chorus in the refrain and a short instrumental section intended for a dance on the stage. The best of these songs are \"Oh! Susanna\" (1848), \"Nelly Bly\" (1849), \"Camptown Races\" (1850), \"Massa's in de Cold Ground\" (1852), \"Old Folks at Home\" (1860), and \"Old Black Joe\" (1860).\n\nFoster married Jane Denny McDowell (1829 - 1903) on July 22, 1850 in Trinity Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh. She was the daughter of Andrew N. McDowell, a Pittsburgh physician, and Jane Denny Porter. The attraction between Foster and McDowell remains a mystery: Jane was on the edge of the Foster circle of friends, and had no special musical talents or interests. She may have broken an engagement to another man to marry Foster. The couple's only child Marion, a daughter, was born on April 18, 1850.\n\nThe marriage was troubled for unknown reasons, and the couple lived apart. They had separated for the first time by the spring of 1853. Jane took Marion to Lewistown, Pennsylvania, where her mother and sister lived. Stephen went to New York City to pursue songwriting. The couple reunited within a year, but separated again and again.\n\nJane and Marion returned to Pennsylvania by July 1861 after a stay in New York with Stephen. He was having money troubles, and his alcoholism was worsening. Jane moved to Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where she worked as a telegraph operator for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Her daughter was probably left with relatives elsewhere. Jane visited Stephen in New York City in September 1861, and several times thereafter.\n\nAt an unknown date after Stephen's death in 1864, Jane married Matthew D. Wiley, a baggage handler and express agent. She worked as a telegraph operator at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Allegheny depot. She supported several relatives including her daughter, her mother, and her grandchildren. She died in 1903 of burns suffered when a spark set her clothing on fire while she dozed near a fireplace. By that date, she and her daughter had received more than $4,100 in royalties from Stephen's songs. She is buried in the Allegheny Cemetery.\n\nMarion Foster (1850 - 1935) married William Welsh and had three children. After living in St. Louis and Chicago, she moved in 1914 to a mansion (as caretaker) on the site of her grandparents' home in Lawrenceville. She was poor, gave piano lessons into her seventies, and battled the government unsuccessfully for repossession of a piece of land once belonging to her grandfather.\n\nIn July 1863, the people of the United States saw the worst riots in the nation's history. In New York City, rioters protested America's first draft. They believed this draft was unfair. It weighed heavily against the poor and allowed the rich to buy their way out. Rioters destroyed several buildings, including the Colored Orphan Asylum, and lynched blacks from lamp posts. Between 105 and 128 people died during the four days of rioting.\n\nFoster's songs had not been selling well in the months before the riots\n. His best days as a songwriter were over. His audience had divided itself along political, economic, and racial lines. On Saturday 9 January 1864, Foster felt sick and went to bed early. He was staying in a poor but decent hotel on the Bowery. On Sunday morning, he spoke to a maid at his door, then turned and fell, breaking a piece of crockery that gashed his neck. His comrade George Cooper (who lived only four blocks away) was sent for. He found Foster naked in a pool of blood. The songwriter whispered, \"I'm done for\" and asked for a drink.\n\nA doctor arrived and the gash was sewn up. Foster was dressed, and taken to a ward for the poor at Bellevue Hospital. He was entered in the register as a \"laborer\". He was uncomfortable and did not like the food. On 13 January, he was eating soup when he fainted dead away. His corpse was put in a coffin and removed to the hospital morgue. In his pocket was found a few coins and a scrap of paper reading, \"Dear friends and gentle hearts\". \n\nThe cause of his death is not known. It was probably a combination of alcoholism, poor diet, and loss of blood, or a heart attack or stroke. Jane Foster and Stephen's brothers Henry and Morrison claimed the body and took it Pennsylvania for burial. The funeral service was held in Trinity Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh, on 21 January. Foster's coffin was met at the Allegheny Cemetery by a brass band playing his tunes. He was buried near his father and mother.\n\nHis death was not recorded in most newspapers. The New York \"Post\" however compared his melodies to those of Donizetti. \"The Round Table\" wrote that Foster was \"an amateur writer\" barely familiar with the rules of musical composition. The \"Table\" did praise his pathos and humor though. \n\nMany songs were promoted after Foster's death as his very last songs. \"The Voices That are Gone\" (published in 1865) and \"Kiss Me Mother Ere I Die\" (1869) are probably, indeed, his last works. In August 1864, a Prussian-born engineer bought The White Cottage and tore it down.\n\n", "id": "385483", "title": "Stephen Foster"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385574", "text": "Garrotte\n\nA garrotte is a weapon, usually a handheld ligature of chain, rope, scarf, wire or fishing line used to strangle a person. Garrotte is normal British English spelling, with single 'r' as an alternate. Garrote with a single 't' is US English spelling. A Spanish version is \"garrote vil\".\n\nThe garrote has been used for centuries for silent assassination. It was widely used in 17th and 18th century India by the Thuggee cult. A garrote can be made out of many materials, including slik scarves, ropes, cable ties, fishing lines, nylon, and even guitar strings, telephone cord and piano wire. The Indian version of the garrote often had a knot at the center to crush the larynx while applying pressure to the victim's back, usually by means of a foot or knee.\n\nA stick may be used to tighten the garrotte (the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself). In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device. \n\nSince World War II the garrotte has been regularly used as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of eliminating (taking out) sentries and other enemy personnel. Instruction in the use of garrottes is in the training of many elite military units and special forces. A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion. Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion used a particular type of double-loop garrotte (referred to as \"la loupe\"), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other.\n\nThe garrote was the main device used for capital punishment in Spain for hundreds of years. Originally, it was an execution where the convict was killed by hitting him with a club (\"garrote\" in Spanish). This later developed into a strangulation device, where the condemned was tied to a wooden stake, with a loop of rope placed around his neck. A wooden stick was placed in the loop, and by rotating the stick, the rope was tightened until the condemned person was strangled to death. As time went on, the execution method was modified in the form of a wooden chair to which the condemned was bound, while the executioner tightened a metal band around his/her neck with a crank or a wheel until asphyxiation of the condemned person was accomplished.\n\nOther versions of this device incorporated a fixed metal blade or spike directed at the spinal cord to cause the breaking of the neck. Such a device can be seen in the James Bond film \"The World Is Not Enough\", the Coppola classic \"The Godfather\", and the Banderas/Jolie film, \"Original Sin\". The spiked version, called the Catalan garrotte, was used as late as 1940. American authorities kept the garrotte for a time in the Philippines after that Spanish colony was captured in 1898. Its use was abolished in 1902 (Act No. 451, passed 2 September 1902).\n\nAmerican military authorities in Puerto Rico used the garrotte to execute at least five convicted murderers in 1900. In a report to Congress, the American military governor said \"that execution by the garrotte is far less inhumane and revolting than execution by hanging\". However, the method was replaced by hanging. Since 1929, capital punishment has not existed under Puerto Rican law.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.\n\nThe garrotte () is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the Second Catiline Conspiracy, where conspirators were strangled with a \"laqueus\". The implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., \"Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains\", tome I, p. 341 (1919). It was also used in the Middle Ages in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the conquista of the Americas, notably in the execution of the Inca emperor Atahualpa.\n\nDuring the Peninsular War of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrotte to execute Spanish \"guerrilleros\", priests, and other opponents to Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrotte appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrotte was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country.\n\nIn May 1897, the last public garrotting in Spain was performed in Barcelona. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. In 1935 in Spain the legislature adopted a law prohibiting any member of the armed forces from being a Freemason. As a result of this edict, 80 Freemasons were garrotted to death in Málaga. This was one of the many issues that led to unrest that became the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe last civilian executions in Spain, both by garrotting, were in July 1959. Two men both convicted of killing police officers: they were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain. In Spain, the garrote was abolished in 1978 along with the death penalty after adoption of a new constitution. \n\nIn 1990, Andorra became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garroting, though this method had not been used there since the late 19th century.\n", "id": "385574", "title": "Garrotte"}

Leonhard Euler solved the problem in 1735. This led to the beginning of graph theory. This then led to the development of topology.\n\nThe city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was set on both sides of the Pregel River. It included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges.\n\nThe problem was to find a way to walk through the city by crossing each bridge once and only once. The islands could not be reached by any route other than the bridges. Every bridge must have been crossed completely every time. The walk need not start and end at the same spot. Euler proved that the problem has no solution. \n\nFirst, Euler pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass does not matter. The only important property of a route is the order in which the bridges are crossed. So, he changed the problem to abstract terms. This laid the foundations of graph theory. He removed all features except the list of land masses and the bridges connecting them. In the language of graph theory, he replaced each land mass with an abstract \"vertex\" or node. Then he replaced each bridge with an abstract connection, an \"edge\". An edge (road) recorded which two vertices (land masses) were connected. In this way, he formed a graph.\n\nThe graph drawn is an abstract picture of the problem. So, the edges can be joined in any way. Only whether two points are connected or not are important. Changing the picture of the graph does not change the graph itself. \n\nNext, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge, one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In any walk of the graph, the number of times one enters a vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. If every bridge has been crossed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be \"even\". This is because if there are n bridges, it is crossed exactly 2n times. However, all four of the land masses in the original problem are touched by an \"odd\" number of bridges (one is touched by 5 bridges, and each of the other three are touched by 3). There are at most two masses which can be the endpoints of a walk. So the proposition of a walk crossing each bridge once leads to a contradiction.\n\nIn modern language, Euler shows that whether a walk through a graph crossing each edge once is possible or not depends on the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the number of edges touching it. Euler shows that a necessary condition for the walk is that the graph be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree. This result stated by Euler was later proved by Carl Hierholzer. Such a walk is now called an \"Eulerian path\" or \"Euler walk\". If there are nodes of odd degree, then any Eulerian path will start at one of them and end at the other. Since the graph representing the historical Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have an Eulerian path.\n\nEuler's work was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on August 26, 1735. It was published as \"Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis\" (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) in the journal \"Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae\" in 1741. It is available in English in The World of Mathematics.\n\nIn the history of mathematics, Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. Graph Theory is a subject now generally regarded as a branch of combinatorics. \n\nTwo of the seven original bridges were destroyed during the bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Two others were later demolished. They were replaced by a modern highway. The three other bridges remain, although only two of them are from Euler's time (one was rebuilt in 1935). Thus, as of 2000, there were five bridges in Kaliningrad.\n\nIn terms of graph theory, two of the nodes now have degree 2, and the other two have degree 3. Therefore, an Eulerian path is now possible, but since it must begin on one island and end on the other, it is impractical for tourists.\n\n\n", "id": "385956", "title": "Seven Bridges of Königsberg"}

One part of the immune system is called the humoral immune system, which is specifically for defending against infectious invaders that are in the blood or other body fluids. The main cells that make it work are the B cells, which create and secrete antibodies that seek out the invaders and attach to them. Once the invader is coated in antibodies, this targets the invader for destruction by other parts of the immune system. \n\nBefore the B cell can create antibodies, it first needs T helper cells to 'teach' the B cell about details of the incoming invader. That way the B cell can then create antibodies that specifically target only that invading organism and do not accidentally target parts of your own body for destruction as well. Of course this whole process takes time, about a day or two, so the humoral immune system does not create a quick defense against new invaders you have never encountered before. However, if your B cells have dealt with this specific invader before in the past, then the antibodies against that invader is already present in your blood, or the B cells that have fought this invader in the past can quickly create new antibodies against it again. So if your B cells have fought this invader in the past, then it can often fight off that invader again but quickly this time, so that the re-invader is killed quickly before it can start setting up house in your body again. This is why, in some cases, after a human has been sick with a specific illness and then fought it off, they can not get sick with it again. Your B cells and the antibodies they produce make you immune to that specific invader infection.\n", "id": "386086", "title": "Humoral immunity"}

It has an OH group (hydroxyl group) bonded to a benzene ring. It is an alcohol. Because the aromatic group attracts electrons, it is quite acidic. \n\nPhenol is produced from petroleum. It is an important molecule because it can be used to make many other products. It is also used in detergents and herbicides.\n\nPhenol has a pKa of about 10. For normal alcohols this number is usually around 15. However, phenol is less acidic than compounds like carboxylic acids. The reason for this high acidity is the resonance stabilization of the molecule when it becomes an anion.\n\nPhenol can do electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions very well. This is because the lone pair on the oxygen atom can give electrons through the benzene ring to an electrophile. Because the lone pair is so high in energy however, sometimes phenol reacts too many times.\n\nPhenol was first discovered in 1834. It was found as a product of burning coal. One of its first uses was to kill germs in surgery. It is still used today in some analgesics. During the Second World War, phenol was also used by the Nazis.

Although the text of the Khrushchev report leaked almost immediately, the official Russian text was published only in 1989 during the glasnost campaign of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nThe speech was based on an investigation of the repressions of the delegates of the 1934 XVII Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They were victims of the Stalinist purges of the 1930s. Estimates of Stalin's role in history were quite changed by the speech. Many in the West who had been Communist Party member, or at least sympathetic fellow-travellers, resigned their memberships and no longer defended the reputation of Stalin. Russian writers like Solzhenitsyn found they were treated with more sympathy. The speech was a significant turning-point in history.\n\nThe speech caused such shock to the audience that, according to some reports, some of those present suffered heart attacks, and others later committed suicide.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386299", "text": "The Master and Margarita\n\nThe Master and Margarita is a novel by Mikhail Bulgakov (1891–1940), a Russsian author. It has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. Like much of Bulgakov's work, magic realism and fantasy occurs to the background of life in the 1920s Soviet Russia.\n\nWith a fascinating cast of characters, the novel in its deepest layer is about the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice. \n\nThe novel is a satire on the Soviet society, a love story and an ironical look at some religious themes. The novel is divided into two parts. It starts with a plot in which two apparently unrelated stories alternate chapter by chapter.\n\nThe first plot theme is the Devil in modern Moscow; the second is the story of Pontius Pilate. \n\n1930s Moscow is visited by Satan in the guise of \"Professor\" Woland or Voland (Воланд). This mysterious magician of uncertain origin arrives with a retinue. \n\n\nThe group causes havoc in the literary elite, especially its trade union, . is a Soviet-style abbreviation for the \"Moscow Association of Writers\" or \"Literature for the Masses\". Targets are Massolit's posh HQ, corrupt social-climbers and their women (wives and mistresses alike), bureaucrats and profiteers and, more generally, skeptical unbelievers in the human spirit.\n\nThe second setting is the Jerusalem of Pontius Pilate, described by Woland talking to Berlioz and later echoed in the pages of the Master's novel. It concerns Pontius Pilate's trial of Yeshua Ha-Notsri (Jesus the Nazarene). Pilate recognises an affinity and spiritual need for Yeshua. There follows his reluctant but resigned submission to Yeshua's execution.\n\nLinking plots A and B are the rather sympathetic characters of Berlioz, Pontius Pilot and Ivan Ponyryov, a young, aspiring poet whose pen name (Bezdomny) means \"homeless\".\n\nBerlioz is the head of . Berlioz brushes off Woland's prophecy of his death, only to have it come true just pages later in the novel. Ivan, the young poet \"Homeless\", tries to chase and capture the gang and warn of their evil. This lands him in a lunatic asylum, where he meets the Master. The rejection of the Master's novel about Pontius Pilate and Christ led him to such despair that he burns his manuscript and turns his back on the \"real\" world, including his devoted lover, Margarita.\n\nConnecting these two themes are Satan himself, and the Master with his devoted lover Margarita. The Master is an embittered author, whose historical novel about Pontius Pilate had been rejected by the Soviet literary committee .\n\nPart Two introduces Margarita, the Master's mistress, who refuses to despair of her lover or his work. She is invited to the Devil's midnight ball, where Satan (Woland) offers her the chance to become a witch with supernatural powers. This coincides with the night of Good Friday: the Master's novel also deals with this same spring full moon when Christ's fate is sealed by Pontius Pilate and he is crucified in Jerusalem. All three events in the novel are linked by this.\n\nMargarita enters naked into the realm of night. She flies over the deep forests and rivers of the USSR. She bathes, and returns with Azazello, her escort, to Moscow as the anointed hostess for Satan's great Spring Ball. Standing by his side, she welcomes the dark celebrities of human history as they arrive from Hell.\n\nShe survives this ordeal without breaking, and for her pains, Satan offers to grant Margarita her deepest wish. Margarita selflessly chooses to liberate a woman whom she met at the ball. Satan grants her first wish and offers her another, saying the first wish was unrelated to Margarita's own desires. For her second wish, she chooses to liberate the Master and live in poverty-stricken love with him. \n\nThe Master and Margarita, for not having lost their faith in humanity, are granted peace but are denied light – that is, they will spend eternity together in a shadowy yet pleasant region, having not earned the glories of Heaven, but not deserving the punishments of Hell. As a parallel to the Master and Margarita's freedom, Pontius Pilate is also released from his eternal punishment\n\nBulgakov started writing the novel in 1928. He burnt the first manuscript of the novel in 1930, seeing no future as a writer in the Soviet Union. The work was restarted in 1931. The second draft was completed in 1936 by which point all the major plot lines of the final version were in place. The third draft was finished in 1937. Bulgakov continued to polish the work, aided by his wife, but was forced to stop work on the fourth version four weeks before his death in 1940.\n\nA censored version (12% of the text removed and still more changed) of the book was first published in \"Moscow\" magazine (#11, 1966 and #1, 1967). The text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was published on a samizdat basis. In 1967 the publisher \"Posev\" (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the first complete version, prepared by Anna Saakyants, was published in 1973, based on the version of the beginning of 1940 proofread by the publisher. In 1989 the last version was prepared by literature expert Lidiya Yanovskaya based on all available manuscripts.\n\nThere are quite a few published English translations of \"The Master and Margarita\", including:\n\nThe early translation by Glenny runs more smoothly than the modern translations. Some Russian-speaking readers consider it to be the only one creating the desired effect, though it may take liberties with the text. As an example, Glenny's translations leaves out Bulgakov's \"crucial\" reference to the devil in Berlioz's thought:\n\nSeveral literary critics have hailed the Burgin/Tiernan O’Connor translation as the most accurate and complete English translation. There are matching annotations by Bulgakov's biographer, Ellendea Proffer. However, these judgements came before the translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky.\n\nA graphic novel, an adaption by Andrzej Klimowski and Danusia Schejbal, published by Self Made Hero in 2008 provides a fresh visual translation/interpretation.\n\nThe novel has been the basis of films, stage productions, opera, ballet, and television versions.\n\n", "id": "386299", "title": "The Master and Margarita"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386385", "text": "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\n\nThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the short title of an important book by the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon. The book traces the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire. \n\nPublished in six volumes, from volume I in 1776 to volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 AD, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and its fall in the West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first \"modern historian of ancient Rome\".\n\nGibbon gave an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell. \n\nAccording to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because its citizens gradually loss their \"civic virtue\". They had become weak, using barbarian mercenaries to defend their Empire, who then became so numerous that they were able to take over the Empire. \n\nRomans, he believed, became unwilling to live the tougher, \"manly\" military lifestyle. In addition, Gibbon argued that Christianity created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered an indifference to the present among Roman citizens, and sapped their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its pacifism tended to hamper the traditional Roman martial spirit. Finally, like other Enlightenment thinkers, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, \"dark age\". It was not until his own age of reason and rational thought, so it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.\n\nGibbon sees the Praetorian Guard as the main catalyst of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus at the start of the empire. He cites repeated examples of the Praetorian Guard abusing their power with calamitous results, including numerous instances of imperial assassination and incessant demands for increased pay.\n\nIn Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon challenged Church history. He estimated far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been previously thought. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. For Gibbon, however, the Church writings were secondary sources. He shunned them in favour of primary sources from the period he was writing about. This is one reason why Gibbon is referred to as the \"first modern historian\".\n\nGibbon's main theory was that Christianity as a prime factor in the Empire's decline and fall. \n\nAnd, more generally:\n\nLater historians have mostly not agreed with Gibbon. Today, historians tend to analyze economic and military factors in the decline of Rome.\n\nGibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.\n\n", "id": "386385", "title": "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"}

The best example is the aldol reaction.\n\nEnols of ketones can be made on two different sides. It is important to be able to choose which side to react. The side with less substituents is the easiest one to react: it can be made at low temperature with a bulky base. This is called the kinetic enolate.

When atoms are put close to each other, this costs energy. The electrons near the atoms want to stay away from each other. This can change the way molecules want to react. It can also change the shape (or conformation) of the molecule. The amount of space that a group of atoms takes is called the \"steric bulk\".\n\nAn example of steric effects is steric hindrance. This is when a large group in a molecule makes reactions not work. For example, an S2 reaction does not happen on carbon atoms that have three substituents. Steric hindrance however can also be a positive thing. Sometimes, chemists would like a reaction to happen in one place rather than another one. A bulky group can block a position. It can also change the shape such that only one diastereomer from a reaction is made.\n\nSteric effects are usually smaller than electronic effects.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386652", "text": "Lake Mungo remains\n\nThe Lake Mungo remains are three sets of human fossils. They are Lake Mungo 1 (\"LM1\", or \"Mungo Lady\"), Lake Mungo 2 (\"LM2\"), and Lake Mungo 3 (\"LM3\", or \"Mungo Man\"). The sites are located near Lake Mungo, in New South Wales, Australia, in the World Heritage-listed Willandra Lakes Region. Pieces of skeletons have been found in this region. These pieces have been attributed to over forty human skeletons. The Lake Mungo remains are the most significant of these.\n\nLM1 was found in 1969, and is widely considered the oldest known cremation in the world. LM3, found in 1974, are the remains of an early human inhabitant of the Australian continent. His remains are the oldest human remains that have been found in Australia. The exact age of these two fossils has been debated since they were found, with studies giving estimates between 20,000 and 62,000 years. Both of them are now generally considered to have lived around 40,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch\n\nLM1 are the fossilised, cremated remains of a young woman. They were found in 1969 by James Bowler with the University of Melbourne. Radiocarbon dating of pieces of bone from the burial put LM1 between 24,700 and 19,030 years old. Charcoal from a hearth 15 cm above the burial was dated at 26,250 years old (plus or minus 1,120 years). Reconstruction and study of the remains was mainly done by Alan Thorne at the Australian National University. The patterns of burn marks on the bones suggest that the body was first burned, then smashed, then burned a second time, before being buried.\n\nResearch published by Bowler in 2003 rejected previous estimates for all of remains at the site. Optical dating concluded that both LM1 and LM3 were buried around 40,000 years ago (plus or minus 2,000 years). This makes it the earliest evidence of human cremation that has been found. It suggests that ancient indigenous Australians in this region had their own complicated burial rituals.\n\nThe bones were returned in 1992 to the area's traditional owners: the Paakantji (Barkindji), the Mathi Mathi and the Ngiyampaa. LM1 is now in a locked vault at the Mungo National Park visitor centre.\n\nLM3 was found by James Bowler on 26 February 1974, when shifting sand dunes exposed the remains. It is located 500 m east of the LM1 site. The body was covered with red ochre, in the earliest known example of such a complicated and artistic burial practice. Like the cremation of LM1, this indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought.\n\nThe skeleton was of a slender individual, quite different to the build of modern indigenous Australians. The skeleton was badly preserved: large pieces of the skull were missing, and most of the bones in the limbs were damaged. Usually, the gender of a skeleton is determined using the bones in the skull and the pelvis. The problem is that these bones are in a very bad state in LM3, or they are missing altogether; in other words, the \"normal\" method of gender determination cannot be used with LM3. Since LM3 was discovered, other features were studied; most of these studies agree that LM3 was probably a male.\n\nLM3 was buried lying on his back, with his hands joined together covering the groin. Some of the bones show evidence of osteoarthritis and eburnation, and the teeth are well worn. Based on this, it is likely that LM3 was quite old (around 50 years old) when he died. New studies show that, using the length of his limb bones, it is possible to estimate LM3's height at 196 centimetres (77 inches or 6 ft 5 in), unusually tall for an Aboriginal.\n\nThe first estimate of LM3's age was made in 1976 by the team of scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) who excavated LM3. They estimated that LM3 was between 28,000 and 32,000 years old. They did not test LM3's remains directly; instead, they made their estimate through stratigraphic comparison with LM1. In 1987, an electron spin resonance test was done on pieces of bone from LM3's skeleton. This gave an estimate of his age at 31,000 years, plus or minus 7,000 years. In 1999, optical dating work was done on quartz from the LM3 burial site. The results indicated a burial older than 24,600 years (± 2,400) and younger than 43,300 years (± 3,800).\n\nLater in the same year, research led by Alan Thorne gave a new estimate of 62,000 years old (plus or minus 6,000 years). This estimate was made by combining data from uranium-thorium dating, electron spin resonance dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of the remains and the soil in the grave. This estimate was very controversial, and some of the techniques used to get this estimate were criticised.\n\nIn 2003, several Australian groups came to an agreement that LM3 is about 40,000 years old. A team led by Bowler did 25 more OSL tests that suggested that LM3 can not be older than 50,000 years. This age roughly agrees with stratigraphic evidence using four different dating methods. The age of 40,000 years is now the most widely accepted age for the LM3. This makes it the second oldest human fossil east of India, and the oldest in Australia. In addition to this, the study published in 2003 found that LM1 and LM3 are similar in age, and that humans were present at Lake Mungo as early as 50,000 to 46,000 years ago.\n\nIn 1998, the remains of a child were discovered. These are believed to have roughly the same age as Mungo Man and Mungo Lady. In 2005, erosion exposed another adult skeleton. Because it was not protected, this skeleton was destroyed by wind and rain about a year later. \n\nThe main idea at the time is called Out of Africa hypothesis: It says that humans developed on the African continent, and spread from there. Another important site is called Kow Swamp, in the northern part of Victoria. It consists of about twenty skeletons, which are between 5,000 and 10,000 years old. The morphology of Mungo Man is noticeably different from these skeletons. For this reason, some researchers have said that Australia was probably settled twice. The settlers were probably descendants of Homo erectus and came from the Asian mainland. This theory is based on the analysis of Mitochondrial DNA. If this is true, the two lines, that of Mungo Man and that of modern humans, separated a very long time ago. This would also mean that Mitochondrial Eve of this line and that of modern humans would be older than Mitochondrial Eve of all living humans.\n\n", "id": "386652", "title": "Lake Mungo remains"}

A person can lose weight by running, swimming or doing any other activity. Also, a person might eat a healthier diet to lose weight. There are many diet and exercises programs available to lose weight. Many people lose weight when they eat less sugar and more vegetables, fruits and lean meat.\n\n\nIn many countries weight loss is caused by sociological pressure mostly on woman to have slim and fit figure.\nUnintentional weight loss is when a person loses weight without trying. It can be a symptom of some types of cancer. Stress can cause unintentional weight loss. Stress can come from divorce, changing jobs or over the loss of a loved one. Once the stress is removed and the person feels happier again, the weight may return to normal. Depression may also cause weight loss. Eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia can cause significant weight loss. These disorders usually require the help of health care professionals.\n\nGetting enough sleep helps to avoid gaining excess weight. Over time, getting more sleep can help a person to lose weight. The main reason is not getting enough sleep leaves a person tired during the day and prone to eating more food. Getting enough sleep helps in maintaining healthy eating habits.\n\nWithout going to the bathroom, a person naturally loses over while they sleep at night. One reason is humans breathe in oxygen but breathes out carbon dioxide. That is breathing in one molecule of Oxygen for every two molecules of carbon each time they breathe out. A molecule of carbon does not weigh much by itself, but given that with each breath twenty billion-trillion molecules are expelled, over a 7-8 hour period that adds up to over a pound of carbon. Normal perspiration occurs while sleeping but usually only causes a small amount of water weight loss. \n\nYour body also burns calories while you sleep.\n\nIt is well known that lean mass (muscle and bone) burn more energy than fat. Even at rest, a body with more muscle tissue will burn more calories.\n\nExercise alone can be effective in weight loss. Several studies found similar results. The comparison between dieting and exercising found both resulted in weight loss. The conclusion was that using both diet and exercise together was the most effective method of weight loss and in maintaining a healthy body.\n", "id": "386754", "title": "Weight loss"}

However, there are many ideas about the interpretations and meanings of quantum mechanics. There are no facts to prove any interpretation over the others, but there are some that are more accepted than others.\n\n\"Main article: Quantum mechanics\"\n\nThe main ideas of quantum mechanics are the postulates of Schrödinger and Heisenberg. The Schrödinger equation is a partial differential equation that describes the wavefunction of an object. The equation can be given by\n\nformula_1\n\nThe basic meaning of this equation is that a particle, such as an electron, is not \"just\" a point-like particle, but also a type of wave. The philosophical implications will be explored shortly. Another fundamental of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This bizarre theory is the idea that the position and the momentum of an object cannot both be known. The greater the certainty of the \"position\" of an object, the less the certainty of the \"momentum\" of the object. The mathematical formulation of this is given by\n\nformula_2\n\nThis can further be generalized by stating that\n\nformula_3\n\nWhere formula_4 is the operator of formula_5 and formula_6. This law also gives rise to an uncertainty between energy and time, which can be expressed in the same way as the relation between momentum and position.\n\nAnother important fact of quantum mechanics is that the electron behaves in a very weird way. At first, no one really knew what the wavefunction meant physically. Max Born, a theoretical physicist, explained that the wavefunction is a \"probability wave.\" In other words, wherever the wave is denser, that is where the particle is most likely found, but it won't necessarily be found there. The way to find the probability \n(formula_7) of the position of the particle in the region formula_8\n\nFor example, if formula_7 is equal to .5, then there is a 50% chance of finding the particle within that region. This shows us that the location of a particle probabilistic; one can never say that the particle will \"definitely\" be found at a certain point in space, but rather, one can only give the probability of finding the particle within that region. \n\nThe most well-accepted interpretation of quantum mechanics is the idea called Copenhagen interpretation. This interpretation builds upon the probability-wave notion, but brings in a radical new idea called the superposition principle. The best way to explain this principle is by showing it mathematically. If the functions formula_10 are solutions of the Schrödinger equation, then the superposition of those wavefunctions is also a solution. i.e.,\n\nformula_11 \n\nWhere formula_12 is the superposition of the various wavefunctions. This idea implies that a particle occupies every possible wavefunction it can. This implies that a particle occupies more than one position \"at the same time.\" In other words, a particle exists in at least two different positions simultaneously. When an observer comes and actually measures the position of the particle, something called the wavefunction collapse occurs. So when someone observes the particle, the following happens:\n\nformula_13→formula_14\n\nIn simple terms: when there is no observation or observer, then a particle occupies many positions simultaneously; when an observation takes place, the wavefunction collapses and the particle exists only in one position. \n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is by far the most fantastic interpretation of quantum mechanics. This interpretation says that rather than the wavefunction collapsing, each possibility actually occurs, but in separate universes. This means that the universes branch off for each possibility. \n\nThe interpretation presented by Albert Einstein himself, states that the outcome of some random event is predetermined. So, rather than a particle existing as a probability wave, this interpretation says that the particle only exists only in one position, but we just perceive it to be a probability. This idea is much less popular, but nonetheless mentionable.\n\nSo, of the three main interpretations of quantum mechanics, which one is correct? Physicists seem to think that the Copenhagen interpretation is the most likely, but no one is for sure.\n", "id": "386898", "title": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics"}

This depends on the amount of melanin in the iris. The appearance of blue, green and hazel eyes result from the Rayleigh scattering of light in the iris. A similar process accounts for the blueness of the sky. Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the human iris or fluid. Eye colour is an example of structural colour which varies according to the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-coloured eyes.\n\nThe brightly coloured eyes of many birds, reptiles and insects is caused by other pigments, such as pteridines, purines, and carotenoids. \n\nThe view that blue eye colour is a simple recessive trait is incorrect. Two main gene loci code for the eye pigment: \"OCA2\" and \"HERC2\". They sit next to each other on chromosome 15. Mutations (SNPs) to these genes account for much of the variation seen in eye colour. \"OCA2\" mutations close to the 5′ regulatory region explain most human eye-color variation. An intron in \"HERC2\" contains the promoter region for \"OCA2\", affecting its expression. \n\nThere are about 15 other genes which have some effect on eye colour inheritance.

It was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was published in Vienna, Austria by Artaria in 1784. It is the second of a group of three piano sonatas. Mozart probably wrote the group in Salzburg in the summer of 1783. It was then that he brought his wife Constance (Weber) to his hometown to introduce her to his father Leopold. The first sonata in the group is No. 10 in C major, K. 330. The third is No. 12 in F major, K. 332. Mozart numbered this group of sonatas 1 through 3. He spent much time teaching during his early years in Vienna. It is likely that these sonatas were written for his pupils. \n\nThe A major sonata is unique among Mozart's piano sonatas. It does not include a movement in sonata form. The first movement is a lilting theme in 6/8 followed by six variations in A major and A minor. The last variation is in 4/4 time. The second movement is a Menuetto in A major with a contrasting section (called a Trio) in D major. It is written in 3/4 time. The third and final movement is the famous \"Alla Turca\" (\"Turkish Rondo\") in 2/4 time. It is considered one of the finest examples of Viennese Turkish music that was produced in the late 18th century. The rondo's rolled block bass chords suggest the drum rolls of a Turkish Janissary band. In true classical style, the rondo alternates between major and minor keys, and loud and soft dynamics. The piece is a favorite for amateur recitals.\n", "id": "387127", "title": "Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)"}

It is found in many animals. It occurs in birds, some dinosaurs, and invertebrate animals such as gastropods (snails and slugs), earthworms, leeches, and insects.\n\nIn a bird's digestive system, the crop is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. It is a part of the digestive tract, essentially an enlarged part of the oesophagus. As with most other organisms that have a crop, the crop is used to temporarily store food. Not all birds have a crop. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds.\n\nScavenging birds, such as vultures, will gorge themselves when prey is abundant, causing their crop to bulge. They subsequently sit, sleepy or half torpid, to digest their food.\n\nMost raptors, including hawks, eagles and vultures (as stated above), have a crop; however, owls do not. \n\nCropping is used by bees to temporarily store nectar of flowers. When bees \"suck\" nectar, it is stored in their crops.\n\nIn a gizzard, the food is ground down before digestion, usually by stones. Gizzards have a tougher lining, and muscles. The gizzard is lower down the digestive tract, and more like a part of the stomach.\n\nThe crop is just a storage device. Often, it pays a bird to feed while the going is good, and do the digestion later. In many birds and in bees, the food is eventually brought back to the nest and given to family members. \n\nIn other species, food brought back to the nest is pre-digested. That would mean it is regurgitated (brought up) from the stomach.\n\n", "id": "387211", "title": "Crop (anatomy)"}

It is a legal agreement through which an insurance company agrees to make regular payments to a specific individual over a period of time.\n\nStructured settlements created as a way for insurance companies to payout settlements in installments as opposed to large lump sums. Structured settlements may benefit injured people whose settlements might result in their owing taxes, by allowing them to reduce or delay tax payments. They may also benefit younger people or disabled people by providing periodic payments of money over an extended period of time.\n\nStructured settlements require the paper holder (a name for the person who receives payments from the settlement) to wait before they will get money, by spreading payments over a number of years. However there are companies offering to buy such a structured settlement for upfront money. For example, a company might offer to buy a settlement that would be paid in 20 yearly payments for a one-time payment of lower value. Such financing may need to be approved by judge and the insurance company.\n\nIn the United States, the sale of a structured settlement may result in tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code.\n", "id": "387334", "title": "Structured settlement"}

Term insurance is the cheapest way of buying live insurance.\n\nTerm life insurance is the original form of life insurance and is different to permanent insurance because its rates wont go up, and there is fixed term contract which will end in future. Permanent life insurances contract can be until death of insured person but the rates will slowly go up every some period of time.\n\nBecause term life insurance is only death insurance, it is used to cover the mortgages reliability (guarantee that bank will receive their money), payment to the families (upon death of insured person his family will usually receive repayment for funeral cost and in some cases will get some money), repayment of debts.\n\nThe simplest form of term life insurance is contract for one year. The death benefit will be paid if insured will die. If he will not die during this year there will be no benefit paid off and new contract will be created.\n\nTerm life insurance is the most affordable type of life insurance because it is temporary and builds no cash value inside the policy over time.

The tale was first published on 7 April 1837 with \"The Little Mermaid\" in the third and final installment of Andersen's \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\". It was published in Copenhagen, Denmark by C. A. Reitzel. The story is based on one from the \"Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio|Libro de los ejemplos\" (or \"El Conde Lucanor\", 1335) by Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena (1282–1348). This book was a medieval Spanish collection of fifty-one cautionary tales with various sources such as Aesop and other classical writers and Persian folktales. Andersen did not know the Spanish original, but read the tale in a German translation titled \"So ist der Lauf der Welt\". In the source tale, a king is hoodwinked by weavers who claim to make a suit of clothes invisible to any man not the son of his presumed father. Andersen altered the source tale to direct the focus on courtly pride and intellectual vanity rather than adulterous paternity.\n\nAndersen's manuscript was at the printer’s when he suddenly changed the original climax of the tale from the emperor’s subjects admiring his invisible clothes to that of the child's cry. Andersen’s decision to change the ending may have occurred after he read the manuscript tale to a child, or had its source in a childhood incident similar to that in the tale. In 1872, he recalled standing in a crowd with his mother waiting to see King Frederick VI. When the king made his appearance, Andersen cried out, \"Oh, he’s nothing but a human being!\" His mother tried to silence him by crying, \"Have you gone mad, child?\". Whatever the reason, Andersen thought the change would prove more satirical.\n\nThe story tells of an Emperor who cares for nothing but new clothes. He hires two swindlers who promise him the finest suit of clothes. It will be made from a fabric invisible to anyone who is unfit for his position or \"hopelessly stupid\". The Emperor's ministers cannot see the clothing, but pretend that they can for fear of appearing unfit for their positions. The Emperor does the same. Finally the swindlers report that the suit is finished. They pretend to dress Emperor. He marches in procession before his subjects. The townsfolk play along with the pretense. Then a child in the crowd cries out that the Emperor is wearing nothing at all. The cry is taken up by others. The Emperor cringes, but holds his head high and continues the procession.\n\n\n", "id": "387392", "title": "The Emperor's New Clothes"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387394", "text": "Shabbat\n\nShabbat is the name of the day of rest in Judaism. Shabbat happens on the seventh day (Saturday) of every week. In Judaism, the day is defined with the cycle of the sun: The day begins and ends at sunset, not midnight. So the seventh day of the week, Shabbat, begins Friday when the sun goes down, and ends Saturday night after it gets dark. The idea of Shabbat comes from the Bible's story of Creation. In that story, God creates the Universe and everything on Earth for six days. On the seventh day, He stops work. In the same way, Jews work on the first six days of the week and rest on the seventh day, Shabbat. \n\nThe word \"Shabbat\" began as a Hebrew word (). The English word \"Sabbath\" comes from the word \"Shabbat\". The English word can also be used to refer to Shabbat. The Christian idea of Sabbath came from the Jewish idea of Shabbat. Now, there are many differences between them. \n\nThe first part of the Jewish Bible, the Torah, says that work is not allowed on Shabbat. It is a day to rest and study the Torah. \n\nIn Jewish law, Shabbat is the most important Jewish holiday. It is even more important than Passover, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Jewish mystics say that the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world. In this world, everyone knows about God and loves him. They believe that kind of world has not been seen since the Garden of Eden, and will not be seen again until the Messiah comes.\n\nThere are two versions of the Ten Commandments in the Bible. These versions use different words. The version in Exodus says \"Remember Shabbat to keep it holy.\" The version in Deuteronomy says \"Guard Shabbat to keep it holy.\" Jewish custom says that \"remember\" means to \"celebrate\" Shabbat. \"Guard\" means \"resting\"—not working or doing business.\n\nShabbat is a happy day. There are many ceremonies of Shabbat that help people celebrate the happiness of the day.\n\n\nEnjoying Shabbat is very important, but Shabbat is a holy day. There are laws and rules in the Torah, the Mishnah and the Talmud about what Jews may and may not do on Shabbat. These laws help Jews keep Shabbat as a holy day.\n\n\nConservative Judaism also teaches Jews not to do activities in the 39 prohibited categories of work \"(melacha).\" Conservative rabbis are often less strict about what is \"melacha\" than Orthodox rabbis are. Conservative rabbis are almost always less strict about what is a prevention \"(shevut)\" than Orthodox rabbis. For example, Conservative rabbis allow Jews to use electricity on Shabbat for many purposes. They do not allow Jews to use electricity to do any of the 39 prohibited categories of work. \n\nMany, if not most, \"lay members\" (not rabbis or prayer leaders) of Conservative synagogues in North America do not follow these laws. Progressive Judaism, including Reform Judaism, does not accept Jewish law as binding. These Jews may rest on Shabbat, but are not usually strict about not doing \"melacha\" or \"shevut.\" They may even add practices not allowed under Orthodox Jewish law that they think improves their celebration of Shabbat. For example, they may drive to synagogue on Shabbat, or may use musical instruments on Shabbat. Orthodox Judaism does not allow either of those actions on Shabbat.\n\nShabbat ends after dark on Saturday night. The end of Shabbat is marked by a ceremony called \"Havdalah\" (). This is a Hebrew word meaning \"division\" or \"separation\". The ceremony \"divides\" or \"separates\" the holy day of Shabbat from the new week. The \"Havdalah\" blessings are spoken over a cup of wine. The \"Havdalah\" ceremony also uses spices with a nice smell and a candle with many \"wicks\" (cloth strings for lighting). After \"Havdalah\", people start doing regular weekday things again.\n\n\"Note 1.\" Sources here may not be in Simple English.<br>\n\"Note 2.\" Some Bible sources below include a Simple English version of the Jewish Publication Society's 1917 English translation.

Norman French came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used with it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327–1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422–61, 1470–71). Royal Assent was sometimes given in English, though more often in French. The practice of recording Parliamentary statutes in French or Latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since.\n\nDuring the period of the the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to remove it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 \"for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice.\" The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was later abolished in 1731, Parliament's practice was not affected.\n\nThe line is used to show that the Monarch has granted their Royal Assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor with the Lords Commissioners, has read out the Letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliament responds by saying the line 19 times towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House. The line is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the Monarch granted Royal Assent to the bill.\n\nThe line has been used wrongly on other bills, same as the wrong line has also been used for government bills. There are a few occasions where this has happened, most notably on the Act of Supremacy 1558 where \"\"Soit fait comme il est désiré\"\", the line used for personal bills, was used instead of \"\"La Reyne le veult\"\".\n\nIf the Royal Assent is refused, the line \"\"La Reyne / Le Roy s'avisera\"\" would be used, though in practice no British monarch since Queen Anne has not given royal assent since a dispute over militia in Scotland in 1707.\n", "id": "387517", "title": "La Reyne le veult"}

It was based on the \"Scrabble\" board game. It was hosted by Chuck Woolery.\n\nTwo players competed. At the start, a computer image of the \"Scrabble\" board was shown. A letter would be given in the center space. The host told the players the number of letters in the word, and then read a clue to the word. The player would take two numbered tiles. These tiles were placed in a slot, giving the player two letters. The player would then choose a letter to place in the word. If the letter was in the word, it was placed into the word. The player then made a guess to the word or placed the other tile. If the player could not guess the word after placing the tile, they took two more tiles. Play continued until the player guessed the word (done by the player hitting their buzzer) or there was only one letter left in the word. If a correct guess was made, the player won the word. If an incorrect guess was made, play passed to the other player. Three words won the game. Two games were played with two different players.\n\nThree of the letters were \"Stoppers,\" a letter that was not in the word. If one of those letters were chosen, the player lost their turn.\n\nSome of the letters were placed into blue and pink squares. If the player guessed the word after placing a letter into one of these squares, they won a bonus. A blue square was worth $500, while a pink square was worth $1,000.\n\nIf all three stoppers were chosen, there was a 2-2 tie, or time was running short, Speedword was played. In Speedword, each letter in the word was revealed one at a time. The first player to buzz in with a correct guess won the word.\n\nThe two winning players of the main game played in the Scrabble Sprint. Here, the winners of the two games competed to guess four words in the fastest time. The four words were six, seven, eight, and nine letters long. The winner of the first game played first. For each word, the player was told the number of letters in the word, and then was given a clue. When the host said to start, the clock started counting up. The player was given two letters, and selected one to place in the word. When the player wanted to guess the word, they hit a buzzer and made their guess. If correct, they moved on to the next word. If incorrect, ten seconds was added to their time, and they had to play another word of the same length. Once the player guessed all four words, the clock stopped. This set the time for the second player to beat.\n\nThe second player played with the same four words. This time around, the clock counted down. If the second player got all four words within this time, the player won. If not, the first player won.\n\nThe winner of the Scrabble Sprint moved on to the Bonus Sprint. Here, the player had to get two words within ten seconds. The rules were the same as the Scrabble Sprint. If the player got both words, they won a jackpot that started at $5,000 and increased by $1,000 each day that it was not won.\n\n\"Scrabble\" aired from 1984 to 1990 on NBC.

This shows that the sequences has been maintained in evolution despite speciation. The further back up the phylogenetic tree a particular conserved sequence occurs, the more highly conserved it is. Since sequence information is normally transmitted from parents to progeny by genes, a conserved sequence implies that there is a conserved gene.\n\nConservation of a sequence happens when mutations in a highly conserved region lead to non-viable life forms, that is, a form which is eliminated through natural selection. In other words, the product of the gene is vital to life, and its function is destroyed by almost all changes (mutations) to the sequence.\n\nThe basic theory, widely agreed, is that highly conserved DNA sequences must have functional value, though the role for many of these highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences is not known. One recent study that eliminated four highly conserved non-coding DNA sequences in mice yielded viable mice with no significant phenotypic differences; the authors described their findings as \"unexpected\". So there is clearly something here which is not understood.\n\nMany regions of the DNA, including highly conserved DNA sequences, consist of repeated sequence elements. If only one of a set of a repeated sequences was removed, and the repetitions were not needed, then no difference would be seen in the mice. The paper did not report whether the eliminated sequences were repeated sequences.\n\nHighly conserved proteins are often required for cells to work or divide. Conservation of protein sequences is shown by the presence of identical amino acid residues at analogous parts of proteins. Conservation of protein structures is indicated by the presence of functionally equivalent, though not necessarily identical, amino acid residues and structures between analogous parts of proteins.\n\nShown below is an amino acid sequence alignment between two human zinc finger proteins. Conserved amino acid sequences are marked by strings of formula_1 on the third line of the sequence alignment. As can be seen from this alignment, these two proteins contain a number of conserved amino acid sequences (represented by identical letters aligned between the two sequences).\nThe research field which studies the evolution and function of multigene families is called comparative genomics.\n", "id": "387607", "title": "Conserved sequence"}

Looking back at this era, Michael Cuscuna of Mosaic Records said, “ What John Hermansader and Paul Bacon really did was evoke the feeling of the music. They used everything from Bauhaus designs to things that were really otherworldly.” Angelynn Grant adds, “When people think of Blue Note covers they think of Frank Wolff”s photography and Reid Miles design. But John Hermansader laid the groundwork that got them going along that path.” Richard Cook, who wrote Blue Note Records: The Biography states, “Hermansader in particular balanced the twin issues of photography and type in a way that would mirror the concerns of the Blue Note of the years ahead.”\n\n“John Hermansader was passionate about oil painting, “beautiful lyrical abstractions, full of color and movement.”5 He was an abstract expressionist painter who drew inspiration for his work from listening to jazz.”\nHis exhibitions included and the Gallery of Contemporary Art at Sunken Meadow, Long Island, 1951–58, Panoras Gallery 1956, Art USA 1958.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387944", "text": "A* search algorithm\n\nA* is a set of steps (an algorithm) that computers can use to figure out how to get somewhere fast between two places. If you have a list of locations, and how hard it is to get from one straight to the other, using A* can quickly tell you the fastest way. It's related to Dijkstra's algorithm, but makes smart guesses so that it doesn't spend as long trying slow ways. It's a good series of steps if you only want the path between two places. If you're going to ask for many paths from the same map, then there are faster ways, that find all the answers at once, like the Floyd–Warshall algorithm. A* will not work if you want to visit several places on one trip (the Travelling salesman problem).\n\nA* first needs a list of all the places you can go to, and then it needs a list of how far the road is between each one. It will then tell you the fastest way to get from place A to place Z.\n\nFor an example, we'll say A is connected to places B and C, and B and C are both connected to D and E. D and E are both connected to Z. There are 4 possible ways to go from A to Z. You can go A-B-D-Z, A-C-D-Z, A-B-E-Z, or A-C-E-Z. A computer using A* first looks at how hard it is to get from A to B, and from A to C. This is the \"cost\" for those places. The cost of a place means how hard it is to get from A to that place. After writing down both costs, the computer looks at how hard it is to get from B to D, and adds this to B's cost. It writes this down as D's cost. Then the computer looks at how hard it is to get from C to D, and adds this to C's cost. This is a different cost for D, and if it's less than the one it already has, it will replace the old one. The computer only wants to know the best path, so it ignores the path with the higher cost. It will only remember one of A-B-D and A-C-D, whichever is faster.\n\nThe computer goes on and finds the fastest way to get to E. Finally, it goes from D to Z, and finds a cost, and from E to Z and finds a cost. It gets a final cost for Z, and this is the smallest cost it can get. Now the computer knows which way is the fastest, and it has the answer. The computer can do a similar series of steps, but with many many more places. Each time, it will look at the place that's nearest to A, and will add up the costs to that place's neighbors.\n\nPeople call the above series of steps Djikstra's algorithm. Djikstra's algorithm can be slow, because it will look at many places that might be going the wrong way from Z. If you asked the computer how to get from one city to a near one, Djikstra's algorithm might end up looking in another state.\n\nA* fixes this problem. A* lets you tell the computer a guess for how far it will be from each place to the end. The computer can use the guess to tell roughly how far it will take to get from a certain place to Z. Instead of just picking the place nearest to A to look at, it will look at the one which is probably going to have the lowest total. It finds this total by adding the cost to the expected distance left. This way, it can look only in the direction where things will probably get better. It's okay if the guess is not perfect, but even a simple bad guess can make the program go a lot faster. If you're trying to find a path between two places in the real world, a good guess is just the distance between them in a straight line. The real path over roads will be longer, but this lets the program guess it, and it won't go in the wrong direction.\n\nIn math or computer science literature, this guess is often a function of the place, and it is called a heuristic. Each place is a vertex, and each path between two places is an edge. These are words from graph theory.\n\nA* is one algorithm in a big group of similar algorithms. These algorithms are all different ways of finding a path between two places, over certain paths between them. They are called path-finding algorithms. \"Places\" and \"paths\" aren't always real places, though. They can be abstract, and they can be a metaphor for something else. One example where it is a real place is trying to find a road trip on Google Maps or Mapquest. In this example, the paths are roads, and the places are houses or cities. A second example is sending information over the Internet. The information needs to go through many computers to get to the end. Many routers use A* to find the best way to send information across the Internet. Here, the paths are cables, and the places are computers. For a third example, where it's not literal, you want to make a certain chemical from the ingredients you have. Mixing some of these ingredients will produce new chemicals, and those can be mixed with each other. A path-finding algorithm could tell you which order to mix them in. Here, the paths are chemical reactions, the cost is how long the reaction takes to finish, and the places are the different chemicals you can make.\n", "id": "387944", "title": "A* search algorithm"}

It is the largest airport in the world in terms of area.\n\nThe airport is an airline hub for the national carrier, Saudia. \n\nDesign started in 1976. The site master plan was created by architecture company Yamasaki & Associates and Boeing Aerosystems International. This plan was completed in 1977. Construction began in 1983. The airport opened for commercial operations in November 1999.\n\nThe airport's basic infrastructure was complete by the end of 1990. The General Authority of Civil Aviation of Saudi Arabia finally opened the new Dammam King Fahd International Airport on November 28, 1999 to commercial traffic. All airlines transferred their operations from Dhahran International Airport, which had been in use until then.\n\nKFIA is northwest of Dammam. The airport serves the entire Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia and the growing urban complex made up of Dammam, Dhahran, Al Khobar, Qatif, Ras Tanura and Jubail with total population of about 2 million.\n\nThe airport, in the Eastern Province of the country, is located between Qatif and Dammam, about away from Dammam. It is linked to population areas by two major roads. The northern exit links the airport with Qatif as a 4-lane highway. The southern exit links the Airport with Dammam as a 6-lane highway to King Fahd Road which is now considered as the main road to the airport. Abu Hadriyah Highway, serves as the airport's eastern border while Dammam-Riyadh Highway serves as a southern border.\n\nOn the airport's southern border, Saudi Aramco occupies an area of 250 km² (97 mi²) which is used for oil drilling and transportation facilities.\n\nThe terminal has six stories, three of which are allocated for passenger processing. The third level is for arrivals, the sixth level is for departures, and the fourth level is for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine level (which is the uppermost level).\n\nThe passenger terminal’s total area is 327,000 m² (3,519,798 ft²). Approximately 247,500 m² (2,664,067 ft²) were built in the first phase, in addition to 11 fixed passenger boarding bridges serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 fixed boarding bridges.\n\nThe terminal has several customer counters of which 66 were allocated to Saudia (now shared with Nas Air), 44 to foreign airlines and the rest for Customs and Immigration.\n\nThe airport has several duty-free stores. In addition to the spaces allocated to duty-free stores, the airport has a separate area for shops specializing in the sale of gifts and all passenger related goods. This area includes restaurants, cafeterias, and banks, and is located on the arrivals level. Several ATMs and currency exchange shops are available in the departure and arrival areas. The airport is served by a multi-storey car park.\n\nSmoking is not allowed in the airport. A fine of SR200 is collected breaking the rule. The airport has a smoking room in the Departure area.\n\nThe airport Mosque is built on the roof of the car park, in the middle of a landscaped area of 46,200 m² (497,292 ft²). The Mosque accommodates two thousand worshipers, access to it can be easily gained from the passenger terminal through two enclosed, air-conditioned bridges with moving belts, in addition to a third open bridge.\n\nThe Royal Terminal is reserved for the Saudi Royal Family, government , and official guests. The terminal was built on an area of 16,400 m² (176,528 ft²) and has four bridges connecting the terminal and aircraft. It is luxuriously furnished and decorated, and includes extensively landscaped exteriors and grounds. Despite its specialized purpose, the terminal is rarely used by the Royal Family, who generally prefer to utilize a similar special terminal at King Abdulaziz Air Base.\n\nThe airport has two parallel runways with a length of each, in addition to taxiways parallel to the runways and a cross taxiway to connect the two runways. A distance of separates the two runways to facilitate simultaneous takeoff and landing operations. For more convenience and shorter taxiing durations, the east runway is usually used by Saudi Aramco while commercial airlines use the west one, however situation changes if one of the runways is undergoing maintenance. Space has been set aside for the construction of a third parallel runway.\n\nThe airport is classified as Code E by ICAO which makes it designed to accommodate large aircraft lke Boeing 747-400 and A340-600. Although it may practically be possible for A380 to use the airport it is not recommended as in order to accommodate such aircraft as Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8 it requires the airport to be Code F. Only the runways at Dammam Airport meet Code F requirements; the taxiways and gates do not. In May 2009, an Antonov 225 the world's largest aircraft landed at Dammam Airport from Ukraine whilst transporting equipment used for oil drilling and exploration to Tanzania for Schlumberger.\n\nA road for ground support equipment (GSE) runs along the western side of the central terminal. It is designed to allow GSE to have access to aircraft and also to facilitate the movement of baggage vehicles from aircraft to baggage areas.\n\nThere are ten main Operations Services areas providing facilities for the operation of the airport.\n\nThe two-story air cargo building is constructed on an area of 39,500 m² (425,174 ft²) and has a capacity of 94,000 metric tons (103,617 tons) of incoming and outgoing cargo.\n\nThe terminal’s design allows for transforming the operation system to a fully automatic system with multi-level racks and a container stacking system. When the air cargo facility becomes fully automatic, its capacity will be increased to 176,000 metric tons (194,007 tons) per year.\n\nThe control tower stands 85.5 meters (281 feet) high, equivalent to the height of a 30-story building. The height allows visibility of all parts of the airport operations area. Its total floor area is 7,960 m² (85,681 ft²), and it contains the following three main sections:\n\nThe total area of the car park is 176,752 m² (1,902,543 ft²), distributed among three covered floors. The parking area accommodates 4,930 cars. Cars enter the car park through a roadway that leads to the second floor. There is direct access to the passenger terminal from the parking on the first floor which lies under the access road with exits leading to the main roads. Parking charges are 1 Saudi Riyal per hour, which is a flat rate regardless how long you stay. There are no special long term parking rates.\n\nTwo open parking areas are available beside the rental car parking area to accommodate additional cars.\n\nSaudi Aramco is responsible for supplying fuel and maintaining fuel installations. These include six large tanks with a capacity of 40,000 barrels each, in addition to pumping equipment, filters, loading stations, and the distribution valve network. Saudi Aramco operates regular flights for its personnel, which originate from Dammam to cover Haradh, Tanajib, Shaybah, Hawtah, Al Ahsa, Khurais, Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu, using Boeing 737 and Dash-8 equipment.\n\nThe General Aviation terminal on the east side of Dammam airport is being used exclusively by Saudi Aramco. In addition, an advanced fleet of fuel tankers provides fuel services to all types of commercial aircraft.\n\nThis building is a 17,287 m² (186,075 ft²), single-story in-flight catering facility, capable of producing 8,000 aircraft meals a day plus 1,000 meals for staff and 300 for the Royal Pavilion kitchen.\n\nKing Fahd International Airport has its own plant nursery with a total area of which encompasses three green houses and of green fields.

Completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his student, Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, it is one of Beethoven's most popular musical compositions for the piano.\n\nThe first edition of the score has \"Sonata quasi una fantasia\" written as the heading, a title this work shares with its companion piece, Op. 27, No. 1. Grove Music Online translates the Italian title as \"sonata in the manner of a fantasy\".\n\nThe name \"Moonlight Sonata\" started to become in use after the comments made by German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab about what the music reminded him of. In 1832, five years after Beethoven's death, Rellstab imagined the effect of the first movement like a moonlight shining above Lake Lucerne. Many agreed to this idea, and within ten years, the name \"Moonlight Sonata\" (\"\"Mondscheinsonate\"\" in German) was being used in German and English publications. Later in the 19th century, it could be said that the sonata was \"universally known\" by that name.\n\nMany critics have disagreed to the subjective, Romantic nature of the title \"Moonlight\", which has often been called \"a misleading approach to a movement with almost the character of a funeral march\" and \"absurd\". Other critics have approved of the nickname, finding it memorable or similar to their own connections with the work. \"Gramophone\" founder Compton Mackenzie found the title \"harmless\", saying that \"it is silly for austure critics to work themselves up into a state of almost hysterical rage with poor Rellstab\", and adding, \"what these austere critics fail to grasp is that unless the general public had responded to the suggestion of moonlight in this music Rellstab's remark would long ago have been forgotten.\"\n\nAlthough there is no direct reason as to why Beethoven decided to title both the Op. 27 works as \"Sonata quasi una fantasia\", it may be important that the layout of the present work does not follow the traditional movement arrangement in the Classical period of fast-slow-[fast]-fast. Instead, the sonata has an end-weighted path, with the faster more technically complex music saved until the third movement. In his analysis, German critic Paul Bekker says that \"The opening sonata-allegro movement gave the work a definite character from the beginning... which succeeding movements could supplement but not change. Beethoven rebelled against this determinative quality in the first movement. He wanted a prelude, an introduction, not a proposition.”\n\nThe sonata consists of three movements:\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "388031", "title": "Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)"}

On 29 November 2014, at the Victorian state election, the Coalition was defeated by Labor and Napthine conceded defeat and his term as Premier ended on 4 December 2014 when the new Labor government was sworn in and he resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded in the Liberal leadership by Matthew Guy.\n\nOne of Napthine's ancestors is the renowned convict, Joseph Potaski.

It has a population of 521,273 (2004 census). Each summer the Saudi Government moves from the heat of Riyadh to Ta'if. The city is the centre of an agricultural area known for its grapes, roses and honey.\n\nThe inhabitants of Ta'if, are largely made up of the Saudis. There are also significant foreigners from Asia, Turkey, and other Arab countries.\n\nIn the 6th century the city of Tā'if was ruled by the Banu Thaqif tribe.\n\nThe town is about southeast of Mecca. The walled city was a pagan religious centre. It housed the idol of the goddess al-lāt, who was then known as \"the lady of Tā'if.\" Its climate was different from its dry and barren areas closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines, and fruit were grown around Tā'if. The city earned its title \"the Garden of the Hejaz.\"\n\nBoth Ta'if and Mecca were resorts of pilgrimage. The people of Ta'if had close trade relations with the people of Mecca. The people of Ta'if carried on agriculture and fruit‑growing in addition to their trade activities.\n\nDuring the Year of the Elephant, the city was involved in several events.\n\nIn 630, the Battle of Hunayn took place at Hunayn, close to this city. Shortly after that, the failed Siege of Ta'if took place. The city was attacked by Banu Daws, but it survived and repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabouk in 631 left Tā'if completely saperated from the other ares so members of Thaqīf arrived in Mecca to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of al-lāt and other signs of the city's previously pagan past were destroyed.\n\nOn 17 July 1517 the Sharif of Mecca gave away Ta'if to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hejaz, Ta'if was also given over to Ottoman control.\nThe city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802 it was retaken by Saudi revolt, who were in alliance with the House of Saud. These forces then continued to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the Holy Cities. The Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, called upon his nominal Viceroy in Egypt Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta'if in 1813.\n\nIn 1813, the Swiss traveller and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Ta'if. He has left an eyewitness account on the city just after it was taken back by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. According to Burckhardt, the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only thick. The castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib. He also noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there and the tomb of Abdullah ibn Abbas – cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the Abbasid Caliphate – had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly Thaqīf. In terms of trade, the city was an trading post for coffee.\n\nThe castle and military barracks in Ta'if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a \"Hükümet Konağı\" – mansion for government business – was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.\n\nPrior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in Tā'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. The city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, was sent with seventy men to Tā'if. While his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by a so small force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite attacks on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to Tā'if, and then the city held out a little longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.\n\nTa'if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long time. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, Sultan of Nejd, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities were temporarily patched up in 1919, by September 1924 the then Saudi-sponsored Ikhwan under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai was ready to attack Ta'if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king's son, Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. 300 of them were slain by the Ikhwan. In 1926 Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new king of Hejaz. Ta'if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms into one under the title of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. The king himself was later to die in the city on 9 November 1953.\n\nTa'if was still little more than a medieval city when the Saudis took control of it. However, they later stared to modernize the city. Saudi Arabia's first public power generator was set up in Ta'if in the late 1940s. In terms of building roads to the city, in 1965 the then King Faisal inaugurated the mountain highway between Mecca and Ta'if, and in 1974 the 400 mile Ta'if-Abha-Jizan highway was started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaif has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\"), with hot summers and mild winters. Temperatures are not as hot in summer as for lower-lying regions of Saudi Arabia. Rain is low, but all months see some rain, with more rain in spring and late autumn than in other months.\n\nBani Hareth is one of the Adnani Arabs tribes living around Taif in Saudi Arabia.

Pediatric bipolar disorder is far more acute in children and youth than in the adult population, with diagnoses at very early age. In children or teens, mania often has serious psychotic troubles with mixed mania and depression episodes which are worse and for more erratic times than in adults. Certain medications for this condition may have strong side effects for those under 18. Most bipolar children have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n", "id": "388137", "title": "Bipolar disorder in children"}

Leaves are simple, opposite or whorled, with 3 to 9 major veins coming from the base.\n\nThe fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals. Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are poisonous; in some species, mainly those from New Zealand, the petals that protect the true fruits can be eaten. Several species of this genus can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria of genus \"Frankia\" in their roots.\n\nThe name of the genus \"Coriaria\" was given by Linnaeus in 1753 in \"Species Plantarum\" (Vol. 2, page 1037). The type species is \"Coriaria myrtifolia\" L.\n\n\"Coriaria\" comes from the Latin word \"corium\", meaning \"leather\" because these plants have a substance named tannin which is used to make leather from skins.\n\nThe several New Zealand species are known by the Māori name of \"tutu\".\n\nThe genus has a very interesting geographic distribution. It is found in 5 regions:\n\nSome species of \"Coriaria\" are used to produce leather from skins of different animals (cattle, horses).\n\nIn New Zealand, the Maori people make a juice with the \"fruits\" (actually the petals) of \"tutu\". In Chile, the nuts are used to make poison for rats and mice.\n\nBecause they produce many bright, colored fruits, some species of \"Coriaria\" are used as ornamental plants.\n\nIn the genus \"Coriaria\" (y en la familia \"Coriariaceae\") there are about 17 species.\n\n", "id": "388167", "title": "Coriaria"}

She lived in China many years and wrote about the country. Her book \"The Good Earth\" was a bestseller in 1931 and 1932. The book won a Pulitzer Prize in 1932. She won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Literature for a trilogy of novels about a Chinese farm family and biographies about her missionary parents. When she returned to the United States, she became active in charitable and political causes.\n\nBuck was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia. The S in her name, Pearl S. Buck, stands for Sydenstricker because her father was named Absalom Sydenstricker. He was a Christian Presbyterian missionary to China, so Buck went to China a little while after she was born. She lived in China until 1934.\n\nBuck learned both Chinese and English. Her mother taught her English, and a tutor taught her Chinese. When she lived in China, the Boxer Rebellion changed her life and her family's life. Chinese friends stopped being their friends, and people from Europe and America came less to China to visit.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Buck went to America to attend college. She went to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia. She finished college in 1914. She then became a Presbyterian missionary like her father and returned to China. She left the missionary life in 1933, after the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy, where Fundamentalists (people who thought the Christian Bible should be taught as it was and that ideas such as Darwinism were wrong) and Modernists (people who thought Darwinism was okay) in the Presbyterian church didn't like each other.\n\nBuck went back to China in 1914. She married a missionary named John Lossing Buck in 1917. In 1920, they had a daughter. She was named Carol. Carol had Phenylketonuria, a disorder that can cause mental retardation.\n\nBuck was not just a missionary in China. She did other work too. Buck and her family lived in Nanjing from 1920 to 1933. There is a college called Nanjing University in the city. That was where Buck's family lived. Pearl taught English Literature in two different colleges which would later become part of Nanjing University. Those colleges were the University of Nanjing and the National Central University. Buck's mother died in 1921 of a disease called sprue. Pearl went back to America in 1924 and got a Masters Degree from Cornell University in 1924. Pearl's family went back to China in 1925.\n\nSomething called the Nanjing Incident, where soldiers of two armies fighting for the control of China attacked Nanjing, happened in 1927. Pearl had to hide from the soldiers. Pearl nearly died. American Navy ships rescued her. Pearl's family moved back to China a year after the Nanjing Incident happened. Then she started to write. She wrote because she needed money to support her family. In 1929, Pearl and her family went back to America to get Carol medical care. In America, her first book was published. It was called \"\". It was accepted for publication by a man named Richard Walsh, with whom Buck would later live after she left her husband. She went back to Nanjing later in 1929, and then she started to write The Good Earth. She finished the book in less than one year.\n\nAfter the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy, Pearl quit her job as missionary and moved back to America for good. She left her husband and he stayed in China.\n\nBuck divorced her husband in 1935. Richard Walsh helped her with the divorce, and she lived with him in Pennsylvania until he died in 1960. Buck died on March 6, 1973 of lung cancer in Danby, Vermont. She designed her tombstone. It had her birth name on it in Chinese.\n\nPearl wrote many books and short stories about her political views and what she saw in her life. She wrote about women's rights, immigration, adoption, war, missionary work, and Asian life.\n\nPearl did not like how adoption worked in America. The adoption companies in 1949 thought Asian children and children with mixed races were not able to be adopted. Pearl did not like that. Pearl created Welcome House, which was the first adoption company that had adoption internationally (between two different countries) and interracially (between races). However, some Asian kids were not able to be adopted. This led Pearl to create the Pearl S. Buck Foundation in 1964 to help those kids. It was later re-named Pearl S. Buck International. A year later she opened the Opportunity House (first called the Opportunity Center and Orphanage) in South Korea. Offices of the Opportunity House were later opened in Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. She made Opportunity house to help Asian kids who weren't able to live like other children.\n\nHer books were reviewed a lot. She got many positive reviews. One person said she had \"beautiful prose\" (prose is how a person writes something) but also said her style makes reading her books hard sometime. Some people like how Pearl's books made Americans understand more how Chinese people lived. The books Pearl wrote made Americans like China more and also made Americans like Japan less.\n\nIn 1983 (ten years after Pearl died), the United States Postal Service made a postage stamp with Pearl on it. It was part of the 5 cent Great Americans Series. In 1999, the National Women's History Project made Pearl an Honoree of the Women's History Month.\n\n\"The Good Earth\" was Buck's most popular book. It was a bestseller in 1931 and 1932. In 1932, Buck won the Pulitzer Prize for \"The Good Earth\". She wrote many other books and short stories. She wrote biographies (a biography is a story about the life of someone) about her parents.

The French fur traders called the place \"le portage\". This later became the name of the community. As a portage, this community grew as a center of commerce and trade. Later, a canal was built to support this trade. \n\nBy the end of the 17th century, the Fox-Wisconsin waterway was the major fur trade path between Green Bay and Prairie du Chien. In the 1780s and 1790s, traders built their warehouses at each end of The Portage. In the early 19th century, Portage was mostly populated by Metis. In 1828, the federal government saw the economic importance of The Portage. They built Fort Winnebago at the Fox River end. Portage became the county seat in 1851. The community incorporated as Portage City in 1854.\n\n\n", "id": "388287", "title": "Portage, Wisconsin"}

Stalling is risky and can be dangerous during low-level flying.\n\nThe stall is most likely to happen because of low air speed. To compensate for a decrease in air speed, for example, a pilot may raise the nose of the aircraft subsequently increasing angle of attack, which may increase Lift Coefficient and keep the same lift. However, after a critical angle of attack is passed (often around 16 degrees) the lift stops increasing and actually collapses, causing a stall. \n\nThe critical angle of attack will always stall the aircraft. It does not matter whether the aircraft is going fast or slowly.\n\nThe signs of the developing stall are:\n\n\nThe signs of a full stall are:\n\n\nThere is the chance of entering a spin if the aircraft controls are not coordinated.\n\nTo recover from a stall, the pilot must push the nose down. Then the pilot must increase the engine power using the throttle. When air speed increases again, the pilot can level the wings and pull up to return the aircraft to the assigned flight level.\n\nAn aircraft with a T tail is at risk from deep stall, because the turbulent air coming back off the stalled wings covers the elevators and makes it very difficult to push the nose down and recover.\n\nA stall turn is an aerobatic manoeuvre also known as a hammerhead. The pilot lowers the aircraft's nose to increase speed, then pulls up sharply to the vertical. The aircraft slows to a low airspeed, then the pilot applies rudder to yaw to the left or right through 180 degrees. The pilot then recovers from the subsequent dive once the aircraft has sufficient airspeed. If executed correctly the wing is not stalled at any point, hence the preferred name of \"hammerhead\" for this manoeuvre.\n", "id": "388415", "title": "Stall (flight)"}

The genus has a long fossil history.\n\nThere are two living species in this genus: the common shortfin mako shark and the rare longfin mako shark. \n\nThe shortfin mako shark, as the name suggests, has smaller pectoral fins to the Longfin mako shark. The shortfin mako shark also has smaller eyes. It is smaller than the Longfin mako shark, reaching a maximum length of 3.8 metres, but weighs more, with the heaviest shortfin mako shark found weighing 506 kg (1116 pounds). \n\nThe shortfin mako has a wide distribution, being found in tropical and temperate waters throughout the world's oceans. It is a true pelagic species, but it inhabits the cooler, deeper water of tropical regions. The shortfin mako shark has been recorded at depths of up to 740 metres. \n\nThe shortfin mako is the fastest species of shark known, reaching speeds of up to 32 km/h (20 mph), and with bursts of up to . Its great speed helps it to capture other fast swimming animals on which it preys. The shortfin mako shark feeds on pelagic fish such as swordfish, tunas, and other sharks, as well as squid. The shortfin mako holds the record for the longest distance travel: about in 37 days. This is an average of about per day. \n\nShortfin mako often leap in sets of three. The third leap is usually the highest. It can reach as high as above the surface. This high-leaping fish is a highly sought-after game fish worldwide. There are cases when an angry shortfin jumped into a boat after it was hooked.\n\nThe longfin mako shark has longer pectoral fins and larger eyes than the shortfin shark. It is longer than the shortfin, reaching a maximum length of 4.2 metres. However, it weighs less than the shortfin, weighing up to only 70 kg (154 pounds).\n\nThe longfin mako is a pelagic species, and is found in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Ocean. It is common in the western Atlantic and central Pacific, but elsewhere it is rare. It is thought to be a bottom-dwelling shark, living in tropical and warm temperate waters, but this is uncertain.\n\nNot a lot is known about the Longfin mako shark's feeding habits, but it is thought to feed on schooling fish and pelagic cephalopods. \n", "id": "388604", "title": "Isurus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=388721", "text": "Coefficient of friction\n\nA coefficient of friction is a value that shows the relationship between the force of friction between two objects and the normal reaction between the objects that are involved. It is a value that is sometimes used in physics to find an object's normal force or frictional force when other methods aren't available.\n\nThe coefficient of friction is shown by formula_1 . In that equation, formula_2 is the frictional force, formula_3 is the coefficient of friction, and formula_4 is the normal force.\n\nThe coefficient formula_5 can be two different things. It is either the coefficient of static friction formula_6, or the coefficient of kinetic friction formula_7.The coefficient of static friction is the friction force between two objects when neither of the objects is moving. The coefficient of kinetic friction is the force between two objects when one object is moving, or if two objects are moving against each other.\n\nThe coefficient of friction is dimensionless, meaning it does not have any units. It is a scalar, meaning the direction of the force does not affect the physical quantity.\n\nThe coefficient of friction depends on the objects that are causing friction. The value is usually between 0 and 1 but can be greater than 1. A value of 0 means there is no friction at all between the objects. This is only theoretically possible. All objects in the real world will have some friction when they touch each other. A value of 1 means the frictional force is equal to the normal force. Some people think that the coefficient of friction can never be more than 1, but this is not true. A coefficient of friction that is more than one just means that friction is stronger than the normal force. An object such as silicone rubber, for example, can have a coefficient of friction much greater than one. The coefficient of friction can also be changed by the mass and speed of the moving object. \n\nThe friction force is the force exerted by a surface when an object moves across it - or makes an effort to move across it.\n\nThe frictional force or force of friction can be expressed as\n\nformula_8 (1)\n\nwhere\n\nformula_2 is the frictional force (in Newton),\n\nformula_5 is the static (formula_6) or kinetic (formula_7) frictional coefficient (dimensionless) and\n\nformula_13 is the normal force (in Newton).\n", "id": "388721", "title": "Coefficient of friction"}

It is named after Christopher Columbus, known as Cristóbal Colón in Spanish. The plural is \"colones\" in Spanish. The ISO 4217 code is CRC.\n\nThe symbol for the colón is a \"c\" with two slashes (₡). The symbol for the colón in many English language Windows keyboards can be made by pressing +.\n\nThe colón sign is not the same as the US cent sign, but the US cent sign is much more commonly available (¢). As such, it is frequently used instead of the colón's own sign in price markings and advertisements.\n\nThe colón is divided into 100 \"centimos\"\n\nThe colón was introduced in 1896 and replaced the Costa Rican peso. Between 1917 and 1919 coins were issued using the name centavo for the 1/100 subunit.\n\nIn 1897 gold 2, 5, 10 and 20 colones were issued. Later, silver 50 centimos and cupro-nickel 2 centimos were issued in 1903. In 1905 silver 5 and 10 centimos were issued. The 5 and 10 centimos had the initials G.C.R. (\"Gobierno de Costa Rica\") because they were issued by the government.\n\nThe government resumed in 1920 making 5 and 10 centimos coins with the G.C.R initials. Silver 25 centimos coins were made in 1925. The last government issued coins were brass 10 centimos coins in 1941.\n\nIn 1935, the International Bank of Costa Rica \"(Banco Internacional de Costa Rica)\" issued cupro-nickel coins of 25 and 50 centimos and 1 colón. These had the initials B.I.C.R.\n\nThe National Bank made 25 and 50 centimos coins in 1937. This bank also issued 1 colón coins. These coins had the initials B.N.C.R. 5 and 10 centimos coins were made in 1942. 2 colones coins were made in 1948.\n\nThe Central Bank of Costa Rica took over coin production in 1951. These coins had the initials B.C.C.R. \"(Banco Central de Costa Rica)\".\n\nThe first Banco Central coins were 5 and 10 centimos. Then 1 and 2 colones coins in 1954. In 1965, 50 centimos coins were made. 25 centimos coins were made in 1967.\n\nBy 1983, 5 and 10 centimos coins were discontinued. 25 centimos to 2 colon coins were made smaller in size. By this time 5, 10 and 20 colon coins were made. \n\nBy 1998, small brass 1, 5 and 10 colon coins were made. In this same year 25, 50 & 100 colones coins were added. In 2003, 500 colones coins were made. In 2006 aluminium 5 and 10 colones coins were made.\n\n1 colón coins are no longer used. In 2009 the large silver-colored ¢5, ¢10 & ¢20 were withdrawn. There are only the smaller silver-colored ¢5 and ¢10 coins and gold-colored ¢5, ¢10, ¢25, ¢50, ¢100 & ¢500 coins.\n\nFour private banks, the \"Banco Anglo–Costarricense\", the \"Banco Comercial de Costa Rica\", the \"Banco de Costa Rica\" and the \"Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica\", issued notes between 1864 and 1917.\n\nThe Banco Anglo–Costarricense was established in 1864 and issued notes from 1864 to 1917. It later became a state-owned bank and in 1994 went bankrupt and closed. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 25, 50, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 colones. Some 1, 5, 10 and 20 colon notes (unsigned and undated) were released in 1963 when the bank celebrated its 100th anniversary. Some had \"Muestra sin Valor\" (\"sample without value\") printed on them in order to nullify the legal tender status and to prevent people from selling them. Most, however, didn't have that printed on them, which makes it harder nowadays to find notes with the seal.\n\nThe Banco de Costa Rica was established in 1890 and issued notes from 1890 to 1914. It is currently a state-owned bank. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.\n\nThe Banco Comercial de Costa Rica issued notes between 1906 and 1914 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica issued notes between 1910 and 1916, also in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.\n\nThe government issued gold certificates in 1897 for 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 colones. Between 1902 and 1917, it issued silver certificates for 50 centimos, 1, 2, 50 and 100 colones.\n\nIn 1914, the \"Banco Internacional de Costa Rica\" introduced notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones, to which 25 and 50 centimos, 1 and 2 colones were added in 1918. Although 25 centimos were not issued after 1919, the other denominations continued to be issued until 1936. After 1917, the Banco Internacional's notes were the only issued for circulation.\n\nIn 1937, the \"Banco Nacional de Costa Rica\" took over paper money issuing and issued notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones until 1949. Many of the early notes were provisional issues overprinted on notes of the Banco Internacional, including the 1 colón notes which were briefly issued.\n\nThe \"Banco Central de Costa Rica\" began issuing paper money in 1950, with notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The first notes were provisional issues produced from Banco Nacional notes (unsigned and undated). The Central Bank printed on them the corresponding signatures and dates, and the legend \"BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA\" over \"BANCO NACIONAL DE COSTA RICA\". Regular issues of notes began in 1951, but a second provisional issue of 2 colon notes was made in 1967. 1000 colon notes were added in 1958, followed by 500 colones in 1973, 5000 colones in 1992, and 2000 and 10,000 colones in 1997.\nWhenever a banknote of a specific denomination is changed (design, security features, colour, etc.), a new series is released. Every banknote issued by this bank measures approximately 6.6 cm x 15.5 cm. Every note also has the serial and series numbers printed in red ink. Exceptions occurred with:\n\nEvery issue also features the signatures, date, and the agreement number printed in black.\n\nThe 1983 \"Z\" series of the 20 colón note was an experimental issue of the American Banknote Company which made the notes out of a polymer. To date, this has been the only Costa Rican note made of that material.\n\nSince 2012, Costa Rican banknotes are undergoing a reform and are being replaced by a new model. Two new denominations were introduced as part of the reform; 20,000 and 50,000 colones. The old notes will all be withdrawn from circulation and be replaced by new ones. The new banknotes will have different colors, shapes and images than their predecessors. All the denominations have a different length so that people with visual impairments can recognize the banknotes easily.\n\nOn February 6, 2011, the United States dollar was worth 508.11 colones. The colón has had an unusual relationship with the U.S. dollar that may best be described as a \"crawling peg\"; instead of being defined by a constant value to the dollar, the colón instead would grow progressively weaker at a fixed rate of about 3.294 colones per dollar per month. On October 16, 2006, however, this crawling peg was modified due to weakness in the U.S. dollar and the perception that the colón is now undervalued. The exchange rate is now free to float within a currency band referenced to the United States dollar. The floor of the band has been set at a fixed value, while the ceiling changes at a fixed rate. In practice the exchange rate has remained fixed at the lower value of the currency band.\n\nSince October 17, 2006 the colón is no longer bound to controlled devaluations (known in Costa Rica as \"minidevaluaciones\") by the Central Bank of Costa Rica. With the new system, \"sistema cambiario de bandas\", the exchange rates posted by the Central Bank are a \"reference\" and each authorized financial institution can determine their value independently in hopes that the free market will provide a mechanism to keep them reasonable.\n\nThe colón is sometimes referred to as the \"peso\", which was the name of the Costa Rican currency before the colón, until 1896. This is very common across Latin American countries, where most have (or had at some point) currencies called pesos. Another nickname is \"caña\" (Spanish for sugar cane, plural cañas) but this nickname is more often used in plural for amounts under 100 colones. For example: 5 cañas, 10 cañas, 20 cañas. This term has become less popular.\n\n\"Teja\" (roof tile in Spanish) is used as another nickname. It means one hundred colones. For example: five hundred colones are called \"\"cinco tejas\"\". \"Teja\" can also be used for 100,000 colones. \"\"Media Teja\"\" (half a roof tile in Spanish) is used for 50 colones or 50,000 colones.\n\nThe one thousand colones note is called \"un rojo\" (one red) because of its red color.\n\n", "id": "388949", "title": "Costa Rican colón"}

It is sometimes called \"Proto-Renaissance\".\n\nOne of the most important centres of art and architecture in this period is Florence, a political, economical and cultural pole of Italy.\n\nThe most important artists who represent this period are Giotto, in painting, and Donatello, in sculpture. Indeed the Trecento begins with the works of the painter Giotto and includes Taddeo Gaddi, Orcagna, Altichiero and the sculptor Nicola Pisano. \n\nIn 1334 Giotto was appointed chief architect to Florence Cathedral, of which the \"Campanile\" (founded by him on July 18, 1334 AD) bears his name, but was not completed to his design. Most of the famous Florence Cathedral, an architecture masterpiece, was built during the Trecento.\n\nImportant sculptors included two pupils of Giovanni Pisano: Arnolfo di Cambio and Tino di Camaino, and Bonino da Campione.\n\nThe Trecento was also famous as a time of heightened literary activity, with writers working in the vernacular instead of Latin.

He arranged the elements from the lightest one to the heaviest one. When he proposed his periodic table, he placed empty spaces between some elements. He said that the empty spaces were for undiscovered elements. Mendeleev had also predicted the properties of these undiscovered elements.\n\nMendeleev gave temporary names for the undiscovered elements. He used the prefixes eka-, dvi- and tri- and combined it with any known elements in the same group with the undiscovered element. Eka-, dvi- and tri- are numbers 1, 2 and 3 in the Sanskrit language. The use of the prefix depends on how far the known element is from the unknown element. For example, germanium was called eka-silicon because silicon is placed one row above germanium, and rhenium was called dvi-manganese because manganese is placed two rows above rhenium. The names of these elements were changed after they were discovered.\n\nOther scientists use the eka- prefix, too. Eka- is also used in the names of elements that Mendeleev did not predict. Before francium was discovered, it was called \"eka-caesium\", and before astatine was discovered, it was called \"eka-iodine\". The eka- prefix is also used to name transuranic elements (elements after uranium). For example, ununoctium is also called \"eka-radon\", and untriennium (element number 139) is also called \"eka-actinium\". Today, the IUPAC uses the systematic element name to give new elements a temporary name. This new way of naming elements depends on the atomic number of the element. It does not depend on the position of the element in the periodic table.\n", "id": "389061", "title": "Mendeleev's predicted elements"}

Essex, England. Harwich records for the year of his birth are missing. Christopher was his father's eldest son. He lived in a house on High Street. Jones was eight when his father died. Christopher was left his father's share in the ship \"Marie Fortune\" when he turned eighteen. His brother Roger was left an eighth part and stock in the ship \"Centurion\" when he turned eighteen. Christopher's mother married Robert Russell on 20 September 1579.\n\nOn 23 December 1593, Jones married Sarah Twitt, the daughter of a fairly wealthy Harwich merchant. She lived across the street from Jones in Harwich. Within a year of their marriage in St. Nicholas's Church, Harwich, they had a son, Thomas. The boy was baptized on 1 December 1595. He died a few months later on 17 April 1596. Sarah's father died in 1599, leaving Christopher and Sarah Jones a twelfth share in the ship \"Apollo\". Sarah died in 1603. She was buried on 23 May 1603 in Harwich. \n\nSix months after his wife's death, Jones married Josian Gray in St. Nicholas' church. She was the widow of Richard Gray, and the daughter of Thomas Thompson. Both men were ship owners and Harwich merchants. The Joneses had eight children, four born in Harwich and four born in Rotherhithe where the family moved in 1609.\n\nBy the time of his first wedding, Jones' father had died. He left Jones his share in the ship \"Mary Fortune\". Sarah Twitt received £20 and a twelfth share in the ship \"Apollo\" at her father's death. In 1601, Jones was elected freeman of the Borough of Harwich. He served as tax assessor and jury member in Harwich. \n\nHis name is listed as one of the 24 capital burgesses on the Great Charter granted to the Borough by James I in 1604. In 1605, he was accused of keeping hunting dogs (greyhounds), an interest open only to gentlemen whose land was valued at more than 40 shillings per year.\n\nWith what wealth he had acquired through inheritance and marriage, Jones was able to pursue a seafaring career. He built the ship, \"Josian\", named after his wife. He traded between England and Europe with voyages to Norway, Bordeaux, and Rochelle. He carried woolen cloth on outward bound voyages and wine on return trips.\n\nJones was part owner in the \"Mayflower\". He had been the master of the ship for about 11 years when it was hired to carry the Pilgrims to North America. Jones and his 102 passengers and 30-40 crew members left Plymouth, England in September 1620. They arrived in North America in November. Jones remained in the New World through a harsh winter and returned to England in the spring of 1621.\n\nJones' wintering in the New World very likely undermined his health.

The name is used for the gathering. One part of the name refers to the Sabbath, the day of rest in Judaism and other Abrahamic religions. The term was in common use in the Middle Ages. At that time, the Jews were shown as evil in many European countries. It was believed that the witches killed people in secret rituals or poisoned wells during the Witches Sabbath. From about the 14th century, the Holy Inquisition used this belief to organise pogroms against people it called heretics. The Catholic Church developed a whole set of ideas about witches. According to this theory, the Witches Sabbath is one of the five elements that characterize a witch. The other elements are witches' flight, a pact with the devil, the idea that they entered into a sexual relationship with the devil, and that they used black magic to harm people. The idea of a conspiracy theory was thematised more and more in the fifteenth century. People feared a secret society or sect of witches and warlocks (male witches) that would do harm. \n", "id": "389225", "title": "Witches' Sabbath"}

The holes are used to represent information. The principle is the same as that of a punched card, except that the length is variable. Punched tape was widely used in the 1950s and 1960s, but was later replaced by other media. Punched tape was first used to program looms, in the 18th century. Similar looms are still used for waving Tartans, but the punched tape is made of metal platelets today. Another use of punched tape is in barrel organs. \n\n20th century teleprinters also use punched tape. Herman Hollerith used punched tape for a census, in 1890. Gilbert Vernam, a telecommunication engineer developed the Vernam cipher in 1917. This cipher could be used with punched tape. Vernam combined a character of the punched tape, with one of a key, to give the encoded character. Combining the ecoded character with the key again gives the plain text. This is in fact an exclusive disjunction, even though Vernam used a different name. It was an automated one-time pad. The NSA has called this patent \"perhaps one of the most important in the history of cryptography.\"\n\nThere are different formats for punching tapes. Today, two formats are left, which are mechanically compatible. One is used in Telex and early computing applications. The strip is wide, and has five positions, plus a row that serves for feeding, and is always punched. The feeding row is between positions three and four. Data positions use a quadratic raster of a width of . The other format is mainly used in computing. The strip is wide, and has eight positions. Like the other format, the feeding row is between holes three and four. Both formats save ten rows of data (or characters) on a length of . If the 5 position strip is put on top of the 8 position one, the first five holes (and the feeding row) have the same position. Thi means that a reader which is capable of reading 8-position tape can also read 5-position tape. There are devices which can output both formats.\n\nIt is possible to encode 256 different characters on an 8 hole tape, the five hole tape can hold 32 different characters. The Baudot code which is used for encoding has two special characters that allow to switch between two halves of a code. This means that the five position punchtape can encode 59 different characters.\n\nPunched tape has some advantages:\n\n", "id": "389239", "title": "Punched tape"}

He was elected on 13 March 2013. He chose the name Francis to honor St. Francis of Assisi. \n\nFrancis is the first Jesuit pope. He is also the first pope in more than a millennium who is not European. He is the first pope ever to come from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFrom 1998 until he was elected as the pope, Francis was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Throughout his life, both as an individual and a religious leader, he has been known for his humility, his concern for the poor, and his commitment to dialogue as a way to build bridges between people of all backgrounds, beliefs, and faiths. He has expressed concern about the effects of global warming (climate change). In his 2015 encyclical \"Laudato si'\" , he wrote about these issues, and others.\n\nSince his election to the papacy, he has shown a simpler and less formal approach to the office, choosing to live in the Vatican guesthouse and not the papal residence. \n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was one of the children of Mario Bergoglio, an Italian railway accountant, and Regina Maria Bergoglio (née Sívori), a housewife.\n\nHe received a master's degree in philosophy and theology from the University of Buenos Aires. After that, he studied at the seminary in Villa Devoto. He entered the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) on 11 March 1958.\n\nBergoglio became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1958. He was made a priest in 1969. In 1973, he was named \"provincial\" or head of the Jesuits in Argentina. In the mid-1980's, he began work on a doctoral degree at Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nPope John Paul II appointed Bergoglio the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. During the 2001 Consistory, Pope named Bergoglio as a Cardinal.\n\nCardinal Bergoglio was elected on March 13, 2013. He chose the name \"Francis\" to honor St. Francis of Assisi. Just after he was elected, Francis told a newspaper how he chose the new name:\n\n\"\"Let me tell you a story,\" he said. He then [explained] how during the conclave he had sat next to Cardinal Cláudio Hummes of Brazil, whom he called \"a great friend.\" After the voting, Cardinal Hummes \"hugged me, he kissed me and he said, 'Don't forget the poor!' And that word entered here,\" the pope said, pointing to his heart. \"I thought of wars, while the voting continued, though all the votes,\" he said ... \"And Francis is the man of peace. And that way the name came about, came into my heart: Francis of Assisi.\"\" \n\nDespite both his parents being Italians, Francis is the first non-European pope since Pope Gregory III in the 8th century.\n\nPope Francis is the first pope to speak to a session of the United States Congress. He spoke there during his visit to the United States on September 24, 2015.\n\nPersonally, Pope Francis likes to read books by authors such as Friedrich Hölderlin, Jorge Luis Borges or Fyodor Dostoevsky. He likes to watch movies of Italian neorealism, and likes to go to the opera.\n\nHe is also interested in football. He is an active member of San Lorenzo de Almagro, which is one of the teams in the \"Primera División\" league.\n\nWhen Bergoglio was a Cardinal, his views about the celibacy of priests were recorded in the book \"On Heaven and Earth.\" The book is a record of conversations he had with a Buenos Aires rabbi. In this book, he said that celibacy \"is a matter of discipline, not of faith. It can change.\" However, he added: \"For the moment, I am in favor of maintaining celibacy, with all its [positive and negative parts], because we have ten centuries of good experiences rather than failures [...] Tradition has weight and validity.\" \n\nHe also said that \"in the Byzantine, Ukrainian, Russian, and Greek Catholic Churches [...] the priests can be married, but the bishops have to be celibate\". He said that many of those in Western Catholicism who are pushing for more discussion about the issue do so from a position of \"pragmatism\", based on a loss of manpower. He states that \"If, hypothetically, Western Catholicism were to review the issue of celibacy, I think it would do so for cultural reasons (as in the East), not so much as a universal option.\" He emphasized that, in the meantime, the rule must be strictly followed, and any priest who cannot obey it \"has to leave the ministry.\"\n\nNational Catholic Reporter Vatican analyst Thomas Reese, also a Jesuit, called Bergoglio's use of \"conditional language\" regarding the rule of celibacy \"remarkable.\" He said that phrases like \"for the moment\" and \"for now\" are \"not the kind of qualifications one normally hears when bishops and cardinals discuss celibacy.\"\n\nPope Francis supports the Catholic teaching that homosexual acts are immoral. However, he has said that gay people should be treated with respect. Bergoglio is against same-sex marriage. In 2011, he called it \"the Devil's work\". \n\nArgentina considered legalizing same-sex marriage in 2010. At that time, Bergoglio was against this legislation. He called it a \"real and dire anthropological throwback.\" In July 2010, while the law was under consideration, he wrote a letter to Argentina's cloistered nuns in which he said:\nAfter \"L'Osservatore Romano\" reported this, several priests expressed their support for the law. Gay people believe that the church's opposition and Bergoglio's language actually helped the law get passed. They also think that Catholic officials reacted by taking a less harsh tone in later debates on social issues such as parental surrogacy.\n\nOn July 29, 2013, Pope Francis gave an interview to some journalists who were traveling with him. When asked if there should be gay priests, Pope Francis replied: Afterwards, when asked if women should become priests, Francis replied: \n\nThree days after being elected Pope, Pope Francis told thousands of news reporters:\n\"[Since] many of you do not belong to the Catholic Church, and others are not believers, I give this blessing from my heart, in silence, to each one of you, respecting the conscience of each one of you, but knowing that each one of you is a child of God. May God bless you.\"\n\nIt is very rare for a Pope to bless people who are not Catholics. By doing this, the Pope was showing that he accepted people who belonged to different religions.\nIn a speech on 20 March, Pope Francis said that some people do not follow any religion, but still search \"for truth, goodness and beauty.\" He said these people are important allies in protecting human dignity; making peace; and caring for the Earth. This meant the Pope was saying atheists could be allies of the Catholic Church, instead of enemies. \n\nIn the same speech, the Pope said that Catholic and Jewish people are connected \"by a most special spiritual bond.\" To Muslim leaders at the speech he said: \"[To] Muslims, who worship God as one, living and merciful, and [call on] him in prayer... I greatly appreciate your presence ... [In] it, I see a ... sign of a will to grow in mutual esteem and in cooperation for the common good of humanity.\" \n\nIn September 2013, Francis wrote a letter that was published in \"La Repubblica\" newspaper. The letter said that atheists would be forgiven by God if they followed their consciences and did what they thought was right. The newspaper's editor, who is not a Catholic, wrote back with a list of questions. Francis wrote back:\n\"You ask me if the God of the Christians forgives those who don't believe and who don't seek the faith. I start by saying—and this is the [most important] thing—that God's mercy has no limits if you go to him with a sincere and [truly sorry] heart. The issue for those who do not believe in God is to obey their conscience. Sin, even for those who have no faith, exists when people disobey their conscience.\" \nFrancis was named 2013 Time Person of the Year in December 2013.\n\n\n", "id": "389278", "title": "Pope Francis"}

The canton has an area of . It has a population of 134,534. The capital city of the canton is San Isidro de El General.\n\nThe canton's boundaries are made by Río Savegre river, Río Guabo river, and the coastal mountain ranges. The canton has the highest mountains peaks of the Cordillera de Talamanca (Talamanca Mountain Range) on the east. In the middle of the canton, the Río General river goes from north to south.\n\nThe canton of Pérez Zeledón is divided into 11 districts (\"distritos\"):\n\n\nThe canton of Pérez Zeledón was made 9 October 1931. It was granted 4 districts: Ureña, El General, Daniel Flores, and Rivas. Ureña was the capital.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, between 1870 and 1899, there were a few families living in the El General valley. The hamlets \"(Spanish: Caseríos)\" of El General, Palmares, Rivas, and Ureña were populated from 1900 onward.\n\nThe \"Caserío\" of Ureña grew more. By 1911, during Ricardo Jiménez Oreamuno's government, the Refuges of Ojo de Agua, El Cerro de la Muerte, and División were created. These refuges further advanced the growth of the region.\n\nSan Isidro de El General, Pérez Zeledón's capital, was given the title of \"Ciudad Mártir\". This was because of the civil war of 1948 that happened here.\n\nDecree Nº274 gave the city its title. This decree established official recognition of the city's participation in the civil war of 1948. A section of the decree states (in Spanish):\n\nWhich in English would translate into:\n\nPérez Zeledón was also the location of major battles during the Costa Rican Civil War. One battle was the Battle of San Isidro de El General. It happened around 6:30 am. 200 government forces fought the rebels at the city's central park. The battle was won by José Figueres Ferrer and his rebels. This battle secured the southern pacific region of Costa Rica for the rebels.\n\nThe canton of Pérez Zeledón's economy is characterized by agriculture, livestock, trade, industry and tourism. One fact that has helped this economy is the canton's geographic location; it is a 'bridge' between Costa Rica's capital (San José) and the southern areas that border Panamá.\n\nImportant farming activities:\n\n\nThe first two products are the most important in the region.\n\nLivestock activities are also important. Pigs and cattle being the most important. The cattle is used for meat and dairy products.\n\nCommercial activities have also become important. There are important credit unions, banks, local companies, media, and various other companies of the San José operating in the canton.\n\nIts main attraction is ecological diversity. There is the Chirripó National Park (one of the highest peak in Central America and the Caribbean).\n\nAnother park in the area is the Parque Internacional La Amistad.\n\nThe first elementary school in Pérez Zeledón was established during Ascensión Esquivel Ibarra's government (1902-1906). It was called Escuela Mixta de Ureña and was located in the Ureña district, south of San Isidro de El General's central park. After the Costa Rican Civil War the school was moved to a new building. It currently has the name \"\"Escuela 12 de Marzo\"\", in honor of the start of the Costa Rican Civil War.

Out of all the helium on the Earth, 99.99986% are helium-4. The nucleus (the center) of a helium-4 atom is also known as the alpha particle. Helium-4 is made of 2 protons (the part of an atomic nucleus with a positive charge), 2 neutrons (the part of an atomic nucleus with a negative charge) and 2 electrons (the part of an atom that goes around the nucleus with a negative charge).\n\nMany helium-4 on Earth is produced from alpha decay of heavy elements. In the Sun and the whole universe, most helium-4 is made during the Big Bang, the event that created the universe. This \"Big Bang helium-4\" is known as the \"primordial helium\". Helium-4 is also made in nuclear fusion at the center of stars. Primordial helium is not much on Earth, because most of it had escaped from the Earth when it was created and the temperatures were very high. Helium-4 on Earth was made through radioactive decay (when an atom breaks down into smaller atoms) from other elements, and it is made after the planet cooled and became solid.\n\nOne quarter of all the mass in the universe is helium-4. The rest are mostly hydrogen.\n\nWhen helium-4 in its liquid form is cooled to below -271.17 °C (2.71 K), it turns into a superfluid. A superfluid is a special kind of fluid that has properties that are different from normal fluids. For example, if helium-4 as a superfluid is placed in an open container, it will climb the walls of the container and spill out. This is called a \"Rollin film\". It is caused by a phenomenon in quantum mechanics that is known as the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The nucleus of helium-4 has a total spin of zero (an integer), and this makes it a boson. Now, the superfluid behaviour is a form of the Bose-Einstein condensate that can only be done by bosons.\n\nHelium-4 can also be found on the Moon.

He lived in Alexandria in the 3rd century. He was born in the year 185 or 186, and proably died around the year 254. Today, he is regarded as one of the Church Fathers, but not as a Saint. This is probably because he had some ideas, which were declared to be false later on. These ideas included that the human soul existed before conception, and entered the human body before birth (generally known as pre-existence). Another idea was that of the souls entering a different human body after death. A third idea, called Apokatastasis, is that the reign of god would be restored when the world ends. These ideas were discussed by church fathers, but it was decided that they were false beliefs. The Council of Constantinople in 453 CE posthumously excommunicated Origen, and the 2nd Council of Constantinople in 553 CE declared \"apokatastasis\" as heresy. However, in recent years the idea has found some reconsideration especially among Restorationist Christian groups.\n\nHis writings are included in the general collection of early Church Fathers. However, unlike many church fathers, Origen was never canonized by the Catholic Church, because some of his teachings (for example, that every man and woman, and even the devil and his demons, would ultimately be saved) directly contradicted the teachings and actions of the apostles.\n\nOrigen was a prolific writer in many branches of theology, including textual criticism, biblical exegesis and hermeneutics, philosophical theology, preaching, and spirituality. Some of his teachings, however, quickly became controversial. Notably, he frequently referred to his hypothesis of the pre-existence of souls. In the beginning all intelligent beings were united to God. In his writingas, Origen also considered the possibility, that in the end all beings, perhaps even the arch-fiend Satan, would be reconciled with God in what is called the apokatastasis (\"restitution\"). Origen saw the Son of God as subordinate to God the Father. Even though this view of the Trinity was common at the time, it became controversial during the Arian controversy of the fourth century. A group who came to be known as Origenists, and who firmly believed in the preexistence of souls and the apokatastasis, were declared anathema in the 6th century. This condemnation is attributed to the Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople, though it does not appear in the council's official documents.\n", "id": "389660", "title": "Origen"}

The chemicals are said to be deliberately sprayed for reasons that are kept secret by the government. Most scientists and workers in the aviation industry say that the trails left by planes are just a form of condensation. These are called contrails (condensation trails).\n\nPeople who believe the theory have speculated about what purpose chemtrails may serve. Some say it is to change the weather or stop global warming. Others say that it is to control the population by spreading chemicals that are harmful to the human reproductive system. Some more recent versions of the theory say that chemtrails are being spread by companies that make genetically-modified (GMO) crops. The chemtrails supposedly contain herbicides that will only kill normal (organic) crops and will not affect the genetically-modified crops.\n\nSome claim that specially modified planes, supposedly owned and operated by the government, are necessary to create a chemtrail. The chemicals are said to either come from the engine or from special nozzles on the plane. In some versions of the theory, the chemical is said to be barium or a barium compound, but in other versions it is aluminum oxide, or a mixture of barium compounds and aluminum oxide.\n\nChemtrails are not to be confused with the spraying of chemicals over short distances at a low altitude, such as aerial firefighting or crop-dusting.\n\nSeveral photographs on the Internet have been claimed to show the inside of planes that spread chemtrails. They show ballast barrels installed on the inside of the plane. In reality, these are photographs of test planes or firefighting planes. The real purpose of the barrels is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel to test different weight distributions while the aircraft is in flight.\n\n", "id": "389771", "title": "Chemtrail conspiracy theory"}

The people call themselves \"Aṉangu\", a word which means \"person\" or \"people\" in their own language. The group is considered part of the Western Desert cultural bloc. Pitjantjatjara people are closely related to their two closest neighbours: the Yankunytjatjara and the Ngaanyatjarra. They can understand much of each other's languages. There are currently about 4,000 people from this nation living in small communities spread out across their homeland.\n\nThe homeland of the Pitjantjatjara covers north-western South Australia and the south-west of the Northern Territory. More communities are located a short distance over the border in Western Australia. The land they live in is special to them. It forms a large part of their culture and beliefs. In South Australia, they mostly live in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands. This area is where the Pitjantjatjara language is strongest. In the Northern Territory, their country is on the south side of Lake Amadeus. It is centred around Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa, two of their most sacred sites. \n\nPitjantjatara are historically a nomadic people. They lived in small family groups, travelling from one rock hole to another depending on the water and food that was available. In the mid-20th century, most families settled in new communities they built together. They have kept their culture and identity despite outside influences and attempts to force them to change. These influences come from the wider Australian community.\n", "id": "389856", "title": "Pitjantjatjara"}

There are about 150 people living in the community, most of whom are Ngaanyatjarra.\n\nThe town is surrounded by the Wingellina Hills, a set of large granite hills with mulga and mallee growth. The name of the community, \"\", comes from the name of a sacred site located in the hills to the south.\n\nThe area was part of the Central Australia Aboriginal Reserve when the reserve was created in 1922. In 1955, however, the borders of the reserve were moved to allow for mining and prospecting, mostly of nickel. Mining camps were set up in the area around what is now Irrunytju. In response, Aboriginal families moved to settle around these camps. Some got jobs with the miners and were paid in food rations; others were simply there to protect places of spiritual importance from outsiders. Some companies took steps to make sure their miners respected these sites; other companies did not, and several sacred sites were damaged during this period. The area was made part of the reserve again in 1972.\n\nOnce the miners left, the Aboriginal families stayed and built a permanent settlement using what was left from the mining camps (shelters, bores, etc.). The community was also given money from the federal government to help establish a permanent settlement. The community became incorporated in 1976. It became a member of the Ngaanyatjarra Council in 1981.\n\nIrrunytju has remained on Aboriginal land since 1972. Economic activities in the area are governed under the Ngaanyatjarra Indigenous Land Use Agreement, formed in 2006.

Tjuntjuntjara is connected to Irrunytju in the north by a dirt track.\n\nThere are about 160 people living at Tjuntjuntjara. They speak a southern variety of the Pitjantjatjara language. They identify as belonging to a group of people known as ' (meaning \"from the spinifex plains\"). This group of people are among those that were removed from their homelands in the 1950s and 1960s due to nuclear weapons testing at Woomera Test Range. Most of the people now living at Tjuntjuntjara were previously living at Cundeelee, then a Christian mission, further to the west. Other communities of ' people include Oak Valley and Yalata, over the border in South Australia.\n\nTjuntjuntjara was founded in the late 1980s. Cundeelee was being closed, so a group of elders led members back east to their homelands to set up a new community. The first choice for a location was Yakadunya (about of Tjuntjuntjara). A water bore was drilled and a temporary camp was formed, but there was not enough water in the ground. The community moved northward to what is now Tjuntjuntjara.\n\nTjuntjuntjara has since grown into a large community. It acts as a service centre for several outstations. These outstations are occupied at certain times of the year for hunting and gathering and ceremonies. The community is governed by a local council. Facilities and services are managed by the Paupiyala Tjarutja Aboriginal Corporation, a non-profit organisation. The community has its own health clinic. The community school, Tjuntjuntjara Remote Community School, was opened in 2008. Both the clinic and the school are helped by the federal government. Mail is flown in by plane once per week. A truck delivers food supplies to the community once every two weeks. There is no police station.\n\nThe Spinifex Arts Project was set up in 1997 for the community to create artworks.\n\nThe community is growing.

The 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 are all 737NG aircraft. It is the third family of Boeing 737. The family which came before it is the 737 Classic (−300/-400/-500) family. They have been made since 1996 by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. All 737s are twin-engined, narrow-body aircraft. This means that they all have two engines and only have two rows of seats.\n\n4,293 737NG aircraft have been delivered (as of December 2012). More than 6,300 have been ordered by airlines. Southwest Airlines has more 737NGs than any other airline. Ryanair, a low-cost airline from Ireland, also has a lot of 737NGs. The only planes Ryanair has are 737-800s. The main rival of the 737NG family is the Airbus A320 family. The Boeing 737 MAX will eventually replace the 737NG.\n\nAfter Airbus designed the Airbus A320, Boeing started designing a new series of Boeing 737. The \"737 Next Generation\" (NG) program was announced on November 17, 1993. Boeing made many changes from the 737 Classic. The wing was changed. These changes made its area bigger by 25%. The wingspan was made bigger by 16 ft (4.88 m). These changes meant that it could carry 30% more fuel. CFM56-7B engines were used. These improvements allowed the 737 to fly 900 nmi farther.\n\nThe inside of the 737 Next Generation was better than the style used on the Boeing 757-200 and the Boeing 737 Classic. It used certain parts of the Boeing 777's inside style. The style of the 737 Next Generation was made the usual style of the Boeing 757-300.\n\nIn 2010, the inside of the 737NG was changed to look like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The new design was called the Boeing Sky Interior. The Sky Interior can only be put into new aircraft. However, a different company has made a style for 737 and 757 aircraft which looks like the Sky Interior.\n\nThe first 737NG was a 737−700. The prototype −800 was finished on June 30, 1997 and first flew on July 31, 1997. The smallest 737NG, the 737−600 series, is the same size as the −500. The FAA said it was allowed to fly on August 18, 1998.\n\nIn July 2008, Boeing brought out new brakes for 737NGs. They are supposed to replace the steel brakes. They will make the brakes lighter. less weight on a Boeing 737-800 means that 0.5% less fuel will be burned. Delta Air Lines got the first 737NG with these brakes. The plane was a 737-700.\n\nOn August 21, 2006, Sky News said that some 737NGs had faulty parts. The report said that Boeing had found some parts of the plane to be faulty, but they did not fix it. Boeing said that these statements were \"without merit\". This means that Boeing thinks Sky News is wrong. However, another show looked at 737NGs and also thought that some things were faulty.\n\nSince 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design.\n\nOn July 20, 2011, Boeing said it would make a new version of the 737. It would have the CFM International LEAP-X engine.American Airlines said it would order 100 of these planes. The plane will probably be finished in 2016 or 2017.\n\nOn August 30, 2011, Boeing said it would definitely make this new plane. They called it the Boeing 737 MAX. The CFM International LEAP-1B engines that it will use burns 16% less fuel than the Airbus A320. The 737 MAX's main rival will be the Airbus A320neo family.\n\nThe 737-600 replaces the 737-500. Its main rival is the Airbus A318. 69 737-600s have been made.\n\nAs of 2012, Boeing has taken the 737-600 out of its list of prices. This might mean that the 737-600 is not being made anymore.\n\nThe 737-700 replaces the 737-300. It began being used in 1998. Its main rival is the Airbus A319. Southwest Airlines has the most 737-700s. They have more than 400 of them.\n\nThe \"737-700C\" is a version where the seats can be taken out to carry cargo instead. There is a big door on the left of the aircraft. The United States Navy got the first 737-700C.

The 737 MAX will have new, better CFM International LEAP-1B engines. The outside of the plane will also get some changes. The very first 737 MAX will probably be delivered in 2017, which is 50 years after the first Boeing 737 took off. Boeing has 1,285 orders for the 737 MAX as of May 14, 2013.\n\nSince 2006, Boeing has been thinking about replacing the 737 with a completely new design.\n\nIn 2010, Airbus said it was making the Airbus A320neo family, which is an improved version of the Airbus A320 family.

Both of these would mean that Boeing would have to make some changes to the wheels, because the engines need to be above the ground. Boeing said the bigger engine would use less fuel. However, because it is bigger, it would make more drag and be heavier. This would mean that even more changes would be needed.\n\nBoth engines are bigger than the CFM56-7B engines on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The new engine will use 10–12% less fuel than the engines on the 737NG. It has been said that Boeing are looking at parts of the plane that can be changed to make less drag and burn less fuel.\nIn November 2011, Boeing said it would use the diameter engine. The landing gear will need to be made longer by 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). This is to make sure the engines stay above the ground. Boeing will probably say exactly what the 737 MAX looks like sometime in 2013. On May 17, 2012, Boeing said the engine's diameter had been made bigger. This means it is now 69.4 inches (176 cm).\n\nThe 737 MAX will have the Boeing Sky Interior. The Boeing Sky Interior is like the cabin of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The 737 MAX will also have winglets.\n\nThe winglets used on the 737 MAX will be different to the winglets on the 737NG. Boeing says the new winglets will help the plane use 1.5% less fuel.\n\nBoeing does not want to change the cockpit because they want it to be similar to the cockpit on the 737NG. Boeing also wants to add some more fly-by-wire to the 737 MAX. However, Boeing said that changes will be \"very minimal\".\n\n\nSources: Boeing 737 specifications\n\n", "id": "390195", "title": "Boeing 737 MAX"}

They are found all over the Oriental region, all over Africa and into southern Europe. \n\nAs they live in Madagascar and Celebes, this shows they also lived in the tropics of the Old World, and beyond it, over Wallace's line.\n\nViverrids mostly live in tropical rainforest. They also live in woodland, savanna and mountains.\n\nMany viverrids are civet cats, such as the genera \"Vivera\", \"Civettictis\" and \"Viverricula\". The term refers to their noticeable and (to us) unpleasant scent. It is sometimes used for other cats which happen to be rather smelly.\n\nVivverrids of the genus \"Genetta\" are known as 'genets', and there is another genus, \"Poiana\", which are called 'linsangs'.

Their skeletons are similar to those of fossils dating back to the Eocene, up to 50 million years ago.\n\nIn external characters, they are distinguished from the Felidae by the hind foot being five-toed and typically by the longer muzzle and shorter limbs. The skull differs as does the dental formula. They have anal glands which may secrete a strong odour.

Improved relations with the king made the Storting approve the money to finish the construction. The roof was put on in 1836. The inside of the building was finished during the late 1840s.

The game is named after a beanie-wearing dog in the game, PaRappa, with his motto \"I gotta believe!\", rapping his way to win the heart of his crush, Sunny Funny, a flower. A PSP port of the original game was released in Japan in December 2006 in North America and Europe in July 2007.\n\nWhile the gameplay is not challenging for experienced gamers, the game is remembered for its unique graphic design of 2D characters and 3D objects, its quirky soundtrack and its bizarre plot. Despite being made in Japan, all of the game's songs and dialogue are spoken in English in all versions. The game is named after the main character.\n\n\"PaRappa the Rapper\" is a music game in which the main character, PaRappa, must make his way through each of the game's six stages by rapping. On each stage, the game alternates with the rapping teacher to PaRappa. There is a U 'RAPPING meter in the bottom right corner, which will show the player's performance with four levels, from top to bottom: \"Cool\", \"Good\", \"Bad\", and \"Awful\". The game works by a pattern of buttons (Triangle, Circle, Square, X, L, and R) PaRappa will have to copy. The teacher will set down a pattern and PaRappa will have to copy it. Players will stay on the \"Good\" ranking when staying to the beat. If he messes up two times in a row, he goes down a level. On the other hand, if he gets a pattern right, he moves up a level, with Good at the maximum. The player must clear the level on Good or Cool. If he clears it on Bad or Awful, or the meter goes below Awful during the game, he will have to try the level again. However, if the meter gets to Cool, the teacher will leave and PaRappa will be able to free-style. This is achieved by freestyling in a manner different to the predetermined lyric. If all of the levels are cleared with the meter on Cool, a bonus level, \"K.T and the Sunny Funny Band\", will be unlocked. However, the player must complete the game at least once before \"Cool\" can be reached.\n\nThe player takes on the role of Parappa, a paper-thin rapping dog, who is trying to win the heart of a flower-like girl named Sunny Funny. However, he is intimidated by the presence of Joe Chin, a rich, narcissistic dog who goes overboard with his attempts to impress Sunny.\n\nThe game starts with a movie, \"Jet Baby\", being watched by the four main characters, PaRappa, Sunny, Katy Kat (a blue cat), and P.J Berri (a bear). When it's finished, they go to Chunky Burger, a restaurant. Somewhere after that, two bullies come up and pick on them, but they are stopped by Joe Chin. However, he ends up chatting about his adventures, which take too long, and Sunny, P.J, and Katy leave. PaRappa thinks he should be a hero to impress Sunny, and decides to drop off at a kung-fu dojo, learning to fight with help from an onion, Chop Chop Master Onion. After that, they are at a plaza. PaRappa asks they should go down to a beach, but the others note they need a license and a car to do that. Joe Chin, once again, arrives and shows them his new car, the Super Stretched Limo 900. They all like it, until Joe Chin thinks Katy and Sunny should be with him at the front, and PaRappa and PJ all the way at the back. Both are far from amused. PaRappa then thinks if he had a car and license, he could take Sunny anywhere, and decides to drop off at a driver's education course to get his license, with help from a moose, Instructor Mooselini. After he gets his license, he still needs a car, and borrow's his dad's. He invites the others on. \"You know, this is really a lot of fun. Wouldn't it be nice if we could so somewhere far far away?\" Sunny's words echo in PaRappa's mind, and he doesn't pay attention to driving and instead thinks of him and Sunny on a date, but when their car crashes into a truck, and breaks into pieces, PaRappa has to go to a flea market owned by a frog, Prince Fleaswallow, to earn money to fix his car. Then, the day before Sunny's birthday arrives and PaRappa is assigned the job of getting a cake. However, he is knocked into the cake he spends his money on by Joe Chin, who plans to win over PaRappa with his tall 42 story high cake. Since he is almost out of money, he needs to make a cake himself, following instructions from a cooking show by a chicken, \"Cheap Cheap Chicken\". The day comes, and his cake is a success. Katy gets an idea to leave PaRappa and Sunny alone, so she and PJ leave. Later, they watch the sunset together. Unfortunately, this goes wrong when PaRappa has a sudden urge to use the bathroom after eating most of the cake later that day. Sunny, on the other hand however, confuses him for \"looking real manly today\" instead of needing to go to the backroom. They decide to go home, but PaRappa, of course, stops at the restroom and sees his previous mentors, having to out-rap all of them to reach the only toilet in the restroom. Then, one night, he is invited to Club Fun, and asks Sunny to go with him, to which she agrees. After they arrive, PaRappa gets on stage with a spider, MC King Kong Mushi, then raps solo at the end of the song to express his true feelings for Sunny. Then the game ends when they all decide to see another movie.\n\nThe characters are 2D to preserve Rodney's unique style of artwork, who designed all of the characters. He was asked to help design the game from an interview by Masaya. Like in the \"Paper Mario\" series by Nintendo, all of the characters appear to be flat, two dimensional beings cut from paper while the surroundings are primarily three dimensional. The setting is a bright urban city; with its inhabitants ranging from animals (chickens, dogs, frogs, and cats), inanimate objects (onions, flowers, hammers), and some humans.\n\nThe game spawned a merchandising campaign in Japan, a spinoff in 1999, an anime series in 2001, and a direct sequel for the PlayStation 2 in 2002. PaRappa is a playable character in \"PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale\". There is another similar game by Masaya, \"Vib Ribbon\".\n", "id": "390634", "title": "PaRappa the Rapper"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390779", "text": "Outstation\n\nIn Australia, an outstation is a small, rural settlement of Aboriginal Australians. They are usually built on or near the community's traditional country; the outstations are therefore also called homelands. The people living on an outstation are usually closely related, belonging to one or two families. The people will have a spiritual and ancestral relationship with the land. The number of people living in the settlement may rise and fall throughout the year, depending on events (such as deaths and ceremonies), but the permanent population is normally less than a few dozen. The definition of an outstation will vary greatly depending on the region, cultural group, history and state property laws. They are generally classed as residential areas on Aboriginal-owned land. They are often located near sites that are culturally important. The average outstation consists of little more than one or more houses and a source of water. They are usually very basic, and constructed entirely by the people living there. Most of these communities are located in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.\n\nIn statistical data, outstations are called \"discrete indigenous communities\". There are more than a thousand such communities in Australia. They are largely self-governing.\n\nHistorically, the word \"outstation\" referred to a dwelling or shelter on sheep or cattle stations. Such shelters were built on stations that were large enough to have more than a day's travel (by horseback) between different parts of the property. They contained beds and food for stockmen.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, a large number of Aboriginal people moved away from the towns and missions in which they had been settled years before. They returned with their families to the areas where they grew up, and set up camps or homes there. This became known as the outstation movement. For most people, it was an attempt at returning to the traditional way of life and getting back their autonomy and self-sufficiency. This movement developed after the Australian government had decided to give welfare benefits to indigenous people. It had also started policies encouraging self-determination and self-management for indigenous communities. This was the opposite of what the government had previously planned for indigenous Australians (cultural assimilation).\n\nIn October 1976, a report by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs estimated that there were more than 100 outstation communities. Most of them were located in the Northern Territory. In Arnhem Land, there were about 55 outstations by the end of 1976, with an average size of about 30 people. About 30 more were located in the southwest of the Northern Territory, ranging in size from 15 to 100 people. The Northern Territory had early success in the outstation movemnet, because the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed in the territory in 1976. This was the first Aboriginal land rights law in the country.\n\nThere are now more than a thousand outstation communities in Australia. There are about 500 in the Northern Territory, and around one-third of Aboriginal people in the Territory live on outstations.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that people living on outstations are much healthier than other Aboriginal people.\n\n", "id": "390779", "title": "Outstation"}

People with thalassaemia make less haemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal, which results in mild or severe anemia.\n\nThalassaemia can cause significant complications, including pneumonia, iron overload, bone deformities and cardiovascular illness. However, this inherited disease of red blood cells gives a degree of protection against malaria, which is or was common in the regions where the trait is common. This selective survival advantage for carriers (known as heterozygous advantage) is responsible for keeping the mutation in populations way above its mutation rate. Carriers are heterozygous for the thalassaemia allele, meaning only one of their two alleles is mutant (abnormal). There are a number of different versiona of thalassaemia. Each one is caused by a mutation in a different position in the genome.\n\nIn that respect, thalassaemia resembles another genetic disorder affecting haemoglobin, sickle-cell disease.\n\nIt is possible to cure patients with thalassaemia with bone marrow transplants from compatible donors. However, this method requires an HLA-matched compatible donor.\n", "id": "390781", "title": "Thalassaemia"}

There is a strong direct relationship between a Cepheid's luminosity and pulsation period. This makes Cepheids important standard candles for the galactic and extragalactic distance scales.\n\nCepheid variables are divided into several subclasses which exhibit clearly different masses, ages, and evolutionary histories: \n\nThe first cepheid known was Delta Cephei in the constellation Cepheus, found by John Goodricke in 1784. Delta Cephei is of great importance because its distance is extremely well known, thanks in part to it being in a star cluster, and the precise Hubble Space Telescope/Hipparcos parallaxes.\n\nClassical Cepheids (also known as Population I Cepheids, Type I Cepheids, or Delta Cephei variables) pulsate with very regular periods of the order of days to months. Classical Cepheids are population I variable stars which are 4–20 times more massive than the Sun, and up to 100,000 times more luminous. Cepheids are yellow supergiants of spectral class F6 – K2. When they pulsate, their radii change by ~25%. For the longer-period I Carinae this means millions of kilometers for a pulsation cycle.\n\nType II Cepheids (also termed Population II Cepheids) are population II variable stars which pulsate with periods between 1 and 50 days. Type II Cepheids are typically metal-poor, old (~10 giga years), low mass objects (~half the mass of the Sun). Type II Cepheids are divided into several subgroups by period.\n\nType II Cepheids are used to fix the distance to the galactic center of the Milky Way, globular clusters, and galaxies.\n", "id": "390795", "title": "Cepheid variable"}

It is thought to be the first airliner to fully use advanced things like able landing gear, an autopilot and deicing boots. \n\nThe Boeing 247 first flew on February 8, 1933. It started being used later that year. Later, planes became bigger and some had four engines. However, no big changes were made until Boeing made the Boeing 307 Stratoliner.\n\nThe Boeing 247 was an advanced plane. The design was taken from the Boeing Monomail (Models 200, 221, 221A) and the B-9 bomber. The Boeing 247 was faster than the Boeing P-12, which was the main American fighter at the time. The P-12 was did not have a roof on the cockpit, and it was a biplane. The Boeing 247 landed at just 62 mph. This meant that flaps were not needed. At just 10 mph, the back wheel came off the ground, which made it easier to steer.\n\nAlso, the 247 was the first airliner with two engines which could fly on just one engine. The Boeing 247 had special propellers. It could fly at 11,500 ft at full weight. The Douglas DC-1 and some other airliners before World War II used parts of the Boeing 247's design. The 247 was supposed to carry 14 passengers and have Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet engines, but the plane was made smaller and got different engines. \n\nThe pilots did not think that the plane, which weighed eight tons, could land on any runway back then. They also did not like the Hornet engines. This was because most pilots were used to Wasps. It was thought that they would find Hornets too powerful. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that the pilots were wrong. P&W's head, Frederick Rentschler, decided to do what the pilots wanted. This made an argument between Mead and Rentschler. \n\nEven though there were some arguments about the design and engines, the 247 was still a very good design. Boeing showed it at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.\n\nBoeing wanted to make the plane as safe as possible. They made the plane strong and put in things to make passengers more comfortable. For example, the cabin had air conditioning. It was also sound-proof. The plane had a pilot, co-pilot and a flight attendant. The wheels did not fully go into the plane. A part of the wheels hung down below the plane. This was done to make it safer for the plane to land if the landing gear could not be put down. The wheel at the back of the plane could not be moved.\n\nIn 1934, Boeing put a Boeing 247 into the MacRobertson Race. In the race, planes raced from England to Australia. The pilots of the Boeing plane were Col.Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn. The 247 was basically a normal plane, but some parts were taken out to make space for more fuel tanks. Many different planes from all over the world took part. Turner and Pangborn came in second place. The Douglas DC-2 came first.\n\nThe Boeing 247 won the 1934 US Collier Trophy for \"excellence in aviation design\".\n\nThe 247 could go across the United States eight hours faster than any plane which came before it. The Boeing 247 started being used on May 22, 1933. One set a record of 19½ hours when it flew from San Francisco to New York. \n\nThe first 60 247s were sold to Boeing Air Transport (part of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, UATC). They cost $65,000 each. TWA (Transcontinental & Western Air) also ordered the 247 but UATC said no. TWA President Jack Frye asked for a new airliner. He paid Don Douglas to design and build the Douglas DC-1 prototype. Douglas eventually made the DC-3 line.\n\nThe Boeing 247 was shown to have some serious problems with its design. Air carriers did not like the fact that it only carried 10 passengers. The DC-2 and later DC-3 could carry many more passengers. This meant that the Boeing 247 would not earn airlines as much money. \n\nSeventy-five 247s were built. Douglas got 800 orders for DC-3s from airlines before the Pearl Harbor attack. Douglas made over 10,000 DC-3s.\n\nMany of United's Boeing 247s were bought by Western Air Express. It was said that they were bought at a very low price.\n\nThe 247 was used until World War II. The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) had seven 247s to move soldiers around. Some 247s were still flying in the late 1960s. These were either cargo planes or personal planes. \n\nOctober 10, 1933 – A United Air Lines 247 was blown up by a bomb.\n\nNovember 9, 1933 - A United Air Lines 247 crashed after it took off. Four of the nine people on the plane died.\n\nDecember 20, 1934 - United Air Lines Flight 6, a 247, crashed near Western Springs, Illinois. Nobody died. The plane was fixed and started flying again.\n\nOctober 7, 1935 – United Air Lines Trip 4, a 247D, crashed 10 miles to the west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. It is not known why it crashed. Everybody on the plane died.\n\nOctober 30, 1935 - A United Air Lines Boeing 247D crashed near Cheyenne. Everyone on board died.\n\nDecember 15, 1936 – Seven people died when Western Air Express Flight 6, a 247D, crashed on Lone Peak in Utah. \n\nDecember 27, 1936 - United Air Lines Trip 34, a 247D, crashed in Los Angeles County, California. All 12 people on board died.\n\nJanuary 12, 1937 – Western Air Express Flight 7, a 247, crashed into a mountain in Newhall, California. Five people died.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "390902", "title": "Boeing 247"}
