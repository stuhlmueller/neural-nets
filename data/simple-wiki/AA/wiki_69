The head office is based in Boston, Massachusetts. It employs over 45,000 people in over 900 offices around the world.\nThey are the third largest property and casualty insurer in the United States based on 2010 written premium. \n\nThe company sells a lot of different insurance products, like car insurance, home insurance and business insurance. It also owns other insurance companies (completely or partly) in countries like Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, India, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela, and Vietnam. \n\nThe current head of the business (CEO) is Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly. He was appointed CEO in 1998.\n\nLiberty Mutual started in 1912 under the name \"Massachusetts Employees’ Insurance Association\" (MEIA). The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and through partnerships with other companies, they started to sell full cover car policies. \n\nIn 1964 Liberty Mutual began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance part of the business.\n\nOver the years, Liberty Mutual has bought a number of other large companies. As an example, in 2008 they bought the Safeco Corporation. Liberty Mutual agreed to buy all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total price of approximately $6.2 billion.\n\nIn 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety was started. It studies safety and health of people at work. Its work has helped to specify machine safeguarding guidelines (how to work safely with machines), the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines. They helped to form the basis for national and international safety standards. \n\nThe Institute's scientists do field and laboratory experiments on the main causes of work-related injury and disability. They publish their findings in scientific literature. The findings are the basis for safety programs, advice and software. They are used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants to help policyholders improve worker safety. The Institute’s work is available to the public.\n", "id": "294063", "title": "Liberty Mutual"}

It begins in the central highlands of New South Wales near the town of Oberon. The river flows northwest past the towns of Bathurst, Wellington, Dubbo, Narromine, and Warren to the Macquarie Marshes. The Macquarie Marshes then drain into the lower Barwon River and then into the Darling River\n\nBurrendong Dam is a large dam (capacity 1,190,000 Megalitres) near Wellington which holds the waters of the Macquarie River and its tributaries the Cudgegong River and the Turon River to stop floods and provide water for irrigation. The dam made Lake Burrendong.\n\nThe Macquarie River flows for 626 kilometres and drops around 517 metres over its length. Lake Burrendong (346m) is the only dam on the river.\n\nThe Macquarie River starts at White Rock, near Oberon at an elevation of 671m.\n\nSix rivers flow into the Macquarie River:\n\nThere are 19 creeks that flow into the Macquarie River:\n\n\n\nThe Macquarie system covers an area of more than 74,000 square kilometres. Over 72% of land is flat, and 17% is hilly. The rest is steep to mountainous, reaching 900 metres.\nThe east boundary is formed by the Great Dividing Range, from near Oberon in the south to Coolah in the north. A mountain ridge goes north-west from the Great Dividing Range for about 400 kilometres, then the boundary turns north.\n\nFrom Bathurst, near the start of the river it passes the following geographic areas:\n\nRainfall varies across the area drained by the Macquarie River. The mountain the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges. The Great Dividing Range area receives between 750 to 900 mm annual median rainfall. This is falls evenly throughout the year. Gaps in the Dividing Range allows moist easterly air to pass inland, annual median rainfall of 750 mm or more is experienced further westward. Further north-west it is drier, in the Castelreagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is 300 to 400 mm.\n\nRainfall can vary dramatically over several years. Records show that rainfall can be 200% or less than 50% of the average annual figure. Evaporation varies from less than 1000 mm south-east of Bathurst up to more than 2000 mm at Bourke.\n\nThe Wiradjuri people are the original people to live in the Macquarie River area. The Wiradjuri called the river \"Wambool\". The famous Wiradjuri warrior Windradyne came from the upper Macquarie River region. He was killed in a tribal battle alongside the river in 1829.\n\nNear Carinda between the Macquarie River and Marra Creek, the oldest evidence of bread making in the world (about 30,000 years old) was found at an ancient lake known as Cuddie Springs.\n\nThe upper parts of the Macquarie River were first seen by Europeans in 1813. The river was named for the Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie. In 1813 surveyor George Evans wrote in his journal:\n\n\"Tuesday, 30th November 1813.\" I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles, where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance; A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off;\n\n\"Thursday, 9th December 1813.\" I have called the Main Stream \"Macquarie River\".\n\nIn 1817-18 John Oxley followed the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers. In 1828 Charles Sturt proved that Macquarie River ended in marshes. He discovered the Darling River\n\nThe Macquarie River area is a regulated Water Management Area and includes private irrigation as well as several public irrigation schemes\n\nThe Macquarie River has a history of flooding. After major floods water can flow past the Macquarie Marshes and into the Barwon-Darling river system upstream of Brewarrina.\n\nRecreational activities are popular along the length of the river particularly in the communities it passes by.\n\n\n", "id": "294078", "title": "Macquarie River"}

Super Janemba's immense power level allows him to easily deal with Super Saiyan 3 Goku, Pikkon, and Vegeta, who had been given his body temporarily to help fight Janemba. Eventually, Goku and Vegeta fuse, but something goes wrong, and they become a very fat and weak fusion named Veku. King Kai blames the messed up fusion on Vegeta, because he did not stretch his index finger out. Veku propels himself away from Super Janemba for the next 30 minutes by farting.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294113", "text": "Gas chromatography\n\nGas chromatography is a type of chromatography. The sample that is going to be tested is first turned into a gas, and then carried through a column by a nonreactive 'carrier' gas such as helium or other inert gas such as nitrogen. As the sample is carried through the column it is separated into its individual components. To achieve this the column is housed inside an oven, where the temperature is controlled to allow the individual components to exit the column at different times.\n\nIn selecting a carrier gas it is important to select a gas that will not react with the components of the sample. The carrier gas should also be able to withstand high temperatures due to the oven. The flow rate of the carrier gas is important in that if it is too high there is not enough time for the sample to interact with the column and no separation will be seen, if it is too slow the experiment may take a very long time.\n\nThe main type of columns used in gas chromatography is a capillary column. Packed columns are created of fused silica or stainless steel. To increase separation of a gas sample columns must be created of a large length and are coiled to fit inside of the oven. Capillary columns are separated into two categories; wall coated open tubular and support coated open tubular. WCOT are capillary tubes with a thin layer of stationary phase, and in SCOT, the tube is lined with a thin film of support material. As the sample moves through the column the individual parts of the sample become contained with the material inside of the column and are then released. This action allows for a sample to become separated.\n\nIt is important that the oven is capable of maintaining a constant temperature. Since movement of the sample through the column relies on the boiling point of the sample being analyzed, the oven should be set to a temperature that is slightly higher than its boiling point. For samples with a large boiling range, a temperature program can be used, in which the column temperature is raised. By using a high temperature, the sample moves through the column faster, while at lower temperatures the sample moves slower, but better resolution is achieved.\n\nMany types of detectors are used in gas chromatographic separations, with the most common are flame ionization, thermal conductivity, and mass spectrometry detectors. In a flame ionization detectors, the separated sample from the column is directed into a flame. By creating a voltage near the burner tip and the detector, the ions that are produced from the flame travel towards the detector. Flame detectors are not capable of detecting HO, CO, SO, and CO. \n\nWith a thermal conductivity detector, the sample from the column is passed into an area that is electrically heated. The thermal conductivity of the column is reduced when the sample passes over by. When this occurs the detector heats up and measures the change in resistance. The thermal conductivity detector is capable of detecting all types of compounds.\n\nA mass spectrometer measures the mass to charge ratio of fragmented ions of a sample. The output of a column can be feed directly into the ionization chamber of the mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometry detector is capable of being able to obtain information from incompletely separated components. Two types of mass spectrometer detectors used are quadrupole and time of flight mass analyzers. In a quadrupole detector, a voltage is produced which makes ions of a specific mass to travel to the detector. In a time of flight mass analyzer, the speed of an ion is measured allowing the mass to charge ratio to be known.\n\nGas chromatography is regularly used to describe what is inside a complex sample. The information obtained from gas chromatography is placed into a graph of detector response versus the time the sample leaves the column. If the separate parts of a complex sample come out at different times far apart from one another it is possible to determine what came out of the column.\n\nIf a sample is compared to a standard calibration it is possible to know how much of a separated part of the sample makes up the sample. This is useful in monitoring quality of a product such as medicine, beverage, or perfume.\n", "id": "294113", "title": "Gas chromatography"}

In ordinary language it means correct or in the right form.\n\nAn argument is valid if it seems appropriate, well-grounded and can be defended. A contract is valid if it is enforceable in law. In other words, it applies legally to a particular situation. A bank-note is valid if it can be exchanged and used for purchase, and a passport is valid if it lets the holder come in and go out of a country. A will is valid if correctly made, and certified by an appropriate court. In all these cases, valid refers to the soundness in some situation. Logical uses of this idea are similar, but phrased much more exactly.\n\nIt is nothing to do with ordinary ideas of truth. Truth points outwards to the world. Validity, on the other hand, points inwards to the syllogism.\n\nThe conclusion of a valid argument is a logical consequence of its premises. An example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known syllogism:\n\n\nAnd it is not true that Socrates was green.\n\n\nThe problem with the argument is that it is not \"sound\".

She was canonized (\"made a saint\") on 1 May ca. 870 by Pope Adrian II. \n\nWalpurga's feast day is on 25 February. The day of her canonization, 1 May, was also celebrated during the high medieval period. Especially in the 11th century under Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. Walpurgis Night is the eve of May Day, celebrated in folklore in Europe with dancing.\n\nTogether with her brothers, Saint Willibald and Saint Winibald, she travelled to Francia (now Württemberg and Franconia) to help her uncle, Saint Boniface, in evangelizing among the Germans. She was educated by the nuns of Winborne Abbey, Dorset, where she spent twenty-six years. Thanks to her rigorous training, she was later able to write St. Winibald's \"biography\" and an account in Latin of St. Willibald's travels in Palestine. She is often credited with being the first female author of both England and Germany. \n\nShe became a nun and lived in the double monastery of Heidenheim am Hahnenkamm near Eichstätt, which was founded by her brother, Willibald. After his death in 751, she became abbess. Walburga died on 25 February 777 or 779 and was buried at Heidenheim. In the 870s, her remains were brought to Eichstätt. \n\nAt Eichstätt, her bones were placed in a rocky hole in the wall. The bones began to produce, it was said, a miraculously therapeutic oil. This made people come to her shrine.\n\nThe earliest picture of Walpurga is from the early 11th century. It comes from the Hitda Codex, which was made in Cologne. It shows her holding stylized stalks of grain. The grain can be seen as an example of where a Christian saint (Walpurga) took over from an older pagan concept, in this case of the Grain Mother. \n\nWalpurga is the patroness of Eichstätt, Antwerp, Oudenaarde, Veurne, Groningen, Zutphen and other towns in the Low Countries.\n", "id": "294253", "title": "Saint Walburga"}

It honors Leif Ericson, the Norse explorer who brought the first Europeans known to have set foot in North America. \n\n\"America Not Discovered by Columbus\" by Rasmus B. Anderson was published in 1874. This book helped make popular the idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World. In 1925, American President Calvin Coolidge recognised Leif Erikson as the Discoverer of America. This was due to research by Norwegian-American scholars such as Knut Gjerset and Ludvig Hektoen. \n\nIn 1930, Wisconsin became the first state to officially adopt Leif Erikson Day as a state holiday. A year later, the state of Minnesota did the same. By 1956, Leif Erikson Day was an official holiday seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota, South Dakota, Illinois, Colorado, Washington, and California) and one Canadian province (Saskatchewan). \n\nIn 1963, the U.S. Representative from Duluth, John Blatnik, introduced a bill to observe Leif Erikson Day in the rest of the United States. In 1964, the United States Congress authorized and requested the President to create the observance through a yearly proclamation. Lyndon B. Johnson and each President since have done so. Presidents have used the proclamation to praise the spirit of discovery and the contributions of Americans of Nordic descent generally. Some states officially commemorate Leif Erikson Day, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where large numbers of people from the Nordic countries settled.\n\nOctober 9th is not related with any event in Leif Erikson's life. The date was chosen because the ship \"Restauration\" coming from Stavanger, Norway, arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825. This was the start of the first organized immigration from Norway to the United States.\n\nSample proclamations:\n\n", "id": "294289", "title": "Leif Erikson Day"}

This became a duchy (\"lands ruled by a duke or duchess\") of the Holy Roman Empire, in the Low Countries.\n\nThe duchy was named after the town of Geldern (\"Gelder\") in what is now called Germany. The present province of Gelderland (English also \"Guelders\") in the Netherlands occupies most of the area. However, the former duchy also included parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg and the territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713. \n\nThe duchy had four special parts, which had their own centres:\nand was separated from the Lower Quarters (Gelderland):\n\nThe county was first mentioned in about 1096, when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as \"Count of Guelders\". It was then in the territory of Lower Lorraine, in the area of Geldern and Roermond. Its main stronghold was at Montfort (built 1260). Count Gerard's son Gerard II in 1127 got the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage. In the 12th and 13th century, Guelders became larger very quickly downstream along the sides of the Maas, Rhine, and IJssel rivers. It even claimed the lands in the Duchy of Limburg. In 1288, it lost the Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant.\n\nGuelders was often at war with its neighbours. Not only with Brabant, but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. Its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare, it also did very well in times of peace. William II, count of both Holland and Zeeland, gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan. However he was not able to repay the debts, so these lands became integral parts of Guelders. \n\nIn 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders became a duke as ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach. When Reginald died without an heir in 1371, William I of Jülich inherited Guelders. In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond. Duke Adolf was fighting with his father Arnold about the inheritance of the land. Arnold came under pressure from the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold, who put him in prison in 1471. When Arnold died in 1473, Duke Charles added Guelders to his Burgundian Netherlands.\n\nThe last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf's son Charles of Egmond (1492-1538). He increased the size of the duchy northward, and included what is now the Province of Overijssel. He left the duchy to Duke William the Rich of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in his will. However, he was not able to hold on to it and Emperor Charles V of Habsburg soon moved in. Guelders finally lost its independence, when it was united with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543.\n\nCharles V stood down in 1556. He decided that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be part of the monarchy of Spain. The northern Netherlands stood up against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt. The three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces when the 1581 Act of Abjuration was agreed. Only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands. \n\nThe Treaty of Utrecht ended the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713. The Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders (Geldern, Viersen, Horst, Venray), the United Provinces (Venlo, Montfort, Echt), Austria (Roermond, Niederkrüchten, Weert), and the Duchy of Jülich (Erkelenz). \n\nIn 1795 Guelders was conquered and incorporated by the French First Republic. It was divided between the départements of Roer and Meuse-Inférieure.\n\nThe coat of arms of the region changed during the ages.\n\n", "id": "294291", "title": "Guelders"}

They belonged to the Asaf Jah dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal Empire fell apart and the viceroy in Hyderabad said he was independent. From 1798 Hyderabad was one of the princely states of British India, but it kept local control.\n\nSeven Nizams ruled Hyderabad for two centuries until Indian independence in 1947. The Asaf Jahi rulers used money to support much literature, art, architecture, culture, jewelry and rich food. The Nizams ruled the state until September 1948 after independence from the British.\n\nThe Asaf Jahi dynasty began near Samarkand. The family came to India from Baghdad in the late 17th century. They were direct descendants of the first Khalifa of Islam, Hazrat Sayyadina Abu bakr Siddiq Razi Allahutaala Anha.\n\nNizām-ul-mulk was a title first used in Urdu around 1600. It comes from the Arabic word, nizām (), meaning \"order, arrangement\". The Nizam was also called Ala Hadrat, Ala Hazrat, or Nizam Sarkar.\n\nThe first Nizam ruled in place of the Mughal emperors. After Aurangzeb died, the Nizams left the Mughals to make an independent kingdom. When the British got power over India, the Nizams were allowed to continue to rule for the British. The Nizams kept power in Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948. Hyderabad then became part of the new Indian Union.\n\nThe Asaf Jah dynasty had only seven rulers. However, for 13 years after the rule of the first Nizam, three of his sons (Nasir Jung, Muzafar Jung and Salabath Jung) ruled. They were not officially recognized as the rulers.\n\nA legend about the first Nizam says that, on one of his hunting trips he was offered some kulchas (an Indian bread) by a holy man. He asked the Nizam to eat as many as he could. The Nizam ate seven kulchas and the holy man predicted that seven generations of his family would rule the state.\n\nBy tradition no Nizam has ever left India, even if there was good a reason.\n\nHyderabad did not join the first war of Indian Independence of 1857 against the British. Therefore its Royal Family had special, official status of \"Faithful Ally\" with Britain.\n\nThe Asaf Jahis were built many palaces.\n\nOther landmarks like the Andhra Pradesh High Court, Jubilee Hall, Asafia library, The Assembly building, the Osmania Arts College and the Osmania Medical College are some of their important buildings.\n\nThe Nizams liked the European style of architecture and created a fusion of European traditions with Hindu and Islamic forms and images.\n\nAfter the British left India in 1947, the princely state of Hyderabad did not join either of the new dominions of India or Pakistan. But later he decided to merge with pakistan. But sardar patel ordered the Indian to attack hyderabad. The Indian army entered hyderabad from four sides killed hyderabad nizams army men the razakaars. Killed lakhs of muslims. This was a genocide.The Nizam's rule ended on 17 September 1948. His soldiers surrendered to Indian soldiers.\n\nAll Nizams are buried in the royal graves at the Makkah Masjid near Charminar in Hyderabad. Only the last Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan is buried in a different place. His mausoleum is in the Judi Mosque facing King Kothi Palace.\n\n\n\"The Days of the Beloved\" Harriet Ronken Lynton and Mohini Rajan, Berkeley University Press\n\n", "id": "294434", "title": "Nizam of Hyderabad"}

He reigned as King of Prussia from 1840 to 1861. \n\nFrederick William was educated by private tutors. He served in the army during the War of Liberation against Napoleon I of France in 1814, but he was not interested in the army. He loved both architecture and landscape gardening and was a patron of several great German artists, such as architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the composer Felix Mendelssohn. He married Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria in 1823, but the couple had no children.\n\nFrederick William was Romanticist, and had a nostalgia for the Middle Ages, therefore he was conservative already at an early age. He was against both liberalisation and unification of Germany and preferred to allow Austria to remain the first power in the German states.\n\nIn the beginning of his reign he did not continue the reactionary policies of his father, he reduced press censorship and promised a constitution, but he did not want a popular legislative assembly, but preferred to work with the aristocracy. He was Lutheran, but he released the imprisoned Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cologne, and he decided to help the construction of Cologne Cathedral. In 1844, he attended the celebrations of the completion of the cathedral, so he was the first king of Prussia who entered a Roman Catholic building. When he finally called a national assembly in 1847, it was not a representative body, but rather a United Diet which cold speak for all the provincial estates and had the right to grant taxes and loans but no right to meet at regular intervals.\n\nWhen revolution broke out in Prussia in March 1848, as part of the European Revolutions of 1848, the king initially decided to fight it with the army, but later decided to recall the troops and place himself at the head of the movement on 19 March. He committed himself to German unification, formed a liberal government, accepted a national assembly, and ordered that a Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia should be drawn up. When his position was more secure again, however, he quickly led the army to reoccupy Berlin and dissolved the assembly in December. But he was still in favour of unification for some time. So the Frankfurt Parliament offered him the crown of Germany on 3 April 1849. He did not accept it, but he tried to establish a union of German states excluding Austria. But rather soon after gave up this plan, when Austria did not accept it.\n\nWhen he had dismissed the national assembly, Frederick William decided to have a constitution with a parliament with two chambers, an aristocratic upper house and an elected lower house. The lower house was elected by all taxpayers, but in a system that was based on the amount of taxes paid so that the rich had more influence than the poor. The constitution also reserved for the king the power to appoint all ministers and reestablished the conservative district assemblies and provincial diets. And it guaranteed that the bureaucracy and the military remained firmly in the hands of the king. This was a more liberal system than had existed in Prussia before 1848, but was still a conservative system of government in which the monarch, the aristocracy, and the military kept most of the power. This constitution lasted until the end of the Prussian kingdom in 1918.\n\nAfter a stroke in 1857 the king was partially paralyzed and largely mentally weak, therefore his brother William became regent from 1858 until the king's death in 1861, then he became king himself as William I.\n\nFrederick William IV of Prussia: \"Die Königin von Borneo.

The reports show that the share of nuclear-generated electricity in the overall global energy production has decreased in the 2000s. Nuclear power now accounts for about 13 percent of the world’s electricity generation and 5.5 percent of primary energy.\nThe \"World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010-2011\" is authored by Mycle Schneider, Antony Froggatt, and Steve Thomas and published by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute. The foreword is written by Amory Lovins.\nAccording to the report, the international nuclear power industry has been unable to stop the slow decline of nuclear energy. The world’s reactor fleet is aging quickly and not enough new units are coming online. As of April 1, 2011, there were 437 nuclear reactors operating in the world, which was seven fewer than in 2002. The Olkiluoto plant has had particular problems:\n\nThe flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in Finland, managed by the largest nuclear builder in the world, AREVA NP, has turned into a financial fiasco. The project is four years behind schedule and at least 90 percent over budget, reaching a total cost estimate of €5.7 billion ($8.3 billion) or close to €3,500 ($5,000) per kilowatt.\nThe report says that the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have made things more difficult for nuclear energy. There is \"no obvious sign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn empirically evident downward trend into a promising future\", and the Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to accelerate the decline. With long lead times of 10 years and more, it will be difficult to maintain, let alone increase, the number of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years.

Thornton was ready to sail back to the area between the rivers Orinoco and Amazon in the summer of 1609 with Italian settlers from Livorno and Lucca, but the project was scrapped.\n\nThornton's galleon 'Santa Lucia' returned to Italy in 1609 with plenty of information (after exploring the area between Trinidad island and the delta of the Amazon river), some indigenous natives of the Americas and a few tropical parrots.\n\nHe brought back with him to Tuscany five Arawak natives, most of whom died of smallpox. Only one lived on at the Medici court for several years, and learned to speak Italian. These natives often talked about the richness and fertility of their native land, speaking of a country rich in silver and gold. Thornton himself corroborated these reports, and asserted that the country was rich in rosewood, wild sugar canes, white pepper, balsam, cotton and many other kinds of merchandise which would form an abundant commerce for the Tuscans.\n\nThe area that Thornton considered as a possible site of an Italian colony now lies in modern French Guyana, near Cayenne, which would be colonised by France in 1630.\n\nThe Italians never created real colonies in the Americas, and only made territorial colonies in other areas of the world mainly after their political unification in the 19th century.\n\nMany Italians (and similarly Germans) moved to America to live under other flags and created the settlements of emigrants, sometimes called called \"colonies\". Those settlements where made by groups of Italian emigrants who settled together in the same place and around the same time, founding a settlement that still exists today in many cases.\n\nThat was the first Italian settlement of this kind made in Venezuela by Luigi Castelli, who wanted to settle in the late 1830s Italian emigrants from Tuscany in the same area where a few years later German emigrants settled and created the \"Colonia Tovar\" (unluckily their ship sank in the Mediterranean).\n\nMany of these Italian settlements were created in the second half of the 19th century, mainly in Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Southern Region of Brazil (Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul).\n\nIn most of those settlements the Italian language (and dialects) is still spoken today: like in \"Capitán Pastene\" of Chile, in \"Chipilo\" of Mexico or in \"Nova Veneza\" of Santa Catarina (where it is spoken the \"Talian\" of Brasil).\n\nNone of these settlements are related to the Italian colonial empire of the 20th century.\n\n", "id": "294519", "title": "Attempted Italian colonization of America"}

The first monastery he established was at Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most famous person is the Dalai Lama. There are others Gelug Masters, like Trijang Rinpoche and Ling Rinpoche.\n\nTsongkhapa was a big promoter of the Kadampa (Bka'-gdams-pa) teachings and the mahāyāna principle of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation. He combined this with a strong emphasis on the cultivation of in-depth insight into the doctrine of emptiness as taught by the Indian masters Nāgārjuna (2nd century) and Candrakīrti (7th century). Tsongkhapa said that these two aspects of the spiritual path, compassion and insight into wisdom, must be rooted in a big wish for liberation driven by a genuine sense of renunciation. He called these the \"Three Principal Aspects of the Path\", and said that it is on the basis of these three that one must embark on the profound path of vajrayāna Buddhism.\n\nThe central teachings of the Gelug School are the Stages of the Path (\"lamrim\"), based on the teachings of the Indian master Atiśa (c. 11th century) and the systematic cultivation of the view of emptiness. This is combined with the yogas of highest yoga tantra deities such as Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, Yamāntaka and Kālacakra, where the key focus is the direct experience of the union of bliss and emptiness.\n", "id": "294538", "title": "Gelug"}

Still, the \"Encyclopédie\" is famous above all for representing the thought of the Enlightenment. According to Denis Diderot in the article \"Encyclopédie\", the \"Encyclopédie\"'s aim was \"to change the way people think.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopédie\" was conceived as a translation of Ephraim Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" (1728). In 1743, the translation was given by the Parisian book publisher André Le Breton to John Mills, an Englishman living in France. In May 1745, Le Breton announced the work as available for sale, but Mills had not done the work. Le Breton beat Mills with a cane. Mills sued for assault, but Le Breton was set free because he was justified. For his new editor, Le Breton chose mathematician Jean Paul de Gua de Malves. In August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being a poor leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and Jean d'Alembert as the new editors. Diderot would remain editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the \"Encyclopédie\" through to completion.\n\nMany of the most noted figures of the French Enlightenment contributed to the \"Encyclopédie\", including Voltaire, Rousseau, and Baron d'Holbach.

The Rhyslings are named for a character in a science fiction story: the blind poet Rhysling, in Robert A. Heinlein's short story \"The Green Hills of Earth\". Two awards are given: \"Best Long Poem\", for poetry of 50 or more lines, and \"Best Short Poem\", for works of 49 or fewer lines.\n\nThe members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association (SFPA) choose several possible winners (nominees) for each year's Rhysling Awards. Each member may name one work that should win in each category. All of the nominees are published in a book called \"The Rhysling Anthology\". Members of the Association then vote on the final winners. Since 2005, the Awards have been presented in July at a ceremony at Readercon. The \"Best Short Poem\" category allows very short poems to be entered.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294713", "text": "Civil parishes in England\n\nIn England, a civil parish is a unit of local government. Civil parishes are the lowest tier of local government, below districts and counties. It is an administrative parish, in comparison to an ecclesiastical (church) parish.\n\nThe parish council can decide to call itself a town, village, neighbourhood or community; and in a limited number of cases has city status granted by the monarch. Civil parishes only cover part of England; about 35% of the population. \n\nThere are currently no civil parishes in Greater London, and before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a London Borough.\n\nThe creation of ancient parishes was linked to the manorial system. The parishes often shared the same boundaries as the manor of the local lord. At first the manor was the main unit of local administration and justice in the early rural economy. Eventually the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe. Responsibilitfor things such as relief of the poor passed from the Lord of the Manor to the church, but in practice it was administered by monasteries. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the power to charge (levy) a rate to fund relief of the poor was given to the parish authorities by the 1601 Act for the Relief of the Poor.\n\nThe parish authorities were known as vestries and were made up of all the inhabitants of the parish. As the population was growing it became increasingly difficult to hold meetings as an open vestry. In some, mostly built up, areas the select vestry took over responsibility from the community at large. This innovation improved efficiency, but allowed governance by a self-perpetuating elite. The administration of the parish system relied on the monopoly of the Church of England. As religious membership became more fractured, such as through the revival of Methodism, the legitimacy of the parish vestry came into question and the perceived inefficiency and corruption inherent in the system became a source for concern. Because of this scepticism, during early the 19th century the parish progressively lost its powers to ad-hoc boards and other organisations, such as the loss of responsibility for poor relief through the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. The replacement boards were each able to levy their own rate in the parish. The church rate ceased to be levied in many areas and was abolished altogether in 1868.\n\nThe ancient parishes split into two distinct units during the 19th century. The Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared that all areas that levied a separate rate —extra-parochial areas, townships, and chapelries— become civil parishes as well. The parishes for church use continued unchanged as ecclesiastical parishes. The latter part of the 19th century saw most of the ancient irregularities inherited by the civil system cleaned up, with the majority of exclaves abolished.\n\nCivil parishes in their modern sense were established afresh in 1894, by the Local Government Act 1894. The Act abolished vestries, and established elected parish councils in all rural civil parishes with more than 300 electors. These were grouped into rural districts. Boundaries were altered to avoid parishes being split between counties. Urban parishes continued to exist, and boundaries were usually changed to be the same as the urban district or municipal borough in which they were situated. Large towns originally split between multiple parishes were, for the most part, eventually joined into one parish. No parish councils were formed for urban parishes, and their only function was as areas electing guardians to Poor Law Unions. With the abolition of the poor law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence.\n\nIn 1965 civil parishes in London were formally abolished when Greater London was created, as the legislative framework for Greater London did not make provision for any local government body below a London Borough (since all of London was previously part of a metropolitan borough, municipal borough or urban district, no actual parish councils were abolished). In 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas and small urban areas, but abolished them in larger urban areas. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs that were being abolished rather than succeeded were continued as new parishes. Urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes were refused this permission and became unparished areas. The Act also led to the possibility of sub-division of all districts (apart from London boroughs, reformed in 1965), into multiple civil parishes. For example, Oxford, whilst entirely unparished in 1974, now has four civil parishes, covering part of its area.\n\nThe creation of town and parish councils is encouraged in unparished areas. The Local Government and Rating Act 1997 gave local residents the right to demand that a new parish and council be created in unparished areas. This was extended to London boroughs by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 - with this, the City of London is at present the only part of England where civil parishes cannot be created. \n\nIf enough electors in an area of a proposed new parish (ranging from 50% in an area with less than 500 electors to 10% in one with more than 2,500) sign a petition demanding its creation, then the local district council or unitary authority must consider the proposal. Recently established parish councils include Daventry (2003), Folkestone (2004), and Brixham (2007). In 2003 seven new parish councils were set up for Burton upon Trent, and in 2001 the Milton Keynes urban area became entirely parished, with ten new parishes being created. In 2003, the village of Great Coates (Grimsby) regained parish status. Parishes can also be abolished where there is evidence that this in response to \"justified, clear and sustained local support\" from the area's inhabitants. Examples include Birtley, which was abolished in 2006 and Southsea abolished in 2010.\n\nEvery civil parish has a parish meeting, consisting of all the electors of the parish. Generally a meeting is held once a year. A civil parish may have a parish council which exercises various local responsibilities given by statute. If a parish has fewer than 200 electors it is usually deemed too small to have a parish council, and instead will only have a parish meeting; an example of direct democracy. Alternatively several small parishes can be grouped together and share a common parish council, or even a common parish meeting. In places where there is no civil parish (unparished areas), the administration of the activities normally undertaken by the parish becomes the responsibility of the district or borough council. There are about 8,700 parish and town councils in England, and about 1,500 parishes with only parish meetings. Since 1997 around 100 new civil parishes have been created, in some cases splitting existing civil parishes, but mostly by creating new ones from unparished areas.\n\nTypical activities undertaken by parish or town councils include:\n\n\nThe role played by parish councils varies. Smaller parish councils have only limited resources and generally play only a minor role, while some larger parish councils have a role similar to that of a small non-metropolitan district. Parish councils receive funding by levying a \"precept\" on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish.\n\nParish councils are run by volunteer councillors who are elected to serve for four years and are not paid. Some councils have chosen to pay their elected members a small allowance as permitted under Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2000 The Local Authorities (Members’ Allowances) (England) Regulations 2003. The number of councillors varies roughly in proportion to the population of the parish. Most parish councillors are elected to represent the entire parish, though in parishes with larger populations or those that cover large areas, the parish can be divided into wards. These wards then return a certain number of councillors each to the parish council (depending on their population). Only if there are more candidates standing for election than there are seats on the council will an election be held. However, sometimes there are fewer candidates than seats. When this happens, the vacant seats have to be filled by co-option by the council. When a vacancy arises for a seat mid-term, an election is only held if a certain number (usually 10) of parish residents request an election. Otherwise the council will co-opt someone to be the replacement councillor. Every Parish Council in England must adopt a code of conduct, and parish councillors must comply with its standards, enforced by the Standards Board for England.\n\nA parish can have city status but only if that is granted by the Crown. In England, there are currently eight parishes with city status, all places with long-established Anglican cathedrals: Chichester, Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Ripon, Salisbury, Truro and Wells.\n\nThe council of an ungrouped parish may unilaterally pass a resolution giving the parish the status of a town. The parish council becomes a \"town council\". Around 400 parish councils are called town councils. \n\nUnder the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, a civil parish may now be given an \"alternative style\" meaning one of the following:\n\n\nThe chairman of a town council will have the title \"town mayor\" and that of a parish council which is a city will usually have the title of mayor. As a result, a parish council can also be called a town council, a community council, a village council or occasionally a city council (though most cities are not parishes but principal areas, or in England specifically metropolitan boroughs, non-metropolitan districts).\n\nWhen a city or town has been abolished as a borough, and it is considered desirable to maintain continuity of the charter, the charter may be transferred to a parish council for its area. Where there is no such parish council, the district council may appoint charter trustees to whom the charter and the arms of the former borough will belong. The charter trustees (who consist of the councillor or councillors for the area of the former borough) maintain traditions such as mayoralty. An example of such a city was Hereford, whose city council was merged in 1998 to form a unitary Herefordshire. The area of the city of Hereford remained unparished until 2000 when a parish council was created for the city. The charter trustees for the City of Bath make up the majority of the councillors on Bath and North East Somerset Council.\n\nCivil parishes do not cover the whole of England. There are none in Greater London and very few in the other conurbations. Civil parishes vary greatly in size: many cover tiny hamlets with populations of less than 100, whereas some large parishes cover towns with populations of tens of thousands. Weston-super-Mare, with a population of 71,758, is the most populous civil parish. In many cases, several small villages are in a single parish. Large urban areas are mostly unparished, as the government at the time of the Local Government Act 1972 discouraged their creation for large towns or their suburbs, but there is generally nothing to stop their establishment. For example, Birmingham has a parish, New Frankley, whilst Oxford has four, and Northampton has seven. Parishes could not however be established in London until the changing of the law in 2007 and as yet none have been established there.\n\nThe 2001 census recorded several parishes with no inhabitants. These were Chester Castle (in the middle of Chester city centre), Newland with Woodhouse Moor, Beaumont Chase, Martinsthorpe, Meering, Stanground North (subsequently abolished), Sturston, Tottington, and Tyneham. The last three had been taken over by the British Armed Forces during World War II and remain deserted.\n\nAncient parishes often had detached parts, exclaves and enclaves which were not joined to the rest of the parish. In some cases the detached part was in a different county. In other cases, an entire parish was in a detached part of the county to which it belonged. There were also many examples of parishes divided between two or more counties.\n\nThese anomalies were mostly fixed in the 19th century. Before civil parishes were introduced, the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 transferred many (but not all) parishes which were detached parts of a county to the county in which they were geographically located. The remaining detached parishes were transferred in the 1890s and in 1931. The detached part of the parish of Tetworth, Huntingdonshire, surrounded by Cambridgeshire, remained until the boundaries were changed in 1965. \n\nOther laws, including the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882, eliminated most instances of civil parishes belonging to two (or more) counties, and by 1901 Stanground in Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely was the sole remaining example. Stanground was split into two parishes, one in each county, in 1905.\n\n", "id": "294713", "title": "Civil parishes in England"}

It is also called the Grito de la Independencia or the Cry of Independence against the traditional Spanish Government, which had become catastrophically distorted by the Napoleonic invasion of the Peninsula in the preceding two years.\n\nHidalgo and a number of criollos were planning to fight the Spanish colonial government, but they were betrayed. \n\nBecause he was afraid to get arrested, Hidalgo made his brother Mauricio and a number of other men with guns go to the sheriff. On the night of 15 September, they made the sheriff set free the pro-independence (\"people wanting to rule their own land\") prisoners. They set eighty free. \n\nThe next morning, at around 6:00 am, Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung. He made his congregation (\"people who attended his church\") come together. With Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama by his side, he spoke to the people in front of his church. He encouraged them to go against the Spanish government. Researchers do not agree as to what exactly Hidalgo said at the time. \n\nThe Battle of Guanajuato, the first important fight in the war, happened 4 days later. Mexico's independence from Spain wouldn't be declared until September 27, 1821, after ten years of war. This happened with the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire.\n\nEvery year on the night of September 15 the President of Mexico rings the bell of the National Palace in Mexico City at around eleven in the evening. After the ringing of the bell, he repeats a cry of patriotism (a Grito Mexicano) based upon the \"Grito de Dolores\". He calls out the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence and ends with the shout of \"Viva Mexico!\" (three times) from the balcony of the palace. After the shouting, he rings the bell again and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd in the Plaza de la Constitución. This is followed by the playing and mass singing of the Himno Nacional Mexicano, the national anthem. On the morning of September 16, or Independence Day, the national military parade starts in the Zócalo (another name for the Plaza de la Constitución). It goes past the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma, Mexico City’s main boulevard. \n\nA similar celebration happens in cities and towns all over Mexico, and in Mexican embassies and consulates worldwide, on the 15th or the 16th. The mayor or governor, ambassadors or consuls will take on the role of the president, and ring the bells, give a speech and so on.\n\nIn the 19th century, Mexican presidents in their last year in office started to come to Dolores Hidalgo for the Grito de Dolores. President Calderón went to Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations in 2010 on the 16th of September.\n\nSeptember 16 is Independence Day in Mexico and is considered a patriotic holiday, or fiesta patria (literally, \"holiday of the Fatherland\").

After gymnasium (high school) he went to study law at the University of Zagreb, were he joined the Ustaša movement. Soon after, he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti-Yugoslav political activities. He stayed in Otočac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933. He took the Ustaša oath in the Borgotaro camp on April 24, 1933, and then spent the following four years in Austria, Italy and Hungary. In Hungary he joined to the Ustashe terrorist group camp at Jankapuszta, under new, conspirative name 'Laszlo'.\n\nAfter the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia he was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government. After a general declaration of amnesty in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Francetić returned to Croatia in November 1937, but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown. The next year Francetić returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead. In late 1940 he was again arrested in Zagreb because of a congratulatory telegraph to Jozef Tiso, president of the newly formed Slovak Republic (1939–1945), signed by a number of Croat nationalists. He was again exiled to his native Otočac. After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local school's New Year's celebration in Otočac on January 12, 1941, he escaped to Germany to avoid another arrest.\n\nFrancetić earned his only military education and officer rank while serving the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Army. He became a non-commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant. About Francetić's military experience and knowledge, his Ustashe superior Eugen Dido Kvaternik wrote: \"He did not have basic military knowledge nor military education, nor did he have any talent for basic military organization.\". After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and other 10 Ustašas organized the Black Legion (Croatian: Crna Legija). Jure Francetić became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the Ustaša army. Kvaternik believed that Francetić \"a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Hercegovina\" was the reason good enough to put him in the role of military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In order to consolidate the Ustashe party power, much of the party work in the province he put in the hands of Catholic priests. Francetić's Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of \"Srbijanci\", as well as those who were Jews. Killings, arrests, and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Francetić's henchmen - based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded total extermination of Jews and murder, expulsion, and conversion to the Roman Catholicism of Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Francetić participated personally in arresting and interrogations of prominent Serbian and Jewish leaders (Vaso Miskin, Albahari) and ordered the murders of some of them. He even turned his own Sarajevo apartment into the prison kitchen and laundry room.\n\nJustification for the slaughter of Bosnian Serbs and Jews Francetic found in \" the propaganda of 'the Jewish communist hydra' had succeeded in misleading a majority of the Serb Orthodox population in eastern Bosnia into committing 'criminal acts against the state' \"and concluded that \"the 'most drastic means' would have to be employed against them.\"\n\nUstashe's unseen cruelty and savagery applied against Serbs and Jews even prompted the German command to demand that Francetić, as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion, be dismissed. Pavelić defied and promoted Francetić to commander of all Ustashe field formations. In the pre-war times about 15,000 Jews lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina. About 3,000 women and children of this number - were arrested and kept in Kruschnitze concentration camp (Bosnia). Later they will be deported to Jasenovac and Stara Gradiska concentration camps. Additional 7,000 Bosnian Jews will be deported directly to Jasenovac concentration camp.\n\nFrancetić died on December 27 or 28, 1942. While flying to Gospić on December 22, his plane was downed by Yugoslav Partisans near the village of Močile, near Slunj, which was the Partisan-held area. Both he and his pilot were immediately captured by Partisan village guards and peasants and Francetić received numerous blows with pitchforks. Severely wounded, he was taken to NOVJ General Staff Hospital where Partisan surgeons attempted to save his life in order to exchange him for inmates of Ustaše camps and prisons, but failed.\n\nUstashe authorities were so concerned about the effect of his death would have on supporters of their movement that the news of his death was delayed until the beginning of March 1943. Official announcement of his death came on March 31, 1943., when Ustashe declared eight days of official mourning.\n\nMemorial plaque to this Ustashe leader was erected in Slunj (in June 2000, by Ustashe's Association of war veterans, \"Hrvatski domobran\") as an embrace, by those responsible, of the NDH and ethnic hatred.\n\nIn late 2004 the Croatian government ordered the removal of the memorial plaque in Slunj.\n\n\"In January 2005 in the outskirts of Split, unknown persons erected overnight a memorial to Francetic and Budak-to show the extreme right's anger at Sanader's betrayal of the Ustasha cause and the prime minister's cooperation with ICTY\"\n\n\n", "id": "294889", "title": "Jure Francetić"}

The organisers says Twicket was the first village cricket match ever to be streamed online.\n\nTwicket is a made up word. The \"Tw\" is from Twitter. The \"icket\" is from Cricket.\n\nThere were reports about Twicket on BBC television news, on BBC Radio London, on TalkSport, and on Radio New Zealand.\n\nIt was written about by \"The Guardian\", and \"Metro\".\n\nIt was mentioned on Twitter by Stephen Fry, the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones and Jonathan Agnew. Agnew is the BBC's cricket correspondent.\n\nJohn Popham is a consultant. He decided to show Twicket online after seeing two comments on Twitter. In the first comment, Dan Slee said he wanted to see news about his a local village cricket team on Twitter.\n\nThen, Chris Conder mentioned that she was testing a new 30Mbps, symmetrical internet connection. \"Symmetrical internet\" means that the upload speed is as fast as the download speed. Conder lives in a village called Wray. Wray is in Lancashire, England. The connection was installed in Wray by Lancaster University Wray is one of only three villages in the UK to have a symmetrical community network.\n\nConder told Popham that a special cricket match was going to be played in Wray. The match was part of the village’s Scarecrow Festival. The Scarecrow Festival happens every year. The match was between Wray and a team called \"The Rest of the World\".\n\nPopham said:\n\nI'm confident we can do this, because the village Wi-Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed ... It's a bit of fun, but it has a serious purpose too. The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done, it possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection. It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas, and the need for fast connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content.\n\nThe match was 20 overs per side. This is called the Twenty20 format. There was an extra rule that said that any batsman who scored 20 runs had to retire. Wray won the toss. They decided to bowl first. After 20 overs, The Rest of the World had scored 69 runs and lost 5 wickets. That meant that Wray needed 70 runs off 20 overs. Wray managed to do that. Their final runs were a six. Wray won in their eleventh over. They won by 8 wickets.\n\nAfter the cricket match, there was a tug o'war contest. It was also streamed live. The rest of the world won.

It started on 16 September 1810. It was started by Mexican-born Spaniards (\"criollo people\"), Mestizos and Amerindians who wanted independence from Spain. \n\nThe idea of a Mexican independence goes back to the years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Martín Cortés led a revolt against the Spanish colonial government.\n\nAfter the plot called the \"Conspiracy of the Machetes\" was not successful in 1799, the War of Independence really started with the Grito de Dolores in 1810 when Spain was fighting against its French invaders\n\nMiguel Hidalgo y Costilla, was a Mexican priest and member of a group of educated \"Criollos\" in Querétaro. They met in \"tertulias\" (salons), and decided in 1810 that a revolt against the colonial government was needed, because Napoleon had replaced the King of Spain with a foreigner. Hidalgo worked closely with Ignacio de Allende, a nobleman with military training, the plan was for a battle in December 1810.\n\nThey were betrayed by a member of the group. Hidalgo then turned to his parishioners in the town of Dolores. Around 6:00 am of September 16, 1810 he declared independence from the Spanish crown, and war against the government in what was known as the \"Grito de Dolores\". The revolutionary army decided to fight for independence. They marched on to Guanajuato, which was a major colonial mining centre governed by Spaniards and criollos. \n\nThere, the leaders of this \"citizens army\", which was more like an unorganised mob, locked themselves in the granary (\"place for storing grain\"). They killed most of the much hated Spaniards and Criollos that were there. This also included high-ranking nobles and supporters of the fight for Independence. This caused Hidalgo and Allende to fight with each other. After that, Allende did not want to fight alongside Hidalgo, and left with his soldiers.\n\nOn October 30, Miguel Hidalgo's army fought the Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces. They won this battle. \n\nIn January 1811, Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of Calderón and the peasant army lost. It made the rebels flee towards the United States-Mexican border, where they hoped to escape. However they were caught by the Spanish army. \n\nHidalgo and what was left of his army were caught in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of Baján. He had a trial done by the Inquisition on 30 July 1811. He was executed.\n\nAfter the death of Father Hidalgo, the leadership of the revolutionary army was taken over by José María Morelos. Under his leadership the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were taken. In 1813, the Congress of Chilpancingo had their first meeting. On 6 November of that year, the Congress signed the first official document of independence, known as the \"Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America\". It was followed by a long war at the Siege of Cuautla. In 1815, Morelos was caught by Spanish colonial authorities. He was put on trial and executed for treason in San Cristóbal Ecatepec on 22 December.\n\nBy the early 1820's the independence movement was close to collapsing. Two of their main leaders were executed, and the rebels found it hard to fight the well-organized Spanish military. Also, many of the most influential criollos did not care any more. The violence of Hidalgo's and Morelos's unorganised army mob was not liked. They wanted a better, less bloody way to get independence. \n\nIn December 1820, Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist criollo officer, Colonel Agustín de Iturbide, to fight in Oaxaca. Iturbide was famous for the way in which he went after Hidalgo's and Morelos's rebels during the early independence struggle. \n\nThe fight at Oaxaca came at the same time as successful coup (\"a fight by the military against the government\") in Spain against the monarchy of Ferdinand VII. Ferdinand was forced to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. When this news reached Mexico, Iturbide saw it as an opportunity for the criollos to gain control of Mexico. After first clashing with Guerrero's forces, Iturbide switched sides. He invited the rebel leader to meet and discuss a new independence struggle.\n\nWhile in the town of Iguala, Iturbide created three rules, or \"guarantees,\" for Mexican independence from Spain.\n\nHe made his troops accept these rules. They are known as the Plan of Iguala. Iturbide then persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of the new independence. A new army, the Army of the Three Guarantees, was then placed under Iturbide's command to enforce the Plan of Iguala. The plan was so broad that it pleased both patriots and loyalists. The goal of independence and the protection of Roman Catholicism brought together all factions.\n\nIturbide's army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico. When the rebels' victory became certain, the viceroy resigned. On August 24, 1821, representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Córdoba. This recognized Mexican independence under the terms of the \"Plan of Iguala\". \n\nOn September 27 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City. The next day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire. \n\nOn the night of the May 18, 1822, a mass of people marched through the streets. They demanded that their commander-in-chief Iturbide accept the throne. The next day, the congress declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico.\n\n\n\n", "id": "294918", "title": "Mexican War of Independence"}

In that case it meant not to tell senior government officials about illegal CIA activities. These officials could then defend themselves if the activities were discovered. They would be able to say quite plausibly, and perhaps truthfully, that they did not know anything about it (deniability). It meant that actions of the CIA could not be blamed on the President of the USA.\n\nThe concept is tied up with the idea of a \"paper trail\", whereby journalists find evidence of orders or discussions between senior officials and agents doing the forbidden acts. Interceptions of phone messages or e-mail messages may also be evidence of wrongdoing by officials. If there is no definite evidence of wrongdoing by an official, then his/her denial can be taken as sincere. The denial is \"plausible\" (or, at least, \"might\" be true). That achieves one of the main goals of public relations: for officials at least not to be caught red-handed doing something illegal. The effect of officials being caught red-handed can be extremely serious: see Watergate scandal.\n\nPlausible deniability refers to the denial of blame in (formal or informal) chains of command. Senior people may give indirect and vague orders. For example, Henry II \"Who will rid me of this turbulent priest?\" or even less direct \"Someone should do something about that\". The intended message is understood. Later, when the deed is done, the higher man can say \"I never intended that to happen\". \n\nPlausible deniability is achieved when no records are kept of any instructions. It becomes impossible to find out who was responsible for the actions taken. If these activities become public, high-ranking officials may deny any knowledge of such act or any connection to the people used to carry out such acts. It usually means that it has been planned in advance, setting up the conditions to avoid responsibility for future actions or knowledge.\n", "id": "294966", "title": "Plausible deniability"}

The bay was named by explorer Matthew Flinders on 7 February 1802. Flinders had hoped that bay was bigger and would have provided better access into the inland of South Australia. One of the first European settlers was a sheep farmer, William McKenzie, who built a house in the area in 1889.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295064", "text": "Burhou\n\nBurhou (pronounced bu-ROO) is a small island approximately northwest of Alderney that is part of the Channel Islands. No one lives on Burhou, and it is a bird sanctuary, so landing there is banned from 15 March to 27 July. The island's wildlife includes a colony of puffins (declining in numbers) and large numbers of rabbits.\n\nIt has no landing stage as such, but visitors use a small inlet. In rough weather it may be impossible to land.\n\nThe Guernsey botanist E.D. Marquand called it, \"the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our archipelago.\" He had to spend the night there, as his return journey was delayed by fog.\n\nThe 1906 book, \"The Channel Pilot\" states -\n\nThe States of Alderney member, John Beaman has political responsibility for the island.\n\nBurhou, like many other Channel Islands (e.g. Lihou, Jethou), has the Norman suffix \"-hou\", meaning a small island, from the Old Norse \"holmr\". According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith, \"bur\" refers to a storehouse - \"Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear\".\n\nSigns of human occupation/visitation are much older. Flint flakes have been found on the island, and one is currently in the Alderney Museum. In 1847, F.C. Lukis found two standing stones, but these have since been lost, according to the archaeologist David Johnston.\n\nAccording to the Assize Roll of the 14th century, Burhou was a rabbit warren, and a refuge for fishermen. This would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there, as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it.\n\nA hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of General Le Mesurier (The Governor), but was destroyed during the German occupation of the Channel Islands (the Nazis used it for target practice during WWII). The hut was replaced in 1953, with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office.\n\nAttempts have been made to raise sheep there. In 1900, a French couple lived there for a year. The soil is thin, and spray often goes right over the island, so the soil is very salty. The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year, and has to rely on shipments, or formerly tanks.\n\nThe island's animals are mainly birds, although rabbits are long established here. The island has many puffins and some storm petrels. Although the latter have declined, they used to nest in the cottage's storm loft. Roderick Dobson in \"Birds of the Channel Islands\" said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century. The \"Birds of Guernsey\" (1878) by Cecil Smith states likewise. The puffins have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from red mite infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them.\n\nAmongst the plants noted here are sea spurry, forget-me-nots, scarlet pimpernel, field bugloss, bracken and nettles. E.D. Marquand counted 18 species of plant here in 1909, but by the late twentieth century Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45, which they wrote up in the \"Transactions of La Société Guernesiaise\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "295064", "title": "Burhou"}

It measures about 50 by 70 metres (160 by 230 ft).\n\nA.H. Ewen thinks that the rock's name meant \"large rock at the edge\" from the Norman language \"Or\" (edge) + \"Etac\" (Stack). Alexander Deschamps said that the French used to call it \"the Eagle's Nest\".\n\nOrtac and Alderney, along with the Casquets, are part of the same sandstone ridge.\n\nPaul Naftel, a Guernsey artist, drew Ortac, and the drawing appeared in Ansted & Latham's book, \"The Channel Islands\" (1862). The writers themselves commented -\n\nIf the sea bottom, which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep, were elevated 120 feet (37 m), the island of Alderney, the Burhou and Ortac group, and the Casquets would be connected by low land, and form a narrow island around 12 miles (19 km) long.\n\nThe 1906 book, \"The Channel Pilot\" states -\n\nBetween Ortac, Verte Tête and Burhou Island, are scattered many dangerous rocks, and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity.\n\nIt also supposedly contains a cave known as \"the Oven\".\n\nVictor Hugo, who lived on Guernsey, and who wrote much about the Channel Islands says in his novel, \"The Laughing Man\" (\"L'Homme qui Rit\"):\n\n\"...on the port bow arose, standing stark, cut out on the background of mist, a tall opaque mass, vertical, right-angled, a tower of the abyss. It was the Ortac rock. The Ortac, all of a piece, rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves... An immovable cliff, it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine coils of the sea. At night it stands an enormous block, resting on the folds of a huge black sheet. In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is 'the thunderclap'...\"\"To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons; to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder... On a straight frontage, such of that of the Ortac, neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet... if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it, and is lost...\"\n\nMeanwhile, in another work, \"The Toilers of the Sea\" (\"Les Travailleurs de la mer\"), he mentions the curious anecdote that Ortac was inhabited by Saint Malo:\n\n\"The Norman fishermen who frequent the Channel have many precautions to take at sea, by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them. It has long been an article of popular faith that Saint Maclou inhabited the great square rock called Ortac, in the sea between Alderney and the Casquets; and many old sailors used to declare that they had often seen him there, seated and reading a book. Accordingly the sailors, as they passed, were in the habit of kneeling many times before the Ortac rock, until the day when the fable was destroyed, and the truth took its place. For it has been discovered, and is now well established, that the lonely inhabitant Of the rock is not a saint, but a devil. This evil spirit, whose name is Jochmus, had the impudence to pass himself of; for many centuries as Saint Maclou. Even the Church herself is not proof against snares of this kind. The demons Ragubel, Oribel, and Tobiel were regarded as saints until the year 745, when Pope Zachary, having at length exposed them, turned them out of saintly company. This sort of weeding of the saintly calendar is certainly very useful; but it can only be practiced by very accomplished judges of devils and their ways.\"\n\nOrtac is noted for its large gannet colony. This is of fairly recent origin. On 19 June 1940, Major J.A.A. Wallace was preparing for the evacuation of Alderney, and went there to inspect the kittiwake colony. He found only one gannet. He found none on Les Etacs off Alderney. Now both swarm with the birds.\n\nIn 1979, a mission with two naval helicopters was launched to remove nets and rubbish used in nests and which were trapped.\n\nRomeo 41 is an Airway over the English Channel from the Channel Islands Control Area to the Solent Control Area. There is a reporting point named ORTAC at southern boundary between Romeo 41 and the Channel Islands Control Zone. Its position is 49° 59' 57N, 2° 0' 18W, which is about 30 miles north-north-east of Alderney. This is not coincident with the islet named Ortac, but its name is undoubtedly derived from the islet. \n\nMany Standard Instrument Approach and Departure Procedures into Channel Islands airports use ORTAC as part of the procedure. A typical clearance for an Aurigny flight from Alderney to Southampton will read as follows:\n\"Ayline 123: your clearance is to the Northern Zone boundary via ORTAC, on track Romeo 41.\"\n", "id": "295073", "title": "Ortac"}

As of 2005, 48,985 people lived there. Its county seat is Marianna, Florida.\n\nJackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 by splitting from Escambia County, making it the third county in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. Jackson County originally spread from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. The county had been shrunk close to its current boundaries by 1840 through the creation of new counties from its original land. Small changes to the county border continued through most of the 19th century, however.\n\nThere were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called \"Robinson's Big Spring\" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the \"Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee\" in 1823. The following year the county court met at \"Chipola Settlement\" which is also known as Waddell's Mill Pond.\n\nMarianna became the county seat, but not without controversy. It was founded by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland, in September 1827. The first town established in Jackson County was Webbville in January 1827. Webbville, a community of land squatters, was located northwest of present day Marianna and was named the county seat. Webbville thrived until 1828 when Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee and enticed the Florida Legislature with free land, construction of a courthouse, a public square and $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna.\n\nBeveridge and his supporters succeeded and Marianna became the county seat of the county justice and civil authority, even though it was never officially named the county seat. Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. Webbville's important citizens moved to Marianna and the L&N Railroad decided to bypass the town. \n\nFrom 1869-71, Jackson County was the center of a low-level guerrilla war known as the Jackson County War. Ku Klux Klan members, including Confederate Army veterans, assassinated over 150 Republican Party officials and important African-Americans as part of a successful campaign to retain conservative white Democratic power.\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of , of which (or 95.92%) is land and (or 4.08%) is water. Jackson County is the only county in Florida that borders both Georgia and Alabama. Jackson County is in the Central Standard Time Zone. Its eastern border with Gadsden County forms the boundary in this area between the Central Standard and Eastern Standard Time Zones.\n\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 46,755 people, 16,620 households, and 11,600 families living in the county. The population density was 51 people per square mile (20/km²). There were 19,490 housing units at an average density of 21 per square mile (8/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 70.18% White, 26.56% Black or African American, 0.67% Native American, 0.36% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.81% from other races, and 1.40% from two or more races. 2.91% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\nThere were 16,620 households out of which 30.90% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 51.50% were married couples living together, 14.40% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.20% were not related. 27.00% of all households were made up of people living alone and 12.80% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The U.S. Census Bureau 2005 estimate for the county is 7,773. Its county seat is Mayo, Florida. Lafayette County is a prohibition county, meaning alcohol is illegal there.\n\nLafayette County was created December 23, 1856 from part of Madison County, and included at the time what is now both Lafayette and Dixie Counties. Lafayette County was named in honor of the Marquis de Lafayette, the French citizen who rendered assistance to the colonies during the American Revolutionary War. The Suwannee River forms the entire eastern border. The county courts first met at the home of Ariel Jones near Fayetteville. The county seat was New Troy until the court house there burned down in 1892. It was then moved to Mayo in 1893, and Mayo is currently Lafayette's only incorporated town.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295204", "text": "Battle of Passchendaele\n\nThe Battle of Passchendaele was one of the biggest battles of the First World War. It happened between July and November 1917. Allied troops attacked the German Army in many operations. The Allies were commanded by British leaders. The battle was fought for control of a village named Passchendaele. Passchendaele is near the town of Ypres in West Flanders, Belgium. The purpose of the battle was to \"wear out the enemy\" and \"to secure the Belgian coast and connect with the Dutch front lines\". The British commander was Douglas Haig. He planned the battle in three parts. These were capturing Passchendaele Ridge, moving to capture Roeselare, and Operation Hush. In Operation Hush, marines were to land somewhere on the Belgian coast and there would be a breakout attack from Nieuwpoort and the Yser bridgehead. \n\nThe British launched many massive attacks. They were helped a lot by artillery, aircraft and sometimes tanks. The British did not win. This is because they were up against a large and modern German defence. The British and French armies eventually became tactically better, and came close to winning later in the year. \n\nThe battle was made up of 'bite and hold' attacks. This captured ground that could be useful. It also wore down the German army with attacks and counter-attacks by the German army to stop the Allied attacks and take back ground. It lasted until the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele on 6 November 1917. The battle ended on 10 November, apart from small operations. Causing huge casualties for the Germans, the Allies had captured 5 miles (8 km) of some of the best defended territory in the world. They lost 140,000 men. This is a ratio of about 2 inches (5 cm) of ground taken by every dead soldier. The Germans took back the lost ground when the line was shortened five months later, during the Battle of the Lys, losing it forever on 28 September 1918.\n\nPasschendaele has become popular with the misery of grinding attrition warfare. This type of warfare was often fought in thick mud. The land between Dixmude and the river Lys was crossed by streams and ditches that were used for drainage. Most of these flowed west, moving towards the Ypres—Commines canal which went north-south. The land was flat and swampy but for good drainage. August 1917 was very cold and wet. This was not usual. Very big artillery strikes had also destroyed the ground surface. There were times where it was dry. It was most dry in September, but mud was still in parts of the battlefield. Tanks got stuck in mud and some soldiers and horses drowned in it. \n\nRidges went in a curve pattern from south of Ypres, east then north to Passchendaele and Staden. They were sixty metres high at the most. This high ground had been fought over a lot since 1914.\n\nMany historians have different opinions on this battle. Most of this debate is in Britain. The volume of the British Official History of the War that wrote about the Battle of Passchendaele was the last ever published. Some people say that it was written to make Field Marshal Douglas Haig look better, and to make General Hubert Gough, the commander of the Fifth Army, look worse. The many dead and injured men the British Army had only to capture a very small amount of land have made many historians follow the example of David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister at the time, and use it as an example of wasting soldiers and being a bad leader. Lloyd George, who was almost certainly affected by Basil Liddell Hart, wrote 100 pages of memoires to a review of British generalship at Third Ypres.\n\nThere is also a revisionist way of thinking which tries to say that the British Army did well in the battle. Revisionists say that the British caused many casualties in the German Army, helped the French and came up with attack tactics which could win against German defences. These tactics made the Germans want winter to come badly. Revisionists say that these things were important in winning the war in 1918.\n\nDeath and injury amounts for the battle are still not decided on. Some people say that the Allies suffered much heavier losses than the Germans. Others say different things. However, nobody says that hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides were not killed or hurt. The last survivor of the battle, who was also the last survivor of the Western Front in the United Kingdom, Private Harry Patch, died on 25 July 2009.\n\n\n", "id": "295204", "title": "Battle of Passchendaele"}

Equal provincial membership in the Senate, thus, balances the provincial inequality in the National Assembly and dispels doubts and apprehension, if any, regarding deprivation and exploitation.\n\nThe role of the Senate is to promote national cohesion and harmony and to alleviate fears of the smaller provinces regarding domination by any one province because of its majority, in the National Assembly.\n\nThe Senate is a body that represents the provinces and territories of the country and promotes a feeling of equality, peace and good understanding between them, which is so essential for the growth and prosperity of a nation. Thus, the Senate in Pakistan, over the years, has emerged as an essential organ and a stabilizing factor of the federation.\n\na) President and Parliament: Under Article 50 of the Constitution, the Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) of Pakistan consists of the President and two Houses to be known respectively as the National Assembly and the Senate. \n\nThe President is elected by members of both Houses of the Parliament and the Provincial Assemblies. The President may be removed from office or impeached through a resolution, passed by not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Parliament in a joint sitting of the two Houses, convened for the purpose. \n\nThe Constitution empowers the President to dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion if a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. However, the Senate is not subject to dissolution. \n\nIn case the office of the President becomes vacant for any reason, the Chairman, or if he is unable to perform the functions of the office of the President, the Speaker, acts as President till such time that a President is elected. Same is the case when the President by reason of absence from Pakistan or any other cause is unable to perform his functions. \n\nb) Relations between the Houses: Unless both the Houses pass a Bill and it receives President's assent it cannot become a law except in the case of a money bill which is the sole prerogative of the National Assembly. Under the Legal Framework Order, 2002, the role of a Mediation Committee, comprising eight members from each House, has been introduced for the first time to evolve consensus on Bills, in case there is a disagreement between the two Houses. \n\nc) Cabinet: The Constitution provides that there shall be a Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister which is collectively responsible to the National Assembly. The Prime Minister is chosen from the National Assembly. \n\nThe Federal Ministers and Ministers of State are appointed from amongst the members of Parliament.

Many of the fans from both of the horror movie characters thought the movie was a great battle movie between the two killers. It was a cross-over between \"Jason Goes to Hell\".\n\nThe movie is about Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) and Jason Voorhees (Ken Kirzinger) terrorizing Elm Street and killing the teenagers who live or dare to cross paths between Jason or Freddy. It wasn't until that Freddy begins to try to kill all of the teens, but Jason keeps cathing up to him which makes both of them angry. Then Lori Campbell (Monica Keena) is wondering how her mother died in which she once thought died from a car crash. Later, Will Rollins (Jason Ritter) and Mark Davis (Brendan Fletcher) escape from a mentaly-ill hospital and tries to save Lori and her friends from Freedy.\n\nIt wasn't until they needed some more pills to keep them awake, so they go to the asylum from where Will and Mark escaped from and try to find the pills. Then Bill Freeburg (Kyle Labine dump all the pills in the sink when he was possessed by Freedy. Then Jason came crashing into the asylum and then was put to sleep by Bill, but was sliced in half. When Jason was asleep, he was dreaming about seeing his mother and then Freddy came along and stabbed him in the head. Then Lori went to the same dream as Jason was, but then he woke-up and then the van they were driving crashed into Camp Crystal Lake. Later Lori, Will, Kia Waterson (Kelly Rowland), and Charlie Linderman (Chris Marquette) went into a cabin, but Lori was in a nightmare with Freddy. Later Jason came into the cabin which he set on fire. Then Lori pulled Freddy into the real world from were Freddy and Jason began to fight.\n\nLater, they were pushed into the dock from the lake and then Jason began to slice Freddy until he cut Jason's fingers and Freddy got the machete and began to stab Jason and then stabbed his eyes with his razor gloves. After Jason killed both Kia and Charlie, Lori and Will lit the propane tank on fire and caused the camp to explode. That was when Jason tore Freddy's arm off and were blown into the lake. Then Will and Lori were about to leave until Freddy came back with Jason's machete and was about to kill them until Jason stabbed Freddy with his own razor glove. Then Lori wanted to get revenge on Freddy when she discovered he had killed her mother, she decapitated Freddy's head-off. At the end Jason fell into the lake until he rose the next day with Freddy's head and later Freddy winked.\n\n", "id": "295311", "title": "Freddy vs. Jason"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295359", "text": "Milankovich cycle\n\nMilankovitch cycles are small, slow but regular changes in the Earth's orbit round the Sun, and the tilt of the Earth's axis. \n\nThe dynamics are complex. The changes affect the 'insolation' (sunlight falling on parts of the Earth). This leads to cycles of climate on Earth, at about 21,000, 41,000 years, 100,000 and 400,000 years. This whole field is still under active research.\n\nUsing applied mathematics, Milanković predicted that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit caused climate patterns on Earth.\n\nSimilar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll and others. However, there was at first no reliable dated evidence. The issue was not settled until deep-ocean cores were taken and a paper published in \"Science\" in 1976. \n\nEarth's orbit is an ellipse. The eccentricity is a measure of the departure of this ellipse from circularity. The shape of the Earth's orbit varies in time between nearly circular and mildly elliptical. \n\nThe angle of the Earth's axial tilt varies with respect to the plane of the Earth's orbit. \n\nWhen the obliquity increases, the summers in both hemispheres receive more heat and light from the Sun, and winters less. Conversely, when the obliquity decreases, summers receive less sunshine and winters more. These slow 2.4° obliquity variations are roughly periodic. They take about 41,000 years to shift between a tilt of 22.1° and 24.5° and back again.\n\nPrecession is the wobble of the Earth's axis. This gyroscopic motion is due to the tidal forces exerted by the sun and the moon on the solid Earth, which has the shape of an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere. The sun and moon contribute roughly equally to this effect. Its period is about 26,000 years.\n\nWhen the axis points toward the Sun, one polar hemisphere has a greater difference between the seasons while the other has milder seasons. The hemisphere that is in summer at perihelion receives much of the corresponding increase in solar radiation, but that same hemisphere in winter at aphelion has a colder winter. The other hemisphere will have a relatively warmer winter and cooler summer.\n\nPlanets orbiting the Sun follow elliptical (oval) orbits that rotate gradually over time (apsidal precession). \n\nIn addition, the orbital ellipse itself precesses in space, primarily as a result of interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. This shortens the period of the precession of the equinoxes from 25,771.5 to ~21,636 years.\n\nThe inclination of Earth's orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit with a cycle having a period of about 70,000 years. Milankovitch did not study this three-dimensional movement. This movement is known as 'precession of the ecliptic' or 'planetary precession'.\n\nResearchers noted this drift, and also that the orbit moves relative to the orbits of the other planets. The invariable plane, the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System, is approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter. The inclination of the Earth's orbit has a 100,000 year cycle relative to the invariable plane. This is very similar to the 100,000 year eccentricity period. This 100,000-year cycle closely matches the 100,000-year pattern of ice ages.\n\nIt has been proposed that a disk of dust and other debris exists in the plane, which affects the Earth's climate. The Earth moves through this plane around January 9 and July 9, when there is an increase in radar-detected meteors and meteor-related noctilucent clouds.\n\nA study of the Antarctic ice core, using oxygen-nitrogen ratios in air bubbles trapped in the ice, concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by Northern hemisphere insolation as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis. This is an additional validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis by a relatively new method. It is not consistent with the \"inclination\" theory of the 100,000-year cycle.\n\n", "id": "295359", "title": "Milankovich cycle"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295427", "text": "Rainband\n\nA rainband is an area of rainfall where all the clouds and precipitation are stretched out in a long line or band. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective. They are caused by differences in temperature. When seen on a weather radar, the long narrow shape is called a banded structure. Rainbands in a tropical cyclone are curved and may even spiral around the center of the cyclone. Tropical cyclone rainbands include rain showers and thunderstorms. When this includes an eyewall and the eye, they make a hurricane or tropical storm. The size of rainbands around a tropical cyclone helps to measure the cyclone's intensity.\n\nRainbands that form near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which can produce tornadoes. The shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains. The mountains block the winds which can then form a low-level barrier jet. Bands of thunderstorms can form when sea breeze and land breezes meet, if enough moisture is present. Sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front, can hide the location of the cold front itself. Rainbands in an extratropical cyclone can cause large amounts of rain or snow. Behind extratropical cyclones, rainbands can form downwind of large, warmer bodies of water such as the Great Lakes. If the air is cold enough, these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls.\n\nRainbands ahead of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts have little upward motion. They tend to be wide and stratiform in nature. In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear, narrow, convective rainbands form. These are known as squall lines, and are usually in the cyclone's warm sector, ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones. Wider rain bands can form behind cold fronts, which usually have more stratiform, and less convective, precipitation. In colder cyclones, small bands of heavy snow can occur with a width of to . These bands are linked with areas of frontogensis, or zones of strengthening temperature contrast. The curved air flow from extratropical cyclones bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands. These can bring heavy localized snowfalls.\n\nRainbands exist on the edges of tropical cyclones, and point towards the cyclone's center of low pressure. Rainbands within tropical cyclones need moisture and a low level pool of cooler air. Bands located to from a cyclone's center move outward. They can cause heavy rains and squalls of wind, as well as tornadoes. Some rainbands move closer to the center, forming a secondary, or outer, eyewall within intense hurricanes. Spiral rainbands are such a basic part of a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins, use of the satellite-based Dvorak technique is the main method used to determine a tropical cyclone's maximum sustained winds. Using this method, the area of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to estimate the maximum sustained wind and a central pressure. \n\nConvective rainbands can form parallel mountains on their windward side. This is due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the cloud's formation. Their spacing is normally to apart. When rainbands near frontal zones get close to steep mountains, a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just before the mountain ridge. This slows down the frontal rainband just before the mountain barrier. If enough moisture is present, sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands. Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to hide the location of an approaching cold front by evening. The edge of ocean currents can cause thunderstorm bands due to heat differences where they meet. Downwind of islands, rainbands can form when low level winds meet downwind of the island edges. Offshore California, this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts.\n\n", "id": "295427", "title": "Rainband"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295479", "text": "Ustaše\n\nThe Ustaše (also called Ustashas or Ustashi) was a Croatian racist, terrorist, and Nazi-like movement. It was engaged in terrorist activities before World War II. Under the protection of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, the Ustaše ruled a part of Yugoslavia, after Yugoslavia was occupied by Italy and Germany. At the end of World War II, the Ustaše were defeated and expelled by the Yugoslav Partisans.\n\nCroatian politician Stjepan Radić was shot on October 1928 and died a month later. Alexander I, King of Yugoslavia, imposed a royal dictatorship in January 1929 and made all political parties illegal. Ante Pavelić left the country for Vienna. He and Gustav Perčec, a former Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant colonel, established contact with organization of Macedonian political emigres. These two groups agreed to coordinate their political activities for achieving full independence for Macedonia and Croatia. There and then, Pavelić secretly met with the leader of outlawed Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), Ivan Mikhailov, a declared enemy of Yugoslavia, and made agreement with him to cooperate against the Yugoslav state.\n\nDue to these circumstances, the Court for the Preservation of the State in Belgrade sentenced Pavelić and Perčec to death on 17 July 1929. The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the Croatian emigration in Europe, North America, and South America. The Ustaše organization was small in numbers and was organized in military patterns. They fought Yugoslav statehood by means of terror.\n\nThe roots of the Ustaše ideology were in the Croatian nationalism of the nineteenth century. The Ustaše ideological system was chiefly based on the traditional pure Croatian nationalism of Ante Starčević. About it, W. Safran wroteBut another vision of Croatian identity that was closely tied to the Catholic Church and the Vatican and was led by an ex-seminarist Ante Starcevic became the ideological precursor to the Ustase. Starcevic and his followers emphasized the high achievements of Western Catholic, Croatian culture, while Serbian culture was depicted as oriental and inferior. Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ustaša Ivo Pilar [under the pseudonym L. von Südland]. His book was translated into Croatian in 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. At the same time, the Ustaše borrowed from traditional Croatian nationalism, the National-Socialism of Hitler, the fascism of Mussolini, and even from the program of the Croatian Peasant Party. The Ustaše aimed at an ethnically \"pure\" Croatia, and saw the Serbs that lived in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as their biggest obstacle. Along that line, Ustaše ministers Mile Budak, Mirko Puk, and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustaše policy was an ethnically clean Croatia. They also publicly announced the strategy (on July 22, 1941 ) to achieve their goal, which resembled the bloodiest religious wars: \"A third must become Catholic, a third must leave the country, and a third must die!\"\n\nThe Ustaše persecuted the Serbs, who were Orthodox Christians. \n\nThe Ustaše's problem with the Nazi ideology was that the Croats are Slavs and were considered inferior by Nazi standards. Ustaše ideology thus created a theory about a pseudo-Gothic origin of the Croats in order to raise their standing on the Aryan ladder.\n\nAt Janka Puszta training facility in Hungary, IMRO terrorists trained Ustaše operatives in bomb-making and in conspirational activities. The Ustaše put that knowledge to immediate use, carrying out about half-dozen assassinations of Yugoslavian officials or pro-Serb civilians. They carried out a dozen bombings of trains, including the Orient Express, and other public targets during the first four years of their existence. This caused the Yugoslav Government to complain to the League of Nations and forced Hungary to close down Janka Pusta Ustaše training camp. Internal power struggle, and discovery that Perčec's mistress was a Yugoslav police informant, will lead to the Perčec assassination by Pavelić in 1933.\n\nThe Ustaše received the most funds from Mussolini, who also supplied this group with an Italian headquarters that changed location whenever Yugoslavia managed to track it down. Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy, chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro. An armed insurrection was attempted in 1933, when the Ustaše, armed by the Italians, attempted to invade Yugoslavia by crossing the Adriatic Sea in motorboats. This was unsuccessful, but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia.\n\nTwo attempts were made; the last one was successful. Alexander was murdered at Marseilles on 9 October 1934, along with the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou. In the wake of the assassination, Mussolini renounced the Ustaše, and the group went deeply underground. The singular lack of armed protection afforded to the Yugoslav king, and the general laxity of security precautions when it was well-known that one attempt had already been made on Alexander's life, are grim tributes to Pavelić organizational abilities. He had apparently been able to bribe a high official in the Surete General. The Prefect of Police of Marseilles, Jouhannaud, was subsequently removed from office.\n\nThe assassin was Vlada Georgief Cernozemski, a Bulgarian, who had already killed two members of the Bulgarian Parliament in Sofia. His accomplices were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. Pavelic was condemned to death by France, but managed to escape.\n\nYugoslavia brought charges against Hungary and Italy before the League of Nations in November 1934, offering evidence that Italy and Hungary had openly conspired against her sovereignty. The League of Nations did not discuss the Italian conspiracy against the national sovereignty of Yugoslavia. Moreover, Italy refused to extradite Pavelić and Kvaternik to either France or Yugoslavia, and Hungary bore the brunt of the charges.\n\nAfter the assassination, the Ustaše activities were prevented completely. A great number of Ustaše were caught and arrested in Italy, Germany, and Hungary. Italy interned many Ustashe to the Lipari camp, where many died. Janka Puszta Ustaše camp was raided by Hungarian police, who arrested some of them. Ustaše from Germany escaped to Switzerland, France, and England.\n\nWidespread outrage at the assassination of Alexander and Barthou led to the first international efforts to combat terrorism since the St. Petersburg Protocol of 1904. The issue was taken up by the League of Nations, which passed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism in 1937.\n\nAfter March 1937, when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a friendship treaty, many Ustaše in Italy were extradited to Yugoslavia.\n\nGermany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. On April 10, the most senior home-based Ustaša, Slavko Kvaternik, took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia (\"Nezavisna Država Hrvatska\", NDH). Maček issued a statement that day, calling on all Croatians to cooperate with the new authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Pavelić and several hundred Ustaše left their camps in Italy for Zagreb, where Pavelić set up his government on 17 April. He accorded himself the title of \"Poglavnik\", - which was equivalent to \"Führer,\" or \"Headman\" in English. Pavelić's \"Independent State of Croatia\" comprised territory of Croatia, Srem, and Bosnia-Herzegovina - except parts of the Dalmatian coast and islands, which were ceded to the Italians. \"De facto\" control over this territory varied for the majority of the war, as the Partisans grew more successful, while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of their interest.\n\nAll who opposed and/or threatened the Ustaše were outlawed. In early 1941, Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb.\n\nPavelić first met with Adolf Hitler on 6 June 1941. Mile Budak, then a minister in Pavelić's government, publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941. Maks Luburić, one of the chiefs of the secret police, started building concentration camps in the summer of the same year. Ustaše activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet. As early as July 10, 1941, Wehrmacht General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW):\nA Gestapo report to Reichsführer SS Heinrich Himmler, dated February 17, 1942, stated that:\nItalian troops in the field had competing territorial claims with their Ustaše allies and had cooperated from the start with Chetnik units operating in the southern areas that they controlled. Hitler tried to insist that Mussolini should have his forces work with the Ustaše, but senior Italian commanders, such as General Mario Roatta, ignored such orders.\n\nThe Ustaše enacted race laws patterned after those of Nazi Germany. These laws were aimed against Jews, Roma, and Serbs, who were collectively declared enemies of the Croatian people. Serbs, Jews, Roma and anti-fascist Croats and Bosniaks, including communists, were interned in concentration camps, the largest of which was the Jasenovac complex, where many were killed by Ustaše militia. The exact number of victims is not known. The number of murdered Jews is fairly reliable: around 32,000 Jews were killed during World War II on NDH territory. Gypsies (Yugoslav Roma) numbered around 40,000 fewer after the war. Of the number of Serbs who died, estimates tend to vary between 300,000 and 700,000.\n\nThe history textbooks in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cited 700,000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac. According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center (citing the \"Encyclopedia of the Holocaust\"), \"Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies.\"\n\nThe Jasenovac Memorial Area, currently headed by Slavko Goldstein, keeps a list of 59,188 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964. The previous head of the Memorial Area, Simo Brdar, estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac.\n\nThe Belgrade Museum of the Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulajić, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, Alexander Arnon (secretary of the Jewish Community in Zagreb) testified about the treatment of Jews in Yugoslavia during the war.\nAlexander Arnon's testimony included estimates of six hundred of thousand killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp.\n\nDuring World War II, various German military commanders gave different figures for the number of Serbs, Jews and others killed on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia. They circulated figures of 400,000 Serbs (Alexander Lehr); 350,000 Serbs (Lothar Rendulic); between 300,000 (Edmund Glaise von Horstenau); more than \"3/4 of a million Serbs\" (Hermann Neubacher) in 1943; 600-700,000 until March 1944 (Ernst Fick); 700,000 (Massenbach).\n\nThe first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941. These included:\n\nThese six camps were closed by October 1942. The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Bročica, were closed in November 1941. The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war:\n\nThere were also other camps in:\n\nNumbers of prisoners:\n\nThe Ustaše held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy, as a symbol of Serbian nationalism to them, was their greatest enemy. The Ustaše never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia. They recognized only \"Croats of the Eastern faith.\" They also called Bosnian Muslims \"Croats of the Islamic faith,\"(the latter which they wanted to force to convert to Christianity) but they had a stronger ethnic dislike of Serbs.\n\nSome former priests, mostly Franciscans, took part in the atrocities themselves. Miroslav Filipović was a Franciscan friar (from the Petrićevac monastery), who joined the Ustaša army on 7 February 1942 in a brutal massacre of 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages, including 500 children. Filipović became Chief Guard of Jasenovac concentration camp, where he was nicknamed \"\"Fra Sotona\"\" by the camp inmates. He was hanged for his war crimes in his Franciscan robes.\n\nFor the duration of the war, the Vatican kept up full diplomatic relations with the Ustaša state (granting Pavelić an audience), with its papal nuncio in the capital Zagreb. The nuncio was briefed on the efforts of religious conversions to Roman Catholicism. After the Second World War was over, the Ustaše who had managed to escape from Yugoslav territory (including Pavelić) were smuggled to South America. It is widely documented that this was done through rat lines operated by members of the organization who were Catholic priests and had previously secured positions at the Vatican. Members of the Illyrian College of San Girolamo in Rome were reputedly involved in this: friars Krunoslav Draganović, Petranović, and Dominik Mandić.\n\nThe Ustaše regime had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during WWII into Swiss banks. Of a total of 350 million Swiss Francs, about 150 million was seized by British troops; however, the remaining 200 million (ca. 47 million dollars) reached the Vatican. Allegations exist that it is still being kept in the Vatican Bank. This was reported by the American intelligence agency SSU in October 1946. This issue is the theme of a recent class action lawsuit against the Vatican Bank and others.\nAdolf Eichmann trial witness Alexander Arnon testified about the Roman Catholic Church stance that time: \nUnfortunately there were no protests. Croatia was definitely a Catholic state. Not even the Catholic Church in Zagreb said one word against the deportations and sufferings of the Jews.\nE. Fratini and D. Cluster wrote in their book \"The entity: Five centuries of secret Vatican espionage:\"\n\nThe Archbishop of Zagreb, Monisgor Alojzije Stepinac, provided Catholic support to the Pro Nazi government of Ante Pavelic; knew right from the start about the massacres and extermination of Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies; and was one of the pillars of the effort to help Nazi and Croatian criminals to escape to South America after the Second World War.\n\nArchbishop Stepinac also said this on 28 March 1941, in note of Yugoslavia's early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs: \"All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The schism (Eastern Orthodoxy) is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than Protestantism. Here there is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.\"\n\nAt the end of war, Ustaše continued fighting for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945, and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria. Pavelić, however, with the help of associates among the Franciscans, managed to escape and hide in Austria and Rome, later fleeing to Argentina.\n\nThe remaining Ustaše went underground or fled to South America and countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany, with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia.\n\nWith the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia, the movement ceased to exist. Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving Ustaše. Ante Pavelić formed the Croatian Liberation Movement, which drew several of the former state's leaders. Vjekoslav Vrančić founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement, and was its leader. \n\nVjekoslav Luburić helped form an organization called the \"Croatian National Resistance\" (\"Hrvatski narodni odpor\"). This became the most violent of the Ustaše organizations which were born after the WWII. Luburić commanded the organization for twenty-five years from his refuge in Spain. His organization was heavily involved in racketeering, attempted murder, extortion, hijacking, terrorist bombings, and other violent crimes. After his death, his successors on the organization commanding post sought out criminal organization ties with La Cosa Nostra, the Provisional IRA, and the Croatian Mafia in San Pedro. Odpor was banned in Germany for terrorist activities and operated (in the USA and Canada) between legitimate emigre functions and a thuggish underworld. Its leaders tried to distance the organization from the acts of the so-called renegade elements that hijacked international flights and served prison sentences for extortion. Odpor embraced a radical nationalist ideology that differed only marginally from Ustaše ideology.\n\nThe Odpor's most spectacular terrorist action was hijacking TWA Flight 355 on September 10, 1976. This terrorist action was masterminded by Zvonko Bušić, then the leader of the American branch of Odor. He and four other Croatian terrorists carried out the hijacking. Bušić also planted a bomb at Grand Central Station in New York City. An attempt to dismantle the bomb ended in a blast which killed one police officer and injured three others. All of the terrorists surrendered, and Bušić was sentenced to life in prison. The other four terrorists were sentenced to various long-term imprisonments.\n\nBlagoje Jovovic, a Serb, shot Ante Pavelić near Buenos Aires, Argentina, on April 9th, 1957. Pavelić was injured and later died.\n\nAnother Ustaše terrorist organization, the Croatian Revolutionary Cell, Bruno Busic Department, bombed the R. S. Schullz publishing house in Percha on Lake Starnberg, Germany, on August 19, 1981. The group, which claims to be based in Paris, used one kilogram of Swiss Mark 2 dynamite. They threatened to use two more kilograms the following week if the firm published Tito's memoirs.\n\n\n\n", "id": "295479", "title": "Ustaše"}

The idea is part of a wider philosophy called the philosophy of naturalism.\n\nThe term 'uniformitarianism' was invented by William Whewell in 1837 to describe Hutton's basic idea. This idea is the foundation of modern geology. \n\nHutton's ideas were popularised by John Playfair in 1802 in \"Illustrations of the Huttonian theory of the Earth\", and by Charles Lyell in his \"Principles of geology\" (1830 to 1833).

The movie was released on September 24, 2008 and received mixed reviews from reviewers, just like the first movie.\n\nIn the movie, Boog volunteers as the best man at Elliot (Joel McHale) and Giselle's (Jane Krakowski) wedding. However, the wilds are forced to go on an adventure when Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron) gets captured by Bob and Bobbie (Georgia Engel) and being forced to become a domestic pet by the pets' leader Fifi (Crispin Glover).\n\nElliot is in love with Giselle and is thinking of getting married. But in an accident, Elliot's giant new antlers are cracked. Boog and the others cheer Elliot up by having a rabbit fight. Mr. Weenie finds a dog biscuit trail that his previous owners left behind and follows it. Elliot sees Mr. Weenie being taking away by his old owners, Bob and Bobbie. The wilds decide to make a rescue attempt to save him. Boog, Giselle, McSquizzy, Buddy, Serge, and Deni all join in.\n\nMeanwhile, the tame pets meet. There is Fifi, a toy poodle and his basset hound companion Roberto, two cats; one named Stanley, whose companion is a mentally retarded cat named Roger, and a Southern dog named Rufus, whose companion is his girlfriend Charlene. The wilds find Weenie, much to Elliot's dismay, who does not want to marry Giselle.

Many of the ecosystems in the arctic are fragile, and can be easily destroyed. These ecosystems are being hurt by global warming.\n\nThe arctic environment includes both land and water. Two important parts of this environment are sea ice and permafrost.\n\nSea ice is ice that floats in the ocean. It is made of frozen seawater. It is important because animals live and sleep on the ice, especially in winter. Sea ice lasts all year and never melts completely. There is less ice during the summer than during the winter.\n\nLots of land in the arctic is frozen all year long. Permafrost is a substrate (layer of soil) that has been frozen for two or more years. The dirt on top of the permafrost is called the \"active layer\". This dirt melts during the summer and is important for plants to grow.\n\nIn the arctic region there is less food. The algae is eaten by small insects. These insects are eaten by plankton.

The caps lock key is usually above the Shift key and below the Tab key on the left side of the keyboard. However, some people prefer it to be in other locations.\n\nThe way the caps lock key works is that once you press it, a light may come on, or you may get a message on the screen. This lets you know that text that you type will be in uppercase letters. When you press the key again, the light turns off, or another message may appear, saying that caps lock has been turned off and text you type will be back to lowercase letters.\n\nSome keyboards and typewriters have a key called shift lock. It is a lot like the caps lock key in that letters you type will be in uppercase instead of lowercase. But shift lock also does something else: when it is on, keys which have two symbols on them, such as the number keys in the top row, will print the symbol on top, instead of the symbol on the bottom. For example, pressing the key with the number 1 on it will print the exclamation mark (\"!\") instead of the number 1. The caps lock key does not do this; it only affects the letter keys.\n\nPeople who type a lot, such as those who use typewriters, use the shift key instead of the caps lock or shift lock keys unless they have to type many capital letters in a row. But there is also a neat trick you can do with the caps lock and shift keys: when caps lock is on, you can hold the shift key while typing and what you type will be in lowercase letters instead of capitals.

He was assassinated (murdered) in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, on Friday, November 22, 1963. This happened while he was traveling in a Presidential motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally, and the governor's wife Nellie.\n\nAs the car drove into Dealey Plaza, shots were fired. Kennedy was shot once in the throat, and once in the head. It happened at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC). The motorcade drove to Parkland Memorial Hospital away. At 1:00 p.m., Kennedy was pronounced dead.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was the main suspect in the murder. He was arrested on the same day for the murder of a policeman, J. D. Tippit. He was charged with both murders later that night. Oswald denied shooting anyone. Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby two days later, on November 24. This was when Oswald was being moved from the police station to a jail. He died in Parkland Hospital.\n\nThe event left a lasting impression on many worldwide. As with Pearl Harbor before it and 9/11 after it, asking \"Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination\" would become a common topic of discussion.\n\nAn investigation into what happened was done by the Warren Commission in 1963–1964. It took 10 months. The commission decided that Oswald was the only person involved, and he had fired three shots from the window of a warehouse on the corner of Dealey Plaza. No one else was involved. The man who murdered Oswald, Jack Ruby, was also said to have acted alone.\n\nMost people at the time believed this was true. However, other alternative theories as to what could have happened have developed. Surveys from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.\n\nAnother investigation was done by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1979. They found that President John F. Kennedy was probably killed as a result of a conspiracy (a secret plot). The HSCA found both the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to have big mistakes. They agree with the Commission that Oswald fired all the shots. But they say that there were at least four shots fired. They also say that it was very likely that two gunmen fired at the President. No gunmen or groups involved in the conspiracy were pointed out by the committee. They said that the CIA, the Soviet Union, organized crime and several other groups were not involved.\n\nThe assassination is still the subject of a lot of debate. There are a lot of conspiracy theories. Some researchers have suggested that Oswald was not the shooter. Others have suggested that he conspired with others to kill the president. Most of these theories accuse criminal groups, the military–industrial complex, the government of Cuba, the KGB, or the CIA. Lyndon Johnson, George H. W. Bush and Sam Giancana are among those accused. That mob boss Sam Giancana was responsible is supported by the account of his brother and nephew. Only one person was ever put on trial: Clay Shaw, but he was found not guilty.\n\nSome have also argued that the gunshots were fired so quickly there must have been more than one assassin shooting at the President. This could be supported by the fact that most witnesses said that the second and third shots were fired closer together.\n\nSome believe that the bullets could not have hit Kennedy in the place they hit him if they had really been fired from the warehouse. Many of the workers at Parkland Hospital reported that a large portion of the back of the President's head appeared to have been blown out. This may suggest that he had been hit from the front.\n\n\n", "id": "295568", "title": "Assassination of John F. Kennedy"}

Speedruns are usually recorded on video tapes (mainly where consoles are concerned), or as a digital file, by the people (\"players\") who make them. It is recorded for entertainment. It can also be used by others to verify that the players actually completed the game in the time they said that they did. Speedruns were created for entertainment. People who began comparing each others' playing skills through videos exchanged over the Internet started speedruns. People want verifiability to see whether a person followed the rules and thus see whether the run counts as a valid attempt to beat the record.\n\nSpeedrunning began as a small project. It was started few people who shared their runs online. However, it has become a phenomenon which is discussed in several active websites. There are many speedrun videos distributed for free on the Internet.\n\nTool Assisted speedruns [TAS] are played on a computer emulator. The player records the movie on the emulator and submits the movie file to TASvideos.org if the movie file is good enough to obsolete a published run on their site. These types of speedruns take longer to make because the player can use the advantage of going back in time in the game and finding the fastest reactions for enemies and other items to beat the game in a time which the game developer would never thought the game could be beaten so quickly. \n\nNormal speedruns are played on a console or PC and recorded with a capture card or a DVD recorder. PC games are recorded with high quality screen recording software such as FRAPS and OBS.The most common normal speedrun site is called Speed Demos Archive. They split the runs into categories: any% (which means that the runner do what it takes to complete the game), 100% (which means that the do the whole game.) and low% (which means that the player uses large frame glitches). Before the speedrun is uploaded onto Speed Demos Archive, they have to verify the run to make sure that the runner was not cheating or using any game hacks.\n\nMany speedruns take advantage of bugs in video games, especially clipping problems that allow a player to walk through walls.\n", "id": "295592", "title": "Speedrun"}

It is 17.5 km from Sargodha city and 10 km away from Dhreema, due to its geographical location, the British Royal Air Force built an air base between Chak No 92 NB and Chak No 105 NB (Godhay wala) nearby. It took on greater importance after the Independence of Pakistan for the Pakistan Air Force. The population grew rapidly. Approximately 75% of the population of this village belongs to the Maken caste or clan of this region.\nBehak Maken was supposedly founded when one Raja Singh, Maken Rajput, first came to the Sargodha district (old Shahpur) sometime during the 12th or 13th century AD. It is claimed that the famous Punjabi Sufi saint Baba Farid \"Ganj Shakar\" appeared to Singh to instruct him in Islam after which the Raja settled permanently in the district with his family as a Muslim. He and his progeny founded this village and others in the vicinity.\n\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century, some of the Baloch tribe from Makran migrated and flocked into the country in and around Mankera,and subsequently ruled here for the next three hundred years. Later on, it fell under Sikh rule until 1849, when the Punjab was annexed by the East India Company and thus British rule lasted here until 1947.\n\nAccording to the 1998 census of Pakistan the village had a population of 5,513. In May 2011 the population of Behak Maken was estimated at 7000. About 90% of the people are followers of Sunni Islam.\n\nThe predominant ethnic population in the village is Punjabi with small communities of Muhajirs (immigrants/settlers from India) and Pashtuns.\nThe economy of this village is primarily agrarian. The vast fields of the village have allowed the farmers to develop a range of crops and animal breeding programs. Some of the main crops include citrus, wheat, rice, and sugar cane which are exported to the other cities as well as internationally. Citrus fruits such as oranges (local hybrid variety known as \"kinnows\") are the main fruit grown in the village. Other fruits grown here are Jaman, Guavas and Mangoes, Pears, Dates and Pomegranates. Almonds are also grown in minor quantities. Turnip, Onion, Cauliflower, Potatoes and Tomatoes are the main vegetables grown in the village. The main livestock in the village include goats, sheep, buffaloes and cattle. The village also supports an orange pulp processing factory on Jhang road.\n\nBehak Maken has an elementary school for boys and one primary school for girls. Many students go to University/Colleges for their studies at Sargodha and Sahiwal, many children are studying in Chak No 84 NB (English medium school) and some also study in a number of small, private academies at Sargodha. Sargodha has several institutions of higher education and several research centres and the local Sargodha University.\n\nDuring the British Raj most of the Maken clan or caste traditionally supported the Unionist Party (Punjab) but by the late 1940s, the swing started in favour of the All India Muslim League. After the creation of independent Pakistan, most of the people here remain supporters of the various Pakistan Muslim League factions, today.\n\nAn \"Urs\" (program of religious festivities) is held here every year on 25 March, in the memory of Syed Pir Hashim Darya Hamdani. Many followers come from different cities, towns and villages in Pakistan. It is a popular and joyous occasion with a \"Qawwali\" musical fest as well as a small rural fair with rides and other fun activities.\n\nPunjabi is the main language of the people here. Urdu is also spoken widely.\n\nFrequently two types of sports competition are played in this rural community. Volleyball and cricket are especially popular.\n\nMany welfare groups are functioning in this community; they perform and organize any time any type of work for the help and development of this village like construction / repair of Mosques, Madrass, basic infrastructure, streets and roads and more.\n\nBehak Maken residents and other populated places and communities in the vicinity are \nDistrict and Tehsil Sargodha Post office and village Behak Maken\nPostal Code: 40101\n", "id": "295608", "title": "Behak Maken"}

It is the eighth game in the \"Call of Duty\" series and the third game in the \"Modern Warfare\" series. The game was made by Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software. The game was released on November 8, 2011.\n\nThe game is a first-person shooter, like the other \"Call of Duty\" games. There are three main sections to the gameplay: campaign, special ops (the cooperative mode) and multiplayer.\nThe campaign follows the events of \"\". Russia continues its invasion of the United States of America and expands its attack to Europe, including the coutries England, France and Germany. The characters include people from previous games in the \"Modern Warfare\" series such as: John \"Soap\" Mactavish, Captain Price, Makarov and Macmillan.\n\nThere are three parts to the special ops mode: the Mission, Survival and Chaos modes. The Mission mode is a game mode that comes back from the special ops mode of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2\". In the Mission mode, players do lots of different missions and get stars for their work. The Survival mode is a new game mode. In the Survival mode, waves after waves of enemies attack the player/s. There is no way to complete Survival mode because the waves keep coming. There are thirty seconds between each wave of enemies. This is so the player has time to buy weapons, explosives and Pointstreaks. The Chaos mode is another new mode. Players must earn the most money they can, which is done by keeping the multiplier going and killing as many enemies as possible as quickly as possible. Weapons are scattered around the map, and perks and care packages assist the players.\n\nOne or two players can do Survival, Chaos and most Missions. Some Missions need two players.\n\nThe multiplayer is similar to that of \"Modern Warfare 2\". Players can do the multiplayer mode online or locally.\n\nPlayers can play different game modes in a variety of maps. As the player does more, they unlock new weapons, attachments and perks. They also unlock new titles and emblems, and they increase their multiplayer rank until the limit of 80. Players can enter \"Prestige\" mode once they complete level 80. This resets all the player's weapons, perks and pointstreaks. The first time it is done, the player will be on Prestige 1, and so on. This can be done 20 times. If a player has reached Prestige 20, they can spend a Prestige Token to reset all statistics to level 0, Prestige 0.\n\nThe Killstreak system is now called the Pointstreak system and it has changed very much. There are now three Pointstreak packages. A player picks one package and selects three rewards from it. In previous games, Killstreaks could only be earned by killing other players. Poinstreaks can now be earned for completing objectives in any objective mode, or by shooting down enemy air support. Pointstreak rewards are organized into three different Strike Packages called Assault, Support and Specialist. In \"Modern Warfare 3\", there are lots of new maps, weapons et cetera. However, the overall way the game is played is the same. DLC packs include maps from previous games, but they mostly need payment to unlock them. Players can play as an American, Briton, African, Russian or as a Frenchman, although this is randomly chosen. The multiplayer factions are Delta Force, Special Air Service, Spetsnaz, GIGN, Inner Circle, Africa Militia and PMC.\n\nOn May 12, 2011, four teaser trailers were released on the official \"Call Of Duty\" YouTube channel. These trailers were called: America, England, France and Germany. The trailers suggest that the countries are locations for the game.\nOn May 23, 2011, the reveal trailer was released.\nOn May 31, 2011, Activision announced \"Call of Duty Elite\". This is a social service for the \"Call of Duty\" community to compare progress, create videos and access premium content. The service will work with \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" and it will be launched at the same time as the game. On June 6, 2011, the first gameplay demo of the game was presented by Robert Bowling and Glen Schofield at E3 2011. On June 14, 2011, the first live gameplay demo of the new \"Survival Mode\" was played by Jimmy Fallon and Simon Pegg on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\". On August 9, 2011, the trailer for the new \"Survival Mode\" was released on YouTube. On September 2, 2011, the multiplayer world premiere trailer was released on YouTube. On September 2-3, 2011, Activision held a two-day event called \"Call of Duty: Experience 2011\", in Los Angeles, CA, to promote the game.\n\n\"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\" sold 6.8 million copies in the US and UK alone and grossed $470 million within 24 hours. It grossed more than $775 million globally in the first 5 days. \"Modern Warfare 3\" also topped the UK video game sales chart in the first seven days. By November 21, 2011, the game was the bestselling title in the United Kingdom, sales dropping by 87%. \"Modern Warfare 3\" was still the top spot on the UK charts in the third and fourth week.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295643", "text": "Randy Roth\n\nRandy Roth (born December 26, 1954) is an American murderer and thief from Washington. He was found guilty of the 1991 murder of his fourth wife, Cynthia Baumgartner Roth. Police thought he killed his second wife, Janis Roth, in 1981 but he was never put on trial for that. He was also found guilty of stealing from the place he worked, from an insurance company, and from Social Security. He was sent to jail for first degree murder in 1992.\n\nJanis Miranda married Roth in March 1981. They were both divorced and raising a child on their own. While they were dating Janis and Randy seemed to be a very happy couple. They seemed to be very much in love. After they got married, they were not like that anymore. Janis' friends saw that she did not seem as happy as she had before. Randy made sure they had a large amount of life insurance. He said he wanted to be able to pay the bills if something bad happened.\n\nOn the day after Thanksgiving 1981, something bad did happen. Janis fell to her death from a cliff at a place called Beacon Rock. Randy Roth was the only person who saw what happened. What he told the police and rescue workers who came to look for her did not always make sense. They could not find Janis for many hours. When they found her, she was not below the spot that Randy Roth said she fell from. The police thought Randy might have pushed Janis off a cliff but they could not prove it. The same day as the fall, Randy made sure Janis would cremated. The next day he made sure he would get paid the insurance money. What he did not do was tell Janis' family and friends that she was dead. He did not even tell her own daughter for a whole week.\n\nRoth had been married three times by the time he met Cynthia Baumgartner in 1990. Baumgartner was also a single parent. Her husband had died of Hodgkin's Disease in 1985. Randy Roth only told her about his own dead wife because she did not believe in divorce. He never told her that he had been divorced twice. Cynthia found out that Roth felt a need to control everything in her life. He did not want her doing anything on her own. Her friends saw that the way she looked and how clean her house was not as good as they used to be. They thought that Cynthia was sorry she had married Randy Roth. Roth was also abusive to all three of the boys in their house. \n\nOn July 23, 1991, they took Cynthia's two sons on a day trip to a big lake called Lake Sammamish. This is the same lake where Ted Bundy had kidnapped two young women years before. It was hot when the Roths arrived and the beach was crowded. Randy and Cynthia left the boys to play in the swimming area while they paddled their inflatable raft into deeper waters. Several hours later Randy Roth came back with Cynthia. She was either dead or dying from drowning. Lifeguards and paramedics tried to save her and take her to a hospital. She was dead when she got there. Randy Roth said that waves caused by a motorboat made the raft flip over and that Cynthia drowned because of that.\n\nThe police noticed that Randy Roth did not seem very upset that his wife was dead. He also did not always tell the story of how she died the same way. They began to think he might have killed her. Once again they could not prove it right away. Just like when Janis had died, he did not tell her friends and family but he did start trying to collect money from the insurance company right away. He had Cynthia cremated even though her parents did not want him to. After a while, he thought he was not going to get in any trouble but on October 8, 1991 he was arrested for murdering Cynthia.\n\nThe police knew it was going to be hard to get a jury to believe that Randy Roth killed his wife. Nobody but Roth saw what happened and there was no way to find anything at the place where she died since it was in a lake. They talked to the families of his other wives and his friends and neighbors. They began to think he did it for money. They also thought that he stole from people he worked for. Lori Baker was a friend of Cynthia's. She found out that Cynthia's will was missing and that Randy Roth was the last person to open the safe deposit box where it had been. Luckily there was another copy. When they read it they found out that Cynthia wanted her friend Lori and not Randy Roth to raise her sons if she died. This made Randy Roth very angry. He was hoping to get money from Social Security that they pay to children whose parents die in accidents. When Lori Baker came to get the boy's stuff from Randy's house, he yelled at her and would not let her take some of the stuff.\n\nNeighbors and an old friend of Roth told the police that Roth had faked burglaries to get money from the insurance company. A girl he had lived next door to told them she had sex with Randy when she was only fifteen years old. They said they never told anyone these things before because they were scared Randy Roth might do something to them.\n\nRoth had claimed that he had served in the Marines in a special forces unit in the Vietnam War. He also said he had been taught how to kill someone with no weapons and without leaving any marks on them. Randy Roth had been in the Marines, but he worked as a file clerk in Okinawa. He had never been to Vietnam or fought in a war. His mother helped him get out of the Marines early. \n\nThe police also talked to people about the death of Janis Roth ten years earlier. They met the police who had investigated it. They found out that there were a lot of things that were the same. He had said things that did not match up with other things he said. He did not seem as upset as most people would be if their wife died. He had her cremated right away. It seemed like he had killed two of his wives and done other criminal things. A judge decided they could arrest him and search his house. When they searched, they found many things that should not have been there. Most of these things belonged to the place where Randy Roth worked. He had stolen them. They also found receipts from when Randy Roth had bought things he said he was given by the Marines for fighting in Vietnam. In the garage, they found a poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not really love her. They also found out that Randy Roth had called someone on the telephone. Those people got to the house before the police and took some of the stolen things out of the house.\n\nThe police had the raft that Randy said had flipped over. They took it back to the same place at the lake and tried to get a boat to make a wave big enough to make it flip over. They could not get the boat to flip over. They threw bags of things into the lake that Randy said he had got back out after he got Cynthia back in the raft. They found out that the things sank too fast for that to be true. They also found out that Randy had a brother who was already in jail for killing a woman, and that Randy had been to jail for stealing. They talked to the people from Social Security and found he had told them lies to try and get money. They felt like they found out about a lot of dishonest things Randy did that would make him look bad in court.\n\nRandy Roth's lawyer tried to stop the trial. When that did not work, he tried to get the judge to tell the other lawyers that they could not tell the jury about the other crimes Randy Roth did. That did not work either. \n\nRandy's lawyer told the jury that he was just unlucky. The prosecutor said he was greedy and did not care about anyone but himself. \n\nOver one hundred people got up and talked about Randy Roth. One of them told how he had taught Randy how to scuba dive and that he was a very good swimmer. Roth had told the police that he was not good at swimming. People who were at the lake said that when Randy came back with Cynthia that he was not in a hurry or very upset about his wife drowning. Jalina Miranda was the daughter of Janis Roth. She told them how Randy did not tell her for a week that her mother was dead and that he stole money from her. They also heard the poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not love her.\n\nRandy Roth took the stand and talked for twenty hours. It took almost a week before they were done asking him questions. The prosecutor tried to get him to talk about all the lies he had told about Vietnam and other things. He could not lie that any longer but he said that he was telling the truth about how Cynthia died. He never got upset or angry about anything and still did not seem sad about his wife dying. \n\nEight and a half hours after the trial ended, the jury came back and said he was guilty of murdering his wife and stealing.\n\nBeacon Rock, where Janis fell and died, was in a place called Skamania County. They said if Randy Roth went to jail for more than fifty years they would not put him on trial for killing Janis. Trials cost much money and Skamania County did not want to use that money if Roth was going to be put in jail for more than 50 years already. The judge said Randy would go to jail for fifty-one years. Fifty years for killing Cynthia and one year for stealing. He will not be able to get parole until at least 2029. Lori Baker, the friend who took in Cynthia Roth's sons, went to court to make sure that Rany Roth and his family did not get any money from the insurance company or from selling Randy and Cynthia's house. Two books were written about Randy Roth and the murder. These books were \"A Rose for Her Grave\" by Ann Rule and \"Fatal Charm\" by Carlton Smith.\n\n", "id": "295643", "title": "Randy Roth"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295667", "text": "Voir dire\n\nVoir dire () is a name for the process of choosing jurors for a trial. It can also mean a small meeting between lawyers and a judge during a trial. It originally referred to an oath taken by jurors to tell the truth (). In the modern court systems, voir dire is a process governed by state and federal laws. It is basically designed to find biases in jurors. It has other uses depending on the court system.\n\nThe origin of the legal term voir dire is Anglo-Norman. It was an oath given to members of a jury. Witnesses are usually sworn in with the oath: \"The evidence you shall give... shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...\". The voir dire oath was: \"you shall true answer make to all such questions the court shall demand of you...\" In the United States the history of voir dire goes back to the Massachusetts Jury Selection Law of 1760. Many cases that went to trial involved seditious libel. British officials in the colonies put anyone on trial who printed anything criticizing British rule. To get every conviction possible, the British government made sure to only pick jurors who would convict the defendant. The sheriff was made responsible to select a list of jurors favorable to the British crown. To counter this, the 1760 Massachusetts law required the list the sheriff used to be selected by a town meeting. In those public meetings prospective jurors were questioned about any biases they might have. Defendants were also able to question possible jurors before they were selected. This voir dire process made jury selection fair. In 1774 the British Parliament cancelled the 1760 Massachusetts law. They left jury selection up to the court. This gave the crown a free hand in making sure trials ended the way they wanted. But, two years later the Americans declared their independence. The American system of voir dire was developed from that time on.\n\nVoir dire is an opportunity for lawyers to get the best juries for their client. This can become very involved. The process begins as the potential jurors enter the courtroom. The lawyers or their paralegals study the jury panel. They watch body language. They watch who jurors talk to or sit next to. There is a great deal of psychology used in jury selections. Juror behavior can be as important as their answers to questions. The voir dire questions are designed to reveal how a potential juror thinks. For example, books potential jurors read can reveal how they might vote. Also, lawyers try to give each juror individual attention while their paralegal takes notes. Eye contact, body language and attitude are all carefully studied during the interview. \n\nIn the United States voir dire is used to eliminate jurors who may have been influenced by pretrial publicity. But there are some indications it may do just the opposite if jurors are asked what their opinions are as to what the outcome should be. Outside the United States pretrial publicity is handled differently. Judges can order individuals not to talk about the trial while it is in progress. This is the case in Australia and Canada.\n\nJudges have a great deal of discretion (choices) in the voir dire process. In some courts the judge conducts voir dire. In other situations it is left entirely to the lawyers. In some cases it is a combination of both. Jurors are usually not quite as honest in answering voir dire questions with a judge as they are with a lawyer.\n\nIn some courts lawyers are given the chance to interview expert witnesses before they testify. An expert witness is anyone who has specialized or expert knowledge of a subject more than an average person would have. Sometimes an expert can be interrupted in his or her testimony for a voir dire to challenge their expertise. If a judge feels the challenge was successful, he can tell the jury to ignore the testimony.\n\nIn the United Kingdom voir dire is not used for jury selection. It is used to decide what evidence can and cannot be presented during the trial. This can include confessions made to the police. In Australia and Canada, voir dire is used as a sub-trial within a trial to examine evidence. It is usually done with the jury absent from the courtroom. In Canada, voir dire can also be used to challenge a particular juror for cause (for a specific reason). But cases of challenging a juror under voir dire are rare in Canada.\n\n", "id": "295667", "title": "Voir dire"}

The order was named after the style of columns used in buildings. It included the base, the shaft, the top (capital), and the part supported at the top; the architrave, the frieze and the cornice. Each order has its own style.\n\nDoric was the earliest style and used by the Greeks for most of their buildings and temples, including the Parthenon. It is believed that the style was first made using wood. The style features heavy columns, a saucer shaped capital on the top, and no base.\n\nThe columns (17) are fluted (18), which means they have about 20 grooves cut into them. The top of the column, the capital (14) is made up of a group of annulets. The saucer shaped piece is called the echinus (16). Above this is a square piece of stone, called the abacus (15), on the top. This supports the entablature, which is about one third of the height of the column. This is made up of a plain architrave (13) and a frieze with triglyphs (8). Between the triglyphs are square spaces, called metopes (9), which can be used for sculptures. Above this is a cornice with large blocks called mutules (5), which overhang the frieze. The lower surface of these blocks are called the soffit. Above this the block of stone has a plain vertical face called the corona.

The movie stars Elvis Presley, Carolyn Jones, and Walter Matthau. It is Presley's fourth movie (the third and last filmed in black & white). It was based on the 1952 novel by Harold Robbins, \"A Stone for Danny Fisher\".\n\nPresley plays a teenager named Danny Fisher, who is forced to drop out of school to help support his father (Dean Jagger). Always in trouble, Danny is saved from a jail term by New Orleans saloon-keeper Charlie Le Grand (Paul Stewart), who gives the boy a job as a singer. Soon a local gang boss, Maxie Fields (Walter Matthau), a shadowy figure from Danny's criminal past, puts pressure on the boy, insisting that Danny sing at his saloon. To tempt Danny, Maxie relies upon the seductive charms of his girlfriend Ronnie (Carolyn Jones), while Danny's true love Nellie (Dolores Hart) suffers on the sidelines.\n\n\nHal Wallis purchased the rights to \"A Stone For Danny Fisher\" so he could make a non-musical movie starring either James Dean or Ben Gazzara. After Dean died in 1955, the project did not continue. In January 1957, following the success of an Off-Broadway stage version of the story, Presley's name was suggested as a possible replacement. The character of Fisher was changed from a boxer to a singer and the story was moved from New York to New Orleans. \n\nWith filming starting in January 1958, Presley had to get special permission to delay his entry to the US Army, until after filming was complete.\n\nMichael Curtiz, a noted director during the golden era of the Hollywood studio system was hired for the project. His famous movies included \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" in 1938, \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" in 1942, and in the same year, \"Casablanca\", \n\nAfter seeing an early copy of the movie Presley thanked Curtiz for giving him the chance to show people he could be an actor. \"King Creole\" was said to have been Presley's favorite role of his entire career. He had high hopes of returning from the Army to pick up from where he had left off. However, despite success of the movie, he never got the chance to be taken as seriously as an actor again, with the exception of the westerns \"Charro!\" and \"Flaming Star\". This was partly due to the success of later movies such as \"Blue Hawaii\", \"G.I. Blues\", and \"Viva Las Vegas\". These were all quick to make, low cost box-office hits. They had enough songs to sell soundtrack albums and entertain the thousands of Presley fans who were more eager to see him sing than act.\n\n\"King Creole\" was the last movie Presley made during the 1950's and is often said to be his best role. \n\nFilming took place between January 20 and March 12 1958. Twelve days after the finishing \"King Creole\", Presley joined the U.S. Army.\n\n\n", "id": "295697", "title": "King Creole"}

This causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure. This type of well is called an artesian well. Water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough, in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well. \n\nAn aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel, limestone, or sandstone, through which water flows and is stored. An artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure. Water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well. \n\nFossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks.

Think of the atoms as round balls that are attached by a spring that can stretch back and forth. An example of this motion is \"stretching\", the simplest example of a vibration for a molecule and occurs between just two atoms. Some examples of molecules that are like this include hydrogen H, nitrogen N and oxygen O\n\nIf the molecule has more than two atoms, then things get more complicated. Suppose just one more atom is added so now there are three atoms like in water HO where the two hydrogen atoms are both attached to the central oxygen atom. Remember with hydrogen there was one kind of stretching, but in water there are two kinds of stretching and four other kinds of vibration called bending vibrations as shown below.\n\nThe atoms in a CH group or molecules like water can vibrate in six different ways: symmetric and antisymmetric stretching, scissoring, rocking, wagging and twisting:\n\nsymmetric stretching: when the two attached atoms move away and toward the central atom at the same time.\n\nantisymmetric stretching: When the two attached atoms do not move away and toward the central atom at the same time.\n\nscissoring: Just like the name says scissoring is when the two atoms move away and toward each other\n\nrocking: This motion is like a pendulum on a clock going back and forth only here an atom is the pendulum and there are two instead of one.\n\nwagging: If a person holds up their hand in front of them and puts there two fingers in a \"V\" sign and bend there wrist toward and away from them. Here the tips of the fingers are the attached atoms and the wrist is the central atom.\n\ntwisting: This motion is like a person is walking on a treadmill where their waist is the central atom and their feet are the two attached atoms\n\nMolecules with more than three atoms are even more complicated and have even more vibrations which are sometimes called \"vibrational modes\". Each new vibrational mode is basically a different combination of the six shown above. The more atoms in the molecule the more ways they can be combined. For most molecules with N atoms the number of possible vibrations for that molecule is 3N - 6 while linear molecules, or molecules with there atoms in a straight line, have 3N-5 vibrational modes.\n\nUsing Newtonian mechanics the vibrations of a molecule can be calculated by treating the bonds like springs. This is useful because like a spring, a bond requires energy to stretch it out and it also takes energy to squeeze it together. The energy needed to stretch or squeeze the bond is dependent on the stiffness of the bond, which is represented by the \"spring constant\" k, and the reduced mass, or \"center of mass\" of the two atoms attached to either end denoted by \"μ\". The formula used to relate the energy needed to cause a vibration in the bond is:\n\n\"h\": is planck's constant\n\nν: is frequency and represents the rate at which the bond is squished together and pulled apart again. The larger ν the faster this rate becomes.\n\nΕ: is the energy required to push and pull the bond together.\n\n\"μ\": The reduce mass is the two masses of the atoms multiplied together and divided by their addition:\n\nUsing quantum mechanics, the formula that describes the spring is exactly the same as the Newtonian mechanics version except only certain energies or energy levels are allowed. Think of the energy levels as steps on a ladder where a person can only go up or down one rung at a time. Just as that person can't stand on the space between rungs so the bond can not have an energy between energy levels. This new formula becomes:\n\nwhere \"n\" is a quantum number or \"energy level\" that can take values of 0, 1, 2 ... \nThe statement that energy levels can only go up or down one level at a time is known as a selection rule which states that the only allowed transitions between energy levels are:\n\nwhere \\Delta n is the energy transition.\n\nWhen light of a certain frequency hits a molecule that has a vibration whose motion corresponds to the same frequency then the light gets absorbed into the molecule and the energy from the light causes the bonds to move in that specific vibrational motion. By checking for light that gets absorbed, scientists can tell if a certain kind of molecular bond is there and match it against a list of molecules that have that bond.\n\nHowever, some molecules like helium and argon have only one atom and don't have any bonds. This means that they won't absorb any light in the same way a molecule with more than one atom can.\n\nThe specific fields of chemistry that use molecular vibrations in their studies include infrared spectroscopy (IR) and Raman spectroscopy (Raman) with IR being more widely used and having three subfields of its own. These subfields are known as Near IR, Mid IR and Far IR spectroscopy. The following is a general list of these fields and real world applications\n\nNear IR: quantitative determination of species such as proteins, fats, low low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons and water. Further use is obtained in the agricultural products, food, petroleum and chemical industries\n\nMid IR:The most popular of the IR fields, is used in determining structure of organic and biochemical compounds.\n\nFar IR: this field is less popular though it has found uses in inorganic studies\nRaman: Is used for the qualitative and quantitative study of inorganic, organic and biological systems often as a complimentary technique to IR.\n", "id": "295795", "title": "Molecular vibrations"}

She is known for founding Lilly Pulitzer, Inc., which makes clothes with bright, colorful patterns. Because the brand has been very popular with rich people, Lilly has been called the \"Queen of Prep\".\n\nLillian Lee McKim, nicknamed Lilly, was born on November 10, 1931 in Roslyn, New York. Her father was Robert V. McKim and her mother was Lillian McKim (maiden name Bostwick). She was the middle child, with an older sister named Mary Maude and younger sister named Florence Fitch. Her mother, Lillian, was an heir to the Standard Oil fortune. Lillian divorced Robert and married Ogden Phipps in 1937.\n\nLilly went to the Chapin School in New York City, along with Bouvier sister Jacqueline. In 1949, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Connecticut. She attended the college-finishing school Finch College in New York City, but left after one semester to work as a midwife's assistant in West Virginia and later as a volunteer at the Veterans Hospital in The Bronx. \n\nIn 1950, she married Peter Pulitzer, the grandson of publisher Joseph Pulitzer. They moved to Palm Beach, where Lilly started her clothing company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. In 1969, Lilly and Peter were divorced. She married Enrique Rousseau soon after. She legally changed her name to Lillian Rousseau, but her clothing company kept the \"Lilly Pulitzer\" label. Lilly continued to live in Palm Beach. Enrique died from cancer in 1993.\n\nLilly has three children from her marriage to Peter: Peter, Minnie, and Liza. Peter lives in Bridgehampton, New York, with his wife, Elise, and five children: Fiona, Caleb, Stefan, Aaron, and Daniella. Liza currently lives in West Palm Beach, Florida, with her husband, Henry, and three children: Waverly, Hattie and Rayna. Liza is currently helping out in Florida with the Lilly Pulitzer Brand.\n\nPulitzer died on April 7, 2013 in her home in Palm Beach, California from natural causes, at age 81.\n\nLilly and Peter settled in Palm Beach, Florida, shortly after their marriage. Peter owned several Florida citrus groves, and with fruit from the groves Lilly opened a juice stand on Via Mizner, just off Worth Avenue in Palm Beach.\n\nIn the course of working at the juice stand, Lilly found that squeezing juice made a mess of her clothes. Seeking to hide the juice stains, she designed a sleeveless shift dress made of bright, colorful printed cotton. Lilly found that customers loved her dress, so she made more to sell at her juice stand. Eventually, she was selling more dresses than juice, and decided to focus on making and selling what had become known as her \"Lillys\".\n\nIn 1959, Lilly became president of her own company, Lilly Pulitzer, Inc. The company's main factory was located in Miami, Florida and the fabrics were produced by the Key West Hand Print Fabrics company in Key West.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the early 1980s, Lilly's bright, colorful clothes were very popular, worn by rich people such as First Lady Jackie Kennedy, and members of the Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney families. However, by 1984, Lilly felt she was not having as much fun as she used to and retired, closing down her entire clothing business.\n\nIn 1993, the rights to the Lilly Pulitzer brand were bought by Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. They contacted Lilly with the hopes of bringing back the brand because, \"they just loved Lilly, their mothers and sisters loved Lilly, and they wanted to bring the line back,\" according to Lilly herself. Lilly is not involved in the day to day running of the company, but she continues to do things like approve new designs, fabrics, and collections. \n\nToday, the company has 75 Lilly Pulitzer Signature Stores (also known as Via Stores), several company-owned retail stores, sells to independently owned stores and is in major department stores such as Bloomingdales, Lord and Taylor, Nordstrom, and Neiman Marcus. On December 21, 2010, Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. was bought by Oxford Industries, Inc.\n\nAlong with women's clothing, the company also makes men's clothing, children's clothing, maternity clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories, bedding (revived in 2010), and stationery. The company started a bridal collection in 2010.\n\nLilly Pulitzer has made special collections with sorority prints on them, among them Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Delta Delta Delta, and Delta Zeta. She has held contests on her Facebook page to vote on which sororities will get their own prints.\n\nLisa Birnbach's humorous \"guides\", \"The Official Preppy Handbook\" and its sequel \"True Prep: It’s a Whole New Old World\", say Lilly Pulitzer clothing is a must-have item for \"preppy\" women.\n\nThe Museum of Lifestyle & Fashion History in Boynton Beach, Florida, ran an exhibit from August 2010 through May 2011 about the clothing and designs of Lilly Pulitzer. Museum director Lori Durante stated \"Lilly Pulitzer fashion is relative to the American experience ...

They also denote whether the group is for men or women. Sororities are only for women. Fraternities are primarily for men, but less often, a fraternity can be for both men and women.\n\nFraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools. Each fraternity or sorority is given two or three Greek letters to call themselves, for example, ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) or ΑΧΩ (Alpha Chi Omega). To tell the difference between groups at different schools, called chapters, each chapter is given another set of Greek letters. For example, a man in the Kappa Sigma fraternity who goes to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is part of the fraternity's EX (Epsilon Chi) chapter. Chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in.\n\nFraternities and sororities often participate in community service.\n\nFraternities and sororities are often exclusive, meaning people who want to join need to be invited to do so. This is done during a process called \"rushing\". During a rush, people who want to join a chapter will talk to current members. If the member think the person rushing is a good fit for the group, they will get an invitation, called a \"bid\", to join the chapter. If the person rushing accepts, they become a \"pledge\".\n\nThe pledging period is a time when the pledge is not yet a full member, and may leave or be refused membership at any time. Sometimes, members of the chapter will put the pledge through trials. Sometimes they are tests on the history of the fraternity they are trying to join, wearing a badge with the fraternity's letters on it at all times, or performing public service. Sometimes the trials are cruel, dangerous or humiliating. If the trials are cruel, it is called \"hazing\". Hazing is illegal in 44 states.\n\nAfter the pledging period, the pledge becomes a full member of the chapter and fraternity or sorority.\n", "id": "295894", "title": "Fraternities and sororities"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295972", "text": "Seed fern\n\nThe term seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) are several distinct groups of extinct seed plants (spermatophytes). \n\nThe oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata, and they flourished particularly during the Carboniferous and Permian periods. \n\nPteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous, though some fossil pteridosperm-like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania. \n\nThe concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many Carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features like cycads. \n\nBritish palaeobotanists made the critical discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds, and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants. \n\nInitially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads, and especially in the English-speaking world they were referred to as \"seed ferns\" or \"pteridosperms\". Today, most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading, but the names have nevertheless stuck.\n\nLater during the 20th century, the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern-like fronds. Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as \"Glossopteris\" and its relatives, which was clearly stretching the concept. \n\nThe seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants, and must have included the ancestors of the later plants. They are spread across a range of clades and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic 'grade-group'.\n\nSo, does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today? Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms, coniferoids (conifers or cordaites), ginkgophytes or cycadophytes (cycads or bennettites). \n\nThis is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups, whose relationships are unknown. We can call them pteridosperms with no suggestion of being a clade. Also, for curators or collectors, the term 'pteridosperm' is a useful shorthand for describing fern-like fronds probably produced by seed plants, which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras.\n", "id": "295972", "title": "Seed fern"}

Zevon wrote many songs that were humorous and often political\n\nMany famous musicians have said they liked Zevon's work, including Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young. His most famous songs include \"Werewolves of London\", \"Lawyers, Guns and Money\", \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\" and \"Johnny Strikes Up The Band.\" All of these are from his third and most famous album: \"Excitable Boy\" (1978). Zevon has written many songs that were recorded by other artists. These include \"Poor Poor Pitiful Me\" (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), \"Accidentally Like a Martyr,\" \"Mohammed's Radio,\" \"Carmelita\", and \"Hasten Down the Wind\".\n\nZevon sometimes recorded or sang cover songs. He liked to sing Bob Dylan's \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\" and Leonard Cohen's \"First We Take Manhattan\". He was often a guest on \"Late Night with David Letterman\" and the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". Letterman later sang with Zevon on \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.\n\nHe had a lot of problems in his life, including divorce, alcoholism, and suicide attempts. He also had a paranoia of doctors and this killed him: he did not know he had cancer until doctors could not help him.\n\nZevon was born in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were to William Zevon, a Secular Jew and Beverly Cope Simmons, a Mormon from Salt Lake City, Utah. They soon moved to Fresno, California. By the age of 13, Zevon sometimes visited Igor Stravinsky where he studied modern classical music. Zevon's parents divorced when he was 16 years old. After the divorce, he dropped out of high school and moved from Los Angeles to New York to become a folk singer.\n\nIn 1978, Zevon released his most popular and critically acclaimed album \"Excitable Boy\". Radio stations often played the songs off the album, especially \"Werewolves of London.\" \"Werewolves of London\" and \"Excitable Boy\" were both examples of black humor (jokes about bad things). The album also had the songs \"Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner\" and \"Lawyers, Guns and Money,\" which were both deadpan humor songs about geopolitics.\n\"Rolling Stone\" named the album one of the most important albums in the 1970s. They said that he, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen were four of the best new artists to emerge in the 1970s.\n\nAfter \"Excitable Boy\" Warren Zevon published \"Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School\" in 1980. This album had the only other song recorded by Zevon that reached the Billboard Top 100: \"A Certain Girl.\" \"A Certain Girl\" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint.\n\nThis album was dedicated to Ken Millar, who calls himself \"Ross Macdonald.\" Millar is a writer who writes mystery novels, and Zevon really liked Millar's stories. He met Millar in an intervention put together by the journalist Paul Nelson. For awhile this intervention helped Zevon not drink too much alcohol.\nWarren Zevon did not like to go to the doctor, and never went to one when he was an adult. Before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and started to have a chronic cough. When Zevon told his dentist his problems, his dentist recommended seeing a doctor. When he finally visited one, the doctor diagnosed him with mesothelmia.\n\nWarren Zevon did not want to get treated for his cancer if it might keep him from making music. So instead he started to make his final album, titled \"The Wind\". He had a lot of friends who helped him make the album. These friends included Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "296044", "title": "Warren Zevon"}

This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today.\n\nThe rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate. \n\nThe wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.\n\n\"Lepidodendron\" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged. \n\nThe closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin. \n\nThe scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of \"Lepidodendron\" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark.\n\n\"Lepidodendron\" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk.\n\nThe branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. \"Lepidodendron\" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores.\n\nStigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks.

FitzGerald was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965, and in 1969 to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael TD. He served as Foreign Affairs Minister from 1973 to 1977. FitzGerald was the leader of Fine Gael between 1977 and 1987.\n\nHe was the son of Desmond FitzGerald, the first Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State following independence from the United Kingdom in 1922. At the time of his death, FitzGerald was the President of the Institute of International and European Affairs, had a column in \"The Irish Times\" and occasionally made appearances on television programmes.\n\nGarret FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family. His father was Desmond FitzGerald, and was the Minister for External Affairs at the time of his son's birth. FitzGerald senior had been active in Sinn Féin during the Irish War of Independence, and had been one of the founders of Cumann na nGaedheal, the party formed to support the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which created the Irish Free State.\n\nAlthough a senior figure on the \"pro-treaty\" side of Ireland's political divide, Desmond FitzGerald had remained friendly with anti-Treaty republicans such as Belfast man Seán MacEntee, a minister in Éamon de Valera's government, and father-in-law of Conor Cruise O'Brien. The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household. FitzGerald's mother, the former Mabel Washington McConnell, was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent. Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mother's family tradition and the southern Catholics of his father's could feel equally at home.\n\nGarret FitzGerald was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin (UCD), from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946, later returning to complete a Ph.D. which he obtained in 1968. He was deeply interested in the politics of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival, Charles Haughey, who also knew Joan O'Farrell (the Liverpool-born daughter of a British army officer, Richard O'Farrell) a fellow student, whom FitzGerald married in 1947.\n\nFollowing his university education, in 1947 he started working with Aer Lingus, the state airline of Ireland, and became an authority on the strategic economic planning of transport. During this time he wrote many newspaper articles, was the Irish correspondent for the Economist Magazine, and was encouraged to write on National Accounts and economics by the Features Editor in \"The Irish Times\". He remained in Aer Lingus until 1959, when after undertaking a study of the economics of Irish Industry in Trinity College, Dublin, he became a lecturer in economics at UCD.\n\nFitzgerald was also qualified as a barrister from the King's Inns of Ireland.\n\nGarret FitzGerald was eager to enter politics, and it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fáil, including Charles Haughey and Michael Yeats, that he should join that party. Ultimately FitzGerald made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael. He attached himself to the liberal wing of Fine Gael, which rallied around the Just Society programme written by Declan Costello. FitzGerald was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile. FitzGerald was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, for the Dublin South East constituency, the same year he obtained his PhD for a thesis later published under the title \"Planning in Ireland\". He became an important figure almost immediately in the parliamentary party and his liberal ideas were seen as a counterweight to the conservative leader, Liam Cosgrave. Difference in political outlook, and FitzGerald's ambitions for the Fine Gael leadership resulted in profound tensions between the two men. In his leadership address to the 1972 Fine Gael ard fheis in Cork, Cosgrave referred to the 'mongrel foxes' who should be rooted out of the party, a reference seen by many as an attack on FitzGerald's efforts to unseat him as leader.\n\nAfter the 1973 general election Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the actual Minister for Finance, George Colley. However the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father W. T. Cosgrave fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period in foreign affairs, Fitzgerald, developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared.\n\nThe minister's role had changed a lot since his father's day. Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community (EEC), now known as the European Union (EU). FitzGerald, as Foreign Minister, was free from any blame due to other Ministers mishandling of the economy. If anything his time at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him to achieve the leadership of the party. His innovative views, energy and fluency in French won him – and through him, Ireland – a status in European affairs far exceeding the country's size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success.\n\nIn 1977 the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election. Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen to succeed him. In his new role as Leader of the Opposition and party leader he set about modernising and revitalising Fine Gael. He immediately appointed a General-Secretary to oversee all of this, a tactic copied from Fianna Fáil. Under FitzGerald, Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity. By the November 1982 election, it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fáil (their closest ever margin until 2011; at times Fianna Fáil was nearly twice as large), with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas \"bigger\" than Fianna Fáil, an unprecedented achievement.\n\nBy the time of the 1981 general election Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna Fáil's. The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs. FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981. To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan, Richard Burke and Tom O'Donnell, former Fine Gael stalwarts, from the cabinet. \n\nTwo fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period: Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation. A protest march in support of the H-Block hunger strikers in July 1981 was dealt with by FitzGerald harshly. On one occasion where he with relatives of the hunger strike, he refused to meet the family of Bobby Sands MP, the Officer Commanding of the Provisional IRA hunger strikers, and the first to die on this strike, along with the sister of Raymond McCreesh, who had died on 21 May. During the meeting two of Thomas McElwee sisters, Mary and Nora, broke down and left the meeting. Mary McElwee stated that \"He's doing nothing, he's asking for suggestions\". Fitzgerald then ordered Gardai to remove the families from the meeting. Fitzgerald's response was, in the words of Eamonn Sweeney, to \"lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the Republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign\".\n\nThe economic crisis was also a lot worse than FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax-cuts in the run-up to the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.\n\nViewing his defeat as a loss of support FitzGerald headed to Áras an Uachtaráin to ask the President, Patrick Hillery, to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. When he got there, he was told that senior opposition figures (and some independent TDs), including Fianna Fáil leader (and ex-Taoiseach) Charles Haughey, Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett had made a series of telephone calls demanding that the President refuse to grant the dissolution. This would force FitzGerald to resign as Taoiseach and allow the Dáil to nominate someone else for the post. The President is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.\n\nIn the subsequent general election in February 1982, Fine Gael lost only two seats and were out of power. However, a third general election within eighteen months in November 1982 resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time, heading a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a working majority.\n\nDeep economic recession dominated FitzGerald's second term as well as his first. The pursuit of ‘fiscal rectitude’ in order to reduce a high national debt needed a firm control of public spending and Labour found this hard to accept. The friendly relationship the Taoiseach developed with Tánaiste Dick Spring successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years, despite tensions between other ministers, and enabled the Government to survive. Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks in order to reduce the public budget deficit. \n\nThe measures proposed by FitzGerald's Minister for Finance, Alan Dukes, were completely unacceptable to the Labour Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services. The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position. They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth. With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment, the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public. The Fianna Fáil opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback.\n\nAs Taoiseach for a second time FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society, to create what he called the non-sectarian nation of \"Tone and Davis\". His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum, although he did liberalise Ireland's contraception laws. A controversial 'Pro-Life Amendment' (anti-abortion clause), which was stated to recognise the 'Right to Life of the Unborn, with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother' was added to the Irish constitution, against FitzGerald's advice, in a national referendum.\n\nFitzGerald set up The New Ireland Forum in 1983, which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from the North. Although the Unionist parties spurned his invitation to join, and the Forum’s conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments, which culminated in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of November 1985. This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the Republic of Ireland could be consulted by the British Government under Margaret Thatcher regarding the governance of Northern Ireland, and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland, whose MPs all resigned their seats in the British Parliament in protest. New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland, in which the unionists lost the seat of (Newry and Armagh) to Seamus Mallon of the SDLP.\n\nWhile the Agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists, it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments, which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993, and the later republican and loyalist cease-fires.\n\nIn 1986, FitzGerald tried to reshuffle his cabinet but certain ministers, including notably Barry Desmond refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio. The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGerald's authority. The new Progressive Democrats party was launched at the same time by Desmond O'Malley out of the divisions within Fianna Fáil. Ironically, it struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to fully address the economic crisis and who yearned for a coherent rightwing policy from FitzGerald. Seeing its support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGerald's Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach, despite their leader's close empathy with that party.\n\nStymied by economic crisis, FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the State and he proposed, in the summer of 1986, a referendum to change the Constitution to allow for divorce. The proposed amendment was mired in controversy and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not clearly presented. Haughey skillfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights. The defeat of the referendum sealed the fate of the Government.\n\nIn January 1987, the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals. FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years. Fianna Fáil returned to power in March 1987, after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election. The Progressive Democrats won some 14 seats mainly from Fine Gael. Although Haughey did not have an overall majority when it came to a vote the Independent Socialist TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" (the reason for this was Gregory's personal Republican convictions and his opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle.\n\nFitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election by the Dáil of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach, to be replaced by Alan Dukes. His autobiography \"All in a Life\" appeared in 1991, immediately becoming a best-seller. He retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election. His wife, Joan, predeceased him, dying in 1999 after a long illness.\n\nAfter that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in \"The Irish Times\", and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs. He came out of retirement to campaign for a \"yes\" vote in the second Irish referendum on the EU's Treaty of Nice, held in 2002. He held the post of Chancellor of the National University of Ireland from 1997 to 2009. In March 2000, Fitzgerald was on the Board of Directors of Election.com, when it conducted the world's first public election ever held over the Internet, which was the Arizona Democratic Primary, which was won by Al Gore; in that primary, voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.\n\nFitzGerald took a leading part in the campaign for the second referendum on the EU's Treaty of Lisbon in 2009. He argued for Ireland to continue with European integration. FitzGerald has been scathing of the record of the Fianna Fáil led Government since 1997 on the economy and the national finances. He was a frequent critic, in his column in \"The Irish Times\", of the loss of competitiveness that occurred and the inflation caused by the tax cuts and excessive public spending increases of the Celtic Tiger era. In 2009, FitzGerald received a new ministerial car, the first and only one to be purchased by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008. In 2010, FitzGerald appeared on RTÉ's \"Top 40 Irishmen\" list.\n\nIn early 1999 it was revealed that some six years earlier, AIB and Ansbacher Banks wrote off debts of almost IR£200,000 owed by FitzGerald following the collapse of the aircraft leasing company, Guinness Peat Aviation, in which he was a shareholder. Chairman of AIB at the time, Peter Sutherland, was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald, prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Ireland's member of the European Commission. The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter, and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey. They found no evidence of any wrongdoing, indeed the Tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to - even selling his family home - to repay the debt to the best of his ability.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded in their report:\nIn summary it would appear that in compromising his indebtedness with the Bank, Dr. Fitzgerald disposed of his only substantial asset, namely, his family home at Palmerston Road, a property which would now be worth a considerable sum of money. As in Mr. Haughey's case, there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr. Fitzgerald's case. However in contrast with Mr. Haughey's case, Dr. Fitzgerald's case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr. Haughey's assets were retained virtually intact.\n\nOn 5 May 2011, it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital. The Taoiseach Enda Kenny sent his regards and called him an \"institution\". He was put on a ventilator. On 19 May, he died, aged 85, in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin.\n\nPresident Mary McAleese described him as a man steeped in the history of the State who constantly strove to make Ireland a better place for all its people. \"His thoughtful writing, distinctive voice and probing intellect all combined to make him one of our national treasures. Above all, Garret Fitzgerald was a true public servant,\" she said. \"Long after he departed active politics, Garret continued to contribute to public life through his voluminous writing and scholarship. His weekly columns in The Irish Times were essential reading for those who sought enlightenment on the issues and debates of the day.\"\n\nTaoiseach Enda Kenny said Dr FitzGerald was \"a truly remarkable man who made a truly remarkable contribution to Ireland\" and that \"his towering intellect and enthusiasm for life\" will be missed by everybody. “He had an eternal optimism for what could be achieved in politics. You could not tire him out and his belief that politics and democracy would work for peace.\" Former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader John Bruton said FitzGerald would \"stand out as a man who changed Ireland\" and that he had changed attitudes to in the Republic to Northern Ireland and to Europe and that he saw that \"Ireland could do best in Europe if it contributed creatively to goals and ambitions of other members\".\n\nHis death occurred during the third day of Queen Elizabeth II's visit to the Republic of Ireland, an event designed to mark the completion of the Northern Ireland peace process which, arguably, FitzGerald began with the Anglo-Irish Agreement. In response to his death, the Queen said of FitzGerald, \"I was saddened to hear this morning's news of the death of Garret FitzGerald, a true statesman. He made a lasting contribution to peace and will be greatly missed.\" British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who was also in Ireland, said of him:\n\nI watched him as a student of politics, rather than someone involved in politics, and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman as well as a politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.\n\nThe following governments were led by FitzGerald:\n", "id": "296115", "title": "Garret FitzGerald"}

These pieces were written by Frédéric Chopin between 1837 and 1838. They were published in the middle of 1839, just after the composer's winter sojourn (stay) on the isle of Majorca with George Sand. Chopin was greatly influenced by Johann Sebastian Bach in the composition of these preludes. The title may have been a tribute to Bach's 24 preludes and fugues in \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\". Like Bach, Chopin journeys through the circle of fifths. The preludes begin in C major and end in D minor. One of the well-known ones is Prelude No. 15, nicknamed \"Raindrop\". This nickname refers to the monotonous repetition of one note in the accompaniment. It reminded early music lovers of the dripping of raindrops. Another well-known number is Prelude No. 4 with its melancholy descending chords in the accompaniment. The \"Preludes\" are all very different. Many are very short, so the atmosphere changes quickly, and this can make the overall structure seem disorganized and uncontrolled. \n\n", "id": "296247", "title": "Preludes (Chopin)"}

It was first performed in Vienna, Austria on 22 December 1808 in the Theater an der Wien with the premieres of the Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the Piano Concerto No. 4 in G major, the \"Choral\" Fantasy, \"Ah! perfido!\" (a concert aria composed in 1796), and excerpts from the Mass in C major of 1807. \n\nThere are five movements in the symphony.

The first movement is in sonata form. It is placid and cheerful. It depicts the composer's feelings as he arrives in the country. The second movement is in sonata form. Beethoven helpfully identified the bird species in the score: nightingale (flute), quail (oboe) and cuckoo (clarinet). The third movement is the scherzo movement of the symphony. It depicts the country folk dancing and it ends unexpectedly when the country folk notice that raindrops are starting to fall. The fourth movement depicts a violent thunderstorm, starting with just a few drops of rain and building to a climax. There is, of course, thunder, as well as lightning, high winds, and sheets of rain. The finale is in sonata rondo form.

While in the bathroom scenes, Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party. When the chorus comes on, Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine, costumed in a low-cut gold halter top, black hots pants, a black jacket with shoulder pads, and big hair. Once arrived at the mansion party, she is first seen dancing ontop of a big, wooden table. In continuing after, Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansion's study. The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom, once again waking up.\n\n\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" is Cyrus' third single. It was a single on June 11th 2011. It was made by Poison in 1988. Miley's version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poison's official song. Hollywood Records is due to release Cyrus' cover in June 2011, while a music video is in the works.\n", "id": "296417", "title": "Can't Be Tamed"}

After Eliza's death in 1900, he moved to Kirk Ireton and later married fellow artist Kate Stevens Smith (1871-1964) - they set up home in Idridgehay, and he died there in 1910. His son William Lakin Turner (1867-1929) also became a famous landscape oil painter.\n\nMost of Turner's paintings are of Derbyshire where he lived.

This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave. In such a system, the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information; all information is present in the phase of the signal. In many cases, this allows to better use the bandwidth available. \n\nIf we think of a wave as a wiggly line, (like a sine wave), wiggling a specific amount of times a second, and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in. Say if it is at the top of its wiggle, and we immediately change it to the bottom of its wiggle, this is called a phase shift. We can use that change to carry information.\n\nBy either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle, we can send either ones or zeros. This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying. If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top, we can have this represent a 1. If we don't change it at the top, we can have this represent a 0. We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it. A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text.\n\nBinary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently. Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase-shift keying, which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, to get higher data rates.\n", "id": "296466", "title": "Phase-shift keying"}

It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life. Jay A. Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979. The Pritzker family pays for the prize. It is the top prize in architecture, and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture. The country, race, religion or political ideas of the architect are not important. Winners get US$100,000 and a certificate. Winners receive a medal. The back of the medal has these words in Latin—\"firmitas, utilitas, venustas\" (English: \"durability, utility, and beauty\"). The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius. Before 1987, a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money.\n\nMartha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009. The director asks many people, including past winners, academics, critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners. Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year. In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it. Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring.\n\nThe first winner was Philip Johnson. The award was \"for 50 years of imagination and vitality\" shown by the many \"museums, theaters, libraries, houses, gardens and corporate structures\". The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner. Ryūe Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44.

In everyday use, people often talk about melanoma, but there are other forms of skin cancer, too. These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably. Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis. Very often a tumor can be seen, so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage. Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease., though it can be disfiguring. Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non-melanoma skin cancer, although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage, treatment is easier and more people survive.\n\nSkin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer. Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer. Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but it is the most serious — for example, in the UK there were over 11,700 new cases of melanoma in 2008, and over 2,000 deaths. It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15–34 in the UK. Most cases are caused by over-exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds. Non-melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers. The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas. These are usually localized growths caused by excessive cumulative exposure to the sun and do not tend to spread.\n", "id": "296516", "title": "Skin cancer"}

Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions. The genus is rare in cool temperate climates, with only four species native to northern Europe.\n\nDodder can be identified by its thin stems. They look leafless, with the leaves reduced to minute scales. \n\nFrom mid-summer to early autumn, the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine, and are about the size of a common pea. It has very low levels of chlorophyll; some species, such as \"Cuscuta reflexa\", can photosynthesize slightly. Others such as \"C. europaea\" are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition. \n\nDodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream. Some flower in the early summer, others later, depending on the species. The seeds are tiny and produced in large amounts. They have a hard coating, and can survive in the soil for 5–10 years or more.\n\nDodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil. Germination occurs without a host, but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly. Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants. \n\nIf a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination, the dodder seedling will die. Before a host plant is reached, the dodder, as other plants, relies on food reserves in the embryo; the cotyledons are very small.\nAfter a dodder attaches itself to a plant, it wraps itself around it. If the host contains food useful to dodder, the dodder produces 'haustoria' that insert themselves into the host. The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies. \n\nThe dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants. In tropical areas it can grow continuously, and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees. In temperate climates it is an annual plant, restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring.\n\nDodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants, including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species, such as alfalfa, flax, clover, potatoes, chrysanthemum, dahlia, trumpet vine, ivy and petunias, among others.\n", "id": "296539", "title": "Dodder"}

Their diet includes leaves and young shoots. During the day they rest high in the trees, clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes. At dusk they become active, gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind. The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane.\n\nColugos range from Burma, Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java.

They were made to replace the medium, medium and heavy tanks used in World War II with just one tank. Lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight. Light tanks are still used in some armies that do not need large guns.\n\nMBT's are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles. They also get help from observation or attack aircraft.\n\nMedium tanks were the earliest MBTs. MBTs started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks. Heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks.\nThe nuclear weapon threat and other anti-tank weapons in the Cold War made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat. Weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor.\n\nThe first Soviet main battle tank was the T-64 and the first American MBT was the M60 Patton. By the late 1970's, MBT's were manufactured by France, West Germany, Britain, India, Japan, the USSR, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\nThe Soviet Union made MBTs very quickly because it needed them for their type of war. The Soviet Union improved the cannon by replacing the loader crewman with an automatic autoloader. This made the turret smaller which also makes the tank harder to see or hit The Soviet Union made missiles that could be shot much farther than other ammunition.\n\nAfter the Cold War, American tanks quickly defeated Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War. The American MBTs were still not as good as attack helicopters at destroying Iraqi tanks. Some said that the MBTs could not stop an enemy force from attacking.\n", "id": "296613", "title": "Main battle tank"}

At birth, he was called Narendranath Datta (Bengali: নরেন্দ্রনাথ দত্ত). He was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission. He introduced Hindu philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America. He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century. Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with \"Sisters and Brothers of America\". Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions at Chicago in 1893.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was born in Shimla Pally in Calcutta on 12 January 1863. He was named Narendranath Datta. His father Vishwanath Datta was an attorney of Calcutta High Court. His mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi. Narendranath's thinking and personality were influenced by his parents—the father by his rational mind and the mother by her religious temperament. From his mother he learnt the power of self-control. Young Narendra was an expert in meditation and could enter the state of samadhi very easily. He saw a light while falling asleep. Once he had a vision of Buddha during his meditation. During his childhood, he had a great fascination for wandering ascetics and monks. He was also an expert in games and naughty things. Even in his young age he showed remarkable leadership qualities. His childhood friend was Kamal Reddy.\n\nIn his youth he visited the Brahmo Samaj and later he came in contact with Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna initiated him, and after his death Naren left his house. He took the monk-name ogivami Vivekananda and stayed at the Boranagar Monastery with his monk-brothers. Later he set out for touring India. He wandered from place to place until he reached Trivandum and decided to attend the Parliament of Religions at Chicago.\nHe delivered the great speech at Chicago and brought Hinduism to the status of a major religion.\n\nVivekananda became very popular after delivering lectures at many places of America and England. He came back to India and founded the Ramakrishna Maths and Mission in 1897. He also founded the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, near Almora on March 19, 1899. The Ashrama was a branch of the Ramakrishna Math.\nHe composed the famous arati song, Khandana Bhava Bandhana \n\nOn 4 July, 1902 he woke up in the early morning, went to the chapel at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At seven p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10 p.m. while meditating.\n\n\nVivekananda's books on the four Yogas (Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Jnana Yoga) are still seen as fundamental texts for anyone interested in the Hindu practice of Yoga. His letters are of great literary and spiritual spirit. He was also considered a very good singer and a poet. By the time of his death, He had composed many songs including his favorite song \"Kali-The Mother\". He used humor for his teachings and was also an excellent cook. His language is very free flowing. These all works were compiled to form a 9 volume set \"The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda\". A book titles 'Selections from the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda' is also very popular, knowledgeable andinspiring.", "id": "296617", "title": "Swami Vivekananda"}

Once cut, turned and polished, its shiny black surface becomes very beautiful. Strictly speaking, Ashford Black Marble is not a marble formed by heat, but a smooth sedimentary rock, a hard mass of dusty minerals. To make art objects, Ashford Black Marble can be cut as materials of them and put together with other fine stones. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals.\n\nAshford Black Marble had been used for decorative purpose since the prehistoric age. Bess of Hardwick was known to use Ashford Black Marble.\n\nHenry Watson played important roles in the development of the local industry of inlaying Ashford Black Marble in the 1750s. He was the uncle of Derbyshire geologist White Watson, and had a water-powered mill at Ashford in the Water.\nPots, obelisks, and other decorative items of AMB were frequently traded during the late 18th and early 19th century. John Mawe had a museum in Matlock Bath that dealt in black marble. Ann Rayner carved Black Marble into pictures using a diamond. Many art objects of Ashford Black Marble are collected in local institutions, including those of Derby Museum, Buxton Museum, and Chatsworth House. In 2009, huge blocks of Ashford Black Marble were found underground in Derby. The auction of these was planed because these blocks are valuable. The rocks might have been abandoned when an \"Ashford Black Marble\" manufacturer moved in the 1880s.\n\nAshford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines.\nAt first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water.\n\nAshford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. \"Rosewood\" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. \"Birds-Eye\" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. \"Duke's Red\" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here.\n\nIn the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals.\n\nWilliam Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His \"Petrifacta Derbiensia\" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils \"crocodile tails\", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles.\n\nIn 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing.\n\n\n", "id": "296644", "title": "Ashford Black Marble"}

He named Charles his heir on 10 December 1758 before leaving Madrid to stay at Villaviciosa de Odón where he died on 10 August 1759. Charles was thus proclaimed the King of Spain under the name of Charles III and adicated as King of Naples as he could not join the three kingdoms of Spain, Naples and Sicily. \n\nThat same year they left Naples for Madrid, leaving two of their children behind in Caserta. Her third son became Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, while his elder brother Infante Charles was groomed in Spain to inherit the Spanish crown. Her oldest son the Duke of Calabria was mentally retarded and was thus could not inherit the thrones. \n\nCharles and his wife arrived in Barcelona on 7 October 1759. Residing in Spain, Maria Amalia once again did much to improve the royal residences having them redecorated and founded another porcelain factory at \"Buen Retiro\". A popular queen, she died of tuberculosis at the Buen Retiro Palace outside the capital having been a heavy smoker.

She was the fifth daughter, and second surviving child, of her parents. Her father became King of Spain as Charles III in 1759, and she moved with her family to Spain. Her first cousins included Louis XVI, Maria I of Portugal and Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia.\n\nOn 16 February 1764 she was married by proxy at Madrid to Archduke Peter Leopold, the second son of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, and the heir apparent to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The next year, on 5 August, she married him in person at Innsbruck. Only a few days later, the death of Emperor Francis made Maria Luisa's husband the new Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the newly married couple moved to Florence, where they would live for the next twenty-five years.\n\nIn 1790, on the death of Peter Leopold's childless brother, Joseph II, Maria Luisa's husband inherited the Habsburg lands in Central Europe, and was shortly thereafter elected Holy Roman Emperor. Taking the name of Leopold II, the new Emperor moved his family to Vienna, where Maria Luisa took on the role of imperial consort. Leopold died scarcely two years later, dying on 1 March 1792. Maria Luisa followed her husband to the grave in less than three months, not living long enough to see her eldest son Francis elected as the last Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nMozart's opera La clemenza di Tito was commissioned by the Estates of Bohemia as part of the festivities that accompanied the coronation of Maria Luisa and her husband Leopold as king and queen of Bohemia in Prague on 6 September 1791. In musical circles, Maria Luisa is famous for her putative denigration of Mozart's opera as \"German rubbish\" (\"una porcheria tedesca\"), however no claim that she made this remark pre-dates the publication in 1871 of Alfred Meissner's \"Rococo-Bilder: nach Aufzeichnungen meines Grossvaters\", a collection of stories about cultural and political life in Prague in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\n\n\n", "id": "296766", "title": "Maria Luisa of Spain"}

The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nThe rocky site was easy to defend, because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb. It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times. The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio (now part of Derby) which was N-shaped route for the North Sea ports.\n\nAncient items of Anglo-Saxons have been found there. They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site. Also, many Roman or Romano-British pottery has been found, including roof tiles of Roman pattern. Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum, but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost.\n\nHenry de Ferrers (Ferrars) faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire, which became known as Duffield Frith. It was between Heage and Shottle on the North, and Tutbury on the South. He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence. He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land. This castle was probably built of wood.\n\nHis third son, Robert, fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138, and became the first Earl of Derby.\nHis great grandson, William, became the Earl in 1162. He supported King's sons when they resisted Henry II, and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173.\n\nWilliam II was favored by King John, and took back the land of Wirksworth, Ashbourne, and Horston Castle (Horsley). The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone. William III was also favored as William II was.\n\nThe next Earl (the 7th generation), Robert, fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed. Once the king forgave Robert, but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield. He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed. His lands were given to Prince Edmund, who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later.\n\nThe castle was completely destroyed. Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings, and the place gradually retuned to wild.\n\nWhen the site was surveyed, the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it. The size of the rock was really remarkable, about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width, only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London.\n\nThe grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations, and transferred to the National Trust in 1899. For many years, Parish Council was in charge of the site, but recently the role was handed down to the Trust.\n\nOther surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans, because many Romano‑British items were found.\n\nA geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001. Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found, and they appeared to date from the same period. The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations.\n\n", "id": "296861", "title": "Duffield Castle, Derbyshire"}

Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac. Little grows on them.\n\nTheories as to the origin of the name include: \n\nA map (\"Leyland map\") dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name \"Casus Rupes\" (broken rocks), which would seem to confirm the third theory above, but which may be a folk etymology.\n\nThere have been numerous wrecks on the islets; fierce tides reaching 6-7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area. The most famous include SS \"Stella\", wrecked in 1899. The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker \"Constantia S\".\n\nIt was believed for centuries that HMS \"Victory\" was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets, the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court-martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ship's loss. However, when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008, it was over 60 nautical miles (110 km) from the Casquets.\n\nThe first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724, and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter, St Thomas and the Dungeon. Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France.\n\nThey were built by Thomas Le Cocq, owner of the rocks, under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses. The lighthouses reverted to Trinity House in 1785.\n\nThey were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790; and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818. This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds.\n\nThe lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823. The towers were raised by a further 10 yards (9.1 m) in 1854, and 184 kilocandela lamps were added which gave three slow flashes every half minute. In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off.\n\nBritish commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse, following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940. The first raid, Operation Dryad, took place on 2/3 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war.\n\nIn 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2,830 kilocandela lamp was put in. The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti-clockwise. At the same time, the other two towers were reduced in height.\n\nThe current light in the 23 metres (75 ft) North West Tower is 37 metres (121 ft) above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 3.7 seconds apart. It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles (44 km) in clear weather. The East Tower contains the foghorn, which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles (5.6 km). The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock. The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays. The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich.\n\n\n", "id": "296879", "title": "Casquets"}

He was particularly famous for playing chamber music and was one of the original members of the Beaux Arts Trio (a group of three musicians: a pianist, violinist and cellist).\n\nGreenhouse was born in Newark, New Jersey to a musical family. He started to learn the cello when he was nine. He studied with Felix Salmond at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. Then he studied with the great cellist Emmanuel Feuermann. He was also one of the very few pupils of the legendary cellist Pablo Casals.\n\nWhen he started his career he soon became the principal cellist of the CBS Symphony Orchestra from 1938-1942 and he also played chamber music with the Dorian String Quartet. After his studies with Casals he gave many solo recitals, but most of all he loved chamber music.\n\nIn 1955 he met the violinist Daniel Guilet and the pianist Menahem Pressler in New York. Together they formed the Beaux Arts Trio. This group became a world famous trio. Bernard Greenhouse played with them until 1987. \n\nAt the time there were a few string quartets who were famous, but the idea of having success as a piano trio seemed strange. However, Columbia Artists asked them to play in 10 concerts, then they were offered 80 concerts. Soon they were performing in Europe and then all over the world, giving about 130 concerts a year in the USA alone and making many recordings.\n\nBernard Greenhouse taught at the Julliard and Manhattan schools of music in New York and at several other music schools in the USA. There are videos of his master classes.\n\nWhen he retired he went to live in Massachusetts. There he gave lessons to talented young players, never charging them fees.\n\nGreenhouse was given many awards, including the Prix Mondial du Disque and the US Presidential Medallion 1985.\n\nGreenhouse was still playing the cello at the age of 95.

It is a coastal city on Boston Bay at the southern end of the Eyre Peninsula. It is the largest city in the region. It is about 280 kilometres (straight line – 646 km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.\n\nThe first people to live in the area were the Indigenous Australian people, the Parnkalla people. Europen people settled in the area in 1836.\n\nBritish Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it \"Port\" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from.\n\nPort Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water.\n\nAbout 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006. Aboriginal people made up 5.4% of Port Lincoln's 2006 population.\n\nPort Lincoln has different coastal areas, from sheltered waters and beaches, to surf beaches and rugged oceanic coastline.\n\nPort Lincoln and its suburbs comprise the City of Port Lincoln local government area. Port Lincoln is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.\n\nThe economy is based on loading wheat onto ships. The port can handle over 337,500 tonnes) of wheat. There is also the canning and fish processing works, lambs, wool and beef, and tuna farming for the Japanese market. The port is home to a large commercial fishing fleet. There is also fish farming (aquaculture) of the following species: tuna, kingfish, abalone, mussels, oysters, and experimental farming in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Before the introduction of fish farming, the main fishing was for Southern bluefin tuna.\n\nPort Lincoln is the end of an isolated narrow gauge railway system to bring the wheat to port. Iron ore traffic may be added in the future, although this has been the topic of protest and debate in the community.\n\nTourism is becoming more important, thanks to the scenic beauty and coastal locality. Easy access to both Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight make Port Lincoln a good place for yachting, scuba diving, shark cage diving and game fishing. The city also is the regional centre for government administration, corporate services and commerce to Eyre Peninsula. However, many State Government functions are gradually being closed as State Government becomes more centralised in Adelaide. During the past decade, there has been a big increase in building houses and commercial buildings.\n\nLincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park and Kellidie Bay Conservation Park are within easy driving distance.\n\nPort Lincoln is the port for the isolated narrow gauge () Eyre Peninsular Railway.\n\nThere is also a smaller port at Proper Bay which may be restored to use for iron ore traffic.

Regional Express and Qantaslink provide several daily flights to the state capital of Adelaide.\n\nThe book \"Blue Fin\" by Colin Thiele was set in Port Lincoln. The movie of the same name was filmed in nearby Streaky Bay. Some of the shark scenes of \"Jaws\" and Anzac Cove scenes in \"Gallipoli\", were also filmed near Port Lincoln. \n\n\"Australian Survivor\", the Australian-produced series of the US television series, \"Survivor\", was filmed at Whalers Way, south of Port Lincoln, in 2001.\n\n\"Hearts Apart\" by Caitlin Jones was written on a farm in Port Lincoln.\n\nPort Lincoln was visited in 1939 by English travel author Eric Newby, while he was crew in the four-masted barque \"Moshulu\", which anchored off Boston Island. \"Moshulu\" had taken 82 days to sail to Port Lincoln from Belfast in ballast (a fast passage for a windjammer). But there was no grain to be had there, even though \"Moshulu\" waited at anchor for most of January. The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. \"Moshulu\" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo.\n\nDuring the 1939 season, \"Passat\" and \"Lawhill\" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book \"The Last Grain Race\" (1956). Several pictures of Port Lincoln in 1939 are in his photo-essay of his voyage, \"Learning the Ropes\".\n\nPort Lincoln has two local commercial radio stations, 89.9 Magic FM and 765 AM 5CC. It is also served by ABC West Coast SA on 1485 AM. It also receives Triple J and ABC Radio National from Tumby Bay and satellite uplink from Melbourne respectively.

The coastline was first explored by Matthew Flinders in 1801-1802. The west coast was also visited by Nicolas Baudin at around the same time.\n\nThe peninsula was explored by John Charles Darke in 1844, who was killed by local Aborigines on his return to Port Lincoln.\n\nThe main towns are Port Lincoln on the southern point, Whyalla and Port Augusta at the north east, and Ceduna at the northwest. They are joined by the Eyre Highway across the inland edge, and the Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway along the west and east coasts.\n\nThe major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the dry north area. More water-intensive farming such as dairy farming and growing wine industry happen in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing. Port Lincoln had a large tuna fishing fleet, which is now changing to fish farming in bays along the coast. The Eyre Peninsula has a growing population of around 55,390 people.\n\nThere is a commercial nephrite jade mine near Cowell. Iron ore is mined in the hills near Iron Knob and taken by rail to Whyalla for smelting.\n\nNational Parks located on the Eyre Peninsula include Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park, Gawler Ranges National Park, and several conservation parks and reserves like Acraman Creek Conservation Park.\n\nIn January 2005, bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula killed nine people.\n\nThe peninsular is served by the isolated narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway.\n\n", "id": "297011", "title": "Eyre Peninsula"}

It has a hotel, cafe, general store and a post office.\n\nIn December 1859, a shepherd called Robert Blinman, from the nearby Angorichina station (farm) found copper. He was nickmaned \"Peg Leg\" because he had a wooden leg. With a group of friends he started the Wheal Blinman, a copper mine in 1861. The town grew quickly and by 1869 there were about 1,500 people living there. Many miners were Cornish men, who had been mining for copper at Burra, South Australia. The mine, later called the Blinman Consolidated Copper Mining Company of South Australia, soon became the biggest and most productive mine in the Flinders Ranges. About 10,000 tonnes of copper were taken from the mine which finally closed in 1918.\n\nWilliam Kekwick (died 1872), who explored South Australia and the Northern Territory with John McDouall Stuart, is buried in the Blinman cemetery.\n\nThe Blinman Copper Mine is now a tourist attraction, and visitors can explore the underground mine.\n", "id": "297090", "title": "Blinman, South Australia"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297100", "text": "Paulo Freire\n\nPaulo Freire (September 19, 1921 - May 2, 1997) was an educator born in Brazil. He developed new ideas about education for the oppressed - people who have been trodden down. \n\nPaulo Freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as Plato, but also from modern Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. In fact, in many ways his \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1970) may be best read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon’s \"The Wretched of the Earth\" (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern (rather than traditional) and anti-colonial (not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer).\n\nIn \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1970), Freire, talks about the oppressors-oppressed distinction,seeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society: the oppressor and the oppressed. Freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction, which stems back to a least Hegel in 1802, and has since been reprised by many authors including Engels, Marx, Lenin, Gramsci, Simone Weil and others.\n\nFreire advocates that education allows the oppressed to regain their humanity and overcome their condition; however, he acknowledges that in order for this to take effect, the oppressed have to play a role in their own liberation. As he states:\n\nNo pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption (Freire, 1970, p. 54).\n\nLikewise, the oppressors must also be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in the oppression if true liberation is to occur; \"those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly\" (Freire, 1970, p. 60).\n\nFreire believed education to be a political act that could not be divorced from pedagogy. Freire defined this as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the \"politics\" that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom (Kincheloe, 2008). Freire believed that \"education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing — of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't\" (Freire, 2004, p. 15)\n\nIn terms of actual pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the \"banking\" concept of education, in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. He notes that \"it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power\" (Freire, 1970, p. 77). The basic critique was not new — Rousseau’s conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from tabula rasa (which is basically the same as the “banking concept”). In addition, thinkers like John Dewey were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, explaining that “education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction” (1897, p. 16). Freire’s work, however, updated the concept and placed it in context with current theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what is now called critical pedagogy.\n\nMore challenging is Freire's strong aversion to the teacher-student difference. This splitis admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey, but Freire comes close to insisting that it be completely abolished. This is hard to imagine in absolute terms, since there must be some enactment of the teacher-student relationship in the parent-child relationship, but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student. He goes so far as to say that “Education must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously students and teachers” (Freire, 1970, p. 72). Freire wants us to think in terms of teacher-student and student-teacher – that is, a teacher who learns and a learner who teaches – as the basic roles of classroom participation.\nFreire however insists that educator and student, though sharing democratic social relations of education, are not on an equal footing, but the educator must be humble enough to be disposed to relearn that which he/she already thinks she knows, through interaction with the learner. The authority which the educator enjoys must not be allowed to degenerate into authoritarianism; teachers must recognize that \"their fundamental objective is to fight alongside the people for the recovery of the people's stolen humanity\", not to \"win the people over\" to their side (Freire, 1970, p. 95).\n", "id": "297100", "title": "Paulo Freire"}

Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. \"Yip\" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" was part of the 1932 musical \"New Americana;\" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era.\n\nThe song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines.\nThe song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word \"time\" in the line \"Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,\" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly \"\"Brother,\" can you spare a dime?\" is replaced with the aggressive \"\"Buddy,\" can you spare a dime?\"\n\nDuring the bad times in the 1970s, the \"New York Times\" asked Harburg to update \"Brother\" for a new age, and he responded with:\n\n", "id": "297105", "title": "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"}

Manohar in lead roles with Thangavelu and Manorama in supporting roles. Also Savitri, makes a cameo as herself. It was directed by R. Sundaram.\n\nRamesh (Askokan) is an engineer who is hunting for a job and with the help of his friend Babu (Thangavelu) goes to see a wealthy businessman named Laxman for a new project of his. After a song and a comic encounter with Laxman's daughter Geeta (Manimala), he falls in love with her. He also achieves very good success in convincing Geeta's father into starting the project. During a sight visit for the project, his suitcase gets swapped with a similar suitcase of a co-passenger named Mala (Manorama), which is full of money. For this reason Ramesh is detained in a police lock-up. Also Mala is revealed to be part of a criminal gang. When the gang leader, Jumboo, is not able to kill Mala (because he needs a particular diary from her), he instead arranges a dangerous rowdy named Bijua Pakiri (R.S. Manohar)to kill Ramesh within the lock-up.\n\nHowever, instead of killing Ramesh, Bijua decides to hold Ramesh captive. Together they escape the lock-up that very night to prove Ramesh's innocence. Bijua also angers the criminal gang of Mala, when he asks for a greater sum in return for killing Ramesh. When a mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) makes phone calls and tried to save Ramesh from captivity, Ramesh escapes by himself out into the city. The mysterious man also attacks Bijua before running away. The criminal gang try to kill Bijua but he escapes after a fight. Geeta meets him and helps him by giving him a hanky and some milk from her flask.\n\nRamesh being chased by police, Bijua Pakiri and the criminal gang attempts to fake his death. Geeta believing his death to be real comes to the waterfall where he committed suicide and learns that he is not really dead. They both go one of the villas owned by Geeta's father, and make a secret stay there. Bijua confronts them and threatens to kill Ramesh but is tamed by the very pleading words of Geeta. He instead promises to help Ramesh out of the situation. Both Bijua and Ramesh don disguises to roam about in public, to search for Mala and with her prove his innocence. But, they are chased by police and are lead to a comic encounter where they sing a song for a dance by Savitri. Later, Mala and Babu drive a car together and develop romantic feelings for one another. When Ramesh and Bijua get to know this, they try to use their relationship to get the truth out of Mala. But their plan backfires.\n\nAfter this, the mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) appears secretly inside Ramesh's car promising to help him. He accepts that he is a police officer when asked, and says he knows that Ramesh is innocent. But leaves when Bijua and Babu enter the car. Men from the criminal gang disguise as policemen and \"arrest\" Ramesh whom they intend to murder at a safe spot. However, with the help of his friends Ramesh escapes.\nLater, the same mysterious man appears once again, and meets Ramesh once again to tell him that he knows Mala well and also Bijua is planning to give off Ramesh to the criminal gang, for money. Ramesh, believes him and starts to avoid Bijua, telling him that he now knows his true colours.\n\nWhen Mala is forced by Jumboo, the gangleader, to fly abroad, she is confronted by the still mysterious man who forces her to give him the diary, failing which she would end up in jail. But she is shot by a shadowy figure, who is then chased by the mysterious man. But, Bijua gets hold of the diary after coming there. Ramesh learns of the death of Mala and becomes sad. Jumboo arrives there and Bijua confronts him, now asking for twice the earlier amount for the diary and the life of Ramesh. \n\nBijua takes Ramesh with him to prove his innocence, after pleading with Ramesh and Geeta for a long time. They arrive at a cave on a hill. There Bijua tries to sell Ramesh and the Diary for the agreed sum, apparently betraying Ramesh. The mysterious man arrives at the scene to whom Ramesh explains the situation.\n\nWhen the mysterious man tries to act his police disguise there, Bijua reveals he is Mr.Prakash, the true leader of the crime gang and he himself is Inspector Sekar of Vigilance Branch. With this information both Prakash and Ramesh are startled. After some talk an elaborate fight and chase scene, Mr.Prakash drives a boat that crashes into a rock fatally killing him.

Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using \"proper English\", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for \"spoken\" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English.\n\nEnglish makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (\"John's\") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but \"she loves\". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking.\n\nWord order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say \"I like fast cars\", but in Spanish, it is \"Me gustan los coches rápidos\" [coches = cars; rápidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: \"the cat sat on the mat\".\n\nGrammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called \"parts of speech.\" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.\n\nNouns are things. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed.\n\nPronouns are special types of nouns. They are not a particular thing. They can mean many different things. An example is the word \"it.\" In the sentence \"I like the ball; it is blue,\" you have to look at what comes before \"it\" to know that \"it\" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent.\n\nThe basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is \"to be\". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?\nVariations of the infinitive create verb tenses. \n\nWords that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words \"red\" and \"juicy\" in the phrase \"the red apple is juicy.\" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence \"the red apples are juicy.\"\n\nAdverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word \"quickly\" in the sentence \"He ran quickly.\" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb \"very\" describes the adjective \"sick\" in the sentence \"The boy is very sick.\" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence \"He ran very quickly\"\n\nA preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that they add to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word \"over\" in the sentence \"he walked over the bridge.\"\n\nA conjugation is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. They can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. \"And\" in the sentence \"the boy and the girl run\" connects the boy to the girl because the both run. They can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word \"but\" in the sentence \"I like cats, but he likes dogs\" is a conjunction doing this.\n\nInterjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word \"Hooray,\" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word \"yes\" is much simpler than saying \"what you say is true,\" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word \"um.\"\n\nGrammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called \"syntax.\" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs.\n\n", "id": "297241", "title": "English grammar"}

Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving.\n\nDoré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante. \n\nIn 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper & Brothers in 1883.\n\nDoré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from \"The Microcosm of London\" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant & Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project.\n\nThe completed book, \"London: A Pilgrimage,\" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London. \n\nHis later works included Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Tennyson's \"The Idylls of the King\", \"The Works of Thomas Hood\", and \"The Divine Comedy\". His work also appeared in the \"Illustrated London News\". \n\nHe continued to illustrate books until he died in Paris after a short illness in 1883. He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\n\nDoré made many works of art. This list is very long, but does not include every piece of art that Doré made.

They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better.\n\nThe halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings.\n\nHalteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight.\n\nThey are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight.\n\nEvery vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres. \n\nThe two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres.\n\nIn Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene \"Ultrabithorax\" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype.\n\nThe Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the \"forewings\" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the \"hindwings\" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution.\n\nGrimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and \"in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight\".\n", "id": "297359", "title": "Halteres"}

The museum is housed in a historic former silk mill which is part of Derwent Valley Mills. Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britain’s first mill beside the River Derwent. This mill was built to produce silk threads using machines powered by a water wheel.\n\nJohn Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk, when he was working within the Italian Silk Industry. This may be the first example of industrial espionage.\n\nTraditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters. But these new, large machines were able to produce far greater quantities of silk and came to compete with the Italians. However, these machines required large buildings and a huge power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove these large spinning machines.\n\nJohn Lombe unnaturally died in 1722. It was believed that he was killed with poison by an Italian as the revenge for stealing trade secrets. His half brother, Sir Thomas Lombe Knt., died on 2 June 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. \n\nDame Elizabeth advertised the lease of the building and machinery in 1739, and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for £2,800.\n\nRichard Wilson stayed in Leeds and took a proportion of the profits. The mill was conducted by William and Samuel Lloyd (both London merchants) and Thomas Bennet as salaried manager.\n\nA description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 is left as follows:\n\nThese circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most progressive feature of the factory. Also, they used the single source of power (water), and employed many organized workers (200-400, according to recent sources). Due to these total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread, the Lombes' silk mill is regarded as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.\nThe Silk Mill was visited by many tourists. For example, Boswell visited there in September 1777. Not all visitors thought that the mill was in good condition. Torrington commented on the \"heat, stinks and noise\". In 1835, Fairholt was shocked at unhealthy poor children. Foreign visitors also visited the mill during their trips.\n\nWilliam Hutton was once the employees and he later recalled the long hours, low wages and beatings. Work only stopped in time of extreme dryness or frost, or lack of silk supply. But in August 1748, unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races.\n\nThe partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 due to quarrel and legal suits. Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery. \n\nIn 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the mill from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but the mill was neglected for years, because other mills in Derby and Cheshire had grown to become competitor, and silk trade itself had declined.\n\nLamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780. He paid £7 to the Corporation and £170 to Thomas Wilson (brother of Richard and William) per year respectively. He conflicted with the Corporation on repairs to dams in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803.\n\nThe Corporation advertised the lease in 1803 to run for 60 years. The advertisement said that the \"Italian works\" was still used for throwing silk.\n\nIn November 1833, labor movements began in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834. Several months later, Tolpuddle Martyrs occurred. The Silk Mill was not at the centre of the movements, Taylor (the mill's lessee at this time) was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member. By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two-thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement. According to \"The Derby Mercury\" some of the former unionists were never able to find next employment in Derby. This event is commemorated by a march organized by the Derby Trades Union Council every year on the weekend before MayDay.\n\nThe Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill but in 1865 they ruined and were forced to sell their machinery and lease. \"The Derby Mercury\" advertised many silk mills for sale that year, and it were obvious that a general depression was hitting the industry. This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry.\nThe long connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when F.W. Hampshire and Company, the Chemists, moved into the buildings to make fly papers and cough medicines. On 5 December 1910 at 5.00 am, fire broke out in the near flour mill of Sowter Bothers and soon the flame spread to the Silk Mill. The mill's east wall fell into the river and the whole building was burnt up. Great efforts were made by the Borough Fire Brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors. These can still be seen today on the tower staircase. The building was rebuilt at the same height but with three stories instead of five and remains that way today.\n\nDuring the 1920s the building passed ownership to the Electricity Authority. They used it partly as stores, workshops and a canteen. Hidden from the road by the power station, the mill's existence was largely forgotten by the general public until the power station was removed in 1970. It was then converted into Industrial Museum which Derby had proposed for a long time. The museum opened on 29 November 1974.\n\nDerby City Council closed the museum on 3 April 2011 in order to free funds for the redevelopment of the Silk Mill museum and other museums in the city. The Report of the Strategic Director of Neighbourhoods (Item 7 put before the Council Cabinet meeting held on the 26 October 2010) indicated that 8.6 full time jobs would be lost but on the contrary £197,000 would be saved to offset the loss of \"Renaissance Programme\" funding. No date for the re-opening of the museum is given in the report, although a period of two years has been reported.\n\nSources of information: \n", "id": "297375", "title": "Derby Industrial Museum"}

The name of \"Auch\" comes from the people that inhabited the area at the time of the Roman conquest. The name of this tribe was \"Ausci\", singular \"Auscus\".\n\nThe Romans named the town where that tribe lived as \"Augusta Auscorum\" (or \"Augusta Ausciorum\"), which means \"Augusta of the Ausci\". Eventually, \"Augusta\" was dropped, and the name changed into modern Gascon \"Aush\", and modern French \"Auch\".\n\nAuch is in the southwest of France, in Armagnac (Gascony), in the valley of the Gers river.

Kellett-Smith, it means \"island of crabs, crayfish or cranes\".\n\nLike many names in the Channel Islands it is Norman language in origin. A thousand years ago, the water level was ten feet lower, so there were many more of the animals the island was named after.\n\nThe island is about 212 by 168 metres (696 by 551 ft) at its widest. Its area is less than three hectares. The distance to Jethou is about 215 metres (705 ft).\n\nA 16th century drawing of the islet, now in the British Museum, shows Crevichon as apparently a wooded islet.\n\nProf. John Le Patourel, in \"The Building of Castle Cornet\" said that in 1566, iron and hammers were taken to \"Creavissham\", and the island quarried for the castle. The quarry has been used since then, but this has made the island much smaller, and less visible. As a result, a fifteen-foot marker was built on the top. Crevichon may have provided the granite for the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nIt is said that in earlier times, pirates were hanged on it with chains, like nearby Jethou.\n\nCompton Mackenzie, former owner of Herm called Crevichon \"Merg\" in his book, \"Fairy Gold\" which is a fictionalised version of the islands.\n\nIn 1953, Victor Coysh says that he saw the remains of a German bomber, from the time of the occupation.\n\nOther wrecks include\n\n", "id": "297381", "title": "Crevichon"}

Although Victor Hugo suggests that they were heavily eroded by quarrying (which was certainly true in the case of Crevichon off Herm), Victor Coysh disagrees saying:\n\nVictor Hugo who wrote about many of the Channel Islands in his books, described Les Houmets, in \"The Toilers of the Sea\" (\"Les Travailleurs de la mer\").

It is triangular, and 80 × 50 yards (73 × 45 m). There is an 18th century gun battery here, to defend against the French. The German occupation added their own, and the British another after the Germans left. The steamer \"Clarrie\" sank off Houmet Benêt in 1921, in the Great Roussel. \"Heathery Brae\" in 1952 tried to salvage it, but ended up being wrecked itself, and there are also the wrecks of \"Vixen\" (a brig), \"Rescue\" (a tug) and \"Romp\" (a cutter) went ashore here. It is covered in grass and brambles.\n\nHoumet Paradis, the fictional Gilliat's home, was originally known as Houmet de l'Eperquerie, as it was used for fish gutting, and drying on stands known as \"perques\" (perches). It was formerly owned by the Collas family, whose estate at Paradis, gave the islet its new name. In the 1920s, it was used for quarrying, and it was also used for grazing cattle, and has a lot of grass. In 1951 it was sold to James Watson of Newcastle upon Tyne for £500 who placed the island under the stewardship of the National Trust of Guernsey. It remained within the family until 2004 when it was sold at auction by James Watson's grandson (also called James Watson who live on Alderney) to a local consortium to keep the island as a nature reserve.\n\nHommetol, more commonly called Omptolle by the Ordnance Survey etc., is used for gathering ormer.

It lies about west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. The wall around it is 16 km long. The area within the wall is . It is one of the largest walled city parks in Europe. It has large areas of grassland and wide roads with trees on both sides. A herd of wild Fallow deer have lived in the park since the seventeenth century. The English name (\"Phoenix\") comes from the Irish \"fionn uisce\" meaning \"clear water\".\n\nA Royal Hunting Park was created in 1662 by the English Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time, Lord Ormonde. The park contained pheasants and wild deer, and a wall was built around the whole area to stop them escaping. The Park originally included more land which was to the south of the River Liffey. But when they started to build the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham in 1680, the Park was made smaller to the size it is today. It was opened to the people of Dublin by Lord Chesterfield in 1745.\n\nTwo people were killed in the park on 6 May 1882. This became known as the Phoenix Park Murders.\n\n\"Áras an Uachtaráin\" is Irish for \"the house of the President\". The President of Ireland lives here. It was built in 1754. It was first called the Viceregal Lodge, as it was where the English Lord Lieutenant of Ireland lived.\n\nThe Chief Secretary's Lodge was the former house of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. It has been the official house of the United States Ambassador to Ireland since 1927.\n\nThe oldest building in the park is Ashtown Castle. It is a medieval tower house from the 15th century. It was restored in 1989. It is located beside the Visitor Centre which has information on the 5,500 years of park and area history.\n\nThe Magazine Fort in the south east of the Park is the location where Phoenix Lodge was built by Sir Edward Fisher in 1611. In 1734 the house was knocked down when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset wanted a powder magazine (\"a building to store gunpowder\") for Dublin. An extra wing was added to the fort in 1801 for troops. The Christmas Raid of 1939 happened here.\n\nDublin Zoo has more than 600 animals and tropical birds from around the world. It was founded in 1830 and opened to the public on 1 September 1831, which means it is the third oldest zoo in the world. It received animals from the Zoological Society of London. Within a year the zoo housed 123 different kinds of animals.\n\nThe Wellington Monument is a tall obelisk. It remembers the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It is the largest obelisk in Europe and would have been even higher if the public funding had not run out.\n\nThe \"phoenix monument\" is a Corinthian column with a Phoenix bird rising from the ashes at the top. Lord Chesterfield had it made in 1747.\n\nThe \"Papal Cross\" is a large cross that was placed in the park for the visit of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open-air mass in the park at the time. The large white cross is high and is made of steel.\n\nThere are 351 plant species in the Park; three of these are rare and protected. The park has kept almost all of its old grasslands and woodlands. It also has rare examples of wetlands. The current 400–450 fallow deer descend from the original herd.\n\nA Birdwatch survey in 2007-8 found 72 species of bird including buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel and jay.\n\nThe park also has several streams that flow into the River Liffey.\n\nThese gardens were created in 1840 as the \"Promenade Grounds\" (\"grounds for talking a walk in\"). It has small lakes, a children's playground and a picnic area. The gardens are located close to the Parkgate Street entrance.\n\nThe south western corner of the park is known as the Furry Glen. It has a number of short walks around a small lake with birds, plants and wildlife.\n\nThe park has sports grounds for football, hurling, soccer, cricket and polo.\n\nPhoenix Cricket Club is located in the park. It was founded in 1830 by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell. It is the oldest cricket club in Ireland. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s, it was the most important club in Leinster cricket.\n\nMotor racing first took place in the Phoenix Park in 1903. The Irish Gordon Bennett Race Speed Trials were held on the main straight road for both cars and motorcycles. This was followed in 1929 by the Irish International Grand Prix; the first of three Irish motor racing grands prix.\n\nRacing took place between 1932 until the beginning of World War II in 1939. It was started again after the War in 1949 with a sprint on the \"Oldtown\" circuit. Over the years seven different circuits have been used, two of which are named after the famous Ferrari World Champion racing driver Mike Hawthorn.\n\nThe Great Ireland Run is a 10 km running competition. It has been held every year in April since 2003. It includes races for professional runners and the public. In 2010 over 11,000 people joined in.\n\nA large gardening, food and family event called \"Bloom\" is organised in the park every year since 2006. It had nearly 90,000 visitors in 2011.\n\nMusical acts like U2, Coldplay, Duran Duran, Robbie Williams, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kanye West have played concerts in the park.\n\nThe park plays a big role in James Joyce's novel, \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\n\n", "id": "297387", "title": "Phoenix Park"}

It is known, in decreasing order of formality, as ( pronounced ); \"the\" '; the ' (in the preceding names, ' \"guard\" is a collective noun, like \"police\"); the ( ; \"guards\", plural); or the Guards.\n\nAn individual officer is also called a ' (plural '), or, informally, a guard. A police station is called a \" station\". ' is also the lowest rank within the force, also used as a title (e.g. \" John Murphy\"), analogous to the British term \"constable\" or the American \"officer\" (\"deputy/trooper/etc.\"). \"Guard\" is the most common form of address used by members of the public speaking to a garda on duty. A female officer was once officially referred to as a ' (; \"female guard\"; plural '). This term was abolished in 1990, but is still used colloquially in place of the now gender-neutral '.\n\nThe force is headed by the Commissioner. Immediately below him are two Deputy Commissioners, one in charge of \"Operations\" and the other \"Strategy and Change Management\". The Chief Administrative Officer has responsibility for resource management (personnel, finance, ICT and accommodation) has the same rank as a Deputy Commissioner. There are twelve Assistant Commissioners: one for each of the six geographical Regions, and the remainder dealing with various national support functions. At an equivalent or near-equivalent level to the Assistant Commissioners are the positions of Chief Medical Officer, Executive Director of ICT and Executive Director of Finance.\n\nThe six geographical \"Assistant Commissioners\" command the six \"Garda Force Regions\", which are currently:\n\nReporting to the Assistant Commissioners are about 50 Chief Superintendents, about half of whom supervise what are called Divisions. Each Division contains a number of Districts, each commanded by a Superintendent assisted by a team of Inspectors. Each District contains a number of Subdistricts, which are usually commanded by Sergeants.\n\nUsually each Subdistrict contains only one Garda station. A different number of are based at each station depending on its importance. Most of these stations employ the basic rank of Garda, which was referred to as the rank of Guard until 1972. The most junior members of the force are students, whose duties can vary depending on their training progress. They are often have clerical duties, as part of their extra curricular studies.\n\nThe Garda organisation also has over 2,500 civilian support staff covering areas such as human resources, occupational health services, finance and procurement, internal audit, IT and telecommunications, accommodation and fleet management, scenes-of-crime support, research and analysis, training and general administration. The figure also includes industrial staff such as traffic wardens, drivers and cleaners. It is ongoing government policy to bring the level of non officer support in the organisation up to international standards - thus enhancing its capacity and expertise in a range of specialist and administrative functions, and releasing more of its police officers for core operational duties.\n\nThe Garda Síochána Act 2005 provided for the establishment of a Garda Reserve, consisting of 4,000, to assist the force in performing its functions, and supplement the work of members of the Garda Síochána.\n\nThe job of the Garda Reserve is \"to be a source of local strength and knowledge\". Reservists carry out duties decided by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. With reduced training, these duties and powers must be operated under the supervision of regular members of the Force, and are also limited from those of regular members.\n\nAs of November 2010 there are 850 graduated Garda Reserve, and another 148 in further training, the first batch of 36 Garda Reserves graduated on 15 December 2006 at the Garda College, in Templemore.\n\n\nMost uniformed members of An Garda Síochána do not usually carry firearms. It is a tradition of the service that standard policing is carried out in both rural and urban areas by uniformed officers equipped only with a wooden truncheon. From March 2007 all new Gardaí have been issued with ASP extendable batons, with existing members trained in time. In addition, the Garda Commissioner announced in October 2008 that all Gardaí are to be issued with Pepper Spray. As of December 2009, all Gardaí have been trained and issued with this Spray.\n\nThe force, when originally created, was armed, but the Provisional Government reversed the decision and reconstituted the force as an unarmed police force. This was in contrast to the attitude of the British Dublin Castle administration, which refused appeals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that that force be disarmed. In the words of first Commissioner, Michael Staines, TD:\n\nAccording to Tom Garvin such a decision gave the new force a cultural ace: \"the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers.\"\n\nAlthough a mostly unarmed force, certain units of the Gardaí, such as detective units, the regional support units, and the Emergency Response Unit are commissioned to carry firearms. The original stock of Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolvers are being replaced by the Sig Sauer P226 and Walther P99C semi-automatic pistols. Regional Support Units have Heckler & Koch MP7 sub-machine guns in addition to issue pistols and non-lethal weapons such as tasers and pepper spray. They serve as a first response to back up regular Garda officers in critical situations due to a rise of incidents that involve firearm use. In order to be issued with a firearm, or to carry a firearm whilst on duty, a Garda must be in possession of a valid gun card.\n\nGarda patrol cars are mainly white, with yellow and blue fluorescent livery whereas traffic unit vehicles adopt the battenburg pattern. The Garda crest is also present on vehicles. An Garda Síochána also use unmarked patrol cars in their duties and use of such vehicles is increasing becoming a matter of cost rather than the need to hide the vehicles, as the amendments to the exterior of the vehicle such as LED strobes, Tetra aerials and bumper LEDs in particular are extremely visible.\n\nThe Civic Guard was formed by the Provisional Government in February 1922 to take over the responsibility of policing the fledgling Irish Free State. It replaced the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Irish Republican Police of 1919-1922. In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle.\n\nThe Garda Síochána (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 enacted after the creation of the Irish Free State on 8 August 1923, provided for the creation of \"a force of police to be called and known as 'The Garda Síochana'\". Under section 22, The Civic Guard were deemed to have been established under and to be governed by the Act. The law therefore renamed the existing force.\n\nDuring the Civil War of 1922-23, the new Free State set up the Criminal Investigation Department as an armed, plain-clothed counter-insurgency unit. It was disbanded after the end of the war in October 1923 and elements of it were absorbed into the Dublin Metropolitan Police.\n\nIn Dublin, policing remained the responsibility of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP, founded 1836) until it merged with the Garda Síochána in 1925. Since then the Garda has been the only police force in the state now known as the Republic of Ireland, with the exception of the Military Police within the Irish Defence Forces, the Airport Police, and Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire Harbour police forces.\n\nFirst established in 1925, the Scott Medal for Bravery is the highest honour for bravery and valour awarded to a member of the Garda Síochána. The first medals were funded by Colonel Walter Scott, an honorary Commissioner of the New York Police Department. The first recipient of the Scott Medal was Pat Malone of St. Luke's Cork City who - as an unarmed Garda - disarmed Tomás Óg Mac Curtain (the son of Tomás Mac Curtain).\n\nTo mark the United States link, the American English spelling of \"valor\" is used on the medal. The Garda Commissioner chooses the recipients of the medal, which is presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\n\nIn 2000, Anne McCabe - widow of Garda Jerry McCabe, who was killed by armed Provisional IRA bank robbers, accepted the Scott Medal for Bravery that had been awarded posthumously to her husband.\n\nThe Irish Republican Police had at least one member killed by the RIC 21 July 1920.\n\nThe first Commissioner, Michael Staines, who was a Pro-Treaty member of , held office for only eight months. It was his successors, Eoin O'Duffy and Éamon Broy, who played a central role in the development of the force. O’Duffy was Commissioner in the early years of the force when to many people’s surprise the ability of the force to succeed despite being unarmed was established. O'Duffy later became a short-lived political leader of the quasi-fascist Blueshirts before heading to Spain to fight alongside Francisco Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Broy had greatly helped the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Anglo-Irish War, while serving with the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). Broy's fame grew in the 1990s when he featured in the movie \"Michael Collins\", in which it was misleadingly suggested that he had been murdered by the British during the War of Independence, when in reality he lived for decades and headed the Garda Síochána from 1933 to 1938. Broy was followed by Commissioners Michael Kinnane (1938–52) and Daniel Costigan (1952–65). The first Commissioner to rise from the rank of ordinary Garda was William P. Quinn, who was appointed in February 1965.\n\nOne later Commissioner, Edmund Garvey, was sacked by the Fianna Fáil government of Jack Lynch in 1978 after it had lost confidence in him. Garvey won 'unfair dismissal' legal proceedings against the government, which was upheld in the Irish Supreme Court This outcome required the passing of the Garda Síochána Act 1979 to retrospectively validate the actions of Garvey's successor since he had become Commissioner. Garvey's successor, Patrick McLaughlin, was forced to resign along with his deputy in 1983 over his minor involvement in a political scandal. The current Commissioner, since December 2010, is Martin Callinan.\n\nDuring the Emergency (as World War II was known in Ireland) there were two reserve forces to the Garda, An Taca Síochána and the Local Security Force.\n\nAn Taca Síochána had the power of arrest and wore uniform, and were allowed to leave the reserve or sign-up as full members of the Garda at the end of the war before the reserve was disbanded. The reserve was established by the Emergency Powers (Temporary Special Police Force) Order, 1939.\n\nThe Local Security Force (LSF) did not have the power of arrest, and part of the reserve was soon absorbed into the Irish Army Reserve under the command of the Irish Army.\n\nSince 1989, the Garda has been part of United Nations peace-keeping forces. Its first mission was when a 50 strong force was sent to Namibia. Since then the force has acted in Angola, Cambodia, Cyprus, Mozambique, South Africa and the former Yugoslavia. The force's first fatality abroad was Garda Sergeant Paul M. Reid, who was fatally injured while on duty with the United Nations UNPROFOR at \"Sniper's Alley\" in Sarajevo on 18 May 1995.\n\nMembers of the Garda also serve in the Embassies of Ireland in London, The Hague, Madrid and Paris. Members are also seconded to Europol in The Hague, Holland and Interpol in Lyon, France. There are also many members working directly for UN and European agencies such as the War Crimes Tribunal.\n\nGarda officers also co-operate with members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat cross-border crime. They have also accompanied politicians from the Republic, such as the President on visits to Northern Ireland.\n\nUnder an agreement with the British Government and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Garda and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria, England.\n\nLike every police force in the world the Gardaí have had many complaints against them including allegations of discourtesy, harassment and perjury (lying to a court). A total of 1,173 complaints were made by the public against the Gardaí in 2005, while over 2000 complaints were made in 2009.\n\nSome incidents involving the Garda have attracted wide scale attention—such as those that led to the Morris and Barr Tribunals—and have resulted in broad reform initiatives. Other reports suggest that people who frequent gay and lesbian establishments feel that the Gardaí are not doing enough to tackle reported homophobic crime in Ireland. In 2007 there was also some debate when a potential Sikh applicant of the Garda Reserve requested that he be allowed wear a turban in place of a standard uniform cap - Ultimately the provision was not made as it was stated that the force had the same uniform requirements for all members.\n\nThe Kerry Babies case was one of the first public inquiries into mishandling of a Garda investigation. Later, in the 1980s, the Ferns Report (an inquiry into allegations of clerical sexual abuse) described as \"wholly inadequate\" the handling of one of eight formal complaints made to Wexford gardaí, but noted that the remaining formal complaints were handled in an \"effective, professional and sensitive\" manner.\n\nThe Gardaí were also criticised in the Murphy Report in relation to the handing over of the case of Fr. Edmondus (a pseudonym) to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan. Some very senior Gardaí were criticised for regarding priests as being outside their remit in 1960. On November 26, 2009, then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologised for the failure of An Garda Siochána to protect victims of child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese. He said that inappropriate relationships and contacts between gardaí and the Dublin Archdiocese had taken place at a time of undue or misguided deference to religious authorities and that these were incompatible with any investigation. On 27 November 2009 he announced that a senior investigator would examine the findings in the report.\n\nThe Gardaí were criticised by the commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of the investigation into the Grangegorman killings. In his report, George Birmingham said that the Gardaí had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons, and had failed to act on a suspicion that Lyons' confession was unreliable. For a period, the gardaí involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man, Mark Nash, had confessed to the crime. They were also criticised for failing to keep adequate records of their interviews with Lyons.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s there were a series of allegations, including suggestions of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal. This became the subject of a judicial inquiry: the Morris Tribunal. The tribunal found that some gardaí based in County Donegal had invented a Provisional IRA informer, made bombs and claimed credit for locating them, and attempted to frame Raphoe publican Frank McBrearty Junior for murder– the latter case involving a €1.5m settlement with the State. In a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Morris Tribunal expressed grave concern about \"organised insubordination\" within the force that \"proper discipline has been lost from Garda\", suggesting that a few mischief-makers abused their positions within the Garda and used the disciplinary process to damage the force. The tribunal also expressed concern that recruits were brought into an undisciplined culture that had the potential to do great damage in the longer term, and warned that a \"terrible and costly\" waste of talent would occur if the situation continued. These scandals damaged the reputation and standing of the force in County Donegal.\n\nOn 20 April 2000, members of the Emergency Response Unit shot dead, from behind, 27-year-old John Carthy at the end of a 25-hour siege as he left his home in Abbeylara, County Longford with a loaded shotgun in his hands. There were allegations made of inappropriate handling of the situation and of the overuse of armed force by the Gardaí. This led to a Garda inquiry, and later a Tribunal of Inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Robert Barr. This inquiry was established on 1 July 2002, and the hearing of evidence was completed on 7 December 2004. The final report was expected within six months, but publication of the report was delayed until 20 July 2006. The official findings of the tribunal were that Sgt Michael Jackson made 14 mistakes in his role as negotiator during the siege, and that he failed to make real efforts to achieve resolution during the armed stand-off. It further stated however that Sgt Jackson was limited by lack of experience and resources (\"psychologists, solicitors, dogs\"). The tribunal recommended that there be an urgent review of Garda command structures, and that the ERU be with stun guns and other non-lethal options, including \"non-compliant firearms support police dogs\".\n\nThe Barr tribunal also recommended a formal working arrangement between Gardaí and State psychologists, and improvements in Garda training (especially for the ERU in siege situations, including those with mental illness as a factor). This included a recommendation that local Garda superintendents undergo refresher training for one week every year as scene commanders and a similar refresher course for ERU officers of the rank of inspector or superintendent. Garda Commissioner Conroy, in a letter to the family of John Carthy, stated that the force was 'truly apologetic' for his death. Former Superintendent Joe Shelley, whose failure to interview John Carthy was cited in the Barr Tribunal Report as \"extraordinary\", and who was also severely criticised in the Report of the Morris Tribunal into the controversial death of Richie Barron, was awarded a top-up bonus of €110,000 when he took early retirement in July 2005. Mr Justice Morris described Shelley's probe as \"\"prejudiced, tendentious, utterly negligent in the highest degree\"\".\n\nOne of the first charges of serious misconduct against the force came from the handling of the Sallins Train Robbery in 1976. This case eventually led to a serious miscarriage of justice and accusations that a \"Heavy Gang\" within the force intimidated and tortured accused. This eventually led to a Presidential pardon for one of the accused.\n\nIn 2004, an RTÉ \"Prime Time\" documentary accused elements within the Garda of abusing their powers by physically assaulting people arrested. A retired Circuit Court judge (W. A. Murphy) suggested that some members of the force had committed perjury in criminal trials before him but later stated that he was misquoted, while a Minister of State (Dick Roche, a junior government minister) accused Gardaí in one instance of \"torture\". The Garda Commissioner accused the television programme of lacking balance.\n\nThe Prime Time documentary followed footage published by the Independent Media Centre Ireland showing scuffles between Gardaí and Reclaim the Streets demonstrators. One Garda in this footage was later convicted of common assault, which is a summary matter, while several other Gardaí were acquitted.\n\nThe family of Eddie Fullerton, a Buncrana Sinn Féin councillor killed in his home by members of the Ulster Defence Association in 1991, have criticised the Gardaí's handling of the investigation and in 2005 they started a campaign for an inquiry.\n\nThe Smithwick Tribunal is also investigating allegations of collusion following the deaths of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers killed by the Provisional IRA as they returned from a meeting with the Gardaí in the Republic of Ireland following a recommendation from the Cory Collusion Inquiry.\n\nProtests at the proposed Royal Dutch Shell Corrib gas refinery in Kilcommon parish, Erris, County Mayo have seen a large Garda operation at its construction sites with up to 200 Gardaí involved, making it the single biggest policing operation in the country at times. By September 2008, the cost of the operation was €10 Million and is estimated to have cost €13.5 Million by the end of January 2009. This is comparable to the €20 Million budgeted for Operation Anvil, targeting organised crime, criminal gangs and their associates. A section of road used by the protesters has been dubbed \"the Golden Mile\" by Gardaí because of the overtime opportunities. Complaints have been made about the Garda handling of the protests and several TDs, including former Green Party leader Trevor Sargent have criticised the Garda's handling of the situation.\n\nPartly as a result of some of the above incidents, the Garda Síochána has undergone a number of reforms in recent years. The Morris Tribunal in particular recommended major changes to the way the force's management, discipline, promotion and accountability arrangements. Many of these recommendations were enacted by the Garda Síochána Act 2005.\n\nMr Justice Morris also said that the code of discipline was extremely complex and, at times, \"cynically manipulated\" to promote indiscipline across the force. Judicial reviews, for example, were cited as a means for delaying disciplinary action.\n\nThe fall-out form the Morris Tribunal was considerable. While fifteen members of the force were sacked between 2001 and 2006, and a further 42 resigned instead of being dismissed, Commissioner Conroy said that he was limited in what he could do to deal with members whose misbehaviour is cited in public inquiries.\n\nWith strong support from opposition parties, and reflecting widespread political consensus, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded to many of these issues by announcing a new draft code of discipline on 17 August 2006. The new streamlined code introduced new procedures to enable the Commissioner to summarily dismiss a Garda alleged to have brought the force into disrepute, abandoned duties, compromised the security of the State or unjustifiably infringed the rights of other persons.\n\nIn addition, a four-member \"non officer management advisory team\" was appointed in August 2006 to advise on implementing change options and addressing management and leadership challenges facing the Gardaí. The advisers were also mandated to promote the ideas of performance management, succession planning, recruitment of non officers with specialist expertise, and improved training. The advisory team included Senator Maurice Hayes, Emer Daly (former director of strategic planning and risk management at Axa Insurance), Maurice Keane (former group chief executive at Bank of Ireland), Michael Flahive (Assistant Secretary at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) and Dr Michael Mulreany (assistant director general at the Institute of Public Administration).\n\nClerical and administrative support has been greatly increased in recent times. In the two-year period from December 2006 to December 2008 whole-time equivalent civilian staffing levels were increased by over 60%, from under 1,300 to approximately 2,100, in furtherance of official policies to release more desk-bound Gardaí for operational duties and to bring the level of general support in line with international norms. A new tier of middle and senior non officer management has also been introduced in a range of administrative and technical/professional support areas. A Chief Administrative Officer at Deputy Commissioner level was appointed in October 2007 to oversee many of these key support functions.\n\nIn accordance with Section 115 of the Garda Síochána Act, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate consists of three members who are appointed by the Irish Government. The job of the Inspectorate, is to:\n\nThe first Chief Inspector (since July 2006), is former Commissioner of Boston Police, Kathleen O'Toole. She reports directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2009, O'Toole was supported by two other inspectors, Robert Olsen and Gwen M. Boniface. Olsen was Chief of Police for 8 years of the Minneapolis Police Department. Boniface is a former Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, and was one of 3 female police commissioners in Canada when appointed in May 1998. She suggested that rank and file Gardaí were not equipped to perform their duties or protect themselves properly. She also suggested that routine arming may become a reality but dismissed the suggestion that this was currently being considered.\n\nOver 2000 complaints were made against the organization in 2009. The Garda Commissioner referred over 100 incidents where the conduct of a garda resulted in death or serious injury to the Ombudsman for investigation. Also newly instrumented, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (usually called the Garda Ombudsman or GSOC) replaces the earlier system of complaints (the Garda Síochána Complaints Board).\n\nWhen it became fully operational on 9 May 2007, the Commission was allowed to:\n\nThe Members of the Garda Ombudsman Commission are: Dermot Gallagher (Chairman; former Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs), Carmel Foley (former Director of Consumer Affairs), and Conor Brady (former Editor of The Irish Times and author of a book on the history of the Gardaí). The Commission's first Chairman was Kevin Haugh (a High Court Judge) who died in early 2009, shortly before his term of office was to conclude.\n\nThe Garda Public Attitudes Survey 2008 found that 81% of respondents were satisfied with the Gardaí, although 72% believed the service needed improvement. 91% agreed that their local Gardaí were approachable.\n\nThe survey also found that 8% of people believed a Garda has acted unacceptably towards them; this rate was highest in Dublin South Central at 14%, lowest in Mayo at 2%. The most common complaint was of Gardaí being disrespectful or impolite.\n\nThe Garda Band is a public relations branch of the Garda Síochána, and was formed shortly after the foundation of the force. It gave its first public performance on Dún Laoghaire Pier on Easter Monday, 1923. The first Bandmaster was Superintendent D.J. Delaney and he formed a céilí and pipe band within the Garda Band. In 1938, the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Band (based at Kevin Street) and the Garda Band joined and were based at the Garda Headquarters in Phoenix Park.\n\nThe band was disbanded in 1965. However to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Garda Síochána it was reformed in 1972.\n\nBesides providing music for official Garda functions (such as Graduation Ceremonies at the Garda College) the band has a community orientated programme each year performing at schools, festivals and sporting events. It has a long association with Lansdowne Road for Rugby union and Soccer Internationals, the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin and the Rose of Tralee Festival.\n\nIn 1964 the band toured America and Canada under Superintendent J. Moloney, and has also travelled to international events and represented the country at police festivals and concerts in Switzerland, Germany and Northern Ireland.\n\n", "id": "297396", "title": "Garda Síochána"}

He may have been the most important cue stick maker. He is sometimes called \"the Stradivarius of cuemakers\". His full name or last name alone is often used to refer to a cue stick made by him. He arrived in the U.S. in 1942. He worked at different carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs. He loved playing pool and bought a pool room with a business partner in 1959. Then he started making cues as gifts for friends. This soon became a business when others wanted to buy them. \n\nBalabushka made about 1,200 handcrafted cues during his 16 year career from 1959 to his death in 1975. His cues are highly valued collectors items. They appeared in Martin Scorsese's 1986 film, \"The Color of Money\". Original Balabushka cues may sell for tens of thousands of dollars at auction. \nGeorge Balabushka was born in Russia on December 9, 1912 and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at 12 years of age. His family, parents Anton and Natalie and younger sister Mary, settled in New York City. Although originally named Gregori, according to Balabushka he was given a new first name, George, by emigration officials when he was processed through Ellis Island.\n\nBalabushka's first job was as a wooden toy designer and maker at the Educational Equipment Company. in Manhattan, The company made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Later, he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company in Greenwich Village. While working, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger. It was very realistic so that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills improved he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. \n\nBalabushka worked hard on playing ability and fine craftsmanship in his cues. He created new methods of cue construction, cue finishes and cue design. Most Balabushka cues look simple. Many of his construction techniques have become standard in the industry.\nGeorge Balabushka died in 1975 at the age of 62. He was named the first member the American Cuemakers Association Hall of Fame in February, 1993.

Ballads were popular in British and Irish poetry and music until the 19th century from the late medieval period. It was also used in Americas, Australia and North Africa. Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides. Poets and composers from the 18th century used this form. In this way, they produced lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, ballads were slow form of popular love song. The term is now often used as synonymous with any love song, particularly the pop or rock \"power ballad\". \n\nPower ballad is a name given to love songs that were predictably included in heavy metal albums in the 1980s. \n\nThe power ballad was usually slower in tempo and much less aggressive in lyrics than the other music on the album.

The river supplies much of Dublin's water. Major rivers that flow into the Liffey are the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.\n\nThe river was called \"An Ruirthech\", meaning \"fast (or strong) runner\" before it was called Liffey. The word \"Liphe\" (or \"Life\") was the name of the plain (\"flat area of land\") through which the river flowed but was later used to name the river itself. It was also known as the Anna Liffey, possibly because of the Irish for \"River Liffey\" - \"Abhainn na Life\" which sounds like \"Anna Liffey\" in English.\n\nThe Liffey starts with a lot of small streams in the Liffey Head Bog between Kippure and Tonduff in the Wicklow mountains. It flows for around through counties Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin. It flows into the Irish Sea at the mid-point of Dublin Bay. Most of its length is in Kildare.\n\nThe Liffey has a lot of tributaries (\"rivers that flow into it\"). Its major tributaries include the King's River, River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.\n\nThe Liffey does not have any natural lakes, and has only a few islands. There are a few areas with rapids, mostly as the river comes close to Dublin city.\n\nThere are dams built for three hydroelectric power stations along the river, at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip. A large reservoir is built at Poulaphouca.\n\nTowns along the river include Ballymore Eustace, Athgarvan, Kilcullen, Newbridge, Caragh, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip and Lucan before the river reaches the city of Dublin as it approaches its mouth.\n\nThe River Liffey in Dublin city was used for many centuries for trade. The Vikings already used the river, and it was used until recent times. It is connected to the River Shannon via the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal. This connects Dublin to the west of Ireland by water.\n\nAround 60% of the Liffey's flow is used for drinking water, and to supply industry. Much of this makes its way back into the river after it is cleaned in wastewater treatment plants. A popular myth is that Liffey water is used to make Guinness beer, but this is not true. Guinness uses water piped from the Wicklow mountains.\n\nThe \"Lady Patricia\" and \"Miranda Guinness\" were cargo ships that were used to export Guinness from the St. James's Gate Brewery. They were well-known sight on the Liffey up to the 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the only regular traffic on the river within the city is a boat which runs guided tours along the River Liffey through Dublin City centre. Downstream of the East-Link bridge, the river is still mainly used for commercial and ferry traffic.\n\nThe river is used by private, university and Garda rowing clubs in Chapelizod. The Liffey Descent canoeing event covers a course from Straffan to Islandbridge. That race has been held every year since 1960. The Liffey Swim takes place every year in late August or early September between Watling Bridge and The Custom House.\n\nThe earliest stone bridge over the Liffey was the Bridge of Dublin. It was built by the Dominicans in 1428. It survived well into the 18th century. It replaced an earlier wooden bridge (Dubhghalls Bridge) on the same site. Island Bridge was added in 1577.\n\nWhen Dublin became important for business in the 17th century, 4 new bridges were added between 1670 and 1684. They were Barrack, or Bloody Bridge, (what is now Rory O'More Bridge), Essex Bridge (Grattan Bridge), Ormond Bridge (O'Donovan Rossa Bridge) and Arran Bridge.\n\nThe oldest bridge still standing is the Mellows Bridge. It was built in 1764 after the Arran Bridge (which was there before) was destroyed by floods in 1763.\n\nThe first iron bridge was the elegant Ha'penny Bridge built in 1816. The newest bridge is the Samuel Beckett Bridge opened in December 2009. It is a suspension bridge, it can move to allow river traffic to pass.\n\nThe river divides the Northside from the Southside of Dublin. It has a lot of bridges, mostly open for vehicular traffic (\"cars, trucks, buses etc.\"). Large bridges are the West-Link Bridge on the M50 motorway, the Seán Heuston Bridge and O'Connell Bridge.\n\nThere are 3 foot bridges in the city: the Millennium Bridge, the Seán O'Casey Bridge and the Ha'penny Bridge.\n\nBridges outside of Dublin include the Liffey Bridge at Celbridge, \"The Bridge at 16\" (a 19th century pedestrian suspension bridge), and the Leinster Aqueduct - which takes the Grand Canal over the Liffey at Caragh.\n\nFrom Joyce to Radiohead, the Liffey is often mentioned in literature and song:\n\n", "id": "297471", "title": "River Liffey"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297490", "text": "James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde\n\nJames Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde PC (19 October 1610 – 21 July 1688) was an Anglo-Irish (\"from English and Irish family\") politician and soldier. From 1641 to 1647, he was the leader in the fight against the Irish Catholic Confederation. From 1649 to 1650 he was top commander of the Royalist forces fighting against Oliver Cromwell who wanted to invade Ireland. In the 1650s he lived in exile in Europe with Charles II of England. When Charles II was put back on the British throne during the restoration in 1660, Ormonde became very important in English and Irish politics.\n\nThe Butlers of Ormonde were an Old English dynasty. They had been very important people the southeast of Ireland since the Middle Ages. His father was Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles. Thurles is a place in County Tipperary. James was the oldest son. \n\nHis father died in 1619, when he was 9 years old. He became \"Viscount Thurles\". His mother took him to England where his grandfather (Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond) made him go to a Catholic school. James I was King at the time. James I was a Protestant, and wanted to make sure that James would also be a Protestant. This would give him power in Ireland once James Butler went back to Thurles. James I placed James Butler under the care of archbishop George Abbot. When he was fifteen he went to live with his grandfather at Drury-lane.\" \n\nIt became very important in his life that he was a Protestant. Almost all his relatives were Catholics. This made his family not like him very much. They had land and possessions taken from them, and they were not treated fairly because they were Catholics. This did not happen to James.\n\nIn December 1629, he married Lady Elizabeth Preston. In 1634, on the death of his grandfather, he became Earl of Ormonde.\n\nIn 1633 Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford became head of government in Ireland. He liked Ormonde. He wrote to Charles I saying that Ormonde was \"young, but take it from me, a very staid head\". Ormonde became Wentworth's friend and supporter. \n\nWentworth planned to take land from the Catholics in Ireland. He did this to get money for the British king. He also wanted to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Ormonde supported this plan. \n\nThe plans made his relatives very angry, and many of them opposed Wentworth. This led to armed rebellion. The opposition to Wentworth helped an impeachment of the Earl by the English Parliament. He was executed in May, 1641. \n\nWhen the Irish Rebellion of 1641 started, Ormonde was in command of government troops based in Dublin. Most of the country was taken by the Catholic rebels, who included Ormonde's Butler relatives. Rebel leader Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret, was Ormonde's cousin. In spring 1642 Mountgarret and Ormonde were the commanders of the two sides at the battle of Kilrush, with Ormonde's side winning.\n\nIn spring 1642 the Irish Catholics formed their own government, the Catholic Confederation. The capital was Kilkenny. They started to organise their own troops. Also in early 1642 the king sent in troops from England and Scotland to help with the fight. The Irish Confederate War had started. \n\nOrmonde cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces. He got control of the area historically known as the Pale. In March 1643 Ormonde brought his troops to New Ross. This was deep in the territory of the Catholic Confederation. He won a small victory there (Battle of New Ross) before returning to Dublin. \n\nHowever, Ormonde was in a very difficult situation. The Confederates held two thirds of the island. The English Civil War had started in September 1642. This meant that there were not going to be more troops from England to help him. The King had even asked to send back the troops he had sent before.\n\nIsolated in Dublin, Ormonde agreed to a ceasefire (\"to stop fighting\") with the Catholics, which began in September 1643. The greater part of Ireland was given up into the hands of the Catholic Confederation. This left only districts in the north, the Dublin Pale, round Cork City, and certain smallish garrisons in the possession of Protestant commanders. This truce was strongly opposed by the Lords Justices and the Protestant community in general in Ireland.\n\nIn November 1643 the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. This was the highest post in the Irish government. Ormonde was told to stop the king's Parliamentarian enemies being helped from Ireland. He also had to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England. He was also given the king's authority to make peace with the Catholic Confederation. They could then allow their troops to fight against the Parliamentarians.\n\nOrmonde had a difficult job to do. \n\nThe Old native Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent (\"the Old English\") had their own government in Confederate Ireland. They would support King Charles I of England if he would allow them freedom to be Catholics, and give them self-government. On the other side, any deals he made with Catholic Confederates meant that his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland would become less. \n\nOn August 25, 1645, Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, acting on behalf of King Charles, signed a treaty (\"peace agreement\") in Kilkenny with the Irish Catholic Confederates. He did not talk about this with the Irish Protestant community. Irish Protestants were strongly against this, and Charles was forced to undo the treaty almost immediately. He was afraid that almost all Irish Protestant would give support to the other side in the English Civil War. \n\nOn March 28, 1646, Ormonde, on behalf of the king, signed another treaty with the Confederates. This one gave them religious and other rights. However, the Confederates' General Assembly (\"their government\") in Kilkenny did not like the deal. This was in part because of what the pope's ambassador (nuncio) Giovanni Battista Rinuccini said. He did not want the Catholics to compromise. The Confederates arrested those among them who had signed the treaty with Ormonde.\n\nOrmonde then judged that he could not keep the Confederates out of Dublin. He asked for help from English Long Parliament and signed an agreement with them on June 19, 1647. At the beginning of August Ormonde handed over Dublin, together with 3000 royalist troops under his command, to the Parliamentarian commander Michael Jones. He had arrived from England with 5000 Parliamentarian troops. Ormonde in turn sailed to England. He said about his surrender that he \"preferred English rebels to Irish ones.\" \n\nThe royalist and parliamentarian troops were fighting on different sides in the English Civil War. But in Ireland, they fought together against the Catholic Confederates. The combined troops won a major battle against the Confederates soon afterward near Dublin (Battle of Dungan's Hill).\n\nIn March 1648 he joined the queen and the Prince of Wales in Paris. In September he went back to Ireland. He was going to try to get the Irish Confederates and the Irish Protestants to support the king now that the pope's nuncio was gone. \n\nThe Irish Confederates wanted to make a compromise now. Their battle against the English Parliamentarian forces was not going well. On 17 January 1649 Ormonde signed a peace with the rebels which said that they could practice their religion freely.\n\nAfter Charles I was executed in 1649, he stated Ireland's support for Charles II. Ormonde was put in command of the Irish Confederates' armies and also the English Royalist troops who had come to Ireland. Almost all of Ireland was under his control before August 1649. Yet Ormonde was not able to stop the conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell in 1649-50. \n\nMost of the English and Protestant Royalist troops left Ormonde's side and went to fight for Cromwell in May 1650. The Irish Catholic troops were the only ones left under his command. They did not trust him. Ormonde was made to leave his command in late 1650. He returned to France later that year. In Cromwell's Act of Settlement 1652, all of Ormonde's lands in Ireland were taken from him.\n\nOrmonde was great friends with Charles II and the queen mother in Paris. He went to Aix and Cologne with Charles when he had to leave France. He played an active part in the secret planning of the Restoration (\"the plan to put Charles II back on the throne of England.\").\n\nAfter Charles II became king, Ormonde got a lot of different responsibilities and titles from the king. He was made\n\nHe also got back his lands in Ireland. On 4 November 1661 he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland again. He did not like it when Charles II stopped importing cattle from Ireland. In return, he stopped importing cattle from Scotland.\n\nIn March 1669, Ormonde was removed from the government of Ireland. He did not mind. He made sure that his sons and others that listened to him stayed in their posts. He was chosen as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on 4 August 1669.\n\nIn 1670 an attempt was made to kill the duke by an adventurer named Thomas Blood. Ormonde was attacked by Blood and his helpers while driving up St James's Street on the night of 6 December 1670. He was pulled out of his carriage, and taken on horseback along Piccadilly. They wanted to hang him at Tyburn. Ormonde managed to escape.\n\nIn 1677 the king decided that he would become the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland once again. \n\nOn his arrival in Ireland he set up a tax system, and reorganised the army. After the Popish Plot (1678) in England, Ormonde at once took action that would make Roman Catholics powerless. There were far more Catholics than Protestants in the country (15 Catholics for every 1 Protestant). In 1682 he went back to London at the request of the King, who he supported. The last thing he did as lord lieutenant was to declare Irish support for James II of England after the death of Charles II. \n\nOrmonde lived in retirement at Cornbury in Oxfordshire. Ormonde died on 21 July 1688 at Kingston Lacy, Dorset. Ormonde was buried in Westminster Abbey on 1 August 1688.\n\n\n\n \n", "id": "297490", "title": "James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297497", "text": "Macbeth (opera)\n\nMacbeth is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi. It is based on Shakespeare’s play with the same name. The opera is normally in Italian, though there is also a French version that's almost never used anymore. The libretto (the words) was written by Francesco Maria Piave with some extra additions by Andrea Maffei.\n\nVerdi wrote several works based on Shakespeare plays. \"Macbeth\" was the first of these. It was composed in 911at a time when he was composing a lot of operas. In those days Italian operas were always about a love story, but \"Macbeth\" was unusual because there was no love story. Instead, it is a story about wanting power, even if means murder. The opera helped to make him very famous, and it has remained one of his most popular operas. \n\nAndrea Maffei, a poet and friend of Verdi, suggested to him that \"Macbeth\" would be a good story to make into an opera. Verdi did not read Shakespeare’s original work until after he had composed the opera. The words were written for him by Piave who based the libretto on an Italian translation. Verdi loved the story, he thought it was “one of the greatest creations of man”. The opera is very similar to the story told by Shakespeare, but Verdi uses a large chorus of witches instead of just three. The last act ends with the refugees coming together on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating their victory over the cruel tyrant.\n\nThe 1847 version was performed a great deal all over Italy. Then, in 1865, Verdi made several changes to the opera in a revised version. It was to be performed in Paris, and in France people expected to have ballet music in operas. Verdi wrote some music for the dancers, and took the opportunity to make other changes as well. Verdi worked in Italian, and had it translated into French for the performance there, but people don't use the French translation. They instead use all his changes for the French version, but keep the Italian text.\n\nAfter 1865 it was not performed very often. Verdi was very disappointed about this because he was particularly proud of this opera. He had worked closely with Piave. It was Verdi who gave Piave the outline of the story he wanted him to write. Verdi concentrated on three main characters: Lady Macbeth, Macbeth and the Witches. It was not until around the time of World War II that it became very popular again.\n\n\"Scene 1: A heath\"\n\nIn the prelude (the music of the opening) we hear music that comes later in the sleep-walking scene. The chorus of Witches prophesy the future. A messenger arrives to say that Macbeth has been given the title and estates of Cawdor. Macbeth and Banquo, his general, think about the witches’ prophecy. Half of the prophecy has just come true (the other half being that Macbeth will become king, and that the kings that come after him will be Banquo’s heirs). The witches dance and sing at the end of this scene.\n\n\"Scene 2: Macbeth's castle\"\n\nLady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband in which he tells her about the prophecy the witches had made. She decides to make sure that Macbeth really does become king. She decides that she must persuade her husband to murder Duncano (Duncan, King of Scotland). Macbeth sees a dagger in front of him. He takes it and murders Duncano (who never sings in the opera). Then he is horrified at what he has done. His wife is disgusted that her husband feels terrible about the murder. She takes the dagger and completes the crime, then smears Duncano’s blood on the guards who are asleep. Banquo and Macduff, a Scottish nobleman, arrive, Macduff discovers the crime, and all the characters sing a chorus asking God to punish the murderer(s). \n\n\"Scene 1: A room in the castle\"\n\nMacbeth is now king. He is worried about the prophecy that Banco’s heirs will become king. He and his wife decide that Banco and his son must be murdered.\n\"Scene 2: Outside the castle\" \n\nA gang of murderers are waiting for Banco. He is caught, but his son Fleanzio manages to escape. \n\n\"Scene 3: A dining hall in the castle\"\n\nMacbeth receives the guests and Lady Macbeth sings a brindisi (drinking song) which is quite similar to the famous one in \"La Traviata\". Macbeth is told that Banco has been murdered, but when he goes back to the table he finds Banco’s ghost sitting in his place. He shouts and raves at the ghost. The other people cannot see the ghost and think that Macbeth has gone mad. The feast ends quickly.\n\n\"The witches' cave\"\n\nThe witches are sitting round a cauldron in a dark cave. They sing, and then dance a ballet which was written for the 1865 version. The music sounds like magic. Macbeth enters and wants the witches to tell him his future. They conjure up three apparitions for him. The first one tells him to beware of Macduff. The second tells him that he cannot be harmed by a man 'born of woman'. The third one says that he cannot be conquered till Birnam Wood marches against him. \n\nMacbeth is then shown the ghost of Banco and his descendants, eight future Kings of Scotland. This shows that the witches prophecy from the beginning of the opera must indeed come true. Macbeth collapses. When he recovers and tells his wife what he saw, she is even more determined to kill Banco’s son and all his family.\n\n\"Scene 1: Near the border between England and Scotland\"\n\nScottish refugees stand near the English border and sing a song about how Macbeth, the tyrant, is oppressing his people.\nMalcolm, Banco’s son, tells his soldiers to cut branches from trees in Birnam Wood and carry them as they attack Macbeth's army. They want to free Scotland from tyranny.\n\n\" Scene 2: Macbeth's castle\" \n\nA doctor and a servant watch the Queen as she walks in her sleep, wringing her hands trying to clean them of blood. \n\n\"Scene 3: The battlefield\"\n\nMacbeth has heard that an army is coming towards him. He is told that the Queen is dead, but he does not seem to mind. He gets his army together. Banco’s army march against him with their tree branches. The prophecy has come true: Birnam Wood has marched up against him. Macduff fights Macbeth and kills him. He tells Macbeth that he was not \"born of woman\" but \"ripped\" from his mother's womb. The fight continues. Macduff kills Macbeth. Macduff's men call out that Macduff is the new King. All the soldiers and the women sing a hymn to victory.\n\n", "id": "297497", "title": "Macbeth (opera)"}

Diffraction occurs when waves bend around small obstacles, or when waves spread out after they pass through small openings. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as light that the eye can see. Diffraction also occurs with matter such as electrons.\n\nDiffraction is caused by one wave of light being shifted by a diffracting object. This shift will cause the wave to have interference with itself. Interference can be either constructive or destructive. When interference is constructive, the intensity of the wave will increase. When interference is destructive, the intensity will decrease, sometimes to a point where it is completely destroyed. These patterns of interference rely on the size of the diffracting object and the size of the wave. The strongest examples of diffraction occur in waves where the wavelength is close to the size of the object causing diffraction.\n\nDiffraction can be used to separate different wavelengths of light using a diffraction grating. A diffraction grating can be a series of closely-spaced slits or a mirror with a series of small grooves. Diffraction gratings work because different wavelengths of light will constructively interfere at different angles. Diffraction gratings are used in many analytical chemistry tools, such as a spectrometer.\n\nDiffraction can also be used to look at molecules using X-ray crystallography. In X-ray crystallography, X-rays are aimed on a crystal. The crystal diffracts the X-ray and makes a diffraction pattern. This pattern is unique to the type of crystal and can be used to identify the molecule that makes the crystal.\n\nSkoog, D.A.; Holler, F.J.; Crouch, S.R. Principles of Instrumental Analysis.

He was the official State Surveyor General for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to King Charles II. \nThe style is based on Les Invalides in Paris. The Royal Hospital Chelsea in Chelsea, London was completed two years later and looks alike in style. \n\nThe Tudor Gothic gateway at the end of the road leading to the Royal Hospital was designed by Francis Johnston. He was one of the leading architects of the day. This gateway originally stood beside the River Liffey at Bloody Bridge (now Rory O'More Bridge). It was moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844. \n\nWhen the Irish Free State was formed, they thought about using the building for the Oireachtas Éireann, the new Irish national parliament. This did not happen. After the soldiers were all gone, the buildings were used for different things like offices for the Garda Síochána (the Irish police force) and as storage for the National Museum of Ireland. \n\nThe Government of Ireland restored the buildings in different stages from 1957, and opened in 1985 as the National Centre for Culture and the Arts.

The monastery was home to the first Norse base (\"longphort\") in Ireland.\n\nIn the 12th century the lands on the banks of the Liffey belonged to the Knights Templars. Strongbow built a castle for them, about a mile away from the Danish wall of old Dublin. Here the Templars lived for nearly a century and a half. In 1308, Edward II ruled that they were no longer allowed to practice their religion. Thirty members of the Templars were imprisoned in Dublin. Their lands and rights were given to the priory of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. They were there until the monasteries were closed in the 16th century. \n\nThe Manor of Kilmainham was a liberty. This means it had special rights. \"The manor\" was an area that included parts of James's Street and side-streets and went as far as Lucan and Chapelizod. \n\nUntil the time of Queen Elizabeth, the lord lieutenants used the manor of Kilmainham.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297602", "text": "Balancing selection\n\nBalancing selection refers to selective processes by which different alleles (different versions of a gene) are kept in the gene pool of a population \"at frequencies above that of gene mutation\".\n\nThis usually happens when the heterozygote for a gene has a higher relative fitness than the homozygote. In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved.\nEvidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies. All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is common in panmictic populations. It is the field experience of Darwin, Wallace and others, that natural populations in the wild are extraordinarily varied. Museum collections of single species tell the same story.\n\nThere are several ways balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism. The two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection.\n\nIn heterozygote advantage, or \"heterotic balancing selection\", an individual who is heterozygous at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness than a homozygous individual. Polymorphisms maintained by this mechanism are \"balanced polymorphisms\".\nA well-studied case is that of sickle cell anemia in humans, a hereditary disease that damages red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is caused by the inheritance of a variant hemoglobin gene (HgbS) from both parents. In these individuals, hemoglobin in red blood cells is extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation, and this causes shorter life expectancy.\nA person who inherits the sickle cell gene from one parent, and a normal hemoglobin gene (HgbA) from the other, has a normal life expectancy. The heterozygote is resistant to the malarial parasite which kills a large number of people each year. The heterozygote frequency is kept high because of the fierce selection against both the homozygotes.\n\nThe heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) wherever malaria exists.\n\nFrequency-dependent selection occurs when the fitness of a phenotype depends on its frequency.\n\nIn \"positive frequency-dependent selection\" the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common. In \"negative frequency-dependent selection\" the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes less common. For example, in prey switching, rare morphs of prey are fitter because predators concentrate on more frequent morphs.\n\nThe fitness of a genotype may vary greatly between larval and adult stages, or between parts of a habitat range.\n\nThe fitness of a genotype may depend on the fitness of other genotypes in the population: this covers many natural situations where the best thing to do (from the point of view of survival and reproduction) depends on what other members of the population are doing at the time.\n", "id": "297602", "title": "Balancing selection"}

Alnico alloys also have a high coercivity (they do not easily lose their magnetism) and are used to make permanent magnets. Before rare-earth magnets were developed in the 1970s, alnico magnets were the strongest type of magnet. The development of Alnico began when T.

Excitation is when an electron in its lowest energy state, also known as the ground state, undergoes a transition to a higher energy state known as an excited state. These transitions can occur through heat, electrical energy, light, particles, or a chemical reaction.\n\nA HCL consists of an anode and a cathode inside of a glass tube. The glass tube is filled with some type of inert gas such as argon or neon with a pressure of around 5 torr (666 Pascal). It is important that the gas is inert in order to minimize interferences in the output of the data. The anode is an electrode in which oxidation takes place. Oxidation is the loss of electrons. The cathode is an electrode in which reduction takes place. Reduction is the gain of electrons. The anode is typically constructed of some type of metal such as tungsten and is coated with a material that helps to prevent contamination from the sputtering process described below. The cathode is constructed of the pure metal of interest or a mixture of metals containing the metal of interest. This mixture of metals is referred to as an alloy. It is important that the cathode be stored under a vacuum to avoid any kind of contamination. Contamination of the cathode compromises the purity of the metal of interest and the data obtained for that metal. The material of the window is specifically selected in order to get the best transmission of spectral lines for the cathode element.\n\nThe excitation process of the element of interest takes place through a few steps. First, the inert gas contained inside of the glass tube is ionized by a voltage. Ionization is the process by which neutral atoms are converted to charged species. This voltage is applied across the anode and the cathode and generates a current of 5-15 mA. This current allows for electrons to move to the anode and cathode. If the voltage applied is large enough, the ions of the inert gas gather enough energy to remove some of the metal atoms of interest from the surface of the cathode by striking the surface. The removal of these atoms produces a cloud around the cathode. The process of producing this cloud is called sputtering. Some of these metal atoms in the cloud have moved to an excited energy state and as they return to their ground state, they emit a specific radiation which is characteristic to the metal of interest. The release of this radiation allows for data to be collected and information gathered pertaining to the metal of interest. After a period of time, the atoms move to the glass walls of the lamp or back to the surface of the cathode.\n\nHow well the HCL works and how long it lasts is dependent on the care of operation. When a high voltage is applied, higher currents arise. These higher currents allow for more intense data output but at the same time can produce a number of unexcited atoms in the cloud. These unexcited atoms can interfere with good output data because they are able to absorb the radiation that is emitted from the excited electrons returning to their ground state. This process is called self adsorption. The process of self adsorption results in weaker intensities. Increasing the current too much can also result in a shorter lifetime of the lamp, as well as melting the metal on the cathode thus ruining the lamp.\n", "id": "297661", "title": "Hollow-cathode lamp"}

Photomultiplier tubes are used to detect low levels of incident light, even as low as a single photon.\n\nAn incoming photon will strike the photocathode surface of the PMT which will emit electrons. These electrons are then accelerated toward additional electrodes by a potential difference of about 90 volts. Upon striking this electrode, more electrons are emitted. This process repeats nine times, each time generating more and more electrons. This process can generate 10 to 10 electrons for each individual photon. These electrons are then collected at the anode where the current and voltage is then measured. \nPhotomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive and have very quick response times. The sensitivity of the PMT can be improved by cooling it, to reduce temperature induced noise. Photomultiplier tubes must not be exposed to intense light, such as the sun or ambient light because the intensity can damage the components. \nPhotomultiplier tubes are commonly used for analysis techniques as well as medical and research purposes.\n", "id": "297670", "title": "Photomultiplier tubes"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297675", "text": "Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry\n\nGas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). This makes it possible to identify different substances within a test sample. GC-MS has many uses include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis and explosives investigation. It can also be used to identify unknown samples. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, GC-MS can identify trace elements in deteriorated materials, even after the sample fell apart so much that other tests cannot work.\n\nGC-MS is the best way for forensic experts to identify substances because it is a \"specific test\". A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A \"non-specific test\" only says that categories of substances are in the sample. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification.\n\nThe first research papers on gas-liquid chromatography were published in 1950. Chemists used different detectors to see that compounds were flowing out of the end of the chromatograph. Most of the detectors destroyed the compounds, because they burned them or ioned them. These detectors left chemists guessing the exact identity of each compound in the sample. In the 1950s, Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty developed a new combined machine. They used a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography. These early devices were big, fragile, and originally limited to laboratory settings. \n\nThe design was complex. The time interval between different compounds flowing out of the chromatograph was hard to control. So, the mass spectrometer had to finish working on one compound before the next one flowed out of the chromatograph. In the early models, the measurements from the mass spectrometer was recorded on graph paper. Highly-trained chemists studied the patterns of peaks to identify each compound. By the 1970s, analog-to-digital converters were added to mass spectrometers. This allowed computers to store and to interpret the results. As computers grew faster and smaller, GC-MS became faster and spread from laboratories into every day life. Today, computerized GC-MS instruments are widely used in environmental monitoring of water, air, and soil. It is also used in the regulation of agriculture, food safety and in the discovery and production of medicine.\n\nThe development of small computers has helped in the simplification of GC-MS machines. It also greatly reduced the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI) was a leading U.S. supplier of analog computers. In 1964, EAI began development of a computer-controlled mass spectrometer under the direction of Robert E. Finnigan. By 1966, over 500 gas-analyzer instruments were sold. In 1967, the Finnigan Instrument Corporation (FIC) was formed. In early 1968, delivered the first prototype quadrapole GC-MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University. FIC was eventually renamed Finnigan Corporation and went on to establish itself as the worldwide leader in GC-MS systems.\n\nGC-MS can find all of the compounds mixed together in a sample object. The operator dissolves the sample in a liquid. The operator then injects the liquid into a stream of gas. (Helium, Hydrogen or Nitrogen gas are used most often.) The gas flows through a tube with a special coating. Because each compound in the sample sticks to the coating in a different way, each compound comes out of the tube at a different time. So the coating is used to separate each compound that was mixed together in the sample. As each compound comes out at the end of the tube, it is ionized and gets an electric charge. Most compounds break apart when they are ionized. The different pieces fly under a magnet which separates the pieces based on their weight. A computer then measures all of the pieces of each compound. By comparing the measurements against a computer library of known compounds, the computer makes a list of the names of all of the compounds in the sample. The computer can also tell how much of each compound was in the sample.\n\nThe GC-MS is made up of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph uses a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) as well as the phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture will separate the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules take different amounts of time (called the retention time) to come out of (elute from) the gas chromatograph. This allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass to charge ratio. \nThese two machines, used together, allow a much finer precision of substance identification than either unit used separately. It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample. In the past, gas chromatography use other detectors such as a Flame Ionization Detector. These detectors cannot separate different molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column. (When two different molecules have the same retention time they are said to \"co-elute\".) The co-eluting molecules will confuse the computer programs that are reading a single mass spectrum for both molecules.\n\nSometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error. It is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, if a mass spectrum matches the analyte of interest, the retention time of that spectrum can be checked against a characteristic GC retention time to increased confidence that the analyte is in the sample.\n\nThe most common type of MS associated with a GC is the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) markets it under trade name \"Mass Selective Detector\" (MSD). Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer. Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer. However these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories. Other detectors are used such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), or in the case of an ion trap MS. The n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.\n\nA mass spectrometer is typically used in one of two ways: Full Scan or Selective Ion Monitoring (SIM). The typical GC-MS can work either way alone, or both at the same time.\n\nWhen collecting data in the full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is selected and put into the instrument's method. An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be \"m/z\" 50 to \"m/z\" 400. The determination of what range to use is largely set by what one expects being in the sample while being aware of the solvent and other possible interferences. If an MS looks for mass fragments with a very low m/z, it may detect air or other possible interferring factors. Using a large scan range decreases the sensitivity of the instrument. The machine will perform fewer scans per second because each scan will take more time to detect a wider range of mass fragments.\n\nFull scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample. It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample. Most instruments are controlled by a computer which operates a computer program called an \"instrument method.\" The instrument method controls the temperature in the GC, the MS scan rate and the range of fragment sizes being detected. When a chemist is developing an instrument method, the chemist sends test solutions through the GS-MS in full scan mode. This checks the GC retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method. Specialized GC-MS instruments, such as explosive detectors, have an instrument method pre-loaded at the factory.\n\nIn selected ion monitoring (SIM), the instrument method focuses on certain ion fragments. Only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. More scans can take place each second. Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. To improve the chances of reading a positive result correctly, the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.\n\nAfter the molecules travel the length of the column, pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods. Typically only one ionization method being used at any given time. Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected, usually by an electron multiplier diode. The diode treats the ionized mass fragment like an electrical signal that is then detected.\n\nChemists select an ionization technique separately from choosing Full Scan or SIM monitoring.\n\nThe most common type of ionization is electron ionization (EI). The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are hit with free electrons emitted from a filament. This is like the filament one would find in a standard incandescent light bulb. The electrons hit the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic way that can be repeated. This \"hard ionization\" technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass to charge ratio (m/z). EI has few, if any, fragments having a mass that is near the mass of the original molecule. Chemists consider hard ionization to be shooting electrons into the sample molecules. In contrast, \"soft ionization\" is placing a charge on the sample molecule by hitting it with an introduced gas. The molecular fragmentation pattern depends on the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electron Volts). The use of 70 eV helps to compare the spectra generated from the test sample against known library spectra. (The library spectra can come from manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA)). The software searches the library spectra using a matching algorithm such as Probability Based Matching or dot-product matching. Many method standardization agencies now control these algorithms and methods to assure their objectivity.\n\nIn chemical ionization (CI), a reagent gas, typically methane or ammonia is put into the mass spectrometer. There are two types of CI: positive CI or negative CI. Either way, the reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a 'soft' ionization of the molecule of interest. A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI. Chemists prefer CI over EI. This is because CI produces at least one mass fragment with a weight, that is nearly the same as the molecular weight of the analyte of interest.\n\nIn Positive Chemical Ionization (PCI) the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule, most often with a proton exchange. This produces the ion species in relatively high amounts.\n\nIn Negative Chemical Ionization (NCI) the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte. This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply. (The fragments do not break up further.)\n\nThe primary goal of instrument analysis is to measure an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated mass spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some known sample in the library. This is best performed by a computer because there are many visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by the GC), to more accurately relate certain data.\n\nAnother method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another. In this method, the tallest peak is set at 100%. The other peaks given a value equal to the ratio of the peak height to the tallest peak height. All values above 3% are assigned. The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak. The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical formula containing the various elements which are believed to be in the compound. The isotope pattern in the spectrum is unique for elements that have many isotopes. So, it can also be used to identify the various elements present. This tells the overall chemical formula of the unknown molecule. Because a molecule's structure and bonds break apart in characteristic ways, they can be identified from the difference in peak masses. The identified molecule structure must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC-MS. Typically, this identification is done automatically by computer programs which come with the instrument. Those programs match the spectra against a library of known compounds that have same list of elements which could be present in the sample.\n\nA “full spectrum” analysis considers all the “peaks” within a spectrum. But, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected peaks associated with a specific substance. Chemists assume that at a given retention time, a set of ions is characteristic of a certain compound. SIM is a fast and efficient analysis. SIM works best when the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured. But the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.\n\nWhen a second phase of mass fragmentation is added, for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS). MS/MS are good at measuring low levels of target compounds in a sample with a matrix of background compounds that are not of interest.\n\nThe first quadrupole (Q1) is connected with a collision cell (q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode, depending on the type of MS/MS analysis used. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and Neutral Loss Scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called \"daughter spectrum\"). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a \"transition\" and forms the basis for SRM. SRM is highly specific and almost completely eliminates matrix background.\n\nMany chemists believe that GC-MS is the best tool for monitoring organic pollutants in the environment. The cost of GC-MS equipment has decreased a lot. The reliability of GC-MS has increased at the same time. Both improvements have increased use in environmental studies. Some compounds, such as certain pesticides and herbicides, cannot be identified by GS-MS. They are too similar to other related compounds. But for most organic analysis of environmental samples, including many major classes of pesticides, GC-MS is very sensitive and effective.\n\nGC-MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a crime. The law accepts using GC-MS to analyze fire debris. In fact, the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) has a standard for fire debris analysis. GCMS/MS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices and results, used in court, need to be highly accurate.\n\nGC-MS is used for detection of illegal narcotics, and may eventually replace drug-sniffing dogs. It is also commonly used in forensic toxicology. It helps to find drugs and/or poisons in biological specimens taken from suspects, victims, or a dead body.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, explosive detection systems have become a part of all US airports. These systems run on a host of technologies, many of them based on GC-MS. There are only three manufacturers certified by the FAA to provide these systems. The first is Thermo Detection (formerly Thermedics), which produces the EGIS, a GC-MS-based line of explosives detectors. The second is Barringer Technologies, which is now owned by Smith's Detection Systems. The third is Ion Track Instruments (part of General Electric Infrastructure Security Systems).\n\nFoods and beverages contain a lot of aromatic compounds, some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing. GC-MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include esters, fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes, terpenes, etc. It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or adulteration which may be harmful. The contaminants are often controlled by governmental agencies, for example pesticides.\n\nSeveral GC-MS have left earth. Two went to Mars in the Viking program. Venera 11 and 12 and Pioneer Venus analysed the atmosphere of Venus with GC-MS. The Huygens probe of the Cassini-Huygens mission landed one GC-MS on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The material in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will be analysed by the Rosetta mission with a chiral GC-MS in 2014.\n\nGC-MS are used in newborn screening tests. These tests can find dozens of congenital metabolic diseases (also known as Inborn error of metabolism). GC-MS can determine compounds in urine even in very small amounts. These compounds are normally not present but appear in individuals suffering with metabolic disorders. This is becoming a common way to diagnose IEM for earlier diagnosis and beginning of treatment. This eventually leads to a better outcome. It is now possible to test a newborn for over 100 genetic metabolic disorders by a urine test at birth based on GC-MS.\n\nIn combination with isotopic labeling of metabolic compounds, the GC-MS is used for determining metabolic activity. Most applications are based on the use of C as the labeling and the measurement of C-C ratios with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). A IRMS is an mass spectrometer with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios.\n\n\n", "id": "297675", "title": "Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry"}

Brown later auditioned in Orlando, Florida with the song \"Over the Rainbow\", from \"The Wizard of Oz\", by Judy Garland. The judges all loved her performance, including guest judge Kristin Chenoweth, and she made it through to the next round. During Hollywood week, her performance of \"What a Wonderful World\" was featured as a montage for contestants who made it to the Top 24. She performed \"Landslide\" on the first night of the semi-finals but did not impress the judges. The judges did not like her performance of \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer during the second week. Despite this, it was well received by the band's lead singer, Leigh Nash. Her cover of Brandi Carlile's \"The Story\", on the final night before the finals, was considered to be better. Brown eventually made it to the Top 12.\n\nBrown's performance of \"Ruby Tuesday\" by The Rolling Stones (she stated that her version is the one by Melanie Safka), was described by the judges as not having energy, but Simon Cowell added that there was nothing wrong with her vocals. Brown was eliminated from the show on March 17, 2010. The song \"What a Wonderful World\" was played at the beginning of the episode, with a montage of the Top 12's journey, setting the tone for her elimination. Her elimination caused problems after Ryan Seacrest tweeted the results. Angry fans did not watch the show which had \"the smallest audience among 18-49 year-olds for a regularly scheduled in-season episode in \"Idol\" history\".\n\nBrown thanked her fans for their support and plans to return to her hometown, after doing interviews in New York. She says she will try \"acting\" (from a criticism to her by Simon Cowell) as well as a career in music. In her final moments on the show, she said she might try country music although her MySpace page lists \"pop\" and \"folk\" as her genres. A notable line of Brown in the show was: \"\"You've got to take no's and turn them into yes'es\"\"\n\nAfter leaving Idol, Brown gave several media interviews with \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"USA Today\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", \"People\", several Fox affiliates, MTV, E!, with Ryan Seacrest on his radio show (\"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\"), with Ellen DeGeneres on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", along with several in New York, including \"the Wendy Williams Show\" and \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", where she performed \"What a Wonderful World\". Among the finalists, her closest friends are Paige Miles and Lee DeWyze although she is friends with all of them including Siobhan Magnus and Katie Stevens. She said in these interviews that she is planning to continue her career in music but she is also open to any offers that may come to her. She now lives in Nashville, Tennessee. She released an EP entitled \"Let It Go\" on May 31, 2011. In 2011, Brown signed a management contract with Tracy Lawrence and she will be touring at the CMA Fest in Nashville in June 2011.. \n\nThe alternative country EP \"Let It Go\", with five songs on it, was released on May 31, 2011 through the independent (self-owned) record label LEB Records. Brown's voice was described as a mix \"...of sweet, yet haunting tones with a hint of Brenda Lee\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297700", "text": "Size-exclusion chromatography\n\nThe popular separation method called Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) separates components of mixture based on the size. Recall a mixture can be composed of many substances each with different physical and chemical properties which can be used to differentiate them. SEC essentially allows components that are larger in size to exit the column (elute) first while components that are smaller in size will exit the column last. \n\nA typical column used in SEC has two substances called phases that interact with the mixture and these substances help force the separation of the mixture. The mobile phase is a solvent which helps carry the mixture down the column, and the stationary phase which does not move. Unlike other chromatography methods, the stationary phase used in SEC does not exploit the polarity of each component. It is worth noting there is no chemical interaction between the stationary phase and a component. A column could be packed with two types of stationary phase material. First the stationary phase could be a porous solid. A common porous solid is silica which has a diameter of 5-10µm and a pore sizes ranging from 100-1000Å. Silica provides excellent rigidity and will not move throughout the column. Porous solids are also stable at high pressures and temperatures which allows for the use of a vast variety of solvents. Unfortunately silica particles have a tendency to allow absorb soluble components and they have the capacity to break down components into atoms. For these reasons columns could also be packed with porous gels. The structure of gel is vastly different from a porous solid because gel’s have a polymer-like (a repeating structure of the same substance) structure. Gels have been shown to be more effective than porous solids at allowing components through its pores. Gels have pore sizes ranging from 100-100000Å. So how is it that larger molecules exit the column before smaller molecules? \n\nThe porous material will not allow larger molecules to pass so these molecules go to the next pore and again they cannot pass. They eventually get to the bottom of the column and exit the column. Remember there is volume inside the column that is not inhabited by the stationary phase which allows for the flow of both the mobile phase and the sample. These larger molecules then find themselves at the bottom of the column whereas smaller molecules have a longer path to travel. Smaller molecules can pass through a pore and then pass through another one. The smaller a molecule is, the greater the chance is that it can fit into a pore which means the longer it spends inside the column.\nNotice the graph is logarithmic not linear. There at two distinct positions on the curve the exclusion limit and the permeation limit. The exclusion limit defines the maximum molecular weight that can enter a pore, while the permeation limit signifies the minimum molecular weight to enter a pore. The curve itself is called the permeation region and this provides a range of molecular weights which could be found in the experiment. Retention time, how long the component spends in the column, is plotted against molecular weight. The peaks located in Figures 1 and 2 are similar to peaks liquid or gas chromatography readout. Normally peaks found in liquid or gas chromatography indicates how many components are in a mixture if the number of components is unknown and the relative amount of each component in the mixture within a given range. In the case of SEC these peaks indicate the relative amount of each component (based on molecular weight) within the permeation region. \n\nSEC has several advantages and disadvantages. First in SEC the time it takes the mixture to exit the column can be controlled. Depending on the chemical characteristics of the mixture and its components the process could be quick or slow. Second the peaks are well-defined, sharp, and narrow. All characteristics indicate SCE provides good sensitivity. Next there is low mass loss since the sample theoretically is not supposed to come interact with the stationary phase. Last the stability of the stationary phase allows close packing to provide greater separation of components in the sample. \n\nA clear disadvantage to SEC is with short retention times the peaks overlap and little information could be extracted from such data. Resolution (how well two peaks can two peaks be distinguished between) must be sacrificed if the process is to be shorter in time. SEC does not provide data to distinguish between components of similar molecular mass. For example if component A has molecular mass equal to 900 g/mol and component B has molecular mass equal to 950 g/mol, SEC will show one peak in this region and both components will be represented by the same peak. To have statistically different peaks there should be a 10% difference between molecular weight. Also lumped into this category are enantiomers and diastereomers which are molecules of the same molecular weight but have slightly different structures. Last SEC fails to take into account for a component’s viscosity or resistance to flow.\n\n", "id": "297700", "title": "Size-exclusion chromatography"}

These plates consist of a layer of silica and are usually backed by a thin piece of glass, although other materials like plastic may be used. The silica coating on the front of the TLC plate is called the stationary phase. \nThe process of running a TLC experiment starts with placing a small droplet of liquid analyte near the bottom of the TLC plate. This is called “spotting” the TLC plate. Very thin glass tubes are commonly used as spotters.\n\nOnce a plate has been spotted, it is placed into a glass container with a small amount of solvent. This solvent is called the mobile phase. It is important that the height of the solvent is below the height that the compound was spotted on the plate. As the solvent moves up the TLC plate by capillary action, the compound will also move. The compound will be separated into its components based upon each component’s attraction for the stationary phase versus the mobile phase. Components that are attracted to the mobile phase more than they are attracted to the stationary phase will move further up the column. Attractive forces are based on polarity differences. \n\nThe TLC plate should be removed before the solvent reaches the top of the plate. Separated compounds will sometimes be colored, but further work is often required for analysis. Many compounds will be illuminated when the TLC plate is placed under an ultraviolet lamp. TLC plates are also commonly dipped in stains (such as anisaldehyde, potassium permanganate, or iodine) to force a compound to appear on the plate.\n\nTLC is commonly used by organic chemists to monitor the progress of reactions. The presence of starting material and products may be monitored using a single TLC plate.\n\nBased on the results of a TLC experiment, a larger volume of mixture may be separated by another technique (like column chromatography) using a similar solvent system. Or, a TLC experiment may be repeated using a different solvent. Mixtures of solvents may also be used. Use of different solvents will affect how well individual components are separated on the TLC plate.\n", "id": "297714", "title": "Thin layer chromatography"}

The Philippine Commonwealth was created by the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which was approved by the U.S. Congress in 1934. When Manuel L. Quezon became president in 1935, he was the first Filipino to head an elected government in the Philippines.\n\nThe President of Philippine Commonwealth had strong control of the islands and was guided by a Supreme Court. The National Assembly or law-making part of the government, members mostly come from the Nacionalista Party, was at first only one, but later became two, a lower part and a higher part. In 1937, the government chose Tagalog, the language of Manila, as the national language. Women were allowed to vote and the economy was strong.\n\nThe Philippine Commonwealth government was forced out of the country from 1942–1945, when the Philippines was under Japanese control. In 1946, the Philippine Commonwealth ended when the Third Philippines Republic began.\n\nThe Philippine Commonwealth was also known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or simply as the Commonwealth. It had official names in Malasariling Pamahalan ng Pilipinas (pɪlɪˈpinɐs) and Mancomunidad Filipina (fɪlɪˈpinɐ). The 1935 constitution specifies Philippines as the country's short form name and uses Philippine Islands only to refer to pre-1935 status and institutions. Under the previous regime, known most formally as the Territory of the Philippine Islands, both terms had official status.\n\nThe Philippine Commonwealth had its own constitution, which remained effective until 1973, and was self-governing although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required the approval of the American President.\n\nIt featured a very strong President, a single National Assembly, and a Supreme Court, all composed entirely of Filipinos, as well as an elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives (as Puerto Rico does today). An American High Commissioner and an American Military Advisor, were also present in the government while a Field Marshall was in charge of the Philippine Army.\n\nIn 1939-40, after an amendment in the Constitution, an upper and lower Congress, consisting of a Philippine Senate, and of a House of Representatives, was restored replacing the National Assembly.\n\nThe pre-1935 U.S. territorial administration, or Insular Government, was headed by a governor general who was appointed by the president of the U.S. In December 1932, the U.S. Congress passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act (First Philippine Independence Act) with the premise of granting Filipinos independence. Provisions of the bill included reserving several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. It was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover but the American Congress overrode his veto in 1933 and passed the bill. The bill, however, was opposed by the then Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and was also rejected by the Philippine Senate.\n\nThis led to the creation and passing of a new bill known as Tydings-McDuffie Act, or Philippine Independence Act, which allowed the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with a 10-year period of peaceful transition to full independence. The Commonwealth was officially inaugurated on November 15, 1935. \n\nA Constitutional Convention was convened in Manila on July 30, 1934. On February 8, 1935, the 1935 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines was approved by the convention by a vote of 177 to 1. The constitution was approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 23, 1935 and ratified by popular vote on May 14, 1935.\n\nIn October 1935, Philippine presidential elections were held. Candidates included former president Emilio Aguinaldo, the \"Philippine Independent Church\" leader Gregorio Aglipay, and others. Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña of the Nacionalista Party were proclaimed the winners, winning the seats of president and vice-president, respectively.\n\nThe Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on the morning of November 15, 1935, in ceremonies held on the steps of the Old Congress Building in Manila. The event was attended by a crowd of around 300,000 people. \n\nThe new government embarked on ambitious nation-building policies in preparation for economic and political independence. These included national defense (such as the National Defense Act of 1935, which organized a conscription for service in the country), greater control over the economy, the perfection of democratic institutions, reforms in education, improvement of transport, the promotion of local capital, industrialization, and the colonization of Mindanao.\n\nHowever, uncertainties, especially in the diplomatic and military situation in Southeast Asia, in the level of U.S. commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines, and in the economy due to the Great Depression, proved to be major problems. The situation was further complicated by the presence of agrarian unrest, and of power struggles between Osmeña and Quezon, especially after Quezon was permitted to be re-elected after one six-year term.\n\nA proper evaluation of the policies' effectiveness or failure is difficult due to Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II.\n\nJapan launched a surprise attack on the Philippines on December 8, 1941. The Philippine Commonwealth government drafted the Philippine Army into the U.S. Army Forces Far East, which would resist Japanese occupation. Manila was declared an open city to prevent its destruction, and it was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942. Meanwhile, battles against the Japanese continued on the Bataan Peninsula, Corregidor, and Leyte until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on May 1942.\nQuezon and Osmeña were escorted by troops from Manila to Corregidor, and later they left for Australia and then the U.S. There they set up a government in exile, which participated in the Pacific War Council as well as the Declaration by United Nations. During this exile, Quezon became ill with tuberculosis, and later he died of it. Osmeña replaced him as the president.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese military organized a new government in the Philippines known as the Second Philippine Republic, which was headed by president José P. Laurel. This government ended up being very unpopular.\n\nThe resistance to the Japanese occupation continued in the Philippines. This included the \"Hukbalahap\" (\"People's Army Against the Japanese\"), which consisted of 30,000 armed people and controlled much of Central Luzon. Remnants of the Philippine Army also fought the Japanese through guerrilla warfare, and it was successful, since all but 12 of the 48 provinces were liberated.\nThe American General Douglas MacArthur's army landed on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and they were all welcomed as liberators, along with Philippine Commonwealth troops when other amphibious landings soon followed. Fighting continued in remote corners of the Philippines until Japan's surrender in August 1945, which was signed on 2 September in Tokyo Bay. Estimates for Filipino casualties reached one million, and Manila was extensively damaged when certain Japanese forces refused to vacate the city (against their orders from the Japanese High Command).\n\nAfter the War in the Philippines, the Philippine Commonwealth was restored, and a one-year transitional period in preparation for independence began. Elections followed in April 1946 with Manuel Roxas winning as the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines and Elpidio Quirino winning as vice-president. In spite of the years of Japanese occupation, the Philippines became independent exactly as scheduled a decade before, on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe Commonwealth ended when the U.S. recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, as scheduled. However, the economy remained dependent to the U.S. This was due to the Bell Trade Act, otherwise known as the Philippine Trade Act, which was a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States.\n\nAt the time, tenant farmers held grievances often rooted to debt caused by the sharecropping system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population, which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers' families. As a result, an agrarian reform program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners.\n\nAn example of these clashes includes one initiated by Benigno Ramos through his \"Sakdalista\" movement, which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or \"haciendas\", and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon on May, 1935, claimed about a hundred lives.\n\nDue to the diverse number Philippine languages, a program for the \"development and adoption of a common national language based on the existing native dialects\" was drafted in the 1935 Philippine constitution. The Commonwealth created a \"Surian ng Wikang Pambansa\" (National Language Institute), which was composed of Quezon and six other members from various ethnic groups. A deliberation was held and Tagalog (due to its extensive literary tradition) was selected as the basis for the \"national language\" to be called \"Pilipino\".\n\nIn 1940, the Commonwealth authorized the creation of a dictionary and grammar book for the language. On the same year, Commonwealth Act 570 was passed, allowing Pilipino to become an official language upon independence.\n\nThe economy of the Commonwealth was mostly based on farming. agriculture-based. Farmers grew abaca, coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber. Other foreign income came from money spent at the American army, navy, and air bases on the Philippines, such as the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base. The economy was good until World War II stopped growth.\n\nIn 1941, the estimated population of the Philippines reached 17,000,000 while Manila's population was 684,000. The number of Chinese people rose to 117,000. There were also 30,000 Japanese people, with 20,000 living in Davao, and 9,000 U.S.-Mexicans. English was spoken by 27% of the population. Spanish was spoken by only 3%.\n\nThe following is the estimated number of speakers of the dominant languages:\n\nThe colors indicate the political party or party groups of each President at Election Day.\n\n\n", "id": "297732", "title": "Philippine Commonwealth"}

These detectors are best at detecting organic compounds. The first flame ionization detector was developed in 1957 in Australia.\n\nThe purpose of a FID is to detect compounds as they exit out of the gas chromatography column. The compounds that are exiting the column are in the gas phase. Detection is done by first turning the gas compounds into ions and electrons and then collecting the charged molecules. The FID turns compounds into ions and electrons by putting them into a flame. The fuel used to make the flame in FIDs is usually made of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. As these charged materials are collected, they make a current which is measured. The larger the current the more charged compounds are being collected. Currents for FIDs are usually about 10 amps and are measured by a high-impedance picoammeter.\n\nFlame ionization detectors are used most often for organic compounds. This is because organic compounds contain lot of carbon atoms which easily turn into ions. Reduced carbons (carbons with no oxygen bonds) make the most ions. Other carbons such as alcohols (C-O-H) and carbonyls (C=O) do not make as many ions.\n\nMany times organic samples being tested are not pure. The samples often contain impurities such as water (HO), carbon dioxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrous oxides (NO), and noble gases. The FID does not detect these impurities because they do not burn. This makes the FID a very useful detector because the samples being tested do not have to be purified before being tested.\n\nFID can be used to detect very small amounts of material, as small as 10 g/s. It is also accurate over a large range of molecule amounts (a range of over 10). One problem with FID is that it destroys the sample being tested. Any sample used in gas chromatography with an FID cannot be used for other measurements afterwards. Also, a lot of fuel is required as well as very exact equipment to get exact results.\n", "id": "297751", "title": "Flame ionization detector"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297798", "text": "Time-domain spectroscopy\n\nTime-domain spectroscopy is a type of spectroscopy that measures the power of electromagnetic radiation as a function of time. Normal spectroscopy is frequency-domain spectroscopy. It measures radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength. Time-domain spectroscopy usually requires the use of Fourier transforms.\n\nTwo monochromatic lights of different frequencies can combine to show interference patterns. At time t=0, the waves interfere constructively. This gives a maximum in the added plot. The waves get more out of phase. This leads to destructive interference and a minimum in the added plot. From one peak maximum to the next is a \"cycle\". So when looking at two monochromatic lights, they can be graphed as two lines in the frequency-domain (this plot shows power, P(ν), as a function of frequency). The same two lights can be plotted as the sum of their waves in the time-domain (this plot shows power, P(t), as a function of time).\n\nSpectroscopy done with visible or infrared radiation involves wavelengths of 10 to 10 Hz. Phototransducers (instruments that convert light to information readable by a computer) cannot make measurements that quickly. What is needed, then, is a way to make these high-frequency signals into low-frequency signals. For optical spectroscopy (such as infrared spectroscopy) the most common way to do this is by using a \"Michelson interferometer\".\n\nMonochromatic light traveling through a Michelson interferometer is split into two beams by a beam splitter. These beams travel to mirrors, reflect, and then recombine at the beam splitter. One of the mirrors can be moved. If the two mirrors are the same distance apart, they meet at the beam splitter in-phase and show constructive interference. As the one mirror is moved, the beams become slightly more out of phase. When the movable mirror has moved a distance equal to ¼ of the light's wavelength, the extra distance it travels is ½ the light's wavelength. This means that when the two beams combine at the beam splitter, they destructively interfere. So moving the mirror a total distance of ½ the wavelength of light means the spectra will show one complete cycle. One could then plot the power of radiation as a function of distance traveled by the movable mirror. However, by knowing the speed of the movable mirror the power of radiation can be plotted as a function of time.\n\nMost time-domain spectroscopy experiments involve broadband radiation (radiation that consists of a large range of wavelengths). \n\nTime-domain spectroscopy is used very often in infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and NMR spectroscopy(FT-NMR). It has several advantages over frequency-domain spectroscopy. In frequency-domain experiments, each wavelength must be measured one at a time. This means scans can take several minutes. A single time-domain experiment takes no longer than a minute. Usually it only takes seconds. This means that many scans may be taken for a given sample, and that the scans can be averaged. So not only is the time-domain experiment faster, but it can also have a better signal to noise ratio.\n\nD.A. Skoog, F.J. Holler, S.R.

It is the largest reservoir of microbes in the human microbiome. \n\nThe human body, consisting of about 100 trillion cells, carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines. The metabolic activities performed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ, leading some to call gut flora a 'forgotten organ'. It is estimated that these gut flora have around 100 times as many genes in aggregate as there are in the human genome.\nBacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and up to 60% of the dry mass of faeces. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora, but little is known about their activities.\n\nResearch suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a symbiotic relationship. Though people can survive without gut flora, the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system, preventing growth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats. However, in some conditions, some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.\n\nOver 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.\n\nThe traditional view is that no metazoan phylum can break down cellulose by producing the enzyme cellulase. Instead, herbivores contain, in their gut, microorganisms which produce cellulase. This is important because cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of cotton is 90% and that of wood is 40–50%). Recently, evidence has emerged that some animals do produce their own cellulase. The question is not yet quite settled.\n\n", "id": "297809", "title": "Gut flora"}

In a first-past-the-post system, a country is divided into constituencies, and in these constituencies people known as candidates, who each represent a different political party will stand for election to the country's parliament. In the individual constituencies, the candidate who gets the most votes from people, wins the race to be elected to a seat in parliament.\n\nIf a party wins over 50% of the seats, it can form a majority government. If no single party wins over 50% of the seats, then either the party with the most seats can form a minority government, or a coalition government can be formed from two or more of the other political parties who together have over 50% of the seats.\n\nCountries using First-past-the-post include the United Kingdom, Canada, India and partly in the United States.\n\nIn a first-past-the-post system, candidate A wins because that candidate received more votes than anyone else.\n\n", "id": "297831", "title": "First-past-the-post voting"}

This energy causes an electronic transition from a ground state (non excited) to an excited state.\n\nThis is used in a technique of absorption spectroscopy known as UV-visible spectroscopy.\n\nDifferent molecules will absorb different wavelengths of light. The wavelengths of light for UV-visible absorption are from about 200 nanometers to 800 nanometers. This is a section of the electromagnetic spectrum pictured.\n\nAbsorption of light starts with energy of a certain wavelength in this UV-visible region being exposed to a molecule. The light/energy then excites the ground state (non excited) outer or valence electrons to an excited state (high energy). The outcome of this can be measured by a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The data is shown as a spectrum with absorption versus wavelength. This pattern can be used to learn properties of the molecule. Only certain molecules can absorb light in this region.\n\nMolecules that absorb light at these wavelengths are called chromophores. Chromophores are functional groups of a molecule that absorb light in this UV-Visible region. They are most of the time characterized by delocalized pi electrons. Pi electrons refer to a type of bond that occurs between electron orbitals called pi orbitals. When many of these pi bonds exist in a molecule this allows electrons to be delocalized or spread out across a molecule. An example of this type of molecule is pictured below. Many dyes (colored molecules) are characterized by these delocalized pi electrons and their color. These molecules can be used for pH indicators to determine if a solution is acidic or basic. The addition of acid or base disrupts the delocalized pi electrons. This disruption causes a color change.\n\nThe absorption of a molecule can be used to determine the concentration of the molecule in solution. To find concentration, Beer’s law is used. This is a mathematical relationship shown by the equation below. \n\nformula_1\n\nA= absorption, a=absorptivity coefficient, b=pathlength, c=concentration\n\nThe components of Beer’s Law can be determined by tests. They can also be referenced in literature. If the absorption is measured by a UV-visible spectrophotometer (instrument to measure absorption and wavelength of molecules), pathlength (b) is related to the sample container used in the test. The sample container (named a cuvette) is made of a material that does not absorb light in this region. The thickness of this cuvette is a known value. This is the pathlength the light will travel through to reach the sample. \nThe molar absorptivity coefficient can be calculated by measuring the absorption of a sample of a known concentration and known pathlength. The absorptivity coefficient units are dependent on the pathlength and concentration units. Molar absorptivity units are L mol-1 cm-1 when the concentration units are molarity. The absorptivity is a measure of how strongly a molecule absorbs light at a particular wavelength. Once this constant is determined, unknown concentrations can be determined from this relationship.\n", "id": "297843", "title": "Ultraviolet–visible absorption"}

There are many different systems of units, so some conversions can be very complex. Most conversions involve a \"conversion factor\" (named \"m\"), and a shift amount (such as \"b\"), to change from a unit \"x\" into a unit \"y\" by the general equation: y = mx + b. That type of conversion is known as a \"linear transform\" or a mathematical \"translation\".\n\nA conversion factor is a ratio that lets you convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the amount. When a conversion factor is multiplied by the item you are converting, it cancels out the units you do not want and leaves those that you do. Because the top and bottom of conversion factors are the same, conversion factors always equal 1. For example, a conversion factor of (1 day)/(24 hours) equals 1, because 1 day = 24 hours.\n\nOne of the most common conversions is to change meters (or \"metres\") into feet, by multiplying the amount in meters by about 3.28 feet per meter (ft/m):\nTypically, conversion amounts are rounded to the same precision as the original input amount, such as 10 meters being 33 feet (when 32.8 feet is rounded to 2 digits as \"33\").Metric conversions are taught very early because they benefit for a really long time!!\n", "id": "297872", "title": "Conversion of units"}

Roy Rogers Restaurants chain was named after him. He and his wife Dale Evans, his golden horse (name:Trigger), and his German Shepherd dog (name:Bullet), came in more than 100 movies and \"The Roy Rogers Show\". The show came on radio and then came on television from 1951 through 1957. His productions usually had a sidekick (a companion), usually either Pat Brady, (who drove a Jeep called \"Nellybelle\") or Andy Devine, or the crotchety (irritating) George \"Gabby\" Hayes. Rogers's nickname was \"King of the Cowboys\". Evans's nickname was \"Queen of the West.\"\nLeonard Franklin Slye was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in USA. His parents' name was Andrew and Mattie Syle. His family lived in a tenement building (apartment on rent) on 2nd Street. (Riverfront Stadium was built at this place in 1970 and Leonard joked that he had been born at second base.) His father, Andrew Syle was not happy with his job and city life. So,Andy Slye and his brother Will built a 12-by-50-foot houseboat from salvage lumber. Then, in July 1912, the Slye family floated on the Ohio River towards Portsmouth, Ohio. The Syles family wanted a more stable life in Portsmouth. So, they bought land on which they could built a home.\nBut, because of the flood of 1913, they were able to move their houseboat to the land. So, they continued living in the houseboat on dry land.\n\nIn 1919, the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run, located near Lucasville, Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth. There they built a six-room home. But the farm alone could not give a good income for his family, so Leorand's father, Andrew took a job at a shoe factory in Portsmouth. He lived there during the week and came back home on the weekends. He used to bring gifts for his family after paydays (the day payment is given). One important gift was a horse on which Leonard learned how to ride a horse.\n\nAfter Leonard comleted his eight grade, he studied at High School in McDermott, Ohio. When he was 17, his family returned to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati, his father started work at another shoe factory. Leonard also wanted to help his family to earn more money. So, he left high school. He started to work with his father at the shoe factory and went to night school. \nLeonard was made laughed at (made fun of) for sleeping in class. So, he left the night school and never joined again.\n\nLeonard and his father did not like their factory jobs. In 1929, his older sister, Mary, went to Lawndale, California with her husband. Leonard and his father left their shoe factory jobs. The family lived with Mary for four months and then cam back to Ohio. Soon, Leonard got to go to California with Mary's husband's father. Rest of the family came to California in the spring of 1930.\n\nThe Slyes took a small house on rent near Mary. Leonard and his father very soon found jobs as truck drivers for a highway making project. But, when they came to work they got to know that their employer (person who gives job) had become bankrupt (did not have enough money). Soon, came the years of Great Depression. The Slyes were now moving from job to job collecting fruit and living in worker camps. One day, Andrew Slye got to know about a shoe factory giving jobs in Los Angeles. Andrew asked Leonard to join him. Leonard used to feel happy playing guitar and singing around campfires. So, he told his father that he wanted to earn money through music. His father allowed him to do so. Leonard and his cousin Stanley Slye went to Los Angeles and started to perform as The Slye Brothers.\n\nLeonard now came to be known as \"Len\". In 1932, he met Lucille Ascolese while on tour. The same year, a palomino colt (a breed of horse) was born in Santa Cietro, CA. The young horse was first named \"Golden Cloud\", and later renamed \"Trigger\". In May 1933, Len, 21, proposed to Lucille, 19, through radio. Len then went on tour with the \"O-Bar-O Cowboys\". In June 1933, Len met Grace Arline Wilkins at a radio station in New Mexico. She gave Len a lemon pie in return of his singing \"Swiss Yodel\" on the radio. By August 1934, Len and Lucille had separated as she was jealous and tired of being a musician's wife. Len and Lucille's divorced on June 8, 1936. Len and Grace Arline Wilkins married in Roswell, New Mexico, on June 11, 1936.\n\nIn 1941, Len and his wife, Grace adopted a girl, Cheryl Darlene.

In 1966 architect Hanns Wiser made the first sketch of the new venue with 15 000 seats and two roofed stands. In 1967 the City decided to build the new stadium in Lehen and to make places for 18 000 spectators. The space for the new venue was also before a football groundTogether with Jakob Adlhart Wiser made a new plan and the stadium was built between 1969 and 1971.

The floodlight was opened in 1974 because neighbours took legal action against it.\n\nThe stadium was opend with a friendly match between SV Asutria Salzburg and the national team of Tunesia. In mid-1990s the stadium was to small because Austria Salzburg played international matches and the UEFA licensed it for only 5 300 spectators.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298018", "text": "Passion play\n\nA Passion play is a religious drama of medieval origin dealing with the suffering, death, and Resurrection of Christ. Early Passion plays (in Latin) consisted of readings from the Gospel with interpolated poetical sections on the events of Christ’s Passion and related subjects, such as Mary Magdalene’s life and repentance, the raising of Lazarus, the Last Supper, and the lament of the Virgin Mary. Use of the vernacular in these interpolations led to the development of independent vernacular plays, the earliest surviving examples being in German. Such plays were at first only preludes to dramatic presentations of the Resurrection. The introduction of Satan (which became typical of German and Czech plays), and thus of introductory representations of the fall of Lucifer and the Fall of man (as in the early 14th-century Vienna Passion), and of scenes from the Old Testament and of the Last Judgment, led to development of cyclic plays similar to the Corpus Christi cycles. The great Celtic Passion cycles of Cornwall and Brittany, and the St. Gall Passion play (which begins with the entry of St. Augustine, who introduces the Old Testament prophets and patriarchs, and also includes the marriage at Cana), exemplify this type of Passion play.\n\nThe Tirol plays early formed a separate group, representing only scenes from the Passion and Resurrection. The Bohemian plays, such as the St. Eger Passion, developed from a simpler version of the Vienna Passion, were also distinct in style and incident.\n\nThe earliest Passion plays of France and Flanders are thought to have their source in a nondramatic narrative poem of the 13th century, the Passion des jongleurs. These plays became highly elaborated in the course of their development, culminating in performances (Mons, 1501; Valenciennes, 1547) lasting more than a week. Confraternities were founded for performance of Passion plays, the most famous being the Confrérie de la Passion (1402). Passion plays were also performed in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere, with local variations.\n\nBy the 16th century, many of the Passion plays, debased by secular influences, had degenerated into mere popular entertainments, full of crude slapstick and buffoonery. Many were forbidden by ecclesiastical authorities, and many more were suppressed after the Reformation.\n\nThe most famous of the Passion plays to survive into the 20th century is that performed at Oberammergau, in the Bavarian Alps. According to tradition, the play has been presented every 10 years since 1634, in fulfillment of a vow made after the village was spared an epidemic of plague (shifting to decennial years in 1700), except in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and World War II, when religious plays were banned. It remains an entirely local production, with villagers taking all the parts and singing in the chorus. Since 1930 roofed seats have protected the audience from the weather. The production runs from May through September. Some villagers and some Jewish organizations have protested anti-Semitic overtones in the 1860 text. Traditional Passion plays have also been revived in villages in the Austrian Tirol. In northern Spain, during Lent and Holy Week, a Catalan Passion play is performed by villagers; and in Tegelen, in the Netherlands, a modern play by the Dutch poet Jacques Scheurs is given every five years.\n", "id": "298018", "title": "Passion play"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298096", "text": "Inductively coupled plasma\n\nAn inductively coupled plasma (ICP) is a type of plasma source. Electromagnetic induction creates energy in the source by causing ions to circulate. Movement of the ions generates energy in the form of heat.\n\nInductively coupled plasma sources usually use argon as a fuel. Unfortunately, most ICP sources require at least 5 L/min of argon. This makes inductively coupled plasma a rather expensive source. The argon atoms are ionized with a spark from tesla coil. These ions will circulate due to the magnetic field to produce heat and high temperatures. This will cause additional ions to be formed from the argon fuel. After a period of time, the torch will reach temperatures between 6 000 and 10 000 Kelvin.\nThe high temperatures produced by ICP make it a popular source for many scientific experiments. This source had the advantage of providing strong signals and only small amounts of noise or interference. Also, the data obtained from experiments using an inductively coupled plasma source is often linear. This makes it easy for scientists to determine the amount of something in a sample. Some of the most common applications are \n\n\nInductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is one of the most common applications of ICP. The plasma source is used to heat a sample. At high enough temperatures, electrons in the sample atoms will gain enough energy to move into an excited state. Energy is released in the form of photons when electrons \"fall\" from the excited state to a lower energy. The lower energy state is usually called the ground state of an atom.\n\nThe wavelength of the emissions are determined by a detector. Most atoms will emit light at different wavelengths so scientists may use this information to identify atoms in a sample. The intensity of emission is related to the amount of an atom in the sample. Scientist may use the wavelength and intensity to determine both the identity and amount of an atom. ICP-AES is often used for the detection of toxins, such as heavy metals. It may also be used for chemical studies.\n\nInductively coupled plasma source may be used for the detection of approximately 60 different elements. These include most alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, metalloids, all transition metals, and some f-block elements.\n\n\n", "id": "298096", "title": "Inductively coupled plasma"}

He used phylogenetic taxonomy of 16S ribosomal RNA, a technique pioneered by him which is now standard practice.\n\nHe was also the originator of the RNA world hypothesis in 1977, although not by that name. He was the Stanley O. Ikenberry professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nAfter defining Archaea as a new domain, Woese redrew the taxonomic tree. His three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships. It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes. Looked at another way, they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria.\n\nThe tree of life shows the diversity of microbes. Single-celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biosphere's diversity. This is surprising to some, given our familiarity with the larger metazoan world. Microbes are responsible for many biochemical cycles and are crucial to the whole biosphere. Woese's efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes was an invaluable service to ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology.\n\nWoese was born on July 15, 1928 in Syracuse, New York. He studied at Amherst College and at Yale University. Woese died on December 30, 2012 in his home in Urbana, Illinois from pancreatic cancer, aged 84.\n\n", "id": "298162", "title": "Carl Woese"}

It is the second largest library in the United Kingdom after the British Library. It is one of six legal deposit libraries for works published in the United Kingdom and under Irish Law it is entitled to request a copy of each book published in the Republic of Ireland. It has had rights of legal deposit for books since the 17th century. \n\nThough members of the University may borrow some books from some dependent libraries (such as the Radcliffe Science Library), the vast majority of the material held by the Bodleian may only be read within the library buildings. Besides books, periodicals and manuscripts there are smaller collections of other types of material.\n\nThe Library occupies a group of five buildings near Broad Street in central Oxford: the oldest is the late medieval Duke Humfrey's Library and the newest the New Bodleian of the 1930s. Since the 19th century a number of underground stores have been built below parts of these.\n\nThough Duke Humfrey's Library was a library for the university from 1488 to 1560 the Bodleian itself was founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in the years 1598 to 1602. In the following centuries it greatly increased in size through collections of books donated by generous benefactors and through books received through legal deposit.\n\nMany notable scholars have been heads of the library (known as Bodley's Librarians): the present Bodley's Librarian is Sarah Thomas.\n", "id": "298167", "title": "Bodleian Library"}
