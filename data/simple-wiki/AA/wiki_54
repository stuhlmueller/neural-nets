It is in Hamilton Parish, close to Castle Harbor. A favorite of tourists since since 1907, it was found in 1905 by Carl Gibbons and Edgar Hollis. The two boys were looking for their lost cricket ball which fell into a hole in the ground. Soon after, the Wilkinson family (the owners of the property since 1884) learned of the discovery. Mr. Percy Wilkinson lowered his 14-year-old son Bernard into it with a bicycle lamp on 140 feet of rope tied to a tree to explore the cave.\n\nThe area around Harrington Sound (which is to the south of Crystal Cave) is made of and has many underground waterways, through which the waters of the sound empty into the Atlantic. Crystal Cave is one of these, and - as its name suggests - has many stalactites, stalagmites, and deep crystal-clear pools.\n\nNext to Crystal Cave is Fantasy Cave with Fantasy being deeper (88 steps down). Fantasy Cave was reopened in the summer of 2001 with all the walking paths having been rebuilt and additional lighting added. It was found and opened about the same time as Crystal Cave. It had been closed by the owners in the 1940s.\n\nThe two caves on 8 Crystal Caves Rd. at Wilkinson Ave. can be reached by bus, taxi and other private forms of transportation. Outside the two caves is a sub-tropical garden lined with palm trees where one will find many different trees and flowers.\n\nThe caves are owned by the local Wilkinson Trust, and are open to the public.\n\nCrystal Cave\n\nFantasy Cave\n", "id": "206399", "title": "Crystal Cave, Bermuda"}

The novel was recommended as one of the ten best books of 1995 by the American Library Association.\n\nCliff is eleven years old and the oldest of six children in his family who live in Ballingsford. As Christmas nears, Cliff's grandmother arrives for a visit. Cliff's baby brother is rushed to the hospital with a severe illness. While he is getting better in the hospital on Christmas Eve his family finally figure out that he has been asking Santa Claus for a little ladder like the one used to climb up to the top of a bunk bed. The whole family work together to build Josh a ladder and deliver it him on Christmas morning. Later, Cliff's first grade brother Brad, drives his bicycle into an ambulance and dies. The family spends the next Christmas at a resort trying to adjust to the loss of Brad but the trip does not seem to work. Their spirits rise during a New Year's party at Aunt Pat's house. When they arrive at the party Josh steps by mistake into Dad's special fig pudding. Dad removes the shoe, smooths down the pudding and swears the children to secrecy. They all keep a straight face until Uncle Eddie says that the fig pudding is the best ever and asks Dad if he has added some new ingredient. They all laugh when the real story of the shoe is told. \n\n\"Fig Pudding\" is written using an episodic plot style.\n\nChris Sherman in his review for \"Booklist\" said that \"Fletcher captures perfectly the humor, irritations, and sadness of life in a large, close-knit family and makes Cliff a sympathetic and thoughtful narrator, occasionally bewildered by his siblings' antics but always a completely believable older brother. The comedy in the final chapter will leave readers recalling hilarious family disasters of their own.\" Elizabeth Devereaux in her review for \"Publishers Weekly\" said this novel \"neatly blends the humor and frustrations of growing up in a large family.\"\n\n", "id": "206403", "title": "Fig Pudding"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206439", "text": "Solar panel\n\nSolar panels get energy from the sun for people to use. There are two types of solar panels, those that collect heat (thermal), and those that produce electricity (photovoltaic). Heat from solar panels is often used for space heating and for hot water. \n\nSolar panels collect renewable energy. In the 20th century some used the heat of the sun to make steam for a steam engine to turn a generator. Nowadays producing electricity from the sun's light is cheaper. This is a solid state way of producing electricity, meaning that it has no moving parts. Solar panels are often mounted on rooftops. Commercial or industrial installations are often on trackers mounted on the ground. The trackers point the panel towards the sun as the sun moves across the sky. Solar panels are also commonly used in outer space, where they are one of the few power sources available.\n\nSolar panels for heat are usually made from a box with a clear window on top. Pipes run through the box. The pipes and the box are usually painted black because black absorbs more heat than other colors. The pipes are filled with a heat transfer fluid such as water or oil. A pump circulates the fluid, which heats up as it is exposed to the sun. When the hot fluid leaves the panel, it goes into a heat exchanger, which transfers the heat into water or air. After the now cool fluid leaves the heat exchanger, it is pumped back up into the panel to collect heat again.\n\n, or Solar Panels, are built to last about thirty years. So far, most of the solar panels, originally created in the 1980's have not yet reached the end of their estimated lifespans. Many of the solar panels which have expired, however, have been classified as hazardous waste. The used solar panels that haven't been considered dangerous can be recycled to create new solar panels. Over 90% of the solar panel is recyclable to create either new solar panels or scrap material. First, the panels are broken down by removing the metal frames and glass plate, leaving the group of solar cell sandwiched between an resin and back film. To actually get to the solar cells themselves, the resin and backing must be removed. \n\nThe top ten uses for solar panels include,\n\nSolar panels have become much cheaper to use, compared to oil, diesel and liquified natural gas in parts of Asia. Solar energy will soon become the main source of energy. Over the years many innovations have been made to improve solar panels. Solar panels have been used for space exploration and are being developed to be able to power cars. Along with this, scientists are developing solar cells in silicone to increase its convenience. \n\nSolar shingles are a new type of solar panel that look like ordinary asphalt roof shingles. They are used where the appearance of traditional solar panels might be undesirable, such as on residential rooftops. Solar shingles are more expensive and less durable than normal solar panels.\n", "id": "206439", "title": "Solar panel"}

It is one of the most common parasites of fish. It often affects pet fish in tanks and ponds, as well as farm-raised food fish species. Wild fish populations can also get the parasite.\n\nThe \"I. multifiliis\" life cycle from birth to death depends on the temperature of the water. In warm water, 25 °C (77 °F), the parasite's whole life cycle can take place in seven days. In cold water, 6 °C (43 °F), it can take up to eight weeks.\n\nThe disease starts when the parasite digs into the skin of the fish. This causes swelling and white spots to form. After a few days, the parasite turns into a trophozoite, a jelly-like substance. This falls off the fish and lives on the bottom of the tank. Inside the jelly are hundreds of baby parasites called tomites. These eventually can swim by themselves and go looking for another fish to live in.\n\nFish may have Ichthyophthirius multifiliis without there being anything to see. Fish owners need to be careful about where they get their fish from, as the disease can spread very easily. There are a number of different ways to try to get rid of the parasite. One method is to heat the water to kill the parasites in the water before they can infect the fish. Another method is to add salt to the water, or put the fish into a salt water bath. The water should be changed frequently to remove the parasites. Chemicals are also available which will kill \"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis\".

The pleura is a slim membrane that covers the lungs. The two parts of the pleura usually touch. A hole might grow in the surface of the lung. Air then enters between the pleura and the lung. The lung will collapse. If enough air gets into the pleural space, it can also push against other organs or parts in the chest, like the heart or the aorta. Pneumothorax is a medical emergency.\n\nThere are two main types of pneumothorax. These are a Closed Pneumothorax, and an Open Pneumothorax. These are also known as Simple Pneumothorax and Complex Pneumothorax.\n\nThe most common symptoms of Pneumothorax are chest pains. The chest pains can be sharp, dull, or stabbing. Some other symptoms of Pneumothorax are shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and coughing.\n\nPneumothorax happens when there is an injury. Some examples of injuries are fractured ribs, knifes, or lung diseases. Pneumothorax also happens when there is a hole in the surface of the lung. One can avoid this disease by not smoking.\n\nSimple Pneumothorax will heal by itself. Complex pneumothorax will need medical attention. One should treat respiratory problems as soon as they occur.\n\nClosed pneumothorax is when air or gas gets in the pleural space without any outside wound. This sometimes happens when the lung is already injured somehow, like from diseases such as cancer or cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a disease in the lungs. Glands in the body make large amounts of thick mucus. The mucus blocks ducts and passageways.\n\nThe most common cause of closed pneumothorax is called spontaneous pneumothorax. The cause of spontaneous pneumothorax is not known.\n\nOpen pneumothorax is when air gets into the pleural space from an injury to the chest. This can happen with stab wounds, like from a knife. It can also happen after a gunshot injury. The injury is most dangerous if the wound lets air in when the injured person (or animal) breathes, but does not let it back out.

Keith struck Belize and Mexico before it died on October 6. Keith killed 24 people and left $225 million in damage. Most of this damage happened in Belize. It was because it struck Belize while stronger than when it struck Mexico.\n\nThe beginning of the hurricane was from a tropical wave that moved into the Atlantic Ocean off of Africa on September 16. The wave moved across much of the Caribbean Sea, until September 28, at that time it became Tropical Depression Fifteen. Fifteen moved a little northwest and became Tropical Storm Keith on September 29. \n\nKeith changed its course and moved west. On September 30 Keith became a hurricane. Keith rapidly gained strength and later on September 30, Keith reached its highest wind speed with which at 140 mph. The hurricane was blocked and was forced to make a loop. \n\nSince Keith was close to land, the block caused Keith to weaken a lot. On October 2 as a weak hurricane, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize. The next day, Keith made another landfall in Belize, this time in Belize City as a very strong tropical storm.\nKeith moved over Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula and weakened to a tropical depression. Tropical Depression Keith moved off of the Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it quickly became a tropical storm again. \n\nOn October 4, Keith again became a hurricane.

The Supremes' were known for their doo-wop, pop, soul, and disco.\n\nThe Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts. They are, to date, America's most successful vocal group, with 12 number one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity. Their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.\n\nFounding members Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, Diana Ross, and Betty McGlown, all came from a public housing project in Detroit. They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer. In 1967, Motown president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong.

It follows the path of Sorcha and Red's third child, Liadian, a girl who lives outside the pattern of the 'Fair Folk', also known as Túatha Dé Danann. \"Son of the Shadows\" won the 2001 Aurealis Awards for Fantasy Novel.\n\nIn this novel, Liadan grows up in Sevenwaters with her twin brother Sean and her older sister Niamh. They are the children of Sorcha and Iubdan (formerly Hugh of Harrowfield). Liadan follows in her mothers tradition in learning the healing arts. Niamh has great beauty and is 'expected' to wed Eamonn, a nearby chieftan. Eamonn actually asks for the hand of Liadan, she says that she will give him an answer in one year. While staying at Sevenwaters, Eamonn tells a tale of a recent attack by a band of mercenaries. Upon this attack, all his men were killed, and his life was spared by a man called the Painted Man. He swears that he will kill him. During the festival of Imbolc, a young druid named Ciarán tells the story of Aengus Óg and Caer Ibormeith and catches the fancy of Niamh. They are soon having a secret love affair. Liadan discovers their secret during a walk in the forest. When the truth comes out, Ciarán leaves the Druids and Sevenwaters and Niamh is forced to marry the Uí Néill chieftan, Fionn.\n\nLiadan goes with her sister on the trip to her new home. On the way back she is kidnapped by an outlaw and brought to the camp of \"The Painted Man\" in order to try to save the life of their smith who was hurt in an accident. She accepts the task and eventually falls in love with Bran, their leader. When Bran finds out that she is the daughter of Hugh of Horrowfield, he sends her back home. When she returns to Sevenwaters, she finds she is pregnant with Bran's child. The Tuatha Dé Danann demand that she and her son remain in the forest, but she refuses to comply. With the help of Finbar she realizes that she has his gift of sight and can read and heal the minds of others.\n\nSean, Liadan's brother and heir to Sevenwaters, wants to buy the Painted Man's fighting men in their long battle for the sacred islands. All of the leaders go to a meeting to discuss the feud with the Britons. Liadan and her sister visit Sean's future bride and Eamonn's sister at his estate called Sídhe Dubh. During this visit Liadan discovers that her sisters husband has been beating her. She uses her mind gifts to help Niamh. With the help of Bran they plan on secretly taking Niamh out of Sídhe Dubh and take her to a Christian nunnery where she can be safe. At the last moment Eamonn and Fionn return and attack Bran and Gull as they escape with Niamh. Eamonn returns from the chase and tells the tale of how Naimh slips on the rocks and fell into the bog and died. All that remained was a cord that Liadan made for Niamh that held a white stone given to her by Ciarán.\n\nLiadan finally gives birth to her son. Her mother and father realize when the child is born that his father (Bran) must have been the son of John and Margery, kinsman of Iubdan when he was Lord of Horrowfield. Liadan names the child Johnny. Shortly after the birth of Johnny, Sorcha dies. But before her death Liadan tells Sorcha, Iubdin and Finbar the story of Niamh's abuse by her husband; the escape from Sídhe Dubh with the help of Bran; and her belief that Niamh is not dead. On her deathbed Sorcha tells Iubdin that he must return to Harrowfield and learn the truth about John and Margery's son. Ciarán returned in hiding as a tinker during the ceremory for Sorcha. He tells Liadan that Niamh is indeed alive and safe. He also tells her the truth of why they could not wed. Ciarán is the son of Lord Colum and the Lady Oonah, he is half brother to Niamh's mother. So their union was forbidden by blood. This was why they were not allowed to wed and that he could never be a druid since he carried the blood of the sorceress Lady Oonah. Ciarán gives Liadan a gift for helping rescue Niamh for her abusive husband and returning her to Ciarán, a mysterious raven named Fiacha.\n\nBran comes to Sevenwaters in secret to meet with Sean and meets Liadan, she tells him of his son. After Bran leaves, Liadan has a vision of her Uncle Liam's death; a vision of Eamonn telling Aisling that she could not marry Sean and then her suicide. They then learn that Fionn was recently killed in his sleep. Liam was indeed killed by a Britons arrow and his nephew Sean takes control of Sevenwaters. Sean fearful for Aisling convinces Liadan to go to Sídhe Dubh to bring Aisling back so they can be married. Liadan has had visions of Eamonn torturing Bran. When she arrives at Sídhe Dubh she learns from Eamonn that he indeed has Bran held prisoner. She makes a deal with Eamonn, in exchange for not revealing that Eamonn betrayed his kinsman Liam and sacrificed his life in exchange for the Painted Man capture. Aisling will be allowed to go Sevenwaters and Liadan can leaves with Bran and Gull if she can find them and leave before dusk. With the help of some magic and Fiacha they make it safely through the bog that surrounds Sídhe Dubh. Liadan learns Bran's hidden truth about his childhood during her fight to bring him back from the torture inflicted on him. She reveals this to her father Iubdin and she convinces Bran that his future might lie in returning to his roots at Harrowfield in Briton, while his men talk of setting up a school for warriors.\n\n\nPublishers Weekly said that \"The story, though a bit light on the magic and heavy on the romantic, is reminiscent of Jennifer Roberson's Chesuli series.

Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (played by David Morse) and Stanton (played by Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing, like bringing a dead mouse back to life, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have done the crimes with which he was charged.\n\n1999 Academy Awards\n2000 Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films\n2000 Broadcast Music Incorporated Film & TV Awards\n2000 Black Reel Awards\n2000 Blockbuster Entertainment Awards\n2000 Bram Stoker Awards\n2000 Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Chicago Film Critics Association Awards\n2000 Directors Guild of America\n2000 Golden Globe Awards\n2000 NAACP Image Awards\n2000 MTV Movie Awards\n2000 Motion Picture Sound Editors (Golden Reel Awards)\n2000 People's Choice Awards\n2001 Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (Nebula Award)\n2000 Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\n", "id": "207269", "title": "The Green Mile (movie)"}

Observant married Orthodox Jewish women, for example, are required to cover their hair, often employing scarves (or sometimes wigs) for the purpose. Headscarves were also worn by married Christian women in Medieval Europe, and even among some of the unmarried.

This dress code applies to women and adolescent girls, but not to children.\n\nHeadscarves and veils used for Muslim religious dress include:\nNote that the Arabic word \"hijab\" refers to modest behaviour in general, and pertains to men and women, but it is sometimes used in other languages to describe the Muslim headscarf, also known as a \"khimar\".\n\nSome English speakers use the word \"babushka\" (grandma in Russian) to indicate the headscarf tied below the chin, as commonly worn in Eastern Europe. In most parts of Eastern Europe, headscarves are used mainly by elderly women (grandmothers) and this led the incorrect use of the \"babushka\" term. In Russia they are worn by women when they go to church to show their convictions to Russian Orthodoxy.\n\nA plain red or scarlet headscarf was worn by female commissars and other women aligning themselves with Bolshevism in times of Russian Revolution and civil war.\n\nA head tie is a west and southern African women's head scarf, specifically an elaborate ornamental head covering.\n\nThe Keffiyeh is commonly used by Muslim men.\n\nAncien Egyptiant men wore a Nemes headcloth.\n\n", "id": "207332", "title": "Head scarf"}

She was one of the first animals in space, and the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was a mix of either a Siberian Husky or other Nordic breed, and a terrier. NASA refers to Laika as a \"part-Samoyed terrier.\" The reason for sending a dog into space was to get information about the behavior of living organisms in a space environment. Information from the flight led to the discovery of solar (from the sun) and cosmic radiation.\n\nLaika had been a stray dog living in the streets of Moscow. She underwent training with two other dogs. She was then chosen as the dog to go up in the Soviet spacecraft Sputnik 2. It was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957. \n\nNot much was known about how spaceflight would affect living animals at the time of Laika's mission. There was also no way, at that time, to bring the satellite back down to Earth. So all the scientists knew there would be no way for Laika to survive her trip. It was necessary to send a dog first as a test, because it was not thought that humans could live in outer space. \n\nBefore her trip in Sputnik, one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children. Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote: \"Laika was quiet and charming...I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.\"\n\nOne of the technicians getting the capsule ready before final lift-off said that \"after placing Laika in the container and before closing the hatch, we kissed her nose and wished her \"bon voyage\", knowing that she would not survive the flight.\"\n\nLaika died within hours from overheating. Her body temperature got way too hot for her to survive. The heat in her spacecraft had quickly risen to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The true cause and time of her death were hidden from people until 2002. Instead, it was reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six. Another untruth, as the Soviet government first said, was that she was euthanised (put to sleep) before her oxygen ran out.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, during the following years, no one openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that Oleg Gazenko, one of the top-level scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, said he was sorry for allowing her to die:\nOver five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2 burned up—along with Laika's remains—during re-entry on April 14, 1958.\n\nOn April 11, 2008, Russian officials opened a monument to Laika. It was built near the military research facility in Moscow which prepared Laika's space flight. It is of a dog standing on top of a rocket.\n\nShe also appears on the Monument to the Conquerors of Space in Moscow.\n\nLaika & the Cosmonauts, a Finnish surf rock band, were named for Laika.

The origin of the civil law system of law is ancient Rome. The civil law system is used in countries such as Germany, France, many countries which were colonies of those European countries before, and in some Asian countries. It also been adopted in Latin America as well as in some parts of Asia and some African countries. There are about 150 countries worldwide that use mainly civil law systems. About 80 countries use the common law system.\n\nCivil law's very name indicates where it started. Called is was the civil law during the Roman Republic and the later Roman Empire. It started in the 2nd century BC. By the end of the Republic, about 27 BC, a number of experts in the law called \"jurists\" (not to be confused with judges) became prominent. They were mostly members of the upper classes. Jurists provided their services to counsel people and advise judges who presided over trials. An important feature of Roman law was it did not depend on legal precedent by earlier cases but on the facts and merits of the current case. \n\nIn the 6th century, Justinian compiled the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\", a simplified code of Roman laws. It was used by the Byzantine Empire. The medieval Church based much of its Canon law on Roman law.\nGermanic law, known as \"leges barbarorum\", written between the 5th and 9th centuries borrows from the Roman civil law.\n\nCivil law developed in Europe during the middle age, about the same time common law developed in England. During the Renaissance, England's common law system borrowed from civil law. While the common law was the traditional law system in England by this time, Equity is based on civil law. Other features were borrowed and used in maritime law and in wills, trusts and estates. The Napoleonic Code, which borrowed much from Roman law, influenced many of the legal systems in Europe and was the foundation for Prussian civil law.\n\nCivil law is based on rules and concepts that come from Roman law. The rules and principles of civil law are found in codes which are available to both citizens and legal professionals. These codes clearly explain everyone's rights and duties. Unlike common law, in civil law judges have a different role. In criminal cases they establish the facts of a case and use the applicable codes. In many countries, judges also bring the formal charges. Unlike common law, precedent is not used to rule in later cases. In this system the legislature passes statutes that are then applied by the courts. Judges look to the statutes instead of precedent in deciding a case.\n\n\n", "id": "207591", "title": "Civil law"}

Anderson is said to have had a big influence on some of the most famous American writers such as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck.\n\nAnderson was born in Camden, Ohio. He was the third of seven children. Anderson’s father, Erwin Anderson, had a business which failed. After this, the Anderson family had to move house often, finally settling in Clyde, Ohio. Erwin Anderson began drinking heavily and died in 1895. Sherwood Anderson took a number of jobs to help support his family and he left school at the age of 14.\n\nAnderson moved to Chicago. He worked there until just before 1900, when he signed up for the United States Army. In 1900, Anderson went to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio. He eventually went back to Chicago to take up a writing job.\n\nIn 1904, he married Cornelia Lane. Lane came from a rich family in Ohio. They lived in Cleveland, Ohio and then in Elyria, Ohio. Anderson had three children and ran a number of businesses.\n\nIn November 1912, Anderson had a mental breakdown. He left his wife and three children and decided to become a creative writer. He moved back to Chicago, but took a job in advertising and publishing. Anderson divorced Cornelia in 1916 and got married to Tennessee Mitchell.\n\nIn 1916, Anderson’s first book, \"Windy McPherson’s Son\", was released. In 1919, Anderson’s most famous book, \"Winesburg, Ohio\", was released. \"Winesburg, Ohio\" was a collection of short stories about life in a town in Ohio.\n\nIn 1922, Anderson divorced Tennessee Mitchell. He got married again in 1924, to Elizabeth Prall. This marriage did not last either. Anderson married again in the late 1920s – this time to Eleanor Copenhaver. \n\nHis later books were not considered to be as good as his earlier works. Ernest Hemingway openly voiced this opinion on more than one occasion. \n\nAnderson died in Panama on the 8th March, 1941, at the age of 64. He was buried in Marion, Virginia.

The equations are named after Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes. The equations result from applying Newton's second law to fluid dynamics with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (in relation to the gradient of velocity), plus a pressure term.\n\nThey are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe, the air's flow around a wing, and motion of stars inside a galaxy. The Navier–Stokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Together with Maxwell's equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.\n\nThe Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist (existence), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any singularity (or infinity or ) (smoothness). These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics, and offered a US$1,000,000 prize (approx. €0.7M or £0.6M as of September 2009) for a solution or a counter-example.\n\nThe Navier–Stokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity. A solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field, which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time. Once the velocity field is solved for, other quantities of interest (such as flow rate or drag force) may be found. This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics, where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a or of a continuum. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid, however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories.\n", "id": "207690", "title": "Navier–Stokes equations"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207756", "text": "Twitter\n\nTwitter is a social networking and microblogging service. Users use mobile phones or computers to send and to read messages, called \"tweets\". Tweets can be up to 140 characters long. They appear on the user's profile page. Tweets can usually be read by anyone, but senders can also keep messages private. Private tweets only go to their list of friends. Users may subscribe to tweets from other people. This is called \"following\", and subscribers are known as \"followers\". As of late 2009, users can also follow lists of authors.\n\nAll users can send and receive tweets using the Twitter website. They can also use other applications that work with Twitter on smartphones. Twitter by Short Message Service (SMS) is available in certain countries. Using Twitter is free, but sending or getting tweets by SMS may cost money. The website is based in San Francisco, California. Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts, and soon in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nTwitter has become very popular worldwide since Jack Dorsey created it in 2006. It now has more than 100 million users. It is sometimes described as the \"SMS of the Internet.\"\n\nTwitter started at a podcasting company Odeo. The company board members had a \"daylong brainstorming session.\" During the meeting, Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of one person using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. At first, they called this project \"twttr\". It fit the five character length of American SMS short codes and sounded like Flickr. At first, the developers planned to use \"10958\" as a short code. Later they changed it to \"40404\" because it was easier to remember and type. Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) March 21, 2006. The first tweet was, \"just setting up my twttr.\"\n\nThe first version of Twitter was only for Odeo employees to use. They opened the full version for anyone to use on July 15, 2006. In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo started a new company called Obvious Corporation. Obvious Corporation bought Odeo and all of its property–including Odeo.com and Twitter.com–from the investors and shareholders. Twitter became its own separate company in April 2007.\n\nTwitter started becoming very popular after the 2007 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. The Twitter company set up two very large computer screens in the hallways at the conference. These screens only showed Twitter messages. Hundreds of people at the conference checked on what each other were doing by looking at the many tweets. Panelists and speakers talked about Twitter. Bloggers at SXSW described it to others in a very positive way.\n\nReaction at the festival was very good. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter \"absolutely rul[ed]\" SXSW. Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter \"own[ed]\" the festival. Twitter staff won the festival's Web Award prize. They said, \"we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!\"\nOn September 14, 2010, Twitter changed the site design and added a new logo.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, Evan Williams announced that he would not be CEO any more. Dick Costolo became the new CEO. He had been COO of Twitter. Williams will stay with the company and work on plans for the future of Twitter.\n\nTechnology author Steven Johnson described the basic way Twitter works. He called it \"remarkably simple.\" Following is an important part of Twitter as a social network. Users' Twitter home pages show all of the tweets from people they follow. The tweets appear from newest to oldest. Johnson said:\n\nTwitter is mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter. Jeremiah Owyang studies social media. He said, \"Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years.\" Only 11% of Twitter's users were 12 to 17 years old in September 2009. This may be because Twitter first gained popularity in businesses and news media that attract more older people. Many famous people such as Shaq, Britney Spears, and Ashton Kutcher are Twitter users.\n\nIn June 2009, more women than men used Twitter—53% women; 47% men. Only 5% of users made 75% of all tweets. Also, New York had the most Twitter users. \nThis is a brief summary of Twitter users as of 3 September 2009. \n\nTwitter is one of the 10 most visited websites in the world.\n\nPeople can use software from other companies to access Twitter. These programs are called \"third-party applications\". The Twitter company changed the way this works on 31 August 2010. Now applications must use OAuth to connect to Twitter. This method means that users do not have to give their passwords to the third-party applications. Changing the login system to OAuth did cause some problems. Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords. However, now third-party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all. The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users \"increased security and a better experience.\"\n\nOn April 30, 2009, Twitter changed the way it looks on the web. They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with \"Trending Topics\". That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages. Biz Stone explained that all messages are instantly indexed and explained the results of the change. The Trending Topics has made Twitter something \"unexpectedly important — a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now.\"\n\nSometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and cannot access the website. They cannot read or write tweets but only see the \"Fail Whale\" image created by Yiying Lu,\n\nTwitter worked well approximately 98% of the time in 2007. That is about six full days of no service. The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address.\n\n\nTwitter developed several software projects to improve their own service. The company shared these as open source software. Some of these software projects are related to databases, such as the Gizzard Scala framework and a distributed graph database called FlockDB.\n\nt.co is a service created by Twitter to make URLs shorter. It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter. It is not available for other uses. Eventually all links on Twitter will use t.co. The company hopes that the service will protect users from harmful websites. They will also use it to keep a record of people clicking on links in tweets.\n\nTwitter had used the services from other sites such as TinyURL and bit.ly. They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010. They used the domain, twt.tl, before they bought the t.co domain.\n\nThe company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site: @TwitterAPI, @rsarver, and @raffi.\n\nOn 2 September 2010, Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them.\n\nTwitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source.\n\n", "id": "207756", "title": "Twitter"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207762", "text": "Microblog\n\nA microblog is a form of a blog where people send short messages of text or media (pictures, video, or sounds). These messages can be sent to a website and shown to either a small group or to the public. A \"microblogger\" (someone who uses a microblog) could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages, email, instant messages or through a website. \n\nA microblog is usually different from a normal blog. It has much smaller pieces. A microblog entry can be just one sentence, or a link to an image or short video. A person writing a microblog can use many ideas from \"what am I doing now,\" to Race cars or politics or information about their business or personal life.\n\nMicro blogs are in use in many ways on different websites. They became popular with sites like Twitter where people send messages to each other with text comments or links to other media. Newer sites are also available now which allow you to share media like videos, pictures or sounds directly instead of sending a link. \n\nMany social networking sites (such as Facebook or MySpace) use a type of microblogging using \"status updates\" where the person tells their friends what they are thinking or doing. \n\nA Harvard Business School study found that while most social networking websites are more popular with women microblogging, like Twitter, has been much more popular with men. Both men and women \"followed\" more men, this allows them to receive the messages that get sent out by the person they followed. \n\nMicro blogs have also become new sources for news that just happened or is still happening, such as the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008.\n\nA new idea for Micro blogging has been to turn it into a way to talk to other people about work. It allows a person to give quick news or information to the people they work without sending a lot of emails and without the spam they get in their email account. New companies such as Yammer have been started who want to help allow workers to talk to each other with about work and share what they need. \n", "id": "207762", "title": "Microblog"}

It is produced by Alan Ball and stars Anna Paquin as the main character, Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who can hear people's thoughts. The story is based on the novels \"The Southern Vampire Mysteries\" written by Charlaine Harris. Most of the events of the TV show occur is a small town in Louisiana named Bon Temps. Although there are other places, like Mississippi, this is one of the main places the show is centered around. On July 15, 2013, it was announced by HBO that the show was renewed for a seventh and final season and would premiere on June 22, 2014.\n\nTwo years before the present (what the viewer sees now), vampires \"came out of the coffin\" (a coined phrase of \"coming out of the closet\"). After the creation of fake blood (called Tru Blood), vampires are allowed to enter the open and interact with humans (which is called \"mainstreaming\") more often. They can only come out at night, however (unlike Twilight, vampires will burn to death, until they are a pile of ashes, if they step out into the sunlight). The show is mostly centered around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepath, better known as a person who can hear the thoughts of others, and how her life changes after she meets vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer). \n\n2008 - Season 1:\nSookie is a waitress for Merlotte's, a bar owned by her boss, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammel). A rather lousy couple enters the bar, in Sookie's section. She serves them, and when a vampire enters the bar, the heads turn. She accidentely reads the rather rude couple's mind, and hears them both think that when they leave the bar, they will drain the vampire of his blood, a rather expensive substance used and seen as a drug in the series. Sookie leaves in a haste to stop them, and actually does save him. Something rather strange happens (Sookie gains the man's attention by throwing a chain around his neck, and it seems to squeeze itself around him and stay there), it is shrugged off. The woman, speaking for both of them, vows revenge on Sookie for getting in the way and runs off, with her male counterpart trailing behind her. \n\nShe removes small chains of silver off of him (which leads her to realize that one of a vampire's weaknesses is silver), and he thanks her, before she ends up pulling him out the way when the evil duo try to run him over with their truck. Because she works hard to shut the thoughts of other people out, she finds a surprise when she discovers she cannot hear Bill's thoughts. She learns that Bill is from an old time, and that he inherited his old family house from several hundred years ago.\n\n", "id": "207916", "title": "True Blood"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208030", "text": "Minimum spanning tree\n\nA number of problems from graph theory are called Minimum spanning tree. In graph theory, a tree is a way of connecting all the vertices together, so that there is exactly one path from any one vertex, to any other vertex of the tree. If the graph represents a number of cities connected by roads, one could select a number of roads, so that each city can be reached from every other, but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another.\n\nA graph can have more than one spanning tree, just like there may be more than one way to select the roads between the cities.\n\nMost of the time, graphs are weighted; each connection between two cities has a weight: It might cost something to travel on a given road, or one connection may be longer than the other, this means it takes more time to travel on that connection. In the language of graph theory, the connections are called \"edges\". \n\nA minimum spanning tree is a tree. It is different from other trees in that it minimizes the total of the \"weights\" attached to the edges. Depending on what the graph looks like, there may be more than one minimum spanning tree. In a graph where all the edges have the same weight, every tree is a minimum spanning tree. If all the edges have different weights (that is: there are no two edges with the same weight), there is exactly one minimal spanning tree. \n\nIt can be very simple to make an algorithm that will discover a minimum spanning tree:\n\nIn this case, \"safe\" means that including the edge does not form a cycle in the graph. A cycle means starting at a vertex, travelling to a number of other vertices and ending up at the starting point again without using the same edge twice.\n\nCzech scientist Otakar Borůvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, in 1926. He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity. Today, this algorithm is known as Borůvka's algorithm.\nTwo other algorithms are commonly used today. One of them was developed by Vojtěch Jarník in 1930, and put in practice by Robert Clay Prim in 1957. Edsger Wybe Dijkstra rediscovered it in 1959, and called it Prim's algorithm. The other algorithm is called Kruskal's algorithm, and was pulbished by Joseph Kruskal in 1956. All three algorithms are greedy, and run in polynomial time. \n\nThe fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date was developed by Bernard Chazelle. The algorithm is based on the soft heap,\nan approximate priority queue.\nIts running time is \"O\"(\"m\" α(\"m\",\"n\")), where \"m\" is the number of edges, \"n\" is the number of vertices and α is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function. The function α grows extremely slowly, so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4; thus Chazelle's algorithm takes very close to linear time. \n\nWhat is the fastest possible algorithm for this problem? That is one of the oldest open questions in computer science. There is clearly a linear lower bound, since we must at least examine all the weights. If the edge weights are integers with a bounded bit length, then deterministic algorithms are known with linear running time.\nFor general weights, there are randomized algorithms whose \"expected\" running time is linear.\n\nThe problem can also be approached in a distributed manner. If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links, one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree.\n", "id": "208030", "title": "Minimum spanning tree"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208163", "text": "Trouble (Coldplay song)\n\n\"Trouble\" is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay. It was composed for their first album, \"Parachutes\". The band wrote the song and produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. The word \"trouble\" is repeated many times in the lyrics of the song.\n\nThe song was released on 26 October 2000 as a single. It was the third single of the album. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the country. \"Trouble\" did not chart on the main singles chart in the United States. But the music press said it was almost as successful as \"Yellow\". \"Yellow\" was the single released before \"Trouble\". Two different music videos for the single were released.\n\nChris Martin, the vocalist of Coldplay said that inspiration for writing \"Trouble\" came from his own behaviour. Martin said that there were \"some bad things going in our band ... the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band.\" The four members of Coldplay are credited as the co-writers of \"Trouble\". But, it was based on Martin's idea.\n\nBritish record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced \"Trouble\" for their first album, \"Parachutes\". The song was recorded four times before the band got the recording they liked most. The band decided that the first three versions were not \"working\". The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker. This was done to provide the rhythm to the track. For the backing track, Will Champion played the drums and Martin played the piano. It was recorded in a little wooden room. Guy Berryman recorded the bass and then guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section. In recording the piano section of the track, the band used two microphones. Nelson, who wanted to keep the song simple, chose the microphone which had a fuller sound for the mixing.\n\n\"Trouble\" was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer. The first mixed version was sent back to the band and Nelson. However, it was not as good as they wanted and had to be mixed again. Nelson found some problems in the version. In spite of this, he did not blame Brauer because he was not present during the mixing. This was because they were recording the album at that time.\n\nLike in the song \"Yellow\", in this song the word trouble is used many times. The song's lyrics have \"softer emotional themes\". This includes apologies and unrequited love, and longing.\n\nThe song has a minimalistic approach. The song is mainly built around a piano. It has a snare drum in the background. The sound of the drum was mixed very low. The snare drum cannot be heard when the guitar is played. The song has a tempo of 70 beats per minute. Martin's vocal range in the song is from F to A, the highest note being sung using his falsetto voice.\n\n\"Trouble\" was released on 26 October 2000 in the United Kingdom, and on 18 December 2001 in the United States. It was the third single of \"Parachutes\". A limited edition CD of the single was released. It had a remix of the songs \"Yellow\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\". Only 1,000 copies were made. It was given only to fans and journalists.\n\nColdplay did not accept many offers to use \"Trouble\" for advertisements. In 2004, the band rejected an offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song. The offer was worth many million Euros. American actor Sylvester Stallone wanted to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film \"Driven\". But the band declined.\n\n\"Trouble\" was a commercial success. It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. This made it the band's second Top 10 single in the UK after \"Yellow\". \"Trouble\" was successful because the previous singles did very well. Also, the album, \"Parachutes\" was very successful in the United Kingdom. The British band Lost Witness made a remixed version of the song. It was released and was successful.\n\nIn the United States, the single's chart performance was almost as good as \"Yellow\"s. It reached number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Top 40 and 28 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks. Martin has said the single had saved them from being a \"one-hit wonder\" band. The band thought it was not a \"great single\". They felt it would not do well in the United States.\n\nThe original European version of the music video for \"Trouble\" was directed by British director Sophie Muller. The video was shot in a Newhall, California ranch. Its theme was the Wild West.\n\nThe music video also had a U.S. version. This was directed by Tim Hope who won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002 for the video. It was also nominated for \"Breakthrough Video\". The video is similar to \"Don't Panic\".\n\n", "id": "208163", "title": "Trouble (Coldplay song)"}

The idea is that quantum computers can use certain phenomena from quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on it. A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine, also known as the universal quantum computer.\n\nThe idea of quantum computing is still very new. Experiments have been done. In these, a very small number of operations were done on qubits (quantum bit). Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest, and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and military purposes, such as cryptanalysis.\n\nToday's computers, called \"classical\" computers, store information in binary; each bit is either on or off. Quantum computation use qubits, which, in addition to being possibly on or off, can be both on and off, which is a way of describing superposition, until a measurement is made. The state of a piece of data on a normal computer is known with certainty, but quantum computation uses probabilities. Only very simple quantum computers have been built, although larger designs have been invented. Quantum computation uses a special type of physics, quantum physics.\n\nIf large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve some problems much more quickly than any computer that exists today (such as Shor's algorithm). Quantum computers are different from other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers based on transistors. Some computing architectures such as optical computers may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves. Without quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement, people think that an exponential advantage over classical computers is not possible. Quantum computers cannot perform functions that are not theoretically computable by classical computers, in other words they do not alter the Church-Turing thesis. They would, however, be able to do many things much more quickly and efficiently. \n\n", "id": "208216", "title": "Quantum computer"}

He was the managing director of Apple Corps, a company started by The Beatles. He had earlier served as the band's road manager.\n\nAspinall was born in Prestatyn, North Wales and grew up in Liverpool, England. He was an Accountancy student and lived with the Best family, renting a room in their house. Eldest son Pete Best was a drummer who played for the Beatles. Aspinall owned a van, and began driving the band to their shows, and setting up equipment. In time, they began to pay him for this, and he gave up his studies to be their official road manager. \n\nDuring 1962 the Beatles changed drummers when Ringo Starr joined, and Pete Best was let go. Aspinall offered to quit also, but he was persuaded to keep working for the Beatles. (He kept a connection to the Best family, having a son, Roag, with Mona Best.) Aspinall was joined by another man, Mal Evans, who shared his job duties.\n\nOver time, other people helped with setting up and breaking down the Beatles' instruments and equipment, but Aspinall and Evans still supervised them. They also did other jobs, like shopping for the band, delivering important messages, and dealing with members of the public who wanted to meet the band. Some of their lesser-known jobs were choosing female audience members at Beatles concerts to visit the band backstage, and signing Beatles autographs on photographs. (The demand for autographs was too great for the Beatles themselves to meet practically.)\n\nWhen the Beatles stopped giving concerts, they put time into forming their own company, which became Apple Corps. Aspinall and Evans were both directors at Apple, and personal assistants to the Beatles. None of the band's inner circle knew how to run a large company, and Apple got into financial trouble. Allen Klein and Lee Eastman (Paul McCartney's father-in-law) took over running Apple, and Evans was fired. Aspinall was also supposed to be fired, but the Beatles themselves insisted he be kept on.\n\nAfter the Beatles disbanded, Apple's business decreased, Klein and Eastman moved on, and Apple was reorganized. Aspinall alone was able to handle most of Apple's ongoing business, which was mostly licensing Beatles-related products, and future issues of Beatles music. He kept working for the band until shortly before his death.\n\nAspinall's last tasks for Apple included handling a lawsuit against Apple Inc. over iTunes, and supervising a new recording of the whole Beatles music catalogue.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208326", "text": "Jean Balukas\n\nJean Balukas (born June 28, 1959) is an American pool player from Brooklyn, New York. During the 1970s and 1980s, many people thought Balukas was the greatest female player ever. Some people described her as a leader and \"a child prodigy, a loner who rebelled against dress codes for women—the pool equivalent of Billie Jean King\". Balukas was named Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Player of the Year five times. She was the youngest person given an entry in the BCA Hall of Fame. She is only the second woman given that honor. In 1999, Balukas was ranked fifteenth on \"Billiard Digest's\" Fifty Greatest Players of the 20 Century.\nBalukas was thought of as a rare young talent. She first earned some fame when she was six years old by appearing in a pool playing event held at New York City's Grand Central Station. She later appeared many times on television, such as on CBS's popular evening television show, \"I've Got a Secret\". She was nine years old when she placed 5th in the 1969 U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. She placed 4th and 3rd in the next two U.S. Opens. From that early start, Balukas dominated women's professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBalukas won the U.S. Open seven years in a row, from 1972 through 1978. She won six world championship titles. She had over 100 professional competition first place finishes; 38 of those wins were in major events. She had a streak of 16 first place finishes in women's professional tournaments. Balukas was also the only woman to compete equally with men in professional play in her era. She quit the sport in 1988 because of a dispute that happened in a match at the World Open Nine-ball Championship that year.\n\nJean Balukas's father, Albert Balukas, and his business partner, Frank McGown, owned a forty-eight-table pool hall, named the Ovington Lounge, in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas began playing pool when she four years old. She did not play at her father's pool room. Her first play was on a 4½ by 9 foot pool table in the basement of her childhood home. Her parents bought the table to keep her four brothers out of local pool rooms.\n\nBalukas played with a cue stick that had ivory details. It was made just for her in 1965 by a cue stick maker, George Balabushka. When she was five and six years old she would practice a game called straight pool to 50 points after family dinners. Her father supported her play.\n\nIn 1966, McGown held a public billiards exhibition at New York City's Grand Central Terminal. With her parents' permission, he brought along the six-year-old Balukas. Balukas participated in the exhibition. This gained Balukas media attention. Later in 1966, Balukas appeared on a television show called \"Wonderama\". Balukas and her younger sister Laura also appeared on CBS's television show \"I've Got a Secret\" later that year.\n\nIn 1967, Balukas was in an exhibition match at a pool hall called the Carom Club, located Manhattan. In advertisements for the match, Balukas was described as \"the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards\". A reporter described her at the match as \"a little girl with honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards...who resembles a young Shirley Temple\". She beat her adult opponent, Roland DeMarco, with a final score of 50 to 42. \n\nIn 1969, at the age of nine, she competed in her first Billiard Congress of America U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. Balukas placed 5th in the competition. All her opponents were adults. In the next two U.S. Opens, in 1970 and 1971, she placed 4th and 3rd, respectively. By that time, Balukas had appeared on other television programs with a number of billiard stars and other celebrities.\n\nOn August 18, 1972, when she was thirteen years old, Balukas won the women's side of the U.S. Open Straight Pool Championship. For the win she beat five time champion Dorothy Wise. The prize was $1,500. Balukas was the U.S Open's youngest winner ever and by a large number of years. She also beat in the finals, Madelyn Whitlow of Detroit, Michigan, with a score of 75 to 32 in 44 innings (turns at the table). Reporting on the competition, \"The New York Times\" described her as a strong player \"throughout the tournament ... as she defeated six opponents with precision shooting and <nowiki>[</nowiki>almost perfect<nowiki>]</nowiki> strategy\". \n\nIn 1973, at fourteen, Balukas successfully defended her straight pool U.S. Open title. She beat runner-up Donna Ries, a psychologist from Kansas City, Missouri, with a final score of 75 to 72 in 42 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 26 balls in a row and won $2,000 for first place. Earlier in the tournament she beat Mieko Harada, a housewife from Kyoto, Japan. Baluka's score was much higher than Harada's: 75 to 1 in 20 innings and sank 25 balls in a row. In the 1974 U.S. Open held at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago, Balukas defended her title, again beating out Harada, but by a much closer score: 100 to 99. This was Balukas's third U.S. Open title in a row, at the young age of fifteen. The close scores at the end of the match were similar to the results on the men's side, where Joe Balsis defeated Jim Rempe 200 to 199. \n\nIn 1975, Balukas beat Ries again in the U.S. Open semi-finals with a score of 75 to 15 in 15 innings. She also beat Gail Breedlove of Ames, Iowa, 75 to 19. She then again played and beat Harada in the finals, winning $3,000 with a score of 100 to 63 in 39 innings. In her longest turn, she sank 23 balls. In 1976, then 17, Balukas took her fifth U.S. Open title in a row, beating Gloria Walker of Cheyney, Pennsylvania 75 to 46 in 39 innings and winning a $1,700 prize. Balukas would win the next two U.S. Open straight pool championships for a total of seven wins in a row. Her streak of wins ended after 1978 because the U.S. Open itself was canceled, not because she was beaten. \n\nBalukas was not only talented at pool but also good at other sports. From age sixteen to eighteen, ABC-TV asked her to be on a show called \"Superstars\". This event happened in Rotonda West, Florida. Top athletes from one sport competed in a different sports that they did not usually compete in. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, Balukas placed second with 192 points. She won titles in tennis and bowling. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included: diver Micki King; tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson; skier Kiki Cutter; runner Wyomia Tyus; and tennis champion Martina Navratilova. The second place win was both good and bad for Balukas. She won $13,100 prize money, so she lost amateur standing. Afterwards, she was banned from competing in high school sports. Also, she was not allowed to get a college athletic scholarship.\n\nBalukas has won many other pool titles, including six at the World Open Pocket Billiard Championships. At her first win in that tournament, held at a convention hall in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 14, 1977, she was described as \"the 18-year-old prodigy from Brooklyn\". There, she again beat Gloria Walker with a score of 100 to 57, and earned a $1,001 prize. Balukas has won more U.S. Opens than any other player, male or female. The closest male is Steve Mizerak with four wins to Balukas's seven. Her ball average over the seven U.S. Opens was far better than was her opponents'. Balukas averaged 3.44 in 1972 with the next best, Gloria Walker, having an average of 2.37. In 1975 she averaged 4.05, while no other player averaged even 3.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Balukas was playing in exhibition matches with top male players. For example, she played with Willie Mosconi and Irving Crane who were together considered between 1941 and 1956 the \"best in the world, flat out\". In 1975, she again played Willie Mosconi on CBS's \"Challenge of the Sexes\", playing in games of eight-ball and nine-ball. For the exhibition, the rules were changed to allow Balukas to have an advantage (a practice called \"handicapping\"). Specifically, Balukas always took the first shot. Then, she also took the next shot, even if she did not put a ball in a pocket on the first shot. Balukas beat Mosconi at both games. She would later play \"Battle of the Sexes\" matches on television with Rudolph Wanderone (also known as Minnesota Fats) in 1977, Ray Martin in 1979, and with Steve Mizerak in 1986.\n\nOn August 6, 1978, Balukas became the first women to qualify to play in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship. This meant that Balukas would be competing in both the women's and men's sides of the tournament. The tournament was to be held on August 12 of that year at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City. \n\nBalukas played against men in several other competitions. These included at least one first shown on TV on March 25, 1979, between her and men's champion Ray Martin. The match was described on the television schedule as part of a \"Challenge of the Sexes\". Other male-female matchups in the series were between golfers Nancy Lopez and Andy North and co-ed participants in a skateboarding challenge match. During 1980, Balukas again competed in the men's side of the World Open Pocket Billiards championship. That year it was played at New York City's Roosevelt Hotel. She was beaten in the second round by Steve Mizerak with a score of 150 to 93. Her final in the tournament was 22nd. At the end, 42 men were behind her. She also played on the women's side and was the champion. She beat Billie Billings, also from Brooklyn, with a score of 100 to 75.\n\nBalukas was entered in both the men's and women's divisions of the 1987 B.C. Classic, a nine-ball competition. After controversy, she competed only on the men's side. There, she beat Keith McCready 11 to 3. At that time McCready was the 17th-ranked male player by money list. Balukas finished the tournament by tying for 9th place.\n\nIn August 1987, at the B.C. Classic held at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton, New York, Balukas was scheduled to play in the men's and women's tournaments. After arriving, she found out that for the nighttime matches, she would be required to wear formal clothing. However, she did not have suitable clothing with her. The men's side had no similar dress code. Thus, Balukas did not buy clothes to follow the rule because she thought it was unfair. \n\nThe women held a vote on whether Balukas should be allowed to play. The vote resulted in Balukas being banned from the women's tournament. Some people said that the real reason other players voted her out was because they would have a better chance of winning the first place USD $5,000 prize if Balukas did not play. Balukas did not think so. Balukas did compete on the men's side, tying for ninth place.\n\nSoon after the dress code issue was reported on, the president of the Women's Professional Billiard Association (WPBA), Belinda Bearden, sent a letter to \"The New York Times\". Bearden wrote that the facts were different than reported. The WPBA stated the dress code was decided by the women players for themselves. They made the rules to improve the image of women's pool and to attract a larger audience and more press to the sport. They said that Balukas was the only woman at the event who was not willing to follow the rule. They also explained that Balukas first left from the women's division. They said that she came back to play after the list of who would play who was already completed. Another vote on whether she could play went 8–7 in Balukas' favor. However, after they asked a player who was absent from the first vote, Balukas withdrew from the women's division of the competition.\n\nIn 1988, Balukas was playing another professional player named Robin Bell the Brunswick-sponsored World Open Nine-ball Championship. The tournament was held at Caesars Palace (a casino and hotel) in Las Vegas, Nevada and shown on television. Bell was Balukas's best friend on the women's tour. She had never beaten Balukas before. However, Bell had been playing very strongly in the tournament. The terms of the match were that the winner would be whoever won nine games first. In the game of nine ball, there is a way to win the game very quickly. The game is over and the first player wins if they put the 9 ball in a pocket when they take the first shot. Early in the match the score was 2 games to 3, with Bell winning. Then, Bell sank the 9 ball on the first shot two games in a row, so she won both games. That made the score 5 to 2 very quickly without having to play a complete game. Bell avoided having to match skill with Balukas on each turn.\n\nAll television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience. Balukas quietly said to herself that Bell had gotten lucky. The microphone let others hear what Balukas said. The referee spoke to Balukas and told her not to continue talking about Bell. They continued playing. Balukas won the match with a final score of 9 to 5. According to an interview with Balukas by \"New York Woman\" magazine in 1991, Balukas's exact words were \"Some world championship... beat me with skill, not luck\". Despite Bell and Balukas's friendship, after the match Bell made a formal to the WPBA about the incident. The WPBA's board of directors fined Balukas $200 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nBalukas was angry about the fine. She did not pay it. She turned down offers by others to pay the fine for her. Balukas explained that \"It wasn’t the $200... [Women] pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, were the ones who decided I should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors\". The sides were deadlocked. Balukas to pay and the WPBA refused to cancel the fine. They would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid. \"Just because she was our premier player does not mean she was above the rules\", said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Another professional named Loree Jon Jones was also interviewed. Her feelings were more mixed: \"Her not playing is, I guess, sad\", but she also said that without Balukas playing, \"we've all learned how to win\".\n\nBalukas had faced other problems before she stopped competing. When she had tried to compete against men as the only woman she heard insults from some men. For example, one said \"I’m gonna put on a dress and go play with the women\". Balukas heard many complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago tournament in 1988. They said it was not fair that she got to play on both the men's and women's side, when the men could only play on their own side. She agreed not to play. However, after she traveled to the tournament she learned she had been tricked: \"I found out that the first- and second-place winners in the women’s event were going to be invited to play in the men’s event. I was stabbed in the back\".\n\nBalukas also admits having been under great pressure, much of it that she placed on herself. After she reached the very top of her profession, \"That's when I started getting nervous... that’s when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself\". \"Playing against the men, I learned to lose... but [losing] hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time\". Balukas later said that leaving the sport was a combination of many things, including: stress, fatigue, frustration, and anger at the professional pool industry. She said, \"You know, you're going to fine me? Well, see you later. That was my excuse to finally say I need a break\".\nAfter leaving the sport, Balukas returned to Bay Ridge. She took over management of her family's pool hall, Hall of Fame Billiards on Ovington Avenue in Brooklyn. She says \"I'm enjoying my life immensely... I have moved on\". In summing up these events in a 1992 article, \"The New York Times\" stated, \"So America's greatest woman pool player competes only for the odd soda. If you're feeling lucky, drop by her poolroom...If you're thirsty...go elsewhere\".\n\nIn 1975, when she was fifteen years old, Balukas was already described as the \"best female pool player in the world\". Announcers had stopped calling Balukas \"the Little Princess\", but introduced her to audiences as \"the Queen\". By that time she had won the World Straight Pool Championship women's division eight of the last nine years. During those same years, she also won sixteen women's professional tournaments. She had been named the Billiard Congress of America Player of the Year five times. In 1985, Balukas became the second woman (after Dorothy Wise) to enter the BCA Hall of Fame. She was the youngest person ever to receive the honor, at just under 27 years of age. In 1999, Balukas was ranked number fifteen on \"Billiard Digest's\" Fifty Greatest Players of the Century.\n", "id": "208326", "title": "Jean Balukas"}

The highway is long. It goes through mostly rural areas, and is usually used as a shortcut from U.S. Route 9 (US 9) to New York State Route 9G. The road passes several landmarks along its path. The road began its history in about 1685, when a group of Native Americans built the Sepasco Trail. This trail went from the Hudson River to Lake Sepasco, and followed the same path that currently exists as Route 308. The trail was there until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was built over it. Route 308 was officially formed in 1930.\n\nPart of NY 308 is in the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, which is a area that has 272 historical buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A well-known attraction is the Beekman Arms Inn, which is located at the corner of NY 308 and US 9. The inn was started in 1776, and says it is one of the oldest inns within the United States.\n\nThe road begins at US 9 in the village of Rhinebeck, which is above sea level. To the south of here is a park, a small lake, and a cemetery. At this point, the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are north of Route 308. The highway goes to the east, and is called East Market Street. It soon leaves Rhinebeck, while it runs next to a small creek sometimes known as the Landsman Kill.\n\nThe road intersects with County Route 101 and then turns to the north. It also intersects with Route 9G before it turns to the east into a rural area. In this area, Route 308 carries about 6,400 vehicles each day. There are many small lakes around the road as it intersects with County Route 52 and turns to the northeast. NY 308 then travels west of Sepasco Lake before turning east again. It ends at NY 199 in the town of Milan.\n\nThe earliest people that lived in northern Dutchess County were the Mohicans. They were a Native American nation that came to the area about 3,000 years ago. There were around 8,000 Mohicans during the time they first saw the Europeans. However, there were only 800 after the American Revolution. Artifacts were found along the shore of Lake Sepasco, which is a small lake near NY 308. The artifacts included very old arrowheads, and are now being shown at a local museum. \nA smaller group of these Native Americans were known as the Sepasco Indians. This name was used for Native Americans in the Sepasco area, which is now known as Rhinebeck. The word \"Sepasco\" probably came from the tribe's word for \"little river\" or \"stream\", which is \"sepuus\". After the Civil War, only a few of the Sepasco were left. The last Sepasco Indian died in 1867 in a hut near Lake Sepasco. By 1685, a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by the Sepasco people. This trail started at the Hudson River and went east through the village of Rhinebeck. It ended at Lake Sepasco. Part of the trail from Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows about the same path that is today taken by Route 308.\n\nThe trail was there until 1802, when a turnpike, a type of road, was built over it \"for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehannah River at or near the Town of Jericho\". The part of the new turnpike east of the Hudson River was sometimes known as the \"Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike\". A plaque was placed in November 1922 at the Beekman Arms Inn. The sign marked the crossing of the Kings Highway (now called US 9) and the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike.\n\nNY 308 itself was officially made during 1930. The path of the road was changed a bit in the 1960s.\n\n\n", "id": "208327", "title": "New York State Route 308"}

Located at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, it is the largest train station in the world by number of platforms.\n\nThe station was built in 1871 by the New York Central Railroad at a time when there were many long-distance passenger trains in the United States which most people took to move across the country. Back then it was called \"Grand Central Depot\". In 1913 the station was rebuilt and given its current name, \"Grand Central Terminal\", but today many people call it \"Grand Central Station\". In fact, \"Grand Central Station\" is the name of the nearby post office, and of a New York City Subway station underneath. \n\nTrains at Grand Central go to northern suburbs of New York .One of the subway trains from Grand Central goes straight to Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where people can catch buses that go through the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey. With a change of trains, they can go instead to Penn Station, another large train station in Manhattan, which has long-distance Amtrak trains to other big cities in the U.S., and other trains to suburbs in New Jersey.\nGrand Central Station covers an area of 48 acres and has 44 platforms on two levels, with 67 tracks along them: 41 on the upper level and 26 on the lower level. All of them are built underground at the end of a long tunnel under Park Avenue, where trains have to change from diesel to electric power using a third rail to avoid problems with exhaust. These platforms serve commuters traveling on the Metro-North Railroad to Westchester County, New York, Putnam County, New York, and Dutchess County, New York in New York State, and Fairfield County, Connecticut and New Haven County, Connecticut in the state of Connecticut. By December 2022, the Long Island Rail Road will be extended to a new station at Grand Central, below the existing platforms. Once this happens, Grand Central will have a total of 75 tracks and 48 platforms.\n", "id": "208351", "title": "Grand Central Terminal"}

During those colonial times, some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time.\n\nIn 1927, the Dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them; the new town was given the name of Pedernales and its first administrator was Sócrates Nolasco who later became a well-known writer.\n\nThe town became, in 1938, a municipal district (an administrative division of a municipality in the Dominican Republic) of Enriquillo, province of Barahona.\n\nWhen the Pedernales province was created in 1957, the town of Pedernales became the capital of the new province.\n\nThe municipality had, in , a total population of 14,590: 7,473 men and 7,117 women. The urban population was of the total population.\n\nThe only rivers in the municipality, and in the province, are the Pedernales river and its tributary Mulito.\n\nSierra de Bahoruco (\"Bahoruco mountain range\") is in the northern half of the municipality; its highest mountain, and the highest mountain of the province, is \"Loma del Toro\", above sea level, in the limits with the Independencia province.\n\nThe municipality has a total area of and has only one municipal district (a subdivision of a municipality): José Francisco Peña Gómez.\n\nThe altitude of the city of Pedernales is above sea level.\n\nThe municipality of Pedernales has the Independencia Province to the north, the Barahona Province to the east, the municipality of Oviedo to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the south and Haiti to the west. The city is at about from the border with Haiti.\n\nPedernales has a subtropical steppe/low-latitude semi-arid hot climate (Köppen-Geiger classification: BSh).\n\nThe average amount of rainfall for the year in the city is .

The warmest month, on average, is August with an average temperature of . The coolest month on average is January, with an average temperature of .\n\nThe municipality of Pedernales has only one municipal district:\n\nBecause Pedernales is on the border, the trade with Haiti is important. But the main economic activity is farming, mainly on the mountains, where coffee and beans are important products. Potato, cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco.\n\nFishing is also an important activity in the province, mainly close to the Beata Island, where lobster, conch and several kind of fishes are caught.\n\nTourism is becoming an important economic activity because there are several beautiful beaches with white sand, like \"Cabo Rojo\" and \"Bahía de las Águilas\". There are two of the largest national parks of the country: the \"Jaragua National Park\" and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco National Park\".\n\nMining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory is another important economic activity in the municipality.\n", "id": "208357", "title": "Pedernales, Dominican Republic"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208412", "text": "Flynn effect\n\nThere is a rise in average IQ scores since the beginning of measurements. It is called the Flynn effect. The rise in most industrialized countries is about three IQ points per decade. James R. Flynn described this phenomenon in 1984.\n\nOthers supported the claims. They found the rise was mostly due to the test scores of those who scored an IQ below 100. The number of those who were classified as \"mentally handicapped\" reduced from year to year. In contrast, the scores of those who got more than 100 did not seem to be affected.\n\nIQ tests are re-normalized every so often to hold the average score for an age group at 100. This gave a first hint to Flynn that the IQ was changing over time. The revised versions are standardized on new samples and scored with respect to those samples only. The only way to compare the difficulty of two versions is to have a group of people take both tests. This confirms IQ gains over time.\n\nThe average rate of rise seems to be around three IQ points per decade. Today, children go to school for a longer time. They have also become more familiar with testing. It might therefore be expected that the biggest gains occur with school-related content, such as vocabulary, arithmetic or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have had small gains and occasional declines over the years. The largest changes appear on general intelligence factor loaded (g-loaded) tests such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, instead. For example, Dutch soldiers gained 21 points in only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.\n\nSome studies focused on the distribution of scores have found that the Flynn effect mainly occurs with lower scores. However, Raven (2000) found that a lot of data must be re-interpreted with respect to the date of birth. Previously, this data had been interpreted to show that many abilities decrease when people get older. This data must now be interpreted to show that many abilities had in fact increased dramatically, as Flynn predicted. On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability. Two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30-year gap. Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that \n\nSome scientists believe these changes are very big. One of them is Ulric Neisser. In 1995 he was the head of a task force of the American Psychological Association, charged with writing a statement on where intelligence research was. He estimates that if American children of 1932 could take an IQ test normed in 1997 their average IQ would have been only about 80. In other words, half of the children in 1932 would be classified as having borderline mental retardation or worse in 1997. Looking at Ravens, Neisser estimates that if you extrapolate beyond the data, which shows a 21 point gain between 1952 and 1982, an even larger gain of 35 IQ points can be argued. Arthur Jensen warns that extrapolating beyond the data leads to results such as an IQ of minus 1000 for Aristotle (even assuming he would have scored 200 in his day).\n\nMost of the time, the effect is associated with IQ rises. A similar effect has been found with increases in semantic and episodic memory.\n", "id": "208412", "title": "Flynn effect"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208418", "text": "Billy Graham\n\nWilliam Franklin Graham, Jr. (born November 7, 1918), better known as Billy Graham, is an American Evangelical Christian minister and evangelist. He is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. He has been a spiritual advisor to several U.S. presidents. Graham has preached in person to more people than anyone else who has ever lived. Until 2002, Graham's lifetime audience with radio and television broadcast was more than two billion people. Graham has met every United States President since Harry S. Truman. He has received many honors including the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nBilly Graham was born on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina. His mother and father Morrow Coffey and William Franklin Graham managed the farm. They were devout Christians and Graham's mother had a big influence on his faith. In 1933 Graham's father forced Graham and his sister Catherine to drink beer until they vomited. This made them hate alcohol for the rest of their lives. The Billy Graham Center says Graham was converted in 1934 during a revival meeting in Charlotte led by local evangelist Mordecai Ham. However, he did not become a member of a local youth group because he was \"too worldly\". After graduating from Sharon High School in May 1936 Graham went to Bob Jones College (now called Bob Jones University).\n\nIn his first year of college, he found both the schoolwork and rules too hard. He almost had to leave school, but Bob Jones, Sr., the founder of the college, said that in doing that, he would throw his life away. He told Graham, \"At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher somewhere out in the sticks... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily.\"\n\nWhile he was at college, Graham would often take a canoe to a little island in the river. On that island he would preach to the birds, alligators, and cypress stumps. In 1937, Graham transferred to the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College of Florida) where the Florida College in Temple Terrace, Florida now stands. Graham later transferred to Wheaton College and in 1943, graduated from Wheaton in Illinois with a degree in anthropology. While he was at Wheaton College, Graham decided to take the Bible as the perfect Word of God. He accepted this as truth at the Forest Home Christian camp (now called \"Forest Home Ministries\"), southeast of the Big Bear area in Southern California. A memorial is there showing where Graham first made this choice.\n\nIn 1946, Graham married a girl who was in a class with him, Ruth Bell. Her parents were Presbyterian missionaries in China. Her father, L. Nelson Bell, worked as a surgeon there. When talking about Bell, Graham said \"She looked at me and our eyes met and I felt that she was definitely the woman I wanted to marry.\" Ruth said that he wanted to please God more than any man she had ever met. They married two months after they graduated from college. After marriage, they lived in a log cabin that she had made. Ruth died on June 14, 2007, at age 87. They had five children together: Virginia (Gigi) Graham Foreman; Anne Graham Lotz; Ruth Dienert; Franklin Graham, and Ned Graham. They also have 19 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.\n\nGraham became a Southern Baptist minister in 1939. Then he took over and organized financing of the radio program \"Songs in the Night\". Afterwards, he made the baritone, George Beverly Shea director of music in his ministry. The program went well, but Graham left it in 1945. He wished to be a chaplain in the armed forces, but after trying to get in, he came down with mumps, so he had to not enlist. After some time, he recovered in Florida. Then he started Youth for Christ with evangelist Charles Templeton. He traveled all through the United States and Europe as an evangelist.\n\nGraham held many revival meetings in Los Angeles in 1949. These revivals are thought to be the time when Graham became a national religious figure. This is because he got help from the powerful newspaper man William Randolph Hearst. Many people believe that Hearst liked Graham for his love of his country. It is also believed that he may have thought that Graham could help with his conservative, anti-communist views. Hearst sent a telegram to his newspaper editors reading \"Puff Graham\" during Billy Graham's late 1949 Los Angeles crusade. Therefore, one could read much more about Graham now in Hearst's newspaper chain and national magazines. That meant that his crusade event could run for eight full weeks — five weeks longer than planned. Henry Luce put Graham on the cover of \"Time magazine\" in 1954.\n\nGraham had missions in both London and the Madison Square Garden in 1957. The London mission lasted 12 weeks and the New York mission was about 16 weeks. He also led his first crusade in Australia in 1959.\n\nGraham was the president of Northwestern College in Minnesota from 1948 to 1952. He began many organizations, such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. He also spoke against racial segregation during the 1960s. Graham did not want to speak to segregated auditoriums. He even once tore down ropes that had been put up to split the audience. Graham paid bail money to get Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. out of jail. That was during the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement. He asked King to join him in the pulpit at the revival meeting at New York City in 1957. During that 16-week tour, he was heard by many people, who came to hear him at Madison Square Garden, Yankee Stadium and the Times Square. Because they became good friends, Graham was one of the few white people King let call him by his birth name \"Michael\".\n\nDuring the Cold War, Graham was the first evangelist to speak behind the Iron Curtain. During the Apartheid times, Graham would not go to South Africa until the government let all people sit together. He finally preached his first crusade there in 1973, during which he taught that apartheid was not right.\n\nGraham went to China, where his wife Ruth was born. He also appeared in North Korea in 1992. On September 14, 2001, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Graham led prayer at the Washington National Cathedral. President George W. Bush went to this service. On June 24, 2005, he began what he said would be his last North American crusade. On the weekend of March 11 and March 12, 2006 Billy Graham held the \"Festival of Hope\". It was held in New Orleans, which was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.\n\nGraham said that he had to retire because of his failing health. He has had Parkinson's disease for about 15 years, as well as many other problems. In August 2005, though weak, he used a walker to go to at the start of his library in Charlotte, North Carolina. On August 18, 2007, Graham, aged 88, was treated for intestinal bleeding.\n\nBilly Graham has preached Christianity to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories. Graham has also preached to hundreds of millions more through television, videos, movie, and webcasts. He has been to over 41 evangelistic crusades since 1948. He began this ministry in 1947, and kept doing it until recently. He would often use a big area, such as a stadium, park, or a large street to speak at. Groups of up to 5,000 people would often sing in choir at his meetings. Graham would preach the gospel and then invite people to come forward. In 1992, one-quarter of the 155,000 in his Moscow audience came for Salvation upon his request.\n\nIn politics, Graham was a member of the Democratic Party, but changed to Republican during the presidency of his friend Richard Nixon. He is no party member, because he says that Jesus did not have a political party. Though he does not support people running on politics in general, he has given his support in some cases over the years.\n\nGraham has met every United States President since Harry Truman. He became close friends with Vice-President Richard Nixon while on a golf course. Dwight D. Eisenhower asked to see Graham while on his deathbed. Graham also worked with Lyndon B. Johnson, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, the Bush family, and Barack Obama when he visited Rev. Graham at his home in Montreat, North Carolina where they “had a private prayer.”\n\nGraham played golf with John F. Kennedy, even though Kennedy was a Roman Catholic. Graham spent the last night of Johnson's presidency in the White House. He was also there for the first night of Nixon's. Nixon appeared at one of Graham's revivals in East Tennessee in 1970. It had one of the biggest crowds ever to gather in Tennessee. However, their friendship got weaker because Graham did not approve of Nixon's post-Watergate behavior. They became better friends again. Graham said at that time, \"I'm out of politics.\"\n\nWhen Graham went to the hospital in 1976, three Presidents called in one day to wish him well: former President Nixon, President Ford, and President-Elect Carter. He was at the start of Reagan's presidency, and gave the speech at George H.W. Bush's presidency. Bill Clinton went to one of Graham's New York revivals in 2005. He also said that he had gone to Graham's revival as a boy in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1959.\n\nGraham has spoken at many funerals over the years, but he was unable to do Reagan's on June 11, 2004, because of recent hip surgery. Graham had been Reagan's first choice. Bad health also kept Graham from doing the funeral of President Gerald R. Ford in Washington D.C., on January 2, 2007.\n\nGraham spoke against communism. He was in favor of the U.S. Cold War policy, including the Vietnam War. However, in a 1999 speech, he talked about his relationship with the late North Korean dictator Kim Il-Sung. He said that he was a \"different kind of communist\" and \"one of the great fighters for freedom in his country against the Japanese.\" Graham went on to say that even though he had never met Kim's son and former North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, he had \"exchanged gifts with him.\" Graham has given a globe covered with doves to the \"North Korean Friendship Museum\".\n\nIn 1994, the people read in the diaries of H. R. Haldeman that Graham had talked with President Nixon about \"Jewish domination of the media\". (H. R. Haldeman worked with Richard Nixon at the White House). Because what Haldeman had written was different from things that Graham usually said in public, most Jewish groups did not really believe it. Graham released a statement that he never spoke \"publicly or privately about the Jewish people, including conversations with President Nixon, except in the most positive terms.\" He said, \"Those are not my words.\" In 2002, however, \"Richard Nixon tapes\" showed that Graham had talked about it, in the 1970s. This was like Haldeman had written. On the tapes, Graham agreed with Nixon that Jews had control over the American media. He called it a \"stranglehold\" in 1972. Graham said \"This stranglehold has got to be broken or the country's going down the drain.\" When the videotapes were released, Graham said he was sorry for his remarks, saying, \"although I have no memory of the occasion, I deeply regret comments I apparently made ... They do not reflect my views, and I sincerely apologize for any offense caused by the remarks.\" He also said that \"If it wasn't on tape, I would not have believed it. I guess I was trying to please... I went to a meeting with Jewish leaders and I told them I would crawl to them to ask their forgiveness.\"\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Graham appeared many times on \"Gallup's list of most admired people\". The United States Postal Service has said that he is one of the few Americans, along with the current President, who can get mail that simply says his name and country: \"Billy Graham, America\". He has received the \"Congressional Gold Medal\" from the United States Congress and the \"Presidential Medal of Freedom\" from Reagan, America's highest civilian honors. President Bill Clinton and former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole gave Graham the \"Congressional Gold Medal\" at a ceremony in Washington D.C., in 1996. The George Washington Carver Memorial Institute has honoured his work to help make better relationships between people of different races.\n\nIn 1971, Graham's hometown of \"Charlotte\" held a \"Billy Graham Day\", to which President Richard Nixon came. On May 30, 1999, Graham was invited to speak right before the Indianapolis 500. On May 31, 2007, the $27 million \"Billy Graham Library\" was officially started in Charlotte. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton came. In 1990, the band \"The Swirling Eddies\" gave homage to Graham with its song \"Billy Graham\" on the album \"Outdoor Elvis\".\n\nGraham got the \"Big Brother of the Year Award\" for his work on behalf of children. He also got the \"Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion\" and the \"Sylvanus Thayer Award\" for his commitment to \"Duty, Honor, and Country.\" The \"Billy Graham Children's Health Center\" in Asheville is named after him. There is a special chair named after him at the Southern Baptist Samford University; the \"Billy Graham Chair of Evangelism and Church Growth.\"\n\n", "id": "208418", "title": "Billy Graham"}

It was the common sport of championship competition until faster-playing games like nine-ball and to a lesser extent eight-ball became more popular. This is the classic game from the history of pool.\nThe game was especially popular in the United States, and was the subject of the classic 1961 film \"The Hustler\".\n\nIn straight pool, the person shooting may attempt to pocket any ball on the table. The aim of the game is to reach a set number of points. The amount of points needed to win is agreed to before the game. One point is scored for each ball pocketed legally (that is, without a foul). A typical game might require a player to score 100 points. This means that at least 100 balls must be pocketed to win. In professional competition, straight pool is usually played to 150 points. Straight pool is a call-pocket game. This means that the player must call what pocket they mean to sink the ball into on every shot. It does not matter how balls reach the pocket. As long as no foul is involved, and the balls goes into the pocket that is called, a point is scored.\n\nStraight pool is well known in the United States, Europe, Japan and the Philippines, but the game has become more obscure elsewhere. Probably the all-time greatest player (by professional statistics), Willie Mosconi, holds the game's record high run. Here is what he said:\n\nIn the first rack in straight pool (when you place all the balls together before the break), the fifteen object balls (the colored balls) are racked in a triangular frame, usually made from aluminum, wooden, or plastic. The center of the ball at the top of the rack is placed over the a spot on the table called the foot spot. Traditionally, the 1 ball is placed at the rack's right corner, and the 5 ball is placed at the rack's left corner. Other balls are placed randomly. All the balls must touch their neighbors. However, it is considered a courtesy by some players to place a striped ball at the front of the rack. This is because the break is very important and it is believed that a striped ball is easier to hit very precisely.\n\nIn most pool games, pocketing a ball and spreading the balls is the aim on the break. Straight pool is different. In it, the goal on the first break shot is to leave the opponent with a \"safety\". A safety means a situation where they opponent has no good shot. The reason for this is because the call-pocket rule—the rule discussed earlier requiring the player to call the ball they intend to pocket—\"includes\" the break shot. For that reason, if you break the balls hard, and even if you pocket many balls, you will not be able to go again unless you called one of those balls in a pocket and it goes into that pocket.\n\nTo perform a legal break, either a ball must be pocketed in a called pocket or the cue ball and at least two additional colored balls must touch rails. If you do not succeed at one of these two options, the shot is a foul. A foul on the first break results in a special penalty of a loss of 2 points. In addition, the opponent has the choice of either accepting the table as it was left, or of having the balls re-racked and requiring the person who fouled on the break to repeat it. \n\nAll other fouls during the game have a penalty of a one point deduction. This includes fouling on an \"intragame\" rack (a rack after the first rack, which are discussed later). However, a third foul \"in a row\" at any time in a straight pool game results in a loss of 15 points. When applying this rule, a foul on the initial break, though it is a loss of two points, is not counted as two fouls. The 15 point deduction is in addition to the one point loss for each foul. Thus, the first two fouls are a loss of one point each, and the third foul in a row is a loss of 16 points: 1 point for the foul, and 15 points for it being the third foul in a row.\n\n\"Intragame racks\" refers to all racks after the first rack. As noted previously, straight pool is played to a specific number of points, normally far more than the 15 total points that can be made in the first rack. For this reason, multiple intragame racks are necessary. Intragame racking employs a separate set of rules from those in place at the game's start on the first rack.\n\nTo reach the point in time when an intragame rack is needed, the balls are played until only the cue ball and only one object ball remain on the table's surface. At that time, if neither the cue ball or the fifteenth object ball remains in the rack area (or is interfering with racking in the rack area) the fourteen pocketed object balls are racked with no ball placed at the top of the rack, and the rack is placed so that \"if the top ball were in the rack\", its center would be placed over the table's foot spot. Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested, and the fifteenth, non-racked object ball from where it rested prior to racking. \n\nThe name \"14.1 continuous\" is named after this racking method. That is, that fourteen (14) racked object balls and one (.1) separate colored ball are left at the end of each intragame rack. The shooter will then normally try to pocket the unracked fifteenth colored ball, and at the same time have the cue ball smash into the fourteen racked balls, spreading them so that later shots are available, and the player continue at the table.\n\nA number of rules detail what must be done when one or both of the cue ball and fifteenth object ball are either in the rack area at the time an intragame rack is neeeded, or are so close to the intragame racking area, that the racking of the 14 balls cannot be done without moving one of them. The rules also vary depending on whether the cue ball or fifteenth object ball are resting on the table's head spot. These rules are shown on the following chart. Note that in the chart the use of the word kitchen refers to the area behind the table's head string.\n\n", "id": "208425", "title": "Straight pool"}

It is the common factor in intelligence tests. It is the result of measuring intelligence in different ways. \n\nCharles Spearman, an early statistician and psychologist, found that school children's grades across unrelated subjects were strongly related to each other. That is to say, children who were good at one area (such as reading) were also good in another area (such as math). He then proposed that these relationships reflected the influence of a dominant factor, which he called \"g\" for \"general\" intelligence. He developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors. The first is the factor specific to an individual mental task: the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another. The second is \"g\", a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks.\n\nAfter 120 years of cognitive testing, \"g\"s central role is still a meaningful measure. Other models have also been proposed, and there is significant controversy about \"g\" and its alternatives.\n", "id": "208428", "title": "General intelligence factor"}

However, he has became one of the world’s finest singers of German song (Lieder) and he also sings a wide variety of styles including Baroque music, opera and jazz.\n\nQuasthoff was born in Hildesheim, Germany. His mother had been taking the drug thalidomide during the pregnancy and this resulted in Thomas being born with physical handicaps. He has flipper-like hands and no arms, and he has very short legs.\n\nQuasthoff wanted to study music at the conservatory, but he was not allowed to do so because there was a rule that every music student had to play the piano. It was impossible for Quasthoff to play an instrument because of his disability.\n\nQuasthoff decided to study singing privately. After he had graduated from school he went to university to study law. He did not enjoy the subject, and after studying for three years he chose music as a career. At first he worked as a radio announcer. He got some experience in singing oratorio. Then, in 1988, he won the ARD International Music Competition in Munich. Many people, including Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, were very impressed with his singing. He became known as a Lieder singer. He first sang in America in 1995. He won many awards, including the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance in 2000. It was for his performance together with the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter of Mahler’s Des Knaben Wunderhorn. They were accompanied by the Berlin Philharmonic conducted by Claudio Abbado. He won prizes for his singing of songs by Schubert, Brahms and Liszt, and Bach Cantatas. \n\nQuasthoff teaches singing at the Hanns Eisler School of Music in Berlin. He is \"artist in residence\" at the Barbican Hall, London. A series called \"Die Stimme\" (The Voice) was made to celebrate his 50th birthday. It was also the title of his autobiography which was published in 2006.\n\nIn 2006 he married. His wife is a television journalist.

Some do prefer places where there is rotting fruit. The adults may feed on nectar, and may lay their eggs on or near decaying fruit. The details differ greatly from species to species. The largest number of species is in the Hawaiian Islands. Some fruit flies can get drunk if they have a gene called \"Happy Hour\".\n\nOne species of \"Drosophila\" in particular, \"D. melanogaster\", has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The genus has more than 1,500 species, and has varied appearance, behaviour, and breeding habitats.\n\nMales of this genus are known to have the longest sperm cells of any organism on Earth. One species, \"Drosophila bifurca\", has sperm long. The cells are mostly tail, and are delivered to the females in tangled coils. Those \"Drosophila\" species with very long sperms make relatively few sperm cells. \"D. melanogaster\" sperm cells are a more modest 1.8 mm long, although this is still about 300 times longer than a human sperm. \n\nSeveral species in the \"D. melanogaster\" species group are known to mate by traumatic insemination, in which the male pierces the female's abdomen with his penis and injects his sperm through the wound into her abdominal cavity (haemocoel).\n\n\"Drosophila\" vary widely in their reproductive capacity. Those such as \"D. melanogaster\" that breed in large, scarce resources have ovaries that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, and can be laid together in one place. Others, which breed in common but less nutritious places (such as leaves), may only lay one egg each day.\n\nThe eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the front end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on vegetable matter but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying surface of leaves or fruits. Development time varies widely between species (between seven and more than 60 days) and depends on factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding.\n\n", "id": "208577", "title": "Drosophila"}

It was a \"panel\" game show, which means that it had, in addition to a host and guests, a group of people who together acted as judges. The show was created by comedy writers Allan Sherman and Howard Merrill. It was related to Goodson-Todman's other panel show, \"What's My Line?\". The first episode of the show aired on June 19, 1952 and ran until April 3, 1967. The first version of the show was in black and white. It switched to color in 1966. \n\nThe show was canceled in 1967 and then brought back for the 1972-1973 season in once-a-week and again from June 15 to July 6, 1976, for a summer run. Another production ran on the Oxygen cable channel in a daily version, airing from 2000 through 2003. GSN ran a revival from April 17 to June 9, 2006 with an all-gay panel. In October 2006, GSN decided not to renew the show for a second season, although reruns remained on its schedule for some time afterward.\n\nThe show was first hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore. After several months of an panel that kept changing, the show settled down to include game show host Bill Cullen, comedian Henry Morgan, TV hostess Faye Emerson, and actress Jayne Meadows. In 1958, Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by actress Betsy Palmer. The following year, Meadows moved to the West Coast to live with her husband Steve Allen and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson. Sometimes, guest hosts substituted for Moore, including panelists Morgan and Palmer. Also, other comedians and celebrities guested for the panel when they were away.\n\nGarry Moore left the show after the 1963-64 season, after his comedy program \"The Garry Moore Show\" was canceled, and he decided to retire from television to travel around the world with his wife. Moore was replaced by Steve Allen on September 21, 1964. Allen also hosted the show during the 1972-1973 revival. Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its short 1976 CBS summer run. The panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson, Henry Morgan, New York-based entertainment critic Pat Collins, and Elaine Joyce.\n\nThe Oxygen channel version of the show was hosted by Stephanie Miller until August 2001. Panelists in the Oxygen version included Jim J. Bullock, Jason Kravits, Amy Yasbeck, and Teri Garr. The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer; the panelists were Billy Bean, Frank DeCaro, Jermaine Taylor, and Suzanne Westenhoefer.\n\nEach episode usually had two contestants. After that, a celebrity guest played. Once in a while, if there was extra time, the celebrity was followed by a third regular guest.\n\nEach round was a guessing game. The panel tried to figure out the contestants' \"secrets\". The idea of a \"secret\" on the show was very broad. Secrets were always intended to be unusual, amazing, embarrassing or . They often were about what happened to a person, owning something, or a job, hobby, success or skill.\n\nOne or more would walk on. The host would tell the name the contestant or ask their name and where they were from. He would then ask them to \"whisper your secret to me, and we'll show it to the folks at home.\" The contestant would then whisper their secret to the host, while the audience and television viewers were shown the secret by writing printed on the television screen. Then the host would give the panel a clue. For example, \"the secret concerns something that happened to [Contestant's Name].\" The host would then choose a panelist to begin asking questions.\n\nWhen the show first started, each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning of a guest. Then this would repeat once. Each 15 seconds that passed without the secret being correctly guessed won the contestant $10. However, a guest could not win more than $80. In mid-1954, they changed to only one question period for each panelist. They changed the money to $20 so that the top prize would stay at $80. Also, the time limit for questions was no longer exact. Instead, a went off to end the questioning, and production staff decided when to use the buzzer. This was partly because the program was shown live (not taped), and this sometimes required the show to be longer or shorter to keep the show running on time. In later times, the panelists were sometimes buzzed when they were too close to the secret, or at a point that would get a laugh.\n\nFollowing the guest's secret being discovered, the host sometimes asked the contestant more about their secret, or, if it made sense, the contestant demonstrated their secret. These demonstrations sometimes included the host, and sometimes one or more of the panelists.\n\nA number of famous people appeared with secrets, including Col. Harland Sanders who founded Kentucky Fried Chicken (\"I started my restaurant with my first Social Security check\"), Philo T. Farnsworth (\"I invented electronic television\"), Pete Best (\"I used to be one of THE BEATLES\"), and an elderly man, Samuel Seymour, who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincoln's assassination (he was 5 years old at the time).\n\nOn each usual episode, a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret. The celebrity usually started the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying \"my name is [Name] and I've Got a Secret!\". Sometimes, though, the celebrity would say \"and this is \"I've Got a Secret\"!\". In the beginning, the celebrities would have a secret. The secrets would sometimes be personal secrets, similar to the other contestants. Other times the secret would be about something they were there to do. The guest part of the show often was really a was to show some new technology or product.\n\nLater in the show, a common thing was for the celebrity to challenge the panel in some other game. This later became the main use of the celebrity part of the show, and they no longer pretended to have a secret. Instead, the celebrity would just come out with a challenge for the panel. Several of these challenges later were the main idea used for other game shows. For example, a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words by what children had said they meant, which became the basis for \"Child's Play\". Or two challenges with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to guess who a celebrity was after being show a photographs of them as a baby and others as the aged, which later was used for the show, \"Face the Music\".\n\n\"I've Got a Secret\" was more informal than its sister show \"What's My Line?\". The panel and host used each other's first names. As noted, the time limit on questioning was removed early in the show', and time limits were set more for entertainment. The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets, though both Morgan and Moore sometimes chose bow ties over straight ties. Until the later years of the series, both Moore, and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air. The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host, usually with a pun on their names.\n\nOnly yes-or-no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel, but this was often relaxed. Unlike on \"What's My Line?\", the host offered hints and suggestions when the panel was quite lost, or when an answer might make them lost. Like on \"What's My Line?\", the panelists were not allowed to try to figure out secrets together, but later in the series, no one bothered the panelists when they whispered ideas to each other.\n\nThe series began in black-and-white, and only in 1966 switched to color. When the show is seen in reruns, though even episodes which were in color are in black and white, as they did not \"record\" the color. Much of the series had a commercial sponsor. The opening of the show would have an advertisement for that company. Signs on the set also promoted the products, and on commercial breaks the product would be advertised. Some sponsors provided samples of their products, which were given to each contestant. Late in the series, sponsorship was stopped.\n\nAn Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 until 1973. It was hosted by Newsreader Don Secombe. Similar to the American version, it had regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee, Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers.\n\nThe format of the 1970s revivals were very similar to the original series. However celebrity secrets were back, as opposed to challenges.\n\nOn the Oxygen revival, the contestant earned $200, and if no one on the panel guessed, they earned a $1,000 prize. Stephanie Miller hosted this version. The show's set was made to look like a fancy city apartment.\n\nOn GSN's revival, each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning, with one conference allowed. Stumping the entire panel won the contestant $1,000 and \"dinner for 2 in Beverly Hills.\" The fine print at the end of the show disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee. Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts. Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show, including piano juggler Dan Menendez. Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay. This was played upon as host, Bill Dwyer, was introduced as \"the straight man to the panel\".\n\nAs with \"What's My Line?\", early episodes from the original series' first season in 1952 appear to have been lost. From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation, most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black-and-white kinescope movies.\n\nGSN concluded its most recent airing of \"I've Got A Secret\"'s run on July 13, 2008 at 3:30 AM (ET), paired with \"What's My Line?\" at 3:00. However, they began their run in mid-2007 with episodes from late 1961 or early 1962. A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired, due to the show's longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes, which remains an existing brand. It is unclear whether this is mandated legally, or simply a choice by GSN. In addition, the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show; this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them.\n\nAll subsequent revivals of \"Secret\" exist in their entirety. GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972-1973 season, the latest being an episode featuring Bob Barker as the celebrity guest, to commemorate his retirement from \"The Price Is Right\" in mid-2007. GSN also occasionally adds reruns of its 2006 revival to the regular schedule.\n\nThe first theme music used on the show from 1952-1961 was \"\"Plink, Plank, Plunk!\"\" by Leroy Anderson (this theme can be heard on the album \"Classic TV Game Show Themes\". However, the theme on the CD was credited to Norman Paris).\n\nThe second theme, used from 1961-1962, was an upbeat arrangement of the \"Theme to \"A Summer Place\"\" by Max Steiner.\n\nThe third theme was used from 1962-1967. It was an upbeat, spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone, composed by the show's musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo. It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts, to which the words \"I've got a secret!\" might be sung by children in a teasing manner.\n\nIn addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted, Steve Allen's composition \"\"This Could Be the Start of Something\"\" was used as the opening theme in 1972. The closing theme to the 1972 version was written by Edd Kalehoff. The theme from the 1976 version with Bill Cullen was used one year later on the ABC game show \"Second Chance\". A remix of that theme was also used in the Australian version of \"Family Feud\".\n\nTim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme, while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyer's 2006 version of the show for GSN.\n\n", "id": "209100", "title": "I've Got a Secret"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209139", "text": "Carrow Road\n\nCarrow Road is a British football stadium in Norwich, England. It is the home of Norwich City Football Club. The stadium is in the centre of the city, near to Norwich railway station and the River Wensum.\nThe stadium is on Carrow Road, and is named after the road. The stadium was built by Norwich City in 1935. Construction took just 82 days. There has been a lot of work done to Carrow Road since 1935. Since 1990 the stadium has been an all-seater. The ground can accommodate 27,244 today and the record attendance is presently 27,091. The record attendance at Carrow Road before it became an all-seater stadium was 43,984 in 1963. The modern Carrow Road site has a club superstore, catering facilities and a Holiday Inn hotel.\n\nNorwich City F.C. played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908. The record attendance at this time was 10,366 in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908. After a disagreement over the rent of the Newmarket Road ground, Norwich City moved to a new home in 1908 - a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as The Nest.\nBy the 1930s, the ground was not big enough for the growing support. Expansion of The Nest was not possible, and there were safety problems with the existing structures. The club began looking for another ground in 1926. Part of the pitch eventually collapsed. The Football Association were not happy with Norwich City’s efforts to repair The Nest. They eventually wrote to the club on 15 May 1935, saying \" The Nest was no longer suitable for large crowds and measures must be taken\".\n\nWith the new season just weeks away, Norwich City were very concerned. About half a mile south of The Nest, they found a new site, the home of the Boulton Paul Aircraft Sports Ground in Carrow Road. On 1 June 1935, the club purchased the ground on a 20-year lease, from its owners Colman's.\n\nThe new stadium took its name from the street. However, the name \"Carrow\" originally referred to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside. Construction began quickly. Ten days after buying the site, work began.\n\nBy 17 August most of the stands and terraces had been completed. Finally, after just 82 days, on 31 August Carrow Road football ground was opened for the Second Division match v West Ham United.\n\nNorwich won the game 4-3. The attendance was 29,779 – at the time, a new record crowd for Norwich home games. The first competitive goal at the ground was scored by Norwich's Doug Lochhead.\n\nAn aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a Colman's Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was next to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising \"a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks\". The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the vice-president of Norwich City. It was constructed in time for the opening of the 1937-38 season. There is a stand named after Barclay in the modern stadium.\n\nAt this time, the ground's capacity was 38,000. The new ground received a royal seal of approval: on 29 October 1938, King George VI watched the home game versus Millwall. This was the first time a ruling monarch had watched a Second Division match.\n\nFloodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance for Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City, and the South Stand (now the Jarrold) was covered \"soon after\".\n\nAfter a disaster at Glasgow Ranger’s Ground, Ibrox in 1971, ground capacities had to be reduced to around 20,000 people. \n\nA two-tier terrace was built at the River End. Soon afterwards, seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands. The damaged stand was eventually demolished completely. In 1987 it was replaced by a new City Stand. Chairman Robert Chase said that \"Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre – the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass\".\n\nAfter a disaster at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground Hillsborough in 1989 and, afterwards, the outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater with the corners being filled. Today, Carrow Road is an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 26,034, with a record attendance for an all-seated crowd of 25,522 for the Premiership match against Manchester United in April 2005.\n\nThe South Stand was replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand, subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand was built in its place. The club installed new electronic screen/scoreboards at either end of the stadium in 2007. Behind the goals, they are full colour, with scope for still and moving images. They were first used in the 5-2 Carling Cup victory over Barnet F.C. in August 2007.\n\nThe current stadium consists of five stands; the Barclay (sponsored by Coral] (the northeastern stand), the River End known as the Norwich and Peterborough Stand (the southwestern stand), the Geoffrey Watling City Stand (the northwestern stand), the Jarrold Stand (the southeastern stand) and the most recent addition, the Aviva Community Stand (the southern stand).\n\nThe previous River End stand (named due to it being close to the River Wensum) was demolished in April 1979. A two-tiered replacement, costing £1.7m, was completed in December 1979. Its name was changed to the Norwich & Peterborough Stand in the 1990s due to a sponsorship deal with the Norwich & Peterborough building society.\n\nThis stand is named after Captain Evelyn Barclay, a former vice-president of the club, who donated the roof costs for the original stand. The Barclay is often incorrectly referred to as the Barclay Stand.\n\nThe original Barclay was built in 1937 and demolished in 1992, when a new two-tier structure, modelled on the River End (now the Norwich & Peterborough Stand) was built at a cost of £2.8m (offset by a £2m grant from the Football Trust).\n\nFloodlights are supported on both corners of the Barclay and the Norwich & Peterborough stands, which are the ends behind the goals.\n\nThe single-tiered Geoffrey Watling City Stand was built following a severe fire on 25 October 1984. The fire was apparently caused by an employee of the club leaving a three-bar electric fire switched on overnight. The City Stand (as it was named at the time) cost £1.7 million to build and was used for the first time on 30 August 1986 when City hosted Southampton. It was formally opened by the Duchess of Kent on 14 February 1987. The stand was renamed in honour of Norwich City president Geoffrey Watling, who died in 2004.\n\nThe stand is the smallest of the four in terms of capacity, but includes the Directors' Box, Press Area, and various other hospitality suites.\n\nWhere The Barclay extends around to meet the Geoffrey Watling City Stand, is the Thorpe Corner infill, \"affectionately dubbed 'The Snakepit' by supporters\", a term that is even sometimes used in official club reports.\n\nThe Jarrold Stand is on the former site of the South Stand, which was named in honour of Sir Arthur South.\n\nThe Jarrold Stand was partially opened for the game against Sheffield United on 31 January 2004, and fully opened for the next home match against West Ham United on 21 February 2004. This was a landmark for the stadium - it represented the final stand of the original ground to be replaced.\n\nThe Jarrold Stand is sponsored by Jarrolds, a local department store. The original 4-year sponsorship deal has now been extended through to 2013. The stand is a cantilever, single-tiered, all-seated stand, that can hold up to 8,000 supporters. The Jarrold Stand is \"unusual in having not one, but three separate television gantries suspended beneath its largely perspex roof.\"\n\nIn 2005, further work was undertaken on the stand and it reopened in 2006. The stand now extends around the Norwich and Peterborough Stand corner of the ground.\n\nAccommodation for visiting supporters is provided in the end of the Jarrold Stand closest to The Barclay. \n\nThe corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich & Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand, which was originally built in 2005 and named after sponsors Norwich Union. It seats up to 1,500 fans and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters.\n\nThe club had two options on how to fill the corner between the Barclay and the Jarrold Stand. The club decided not to fill this corner with seats, as this would lead to away supporters being surrounded by home fans.\n\nIt was therefore decided to complete the ground's corners with a hotel. It was hoped that a hotel could offer greater financial rewards than ticket sales. In 2005, a contract was signed with the Holiday Inn hotel chain in 2005, and construction commenced in 2006. The hotel opened in 2007 and allows customers with pitch-facing rooms to watch matches.\n\nCatering at Carrow Road is provided by Delia's Canary Catering, which is part of Norwich City Football Club PLC. The service is described: \"All menus are made up from Delia Smith's own published recipes (6,000 in all) and as we are situated in an agricultural area we take pride in using the finest ingredients and local seasonal produce.\"\n\nYellows is a \"New York-style diner\" in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand. Earlier restaurants in the same place were called 'Strikers' and 'Scores'.\n\nDelia's Restaurant and Bar is a restaurant in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand.\n\nThe Gunn Club is a catering facility behind The Barclay. With access restricted to members and season-ticket holders, \"The Gunn Club\" offers a slightly more up-market catering experience, available for hire on non-match days. The club offers facilities and features including video screens, appearances by current and former club members and (by popular demand) real ale.\n\nThe 68-page match programme for Norwich City matches costs £3.\n\nThe club have, in the past, stated that they have plans to increase the capacity of the stadium should the club win promotion back to the Premier League, using the increase in funds to finance the expansion. Specifically, these plans include building a second tier on the Jarrold Stand or the Geoffrey Watling City Stand. The club have stated that the Geoffrey Watling stand has foundations designed to support a second tier, and that the roof can be removed and replaced after a second tier is added. At the time the original stand was built the inner ring road ran next to the ground, and any extensions of an upper tier outside the existing footprint of the stand would have caused planning difficulties. Since the road was re-routed in the late 1990s an extension to the stand is less likely to raise planning objections.\n\nCarrow Road has never hosted a match involving the England national football team, but the England national under-21 football team has played at the stadium on three occasions. The first was in 1983 in a UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualifying match against Denmark national under-21 football team, which England won 4-1. The team played another qualifying match in the same tournament at the stadium in 1997, beating Greece national under-21 football team 4-2. This game saw Michael Owen's only ever appearance for the England Under-21 side, before his subsequent rise to fame in the senior national team. As part of their preparations for the 2007 finals of the European Championship tournament, the England Under-21s played Slovakia national under-21 football team in a friendly match at the ground in June 2007. England won 5-0 in front of a crowd of 20,193 people.\n\nGames involving the England Under-19 team and the full England women's national football team have also been played at the stadium. The women's team have played there on two occasions; the first a 1-0 defeat to Nigeria women's national football team in 2002, in front of 8,000 fans, and the second a 1-0 victory over Iceland national women's football team in 2006. The latter game's attendance of 9,616 was the largest crowd that had watched a friendly game involving the women's team.\n\nThe stadium has also occasionally hosted music concerts. Status Quo played a concert there in 1997. Elton John, supported by Lulu, appeared at the venue in 2005, performing what was at the time the largest concert ever to have been staged in Norwich. George Michael gave a performance there on June 12 2007, supported by Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The John and Michael concerts both attracted crowds of over 20,000 people. Andrew Cullen, the director of sales and marketing for the Carrow Road ground, told BBC Radio Norfolk prior to the George Michael performance that he hoped such concerts would become an annual summer event for the venue, if big enough star names could be attracted.\n\n", "id": "209139", "title": "Carrow Road"}

She was born in a village in France called Pibrac, which is about ten miles from Toulouse, France. \n\nShe was born with a disfigured hand and a disease called scrofula. When she was a baby, her mother died. Germaine's father married again, but she was cruel to Germaine. Germaine's stepmother did not want the other children to contract scrofula, so she talked her husband into keeping Germaine away from the house. When she was very young she started to be a shepherdess. At night she slept in the stable or on vine branches in a roof space. In early ages she learned to practice humility and patience. She was not lonely because she had a gift with a sense of presence of God and other spiritual things. Her daily food was bread and water. She loved Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. She went to church every day. When she heard the church bell ring, she fixed her staff on the ground and left the sheep in the care of Jesus while she was in mass. Even though the flock was near a forest filled with wolves, the sheep were never harmed. After heavy rains or the snow melted, it was hard to cross to go to church. Her only book was the Rosary, and she had great devotion to the Angelus. Several times people saw the water make a passageway for Germaine to cross without wetting her cloths. She helped the poor by sharing her bread with them. One day Germaine's father forbade her wife to treat Germaine cruelly, and gave Germaine a place in the house. Germaine begged to be allowed to keep her humbler way of life. Now, when everyone began to realize Germaine's holiness, she died. She had not awoken at her usual hour one early summer morning of 1601, so her father went to look for her. He found her dead on the vine branches. She was 22 years old.

It is in the family Pieridae. In seasons with heavy monsoons, this butterfly is seen in large migrations. These migrations are common in Texas. They are less common in the southwest. It sometimes lives in southern Florida.\n\nThe coloring of the Lyside Sulphur . The upper side of the wings is pale yellow. It usually has a black bar on the top edge of the hind wing (the bottom wing). There is normally a bright yellow patch near the base (where the wing connects to the body) of the fore wing (the top wing). Some individuals also have black borders along the top edges of the fore wing. The underside of the wings varies. They vary from a greenish color to bright yellow to almost white. Greener individuals have a whitish vein in the center of the hind wing. The fore wing has a bright yellow basal patch. The wingspan is 1.5 to 2.38 in. (3.8 to 6 cm.).\n\nSimilar species in the Lyside Sulphur's range include Queen Alexandra's Sulphur (\"Colias alexandra\"), the Cloudless Sulphur (\"Phoebis sennae\"), and the Statira Sulphur (\"Phoebis statira\").\n\nQueen Alexandra's Sulphur has more yellow on the underside of the fore wing.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=209475", "text": "Der Rosenkavalier\n\nDer Rosenkavalier (in English: The Knight of the Rose) is a comic opera by Richard Strauss. The words (libretto) were especially written for the opera by the German poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal.\n\nIt was first performed in Dresden on 26 January 1911 and was an immediate success. It continues to be a very popular opera in opera houses all over the world and has been performed more often than any other German language 20th century opera.\n\nThe story is supposed to be happening in Vienna in the time of the Empress Maria Theresa (mid to late 18th century). The music and the words deliberately show the elegant life of aristocratic society of that time. For example: the title of the opera is about the silver rose which traditionally was sent by a bridegroom to his bride and was brought by a knight (the Knight of the Rose).\n\nAct I takes place in the Marschallin’s bedroom. The Marschallin is an aristocratic lady aged 32. She has a lover, a young boy aged 17 called Octavian. When the opera starts, we first hear an orchestral prologue. The music suggests that the Marschallin and Octavian are making love. Then the curtain opens and we see the two together. They hear a noise and the Marschallin thinks her husband is coming, so Octavian hides. It is not her husband, but her cousin Baron Ochs. Ochs is a very rude man with bad manners. He marches in to the Marschallin’s room although the servants had asked him to wait. Octavian manages to change his clothes and appears dressed as a maid called Mariandel. Ochs thinks “she” is pretty and wants “her” to meet him. Then he tells the Marschallin what he has come for: he wants a young knight to deliver the silver rose to his bride Sophie. He also needs a notary to sign the legal documents of the wedding. Ochs sings about the fun of making love. He wishes he were like Jupiter who was able to disguise himself in many ways.\n\nThe morning levée begins. This means: the ceremony of the Marschallin getting up. Several people come in. They include: an Italian tenor who sings an aria, two Italian people called Valzacchi and Annina, who are always spreading gossip, and a notary. When the notary tells Ochs that he needs to pay a dowry to his bride, not the other way round, Ochs is very angry.\n\nWhen the Marschallin is left alone she sings a song about how she is losing her youthful looks. Octavian returns and cheers her up a bit, but she feels sad when he says goodbye very politely and formally, not even kissing her. The Marschallin sends her little black pageboy to run after him with the silver rose.\n\nThe story continues in the large room of the house of Herr von Faninal, the father of Sophie whom Ochs wants to marry. Sophie is waiting for the silver rose to arrive (the convention of the time says that her father must not be there). Octavian enters and gives her the rose. The music at this moment is very beautiful and very famous. The people in the room are talking, then Baron Ochs enters rudely. Sophie is shocked about his bad manners. Ochs hums his favourite waltz, then goes to the next room to sign a marriage contract. Sophie sinks into Octavian’s arms. When Ochs comes back Octavian tells him Sophie does not want him, but Ochs will not listen. Eventually Ochs takes his sword and starts to fight Octavian, who wounds Ochs slightly. Ochs is furious, but calms down a little after he is given some wine.\n\nOctavian has fallen in love with Sophie, and Sophie with him. He wants to use Valzacchi and Annina to help him with a plan. He writes a note to Ochs, which is supposed to be from the maid Mariandel, asking him to meet her. He gets Annina to take the note to Ochs, who is delighted when he reads it. He sings his favourite waltz.\n\nThe scene is an inn near Vienna. Valzacchi and Annina now work both for Octavian and for Ochs. They prefer working for Octavian because he pays them more money. They are planning tricks on Ochs. \n\nOchs meets Mariandel (Octavian dressed up as the maid again). He tries to get \"her\" drunk, but \"she\" shyly sings “Nein, nein! i’ trink kein Wein.” (“No, no, I don’t drink wine”). Ochs thinks \"she\" looks like Octavian. Then strange figures of people appear at a window. Then Annina comes in and says she is Ochs’s wife whom he has deserted. Then some children come in and say that Ochs is their father. Ochs is very embarrassed when Faninal comes in and says Mariandel is his fiancée. He tells the people he has never seen Faninal before. Then the Marschallin appears and also the police. The evening is a disaster for Ochs. The Marschallin tells the police it is just a joke. She sends Ochs away.\n\nThe Marschallin, Sophie and Octavian sing a beautiful trio (using some of the music from the song “Nein, nein, i’ trink kein Wein”). Octavian is forgiven. He is left alone with Sophie and they sing a duet together, then go off hand in hand. She has left a handkerchief on the floor. The little black pageboy picks it up and runs after them.\n\nThe language used by Hofmannsthal changes according to who is speaking. The members of the nobility speak in very elegant language which is often old-fashioned and always very polite. When good friends speak to one another they often use the familiar (\"du\") (“you” when used between very close friends). For example: Octavian and the Marschallin often use the familiar \"you\" but sometimes use (\"Sie\") when they are being more formal.\n\nBaron Ochs is always showing off and the words he uses show this. When Octavian pretends to be the maid Mariandel he speaks in an Austrian dialect. Valzacchi and Annina also speak in a dialect, but their German is not perfect and often mixed with Italian. \n\nAll this makes it particularly difficult to sing the opera in any other language.\n\nThe New Kobbé Opera book, ed.

He is well known for his skills as a \"slide guitar\" player. He also plays piano, bass and drums.\n\nTaylor was born in Welwyn Garden City. He was raised in Hatfield.\n\nHe formed his first band \"The Gods\" in 1965. He played together with Ken Hensley (later with Uriah Heep). Other musicians were Greg Lake (later with Emerson, Lake and Palmer) and John Glascock. 1966 he left the band and joined John Mayall´s Bluesbreakers. He replaced there Peter Green. In June 1969 the Rolling Stones looked for a new guitarist and they found Mick Taylor. His first gig as band member of the Stones was the concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969 . The concert was in memory of the late Brian Jones.\n\nLike Bill Wyman he was never the show man on stage. Due to Richards drug problem he did a lot of guitar work for the albums. Jagger and Taylor recorded \"Sway\", \"Moonlight Mile\", \"Winter\", \"Till the Next Goodbye\" and \"Time Waits For No One\". But Taylor never earned money for this work. As Richards critizied his guitar playing he decided in December 1974 to leave the Stones.\n\nTaylor's onstage presence with the Rolling Stones is preserved on the album \"Get Yer Ya-Yas Out!\", recorded in New York and Boston in November 1969; in the documentary films \"Stones in the Park\" (released on DVD in 2001), \"Gimme Shelter\" (released in 1970) and \"Cocksucker Blues\" (unreleased); and in the concert film \"\" (shown in cinemas in 1974). Bootleg recordings from the Rolling Stones' tours from 1969 through 1973 also document Taylor's concert performances with the Rolling Stones.\n\nCompared to the Rolling Stones time his solo career was not very successful. After leaving the Stones he formed together with Jack Bruce, Carla Bley and Bruce Gary the Jack Bruce Band. The project failed due to musical differences between Bruce and Taylor. But despite the split Taylor was often guitar player on solo projects of Rolling Stones members. For example he played om Richards album \"Talk is cheap\" from 1988. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Mick Taylor along with the Rolling Stones in 1989.In the early 1990s he played for Bill Wyman´s Rhythm Kings.\n\n\n\nNon-Rolling Stones work with Rolling Stones members:\n\n\n\n\n\nreleased on CD (A& M - Japan, 2002)\nOriginally released by Alpha Music in 1996, this \"Mick Taylor featuring Sasha\" album should have read \"Sasha featuring Mick Taylor\", but the company felt it would sell better under a household name.

He was descended from knights who had participated in the Crusades. One of his ancestors from his father's side of the family had died at the Siege of Antioch.\n\nJelckama was married to a woman by the name of Fokel, the exact year of their marriage is unknown. She survived for longer than her husband but died in 1553. They had two daughters and a son. Their son was named Janco Douwes Jelckama (1514-1587)and their daughters were named Bonga (1516-1575) and Fokel (1517-1546).\n\nGrandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jelckama are known.\nA great-granddaughter who died in 1625 probably ended Jelckama's official bloodline.\n\nTogether with Pier Gerlofs Donia, Jelckama fought against the Saxon warriors that occupied their homeland of Frisia, at the capture of Medemblik, and in the siege of Middelburg castle.\n\nJelckama served as Donia's lieutenant for the first five years. After Donia had died in 1520, Jelckama took over the command of the armies. He had been the commander of the Arumer Black Heap and the main leader of the Frisian rebellion against the House of Habsburg since as early as 1519.\n\nAuthor Wopke Eekhoff described Jelckama as being as sturdy as his giant uncle, who was himself reportedly at least 7 feet tall and once lifted a 1000-pound horse above his head.\nJelckama himself was strong enough to lift a horse over his shoulders high up in the air. His height is documented at 7 feet.\n\nAfter a series of defeats, he and what was left of the Frisian army were captured in 1523 and taken to the city of Leeuwarden in Frisia. There they were executed. The execution took place in public. It took the executioner four blows to sever Jelckama's head from his extremely thick neck.\n\nWith the death of Jelckama and the rebels, the independence of Frisia came to an end.

It was when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000 to 80,000 gathered at a meeting to demand the reform of parliamentary representation.\n\nThe end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in a time of famine and chronic unemployment. This was exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions and the lack of suffrage in northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a demonstration to be addressed by the radical orator Henry Hunt. The Manchester Patriotic Union was a group agitating for parliamentary reform.\n\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest Henry Hunt and several others with him, and to the men. Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn. In the resulting confusion, 15 people were killed and 400 to 700 were injured.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210064", "text": "Rotifer\n\nThe rotifers are a phylum of tiny animals which are common in freshwater environments, such as ponds and puddles. Some rotifers are free swimming, others move by inching along, and some are fixed. A few species live in colonies. \n\nRotifers were first described when early microscopes became available, around 1700. They are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton. Also, many species help decompose organic matter in soil. Rotifers eat fish waste, dead bacteria, and algae. They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size. A rotifer filters 100,000 times its own volume of water per hour. They are used in fish tanks to help clean the water, to prevent clouds of waste matter.\n\nAbout 2200 species of rotifers have been described. They are placed in the phylum Rotifera. This phylum is subdivided into three classes, \"Monogononta\", \"Bdelloidea\", and \"Seisonidea\". The largest group is the Monogononta, with about 1500 species, followed by the Bdelloidea, with about 350 species. There are only two known species of Seisonidea.\n\nFossils of the species \"Habrotrocha angusticollis\" have been found in 6000 year old Pleistocene peat deposits. The oldest known fossil rotifers have been found in Eocene Dominican amber.\n\nThe front has a ring of cilia circling the mouth. This gave the rotifers their old name of \"wheel animalules\". There is a protective \"lorica\" round its body, and a foot. Inside the lorica are the usual organs in miniturised form: a brain, an eye-spot, jaws, stomach, kidneys, urinary bladder.\n\nRotifers have a number of unusual features. Biologists suppose that these peculiarities are adaptations to their small size and the transient (fast changing) nature of its habitats.\n\nRotifers are specialists at living in habitats where water dries up regularly. \n\nThe Monogononta, which have males, produce fertilised 'resting eggs' which can resist desiccation (drought) for long periods. \n\nThe Bdelloids, who have no males, contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water, a process known as \"cryptobiosis\". Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods: the longest well-documented dormancy is nine years. After they have dried, they may be revived by adding water. In this, and several other ways, they are a unique group of animals.\n\nRotifers are hatched with a standard number of cell nuclei, exactly the same number for every rotifer in a species. This is called \"eutely\". No cell division whatsoever takes place during adult life. Not only that, but the number of nuclei in each tissue is constant. Furthermore, most of the nuclei do not have cell walls: rotifer tissue is largely or wholly a syncytium.\n\nThe absence of cell division is probably one reason they are extraordinarily resistant to ionising radiation. Also, repairing DNA is one of the things they are known to do after desiccation.\n\nIn one of the classes, the freshwater Bdelloid rotifers, \"no males have ever been seen\". It is the largest group of wholly parthenogenetic species in the Animalia. \n\nThe females in this group produce eggs by parthenogenesis (virgin birth). In some species these eggs develop into small juveniles before they are released from their parent. The offspring are \"clones\" of their mother. \n\nCytological and molecular genetic studies show that bdelloids evolved from a common ancestor which lost sexual recombination (meiosis and fertilisation) about 100 million years ago. Research has also been done on the implications of parthenogenesis for speciation.\n\nBdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more non-identical copies of each gene. This suggests their asexual reproduction is of long standing. For example, there are four copies of gene \"hsp82\". Each is different and on a different chromosome. This cannot be explaned by normal gene duplication, which produces two or more near-identical genes next to each other. By contrast, in a monogont rotifer, most genes were single-copy. \nThere are genes in bdelloid rotifers that seem to have come from bacteria, fungi, and plants. This suggests they arrived by horizontal gene transfer. The capture and use of exogenous (~foreign) genes seems to be important in bdelloid evolution. The team led by Matthew S. Meselson at Harvard University showed that, despite the lack of sexual reproduction, bdelloid rotifers do engage in genetic (DNA) transfer within a species or clade. The method used is not known at present.\n\nThe Acanthocephala, a group of parasitic worms previously considered to be a separate phylum, have been shown to be modified rotifers. The exact relationship to the normal, freeliving, members of the phylum is not resolved.\n\n", "id": "210064", "title": "Rotifer"}

It was the 19th tropical storm and 12th typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season. The typhoon formed out of a disturbance in a monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei. At first, a tropical storm to the northwest prevented Tip from strengthening, but after it moved further north, the storm was able to gain more strength. After passing near Guam, it strengthened quickly and reached its highest winds of 305 km/h (190 mph) and a worldwide record low barometric pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg) on October 12. At its peak strength, it was also the biggest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 2,220 km (1,380 mi). Tip slowly weakened as it kept moving towards the west-northwest, and later turned to the northeast. Tip made landfall on southern Japan on October 19, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter.\n\nU.S. Air Force Reconnaissance flew into the typhoon on 60 different times, making Tip one of the most closely watched tropical cyclones. Rainfall from the storm breached a wall that was used to stop flooding at a United States Marine Corps training camp in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan. This eventually led to a fire which killed 13 Marines and hurt 68. Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused lots of damage and 42 deaths and shipwrecks left another 44 killed or missing.\n\nThree low pressure areas formed the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands. An area of disturbed weather to the southwest of Guam eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Roger on October 3. Later on the same day, the tropical system which would later become Typhoon Tip formed to the south of Pohnpei. Because Roger was so close, the storm that would become Tip was not able to strengthen much. However, it gradually organized as it moved towards the west. The tropical disturbance moved slowly and and slowly made a loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a circulation center. A bit later, on October 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) called the system Tropical Depression Twenty-Three.\n\nThe tropical depression into Tropical Storm Tip, but it did not organize significantly due to Tropical Storm Roger being so close. After moving slowly for many days, Tip began a steady northwest path on October 8. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone. At first, the storm was expected to continue moving northwestward and hit Guam. However, early on October 9, it turned to the west, passing about 45 km (28 mi) south of the island. Later that day, Tip reached typhoon strength.\nAs a result of certain weather conditions, Typhoon Tip quickly strengthened in the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. Late on October 10, the typhoon reached Category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the next day it became a \"super typhoon\". The central pressure dropped 92 mbar (hPa, 2.71 inHg) from October 9 to 11. During this time, the typhoon became extremely large, reaching a record diameter of 2,220 km (1,380 mi). The typhoon continued to gain strength, and early on October 12, Reconnaissance Aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg). The typhoon had winds of 305 km/h (190 mph) while located about 840 km (520 mi) west-northwest of Guam. At the time, the typhoon's eye was only 15 km (9.3 mi) wide.\n\nAfter hitting its peak strength, Tip weakened to a 230 km/h (145 mph) typhoon and stayed at that intensity for several days as it moved west-northwest. For five days, 55 km/h (35 mph) winds extended over 1,100 km (685 mi) from the center. On October 17, Tip began to weaken and get much smaller. The next day, it curved towards the northeast because of a nearby trough. After passing about 65 km (45 mi) east of Okinawa, it sped up and was then moving at 75 km/h (46 mph). On October 19, Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honshū with winds of about 130 km/h (80 mph). The typhoon continued moving rapidly northeastward through the country, and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honshū. What was left of the cyclone kept moving northeastward and slowly lost strength. It was last observed near Alaska.\n\nThe typhoon produced heavy rain while passing near Guam, including a total of 23.1 cm (9.09 in) an Air Force base. The outer rainbands of Tip dropped moderate rain in the mountains of the Philippines.\n\nHeavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a wall used to stop flooding at Camp Fuji, a training camp for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp during the storm stayed inside of huts near the bottom of a hill. On top of the hill was a fuel farm. The breach caused hoses to be torn from two rubber storage tanks, letting large amounts of fuel flow down the hill. The fuel was ignited by a heater used for warming a hut. This started a large fire which killed 13 Marines, hurt 68 others, and caused damage to the camp. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with 15 huts and several other buildings. Firemen from nearby areas arrived within two hours. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was created for those who lost their lives to the fire.\n\nWhile passing offshore, Typhoon Tip came within 65 km (40 mi) of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72 km/h (44 mph), with gusts to 112 km/h (69 mph). Winds in mainland Japan are not fully known. The typhoon did many millions of dollars in damage to farming and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44 fishermen dead or missing. A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon. Its crew of 46 people was rescued. The rainfall led to over 600 mudslides across the mountains of the country flooded more than 22,000 homes. It is estimated that 42 people died, with another 71 missing and 283 hurt. Around 27 bridges were destroyed by the storm, as well as about 105 dikes. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left without a place to live. Transportation in the country was also affected; 200 trains and 160 domestic airline flights were canceled. Tip was called the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.\n\nTyphoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 1,380 mi (2,220 km). This is almost double the previous record of 700 miles (1,130 km) set by Typhoon Marge in August of 1951. At its largest size, Tip was nearly as big as half of the United States. When Tip was at its peak strength, the temperature inside the eye of was 30° C (86° F), which is high for a tropical cyclone. Also, with 10-minute sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h), Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the list of tropical cyclones by the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\nThe typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the world. It had a minimum a pressure of 870 mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg), which is 6 mbar (hPa, 0.17 inHg) lower than previous record set by Typhoon June in 1975. The records set by Tip still exists, although because Reconnaissance Aircraft missions in the western Pacific Ocean stopped in August 1987, some people think there might be slightly stronger cyclones. Three researchers found that two typhoons, Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992, had higher Dvorak numbers than Tip. They believe that one or both of the two may have been stronger than Typhoon Tip. Also, Cyclone Monica of 2006 was rated at 869 mb by Dvorak classifications, but this is not considered accurate data. Because of this, it is unknown if Tip still has the world record. Despite its record intensity and severe damage, the name Tip was not retired. It was then reused in 1983, 1986, and 1989.\n\n", "id": "210168", "title": "Typhoon Tip"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210191", "text": "Common scold\n\nIn the criminal common law of England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public nuisance. The term was applied to a woman who caused trouble and who disturbed the peace by arguing and fighting with her neighbours all the time. The Latin language name for this type of woman was \"communis rixatrix\". This name's grammar only applies to females. This makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime. \n\nWhen British people first went to the North America, they took this crime with them. \n\nThe crime was often punished by \"ducking\". Ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond. They were then lowered into the water, until they were all in the water. This was done several times. Few people were actually convicted of being a common scold, but it remained a crime listed on the law books of England and Wales until 1967. Because it applied only to women, it was eventually banned in the United States. This was because the U.S. Constitution (the highest law in the U.S.) does not allow people to be treated differently from each other. This comes from a section of the Constitution called the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn the \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", William Blackstone says of this crime:\nLastly, a common scold, \"communis rixatrix\", (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgement is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.——Commentaries on the Laws of England, IV:13.5.8, p. *169 \n\nThe common punishment for being a common scold was forcing the woman found guilty under water over and over. This was done using a piece of furniture called a \"cucking stool\". The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, later was called a \"ducking stool\".\n\nOther writers disagree with Blackstone. They say that the cucking stool and the ducking stool are really two different types of punishment devices. The \"Domesday Book\" mentions the use of a cucking stool in the town of Chester. The stool was also known as \"cathedra stercoris\". This Latin word translates to \"dung chair\". It is thought that the punishment involved letting everyone see the punished woman's buttocks. This type of chair was used to punish not only common scolds, but also people who make beer (brewers) and bakers who sold bad beer or bread. Francois Maximilian Misson, a French traveler and writer, wrote down the way the ducking chair was used in England in the early 1700s:\n\"The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.\"——Francois Maximilian Misson\n\nThe ducking stool was not always tied down to one spot next to a river or pond. Sometimes it had wheels on it. The woman found guilty would be taken through the streets before punishment was done. Another way of ducking was to use a device called a \"tumbrel\". The tubmrel was a chair on two wheels. It had two long shafts on its axles. The tumbrel would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released. This would tip the chair up backwards, ducking the victim.\n\nA scold's bridle was another punishment device. It was known in Scotland as a brank. A scold's bridle was a metal mask that locked around a person's head. For that reason it was sometimes called a \"head cage\". The scold's bridle had a tab that went into the victims mouth to make it difficult to talk. Some people say that common scolds had to wear a scold's bridle to stop them from scolding. Some say they were used only to punish. No legal source known mentions the use of scold's bridals to punish a common scold. However, some less formal sources do tell of scolds being punished with scold's bridles. In the United States, scolds, or people found guilty of similar crimes, were sometimes punished using a cleft stick. A cleft stick was similar to a scold's bride, but they were easier to make. The ducking stool was taken to the U.S. when British people went to live there during colonial times.\n\nA piece of writing mounted on the Fye Bridge in Norwich, England says it marks the place where a \"cucking\" stool had been in place from 1562–1597. It also says that \"strumpets\" (prostitutes) and common scolds were ducked there. In the \"Percy Anecdotes\", published in 1820, the authors state that \"How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear.\" The \"Anecdotes\" also suggest that the ducking stool stopped being used because it did not work well. The text talks about a Mrs. Finch. It says of her that in about 1681, she had been found guilty of being a common scold for a third time. Each time she was found guilty she was ducked. When she was found guilty \"a fourth time\", the King's Bench (a court) did not order her punished by ducking. Instead, they ordered her to pay a money fine and that she be imprisoned until she paid the fine. \n\nThe Percy miscellany also quotes a poem by John Gay (1685–1732), who wrote that:\n\nand also a 1780 poem by Benjamin West, who wrote that:\n\nThese poems do not prove that the punishment took place at the time they were written. However, they do show that ducking had not been forgotten. \n\nIn a 1704 legal case called \"The Queen v. Foxby\", 6 Mod. 11, the lawyer for the person accused of being a scold said that he did not know of any law allowing the ducking of scolds. Lord Chief Justice John Holt (the person trying to have the judge find Foxby guilty) said this was not correct. He said that it was \"better ducking in aTrinity, than a Michaelmas term\", meaning it was better that a person be ducked in summer than in winter. The way he said it, however, suggests that he thought the punishment was an old custom and something of a joke. The last written record of stools being used for ducking involved a Mrs. Ganble at Plymouth in 1808, and one Jenny Pipes from Leominster (a town in Herefordshire) in 1809. In 1817, Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster, was sentenced to be ducked. However, the water in the pond was too low. The authorities instead wheeled her around the town in the ducking chair. \n\nThe common law of England—law made by court precedent, rather than through legislation—was adopted by the United States in its early days. The common law included the offence of being a common scold. In 1829, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania court found American writer and journalist Anne Royall guilty of being a common scold. Royall had objected to a firehouse, built with federal money, being used by a small church for their services. She thought this violated the U.S. Constitution's separation between church and state. The local clergymen campaigned to have her punished as a common scold. Hoping the court would sentence Royall to ducking, sailors at the Navy Yard built a ducking stool. However, the Pennsylvania court ruled that the punishment was not to be used any longer. They instead fined Royall ten dollars. In 1972, in the case of State v. Palendrano, 293 A.2d 747, New Jersey State prosecutors charged a woman with being a common scold for a disturbance she had caused. The New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the law was improper because of it was too vague.\n\nIn England and Wales, the only parts of the United Kingdom where the law was in use, no prosecutions of common scolds have occurred for a long time. The lawyers in Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1962] AC 528, described the offence as \"obsolete\". Section 13(1)(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 did away with it. \n\nThe offence of being a common scold has also become obsolete in the United States because only women could commit it. This was found to violate the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. Many states have laws restricting public profanity, loud noise in public, and disorderly conduct. None of these laws have any punishment similar to those traditionally used for the common scold.\n\n", "id": "210191", "title": "Common scold"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210332", "text": "Tropical Storm Peter (2003)\n\nTropical Storm Peter was a short-lived tropical storm that formed after the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from an extratropical storm, and at first, it was a subtropical cyclone. However, as it moved over warmer waters, it began to gain strength. On December 9, 2003, it became a tropical cyclone. An eye formed within the cyclone, and Peter almost became a hurricane. It reached its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), but wind shear and cooler waters quickly caused Peter to lose strength. \n\nAn extratropical cyclone developed on December 2 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean about 1430 miles (2300 km) southwest of the Azores islands. It moved northwestward, then turned to the north, and developed gale force winds on December 4 after turning to the northeast. Later that day, it turned into a frontal low pressure system. As high pressure existed across the northeast Atlantic Ocean, the storm turned to the southeast. The system turned to the south-southwest on December 7. Later that day, thunderstorms formed around the center, and it is said that the system organized into a subtropical storm late on December 7 while located 835 miles (1340 km) south-southwest of the Azores. The storm moved to the southwest over warmer waters, and the thunderstorms, or convection, around the storm continued to get stronger. The convection became near the center as rainbands developed around the center. Since the storm was gaining more strength, the National Hurricane Center declared the system Tropical Storm Peter on December 9 while located 980 miles (1580 km) northwest of Praia in the Cape Verde islands.\n\nSeveral days before Peter formed, forecasts anticipated the development of the storm. As it became a tropical storm, Peter was moving slowly, so initial forecasts said the storm would quickly die out. However, an eye feature quickly developed, and Peter strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) late on December 9. Although the presence of an eye, along with Dvorak classifications of 75 mph (120 km/h), would usually mean the storm is of hurricane strength, Peter stayed as a strong tropical storm and quickly began to weaken. It moved northward due to a cold front. The combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures quickly weakened the storm. By December 10, Peter became a tropical depression. As the system turned to the northeast, Peter turned into an extratropical storm on December 11. Shortly afterward, it was absorbed by the cold front.\n\nPeter stayed over the open Atlantic Ocean for its entire lifetime. It did not affect land. Because of this, there were no deaths or damages. The storm formed in the month of December, which is rare, since most storms in the Atlantic exist between June and November. Another storm, Odette, also formed in December. This made the 2003 season the first year since 1887 that two storms developed in the month of December. Peter made 2003 the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season (at the time, it was the fifth). The 235 days between the development of the first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, and the of the last storm, Peter, made the 2003 season the longest since 1952. Peter is one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach the \"P\" name since the official naming of hurricanes began in 1950.\n\n\n", "id": "210332", "title": "Tropical Storm Peter (2003)"}

The risks in training a disabled person in diving are no higher than for able bodied people.\n\nInstructors may have to alter some of the techniques and some equipment may also need changing to meet the individual's need. In some cases extra pool and / or open water training may be needed. In some extreme cases even individual lessons may be needed.

His father was a Greek businessman and Rangel was of African, European and Chinese descent. Rangel was raised by his African grandmother in the impoverished suburbs surrounding Lourenco Marques, while he visited his parents in the outlying provinces.\n\nRangel's photography career began during as the early 1940s by developing pictures in a private studio. Interest in taking photographs soon followed. Rangel was hired as the first non-white employee to join the Mozambican newspaper \"Noticias de Tarde\" in 1952, where he worked as a photographer. Rangel moved to \"Noticias de Tarde\" sister publication, \"Notícias\", in 1956.\n\nHe next became the head photographer at the Lourenco Marques daily newspaper, \"A Tribuna\", from 1960 until 1964. Rangel moved to the city of Beira during the mid-1960s. He worked as a photographer for several Beira-based newspapers including \"Diário de Moçambique\", \"Voz Africana\" and \"Notícias da Beira\". He returned to the city of Lourenco Marques during the late 1960s and returned to \"Notícias\". \n\nRangel joined with four other Mozambican journalists in 1970 to found a weekly magazine called \"Tempo\", which in effect acted as the only publication in opposition to Portuguese rule. Additionally, \"Tempo\" was also Mozambique's first full color magazine. Rangel's worked as \"Tempo\"'s main photojournalist, often documenting poverty or Portuguese policies which were perceived as unfair by the publication.\n\nMany of Rangel's colonial era photographs were banned or destroyed by Portuguese government censors, and could not be published or exhibited until Mozambique's independence in 1975. He became a frequent target of the Portuguese secret police, the PIDE.\n\nMozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

He was survived by his Swiss wife, Beatrice. Rangel's funeral, which was held at Maputo City Hall on June 15, 2009, was attended by several dignitaries, including Prime Minister Luisa Diogo. Jazz music was played at the funeral according to his wishes, as Rangel was a fan of jazz. He was buried in the Lhanguene cemetery in Maputo.\n\nPrime Minister Luisa Diogo praised Rangel's life and career at his funeral, noting that Rangel left \"an indelible mark on the history of Mozambique.\" She also praised Rangel's colony era work which was used \"to denounce colonial dictatorship,\" and pointed out that many of Rangel's photographs had been banned until Mozambique's independence.\n\nJoao Costa, the head of the Mozambican Photographic Association (AMF), spoke of Rangel saying, \"the man has died, but his work remains\".\n\nThe movie “Ricardo Rangel – Hot Iron”, the director Licinio de Azevedo is a film designed the Instituto Camões in Luanda as part of the cycle CPLP Film Festival which takes place in the Angolan capital of the 10th day September 16, 2009.\n\nOrganized by the embassies of the CPLP countries accredited in Angola, the cycle includes the display of five films of Portugal, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Mozambique and Angola second source of Embassy of Mozambique in Luanda, contacted by AIM in Lisbon.\nThe film, lasting 52 minutes, is a documentary 80 years of Ricardo Rangel, 60 of which were dedicated to photography, directed by Licinio de Azevedo and co-produced by Camilo de Sousa and Ebano Multimédia.

Unlike land living kangaroos, their legs are not very large compared to their forelimbs (arms), which are strong and end in hooked claws for grasping tree branches. Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos have long tails for balance. These physical traits help them with a mostly tree-living life. They have short, woolly fur, usually reddish-brown in color, a gray-brown face, yellow-colored cheeks and feet; pale stomachs, long, golden-brown tails, and two golden stripes on their backsides. They weigh about 7 kilograms (about 15 pounds).\n\nGoodfellow's tree-kangaroos are slow and on the ground. They move at about the speed a human walks and do not hop well (hopping is something that, by contrast, terrestrial kangaroos are famed for). However, in trees, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are fearless and agile. They climb by wrapping their arms around the trunk of a tree and hopping with their strong back legs. This allows their arms to slide. They have very good jumping ability and can jump from trees to the ground from thirty feet up without hurting themselves.\n\nGoodfellow's tree-kangaroos feed mostly on the leaves of the silkwood tree (\"Flindersia pimenteliana\"). Other foods are part of their diet when available, including different kinds of fruit, cereals, flowers and grasses. They have large stomachs that they use similar to fermentation vats, much the way the stomachs of cows and related herbivores digest food. First the food is softened in one part of their stomach, and then by passing the material back up and chewing it again, they can return it to a second part of their stomach. This is where bacteria in the stomach's various chambers, breaks down the tough fibers of leaves and grasses.\n", "id": "210959", "title": "Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo"}

Wii is a platform game for the Wii, and is the sequel to New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS. The game was first revealed at Nintendo's E3 2009 and was released on November 12, 2009 in Australia, November 15, 2009 in North America, November 20, 2009 in Europe, December 3, 2009 in Japan, and August 7, 2010 in South Korea.\nAlthough \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is a 2D platform video game, some of the characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in \"New Super Mario Bros.\") that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi, or two Toad characters: one blue and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls are similar to those of \"New Super Mario Bros.\", with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. In multiplayer mode, players can play up to four players simultaneously. If a player character loses a life and has at least one life in reserve, he will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees him by touching the bubble or a fire/ice ball (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move his bubble closer to an active player, but cannot free himself). If a player loses a life and does not have any more lives, a Continue must be used to start over with five lives. Players can also encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters bubbles at the same time (whether through death or pressing the A button), the level is lost, and they must restart.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, if one or more players do not keep up with the one in the lead, on some levels, the view will pan out a bit so that the player[s] in the rear will still be in view. If the players still do not catch up, they are then dragged by the edge of the screen, until they move forward faster or lose a life by a fall or other object. If one player enters a pipe, climbs a vine, grabs the flagpole at the end of the stage, etc. without the others, the other players will warp to the same place after a short time, or have a limited amount of time to grab the pole before the course ends. On vertically scrolling courses, being left below the screen results in losing a life. On the world map, Mario (Player 1) controls navigation.\n\nPlayers return to the map screen if they all run out of lives, or if all players lose their lives at the same time, leaving no one to free them. For most levels, there is a midway flag that if touched will return the player to that point after dying and being sent back to the map screen. The stage is completed by getting at least one player to touch the goal at the end, though a bonus is awarded if all players manage to grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. In a few levels, in addition to the normal goal and flag pole, there is an alternative exit leading to a red flag pole. Reaching this goal will open up a new path on the map, leading to new stages on the overworld map and on occasion a warp cannon (which will blast the player off to a later world). The game does not feature online multiplayer. During single player mode, losing a life sends the player back to the map screen.\n\nAlong with the usual Mario series items, as well as the Mini Mushroom from \"New Super Mario Bros.\", new items have been added, including: the Propeller Mushroom, which allows players to fly; the Ice Flower, which allow players to freeze enemies with snowballs; and the Penguin Suit which, on top of the Ice Flower's ability, allows players to slide along the ground and across water as well as have better control on ice and in water. Players are also able to ride on Yoshis, who appear in certain levels and can swallow enemies and flutter in the air.\nAll levels can be accessed via a map screen, and enemies are often roaming it. If the player bumps into one while traveling the map, a \"mini-boss\" fight will be initiated; if successful in the fight, players can earn three extra Super Mushrooms. There are also Toad Houses where players can earn additional lives and items that can be equipped on the map screen. At some points, a Toad will appear trapped in one of the previously completed levels, and the player can choose to rescue him from a block and carry him safely to the end of the stage to earn bonus lives (this can only be done with one player). There are three Star Coins hidden in each course which can be spent on hint movies that show certain secrets, such as the location of a secret goal or how to gain infinite 1-ups. Collecting all the Star Coins within a world unlocks one course from the secret World 9 that can only be played after the main game has been completed.\n\nThe game includes simultaneous multiplayer capability of up to four players. In addition to the main story mode, which can be played in either single-player or multiplayer modes, there are two dedicated multiplayer modes. \"Free-for-All Mode\" ranks players at the end of each course by score, coins, and enemy kills; while the other mode, \"Coin Battle,\" ranks players on the amount of coins collected.\n\nThe game is played either in classic style, with the Wii Remote held horizontally, or in Nunchuk style. The Nunchuk is used for movement. Some actions, such as jumping and attacks, are performed with the buttons, where others, like spinning in midair and picking up other players, are performed by shaking the Wii Remote. Certain areas of levels, such as specific platforms, can also be manipulated by tilting the Wii Remote.\n\nThe game is the first on the Wii to feature \"Super Guide,\" a new system devised by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. During single player mode, if a player dies eight times in a row in any level, a green \"!\" Block appears, allowing a computer-controlled Luigi to show the player a safe path through the level. The player may interrupt the guide at anytime and take control. After Luigi completes it, the player has the option to try the level again, or skip it completely. However, Luigi will not reveal any Star Coin locations or secret exits. A variation of this is used in \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\", where it is called \"Cosmic Guide.\" Another variation is found in \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\", where it is also known as \"Super Guide.\"\n\nOn May 30, 2009 it was announced that two new sequels would be released for the Wii: \"Wii Fit Plus\" (a sequel to \"Wii Fit\") and a new Mario game tentatively called \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" (which it was unknown what the name of the game would be at the time), a sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros\". \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was later officially announced at the 2009 E3 convention and GamesCom in Cologne, Germany. To highlight the uniqueness of the game, Nintendo chose the color of the case to be red instead of the traditional white.\n\nThe game was created in response to Nintendo's head game developer Shigeru Miyamoto's desire to recreate the \"Mario\" series's single-player gameplay experience for multiple players, as he was unable to bring these ideas in previous installments. The Wii's hardware allowed him to display enough enemies and items on the screen at once, and allowed a camera that could dynamically adapt to the players' movements, ensuring they constantly know what is the situation of their character. Miyamoto said Princess Peach was not a playable character because of her dress, since it would require \"special processing and programming to handle how her skirt is handled within the gameplay.\" \n\nThe music for \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was created by Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu. There were additional compositions provided by sound director Kenta Nagata. Koji Kondo was the sound advisor and did not write any new compositions, though some of his creations were rearranged for the game. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Samantha Kelly as the Toads and Princess Peach, Kenny James as Bowser, and Caety Sagoian as Bowser Jr. New voice actors include Lani Minella as Larry Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr., Wendy O. Koopa, and Lemmy Koopa, Dan Falcone as Roy Koopa, and Mike Vaughn as Iggy Koopa and Ludwig von Koopa.\n", "id": "211066", "title": "New Super Mario Bros. Wii"}

A shorthand definition of niche in biology is how an organism makes a living in a place. \n\nHowever, the term has been used in different ways. It is not only a place but a way of life. For example, grazers, insectivores, scavengers and predators can all live their different lifestyles in the same forest. A niche can be occupied by different species in different places even though they 'earn their living' in roughly the same way. Thus the 'bird of prey eating small mammals' niche would in grasslands include the kestrel, but in an oak wood it would be filled by the tawny owl.\n\nThe idea of a niche in natural history is ancient: many writers noticed that animals and plants live in places where they are well adapted to live. The word \"niche\" was first used in biology by naturalist Roswell Johnson, but in 1917 Joseph Grinnell was the first to use it in a research program. Later, he described the niches of a variety of species. Grinnell was the first to offer the \"exclusion principle\" in which only one species could occupy a particular niche at any one time.\n\nScientists who study the interactions between animals and their environment are called ecologists, and their branch of science is called ecology. A niche is a term which describes a position or opportunity into which some organism fits well. Thus, an ecological niche is a place in nature that is filled by an animal or plant because it is well suited to do so. \nWhen a niche is left open, for example by extinction, other organisms may fill that position. \n\nAlso, invasive species of plants and animals in a new land often take over all or part of the niches of native organisms. Non-native species often have consequences for resident species, sometimes including extinction.\n\nThe house sparrow, \"Passer domesticus\", native to Europe and Asia, has been introduced to North and South America and Australia. \n\nIt was introduced deliberately to the U.S.A. in the late 19th century by Eugene Schieffelin. He wanted to introduce to America all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Two of these species were great successes: starlings and house sparrows. He organized a society for the importation of foreign birds, incorporated in Albany.\n", "id": "211132", "title": "Ecological niche"}

They were not allowed to teach, they could not show or sell their art, and some were even forbidden from creating any art at all. \n\n\"Degenerate Art\" was also used as the name for an exhibition put on by the Nazis in Munich in 1937. The exhibition was made up of modern artworks, displayed badly, with text labels making fun of the art. This was meant to make people hate modernism. The show traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria.\n\nWhile modern styles of art were not allowed, the Nazis liked paintings and sculptures that were very traditional and old fashioned. They thought art should glorify Nazi ideas of the \"blood and soil\" values of racial purity, militarism, and obedience. Music was also expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences; movies and plays were censored. The censorship was done by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda.\n", "id": "211140", "title": "Degenerate art"}

The conference was to tell leaders of government departments that dealt with Jews, that Adolf Eichmann had been put in charge of the \"Final Solution to the Jewish question\" (in German: 'die Endlösung der Judenfrage'). They were expected to give the plan their full support. Heydrich presented a plan for removing the Jewish population of Europe and French North Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) to German-occupied areas in eastern Europe. Those people that were fit, would be put to work on road building projects. It was expected that they would be worked to death. The survivors would be executed when the projects were finished. The plan was never carried out as planned, as it was based on the continued German occupation of Polish and Soviet lands. Instead, as the Soviet army gradually pushed back the German lines, most of the Jews of German-occupied Europe were sent to concentration or death camps, or killed where they lived.

The main thing to know is that the islands were part of Gondwana, from which they separated 84 million years (mya) ago. New Zealand has some animals and plants which survive from that time, and birds which flew there much later. The islands are well known for their terrestrial birds, some of which were large species (the moas). For millions of years the islands did not have any native mammalian carnivores, and the moas' only predators were other birds, such as the giant Haast's eagle.\n\nHumans arrived in New Zealand less than 1,300 years ago. At that time the country's only mammals were Batman (which flew there), and robbin and superman (which swam there). This meant that all the ecological niches occupied by mammals in other lands were occupied in New Zealand by either insects or birds. Because of this, the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds, of which only the kiwi, and the kakapo survive. \n\nBecause of the lack of predators, even the bats spend most of their time on the ground. There are also about 60 species of lizard (30 of gecko and 30 of skink), and four species of frog (all rare and endangered). There are two species of tuatara, \"Sphenodon\", the only surviving reptile in its order. These living fossils are reptiles of a type which flourished as long ago as 200 million years. While mapping its genome, it has been discovered that the species has between five and six billion base pairs of DNA sequence. The reptile now lives only on the islands in the Cook Strait and the Bay of Plenty.\n\nHumans brought with them the Polynesian Rat (\"Kiore\") and the dog. Europeans later brought their domesticated animals. Of these, the rats, ferrets, cats, stoats and dogs have all had serious effect on the original New Zealand animals. They have driven many species to extinction. Possums were later introduced from Australia for a fur industry, and deer from Europe as animals to be hunted. Both seriously damaged the forest habitat of many birds.\n\nIn recent years, successful efforts have been made to remove possums, rats, ferrets, and other mammals from many offshore islands, large and small. In some parts of the mainland, mammals are being completely eliminated inside fenced areas to create \"ecological islands\". Examples are the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in Wellington City, from which about a ton of dead possums was removed after the installation of a mammal-proof fence, and the Maungatautari Restoration Project.\n\n", "id": "211180", "title": "Animals of New Zealand"}

It became a full tropical cyclone on October 27. It later reached winds of . The storm had a little effect on the island of Bermuda when it passed to the south. Another storm to the north made Grace turn east. The hurricane combined with the large circulation of the other low pressure system.\n\nGrace began as a low pressure area in the middle of the atmosphere. It formed on October 23 south of Bermuda. Reports from a ship said that it was in the lower atmosphere by October 25. At first, the storm was like a subtropical cyclone. There were not many thunderstorms around its center. (For a storm to gain strength, strong thunderstorms need to build around it.) The system started being called a subtropical storm on October 26. A separate area of clouds near Bermuda slowly became involved with this storm. There started to be thunderstorms near the center of the storm. Because of this, on October 27, the storm became a tropical storm and was named \"Grace\".\n\nGrace continued to get larger. Information from satellites gave measures of the storm's strength. Based on that and reconnaissance reports, Grace was changed to a Category 1 hurricane. That is the lowest level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane moved towards the northwest until an extratropical cyclone formed along a cold front on October 28. This storm quickly became stronger and very large. It eventually caused Grace to turn quickly to the east. Around the same time, Grace began to have an eye. Grace moved faster as it moved east. On October 29, it reached its highest strength. Its winds were at . Its minimum central barometric pressure was 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). That made it a Category 2. The center of the hurricane passed south of Bermuda. Bermuda was not affected much.\n\nHurricane Grace turned northeast later that day. The cold front quickly came and overtook it. After that, it was no longer a tropical system. Grace moved north along the front. It combined with the large storm to the north. By the next day, Grace could not be seen any more.\n\nOn October 27, a tropical storm warning was sent for Bermuda . The next day, the tropical storm warning was made into a hurricane warning. On October 29, the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning. This was changed to a gale warning shortly after. Bermuda had some rain and wind from the storm. The rain reached . However, no deaths or bad damage were reported. A yacht, a type of boat, that was traveling from Bermuda to New York ran into strong winds and seas high off the Virginia coast. The nine people on the boat had to be rescued by Coast Guard helicopters.\n\nBecause of its large size, Grace caused large waves along the East Coast of the United States. These waves reached at least high. No bad property damage occurred. There was minor beach erosion. Carolina Beach, North Carolina lost about of sand.\n\nThe damage from Hurricane Grace was mostly small.

Paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40, inclusive.\n\nThe simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane, CH, a gas at room temperature. Heavier members of the series, such as that of octane, CH, and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature. The solid forms of paraffin, called \"paraffin wax\", are from the heaviest molecules from CH to CH. Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830.\n\nParaffin, or \"paraffin hydrocarbon\", is also the technical name for an alkane in general, but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear, or \"normal\" alkane — whereas branched, or \"iso\"alkanes are also called \"iso\"paraffins. It is distinct from the fuel known in Ireland, Britain and South Africa as \"paraffin oil\" or just \"paraffin\", which is called kerosene in most of the U.S., Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe name is derived from the Latin \"parum\" (= barely) + \"affinis\" with the meaning here of \"lacking affinity\", or \"lacking reactivity\". This is because alkanes, being non-polar and lacking in functional groups, are very unreactive.\n", "id": "211712", "title": "Paraffin"}

The communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\", shortly \"SED\") lost their power and a democratic government was established. The policy of this new government lead finally to German reunification in October 1990.\n\nThe \"Wende\" was known to be very peaceful. The people who were against the SED and communism did not want to use violence, and so these events are also known as the Peaceful Revolution (in German: \"Friedliche Revolution\").\n\nThe \"Wende\" events were part of the fall of Communism all over Eastern Europe, for example in Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Soon there were reforms in that countries. In August 1989, Hungary opened its borders to Austria, and many tourists from East Germany crossed the border and fled to Western countries. \n\nIn September, East Germans were not allowed to go to Hungary any more. Soon, more and more East Germans went to the embassies of West Germany in Warsaw and especially in Prague. Soon there were more than 4,000 people in the Prague embassy. West Germany could reach that East Germany allowed its people to go. On 30 September 1989, the West German Minister of the Exteriour, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, came to Prague and told the East Germans in the embassy's garden that they could go. The traveled to west Germany by trains which went through the GDR. In the first days of October, even more East Germans went to West Germany from Prague.\n\nIn the GDR itself, some oppositional groups were founded, for example the \"Neues Forum\" (\"New Forum\"), the \"Demokratischer Aufbruch\" (\"Democratic Awakening\") or \"Demokratie Jetzt\" (\"Democracy Now\").\n\nSince October 1989, there were lots of demonstrations against the SED and for democracy and human rights. In the city of Leipzig, people met every Monday in a church which is called \"Nikolaikirche\". They prayed for peace and freedom, and after that, they went out and demonstrate. These demonstrations are called \"Montagsdemonstrationen\" (\"Monday Demonstrations\"). \n\nOn 7 October 1989, there was the 40th \"birthday\" of the GDR. The SED held big celebrations and festivals in East Berlin and other cities. At the same time, lots of people protested in the streets, and more than 1,000 of them were arrested. In Plauen, in the south of East Germany, many people met for a demonstration. Two days later, on 9 October, there was the next Monday Demonstration in Leipzig. About 70,000 people went peacefully through the city centre, and the police or the State Security (Stasi) did not do anything to stop them. \n\nOn 18 October, the main leaders of the SED decided that their chairman, Erich Honecker had to resign. Egon Krenz became the new leader of the SED (\"Generalsekretär des Zentralkomitees der SED\", \"General Secretary of the Central Comitee of the SED\") and head of state (\"Staatsratsvorsitzender\", \"Chairman of the State Council\"). He said that he wanted to start a \"Wende\", but the demonstrants still wanted the SED to give up all power.\n\nOn 4 November, there was a very big demonstration on the \"Alexanderplatz\" in East Berlin. More than 400,000 people took part, and the demonstration was shown live on East German television.\n\nThe government of the GDR discussed a new law about travels to West Germany and other countries. In the evening of 9 November 1989, there was a press conference with the press secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, Günter Schabowski. Just before that press conference, Egon Krenz had given Schabowski a sheet of paper about the new travel law. Before the press conference ended, a journalist from Italy asked Schabowski a question about freedom of travel. Schabowski read out his sheet of paper, which said that everyone should be allowed to leave the country and come back whenever he or she wanted. When he was asked when this rule should come into force, Schabowski answered \"at once\" and \"immediately\".\n\nMany people watched this press conference on TV, and the West German mass media reported that the GDR wanted to open the borders \"immediately\". So more and more East Germans went to the Wall to see if this was true. When they saw that the Wall was still closed, they became angrier and angrier. After 23:00, the border was opened at one border checkpoint, at \"Bornholmer Straße\", and soon the other checkpoints followed. In that night lots of people went to West Berlin and back. In the next days and weeks, thousands of people visited West Germany.\n\nOn 13 November 1989, Hans Modrow became the new Minister-President of East Germany. He established a Round Table for political decisions. On the Round Table were members of the SED and its mass organisations, from oppositional groups and from the churches. In cities, towns and villages, there were many other Round Tables established, too.\n\nMany people in the GDR still feared the Ministry of State Security, which was known as the \"Stasi\". Modrow renamed the Ministry into \"Amt für Nationale Sicherheit\" (\"Office of National Security\"; AfN). The AfN started to destroy the documents which they had collected over the years. The oppositional forces wanted the documents to be kept, and so they occupied all the Stasi offices in the country in December 1989 and January 1990. The last was the Stasi headquarters in East Berlin on 15 January 1990.\n\nOn 18 March 1990, there were free elections to the parliament of East Germany, the \"Volkskammer\" (\"People's Chamber\"). These election was won by the \"Allianz für Deutschland\" (\"Alliance for Germany\"), a group of parties which wanted the GDR to be annexed by West Germany. The most importand party of the Alliance was the CDU, and their chairman, Lothar de Maizière, became the new Minister-President of the GDR. The new government started the process of reunification, which finally came to an end on 3 October 1990.\n\n", "id": "211729", "title": "Wende"}

Its obvious black and white-striped pattern is like the pattern of a zebra. The Zebra Swallowtail is the official state butterfly of Tennessee.\n\nThe Zebra Swallowtail has triangle-shaped wings. It has long tails on the hind wings (the bottom wings). It has some black and white markings on its wings. There are some small red and blue markings on the hind wings. There are two seasonal forms. Spring forms are more white. They have small black tails with white tips. Summer forms are more black. They have longer tails with more white in them. The wingspan is 2 2/5 to 3 1/2 inches.\n\nThis species is found in the eastern United States and southeastern Canada.\n\nThis butterfly can be found in a variety of habitats near pawpaw trees. Such habitats include open woodlands, grassy fields, savannas, and southern pine woods.\n\nThe Zebra Swallowtail can be seen from late March to August in the northern part of its range. In the southern part of its range, it can be seen from February to December.\n\nFemales lay their eggs singly on pawpaw leaves. They are sometimes laid on the tree trunks. The egg is pale green. After three days it turns an orange-brown color. It turns dark gray just before hatching. The caterpillars are cannibalistic (this means that two individuals of the same species will eat each other). Young caterpillars are black. Older caterpillars have two different color forms. The more common form is green. It has yellow and white stripes. There is a tricolor (meaning it has three colors) band that is bluish-white, black, and yellow. The more rare form is black with white and orange stripes. The caterpillar has a bad smelling, forked gland called an osmeterium. It is found just behind the head. It will use the osmeterium to scare predators. The osmeterium can pull back inside the head when the caterpillar is not using it. The chrysalis is either green or brown. The chrysalis hibernates.

They teach that without this faith it is impossible to achieve the benefits and realization of meditation. However some basic study is also important. One of the most important books of this tradition is \"The Jewel Ornament of Liberation\" which was written by Gampopa.

Sometimes it is called Sierra de Montecristi, mainly in old books.\n\nIt has a total length of about 200 km, from the coast of the Monte Cristi province to near the Samaná Bay, several kilometres to the east of San Francisco de Macorís. Its maximum width is about 40 km.\n\nIt goes along the northern coast of the Hispaniola island, from northwest to southeast. Only small valleys are between the Atlantic coast and the mountain range. It has an average of 600 metres in elevation.\n\nIn the west, the range ends in a small mountain in a headland; that mountain is \"El Morro\" and is near the city of Monte Cristi. Christopher Columbus saw on 4 January 1493 that mountain and gave it the name of \"Monte Cristo\" or \"Monte Christi\" (in English, Mountain of Christ).\n\nThe highest mountains in this range are to the north of the Valverde and Santiago provinces, in the central part of the range. These mountains are:\n\nOther important mountains are \"El Mogote\" (970 m), north of Moca, and \"Quita Espuela\" (985 m), northeast of San Francisco de Macorís. Quita Espuela is the highest mountain in the eastern part, where the range was called \"Sierra de Macorís\".\n\nThe \"Isabel de Torres\" mountain (799 m) is part of the Cordillera Central even if it is not completely on the range; it is 5 km to the southeast of the city Puerto Plata.\n\nThose rivers with their sources in the Cordillera Septentrional are short. On the southern side or the range, the longest river is Licey, a tributary of the River Camú.\n\nOn the northern side, rivers are longer than those of the southern side and they flow into the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them are Bajabonico, Camú del Norte, Yásica, Boba.\n\nIn the western part of Cordillera Septentrional, there are only small hills and the region is very dry; because of that, only plants of dry regions like cacti grow here.\n\nIn the central and eastern sections of the range, it rains more and there are rainforests in some places, mainly in the eastern part.\n\nIn the natural vegetation of the Cordillera Septentrional, pines do not grow even if they grow in the other main mountain ranges of the island.\n\nThere are only a few small towns in the Cordillera Septentrional; three of them are Altamira, Imbert and Jamao al Norte.\n\nThe western part of the range is too dry to allow any economic activity but in the central and eastern parts, farming is important. The main crops are coffee and cacao. Cattle raising is also very important where the mountains are not too high.\n\nAmber is found in the Cordillera Central, on the mountains north of Tamboril. This amber is used to make jewels.\n", "id": "212097", "title": "Cordillera Septentrional"}

A similar term for short people is midget; however, dwarves and midgets are not the same. Midgets are perfectly proportioned humans, while dwarves have a large head and misshapen limbs and torsos.\n\nDwarfism is often caused by the person inheriting an allele (a mutant gene), which produces a defect in development. Defects caused by genetics are the main kind of congenital defects, and usually cannot be cured. The most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in bone development called \"achondroplasia\", in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body. This accounts for 70% of cases. Extreme shortness, but with body parts of normal proportions, may be caused by growth hormone deficiency, once known as \"pituitary dwarfism\". There are more than 200 other conditions which may cause dwarfism.\nIn the 19th century in the United States, people with dwarfism were a major attraction of many circus sideshows.

There is also a ferry across the bay from St.Kilda on weekends and holidays.\n\nThe first people to live in the Williamstown area were the Yaluki-willam clan of the Kulin people, an Indigenous Australian people. They lived and hunted along the coast from Werribee to Williamstown. The Yalukit-willam were part of the Bunurong, a language group of six clans along the coast from the Werribee River, to the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay and Wilsons Promontory. They ate shell fish, birds, fish, eels, eggs, snakes, kangaroos and possums which were found across their lands. They called Williamstown, \"koort-boork-boork\", (\"She-oak, She-oak, many\") meaning \"many she-oaks\", a native tree. The head of the Yalikut-willam tribe at the time of the arrival of the first white settlers was Benbow. He became a guide to John Batman, the first European to settle in Melbourne.\n\nThe numbers of indigenous people went down quickly after 1835 because of diseases like typhoid. With racism and loss of hunting lands, it was impossible for them to keep up their traditional life style.\n\nThe first European to arrive at Williamstown was Acting-Lieutenant Robbins, who explored Point Gellibrand in 1803. The mouth of the Yarra River was later explored in May and June 1835 by John Batman. He thought that the area now called Melbourne would be a good settlement site. The site of Williamstown he named Port Harwood, after the captain of one of his ships.\n\nIn November 1835, Captain Robson Coltish, of the barque \"Norval\" sailed from Launceston, with a cargo of 500 sheep and 50 Hereford cattle. Captain Coltish chose the area now known as Port Gellibrand, as a goood place to unload his cargo. Within weeks, many ships began making their way across Bass Strait. Because of the sheltered harbour, many people decided to settle in the immediate area.\n\nGovernor Richard Bourke and Captain William Lonsdale visited the new settlement at Port Phillip Bay in 1837. They both thought the main settlement would be at the river mouth. They renamed it William's Town after the king, William IV. It was Melbourne's first harbour and port for the Port Phillip district until the late 19th century.\n\nWilliam’s Town was named after the king and Melbourne was named after the British prime minister Lord Melbourne. This made people believe that William's Town was to be the capital of the new Colony. The first streets of old William’s town were laid out in 1837 with that in mind. But a lack of fresh water at William’s Town meant that it became necessary to change the city centre to the inland site of Melbourne.\n\nThe first land sales took place in 1837. Convicts built a 30 metre stone jetty in 1838. This is where Gem Pier now stands. That same year a ferry service between Melbourne and Williamstown was started. The steamer 'Fire Fly' carried passengers, sheep and cattle from Tasmania. By 1839, Williamstown had a pier and government stores built by convicts. The main part of the town was centred on Nelson Place. About 100 buildings were built, including two hotels, the Ship Inn and the Woolpack. The first cemetery in Victoria was started at Point Gellibrand.\n\nThe first lighthouse, made of wood with an oil-burning light at the top, was built at Point Gellibrand in 1840. In that same year a water police superintendent was appointed to Williamstown (and Williamstown is the present-day home of the Victorian Water Police).\n\nIn 1841 the census said there were about 259 people living in Williamstown. It is believed that there were many more. There were three hotels in Williamstown by 1841 and most of the men worked at the port. Being a busy port, there were numerous lodging houses and a constantly changing population. The years 1842 and 1843 there was an economic recession and Williamstown's population went down.\nIn 1842 the arrival of the ship \"Manilus\" threw the small colony into a frenzy. Forty-five of the ship's 243 passengers had died from yellow fever during the journey from Scotland's shores. The sick were taken to a quickly built quarantine camp. Those that died were buried in a makeshift graveyard.\n\nAlso in 1842, St Mary's School (the oldest continuously operating Catholic school in Victoria) was started in a small timber chapel with a wood shingle roof. Mr. John Wilson was the first teacher/principal. The earliest records show there were six boys and eight girls in July 1844.\n\nIn 1847 Steamboat Pier was built and a permanent customs house was set up. The water police and customs officers remained here until the Melbourne Harbour Trust developed river channels closer to the Melbourne CBD in the 1890s.\n\nA bluestone lighthouse was built in 1849-50 to replace the wooden one. It only operated as a lighthouse until 1860, when a Pile Light was built and anchored off Shelly Beach. It was then used as a time ball tower.\n", "id": "212310", "title": "Williamstown, Victoria"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212314", "text": "Cowboy Jimmy Moore\n\nCowboy Jimmy Moore (September 14, 1910 – November 17, 1999), born James William Moore, was a world famous American pocket billiards (pool) player. He was originally from Troup County, Georgia, and lived for much of his life in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is best known for his skill in the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous).\n\nMoore was an excellent athlete at other sports. He has set many records in billiards. He won the Michigan State Billiard Championship four times. He came in second at the World Championship five times while playing the best in the world such as Willie Mosconi, Irving Crane and Luther Lassiter. He won the United States National Pocket Billiards Championship in 1958, the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship in 1965, and the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition in 1984.\n\nMoore was known for playing in straight pool . He was a feared road player (a player who hustled while traveling across the United States). He was also known for his unusual pool style, which included wearing cowboy clothing, and an unusual way of using his pool cue when he was hitting ball—a technique known as a \"slip stroke\". Moore also worked as a technical adviser for scenes in television and film that showed pool. He did so for the movie \"My Living Doll\", and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\". He was honored by election to the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame, the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nJames William Moore was born on September 14, 1910 on a farm in Troup County, Georgia, just outside the City of Hogansville. He was the son of a Georgia blacksmith, sheriff and streetcar conductor. He began working at a young age to supplement his family's income. He worked at many jobs including as a cotton picker earning 35 cents per 100 pound, managing a fruit stand, and delivering newspapers. His family moved to Detroit when he was 13. There, he found other ways of making money. Moore ran card games and pursued other games of chance. He even pitched pennies. He was very good at gambling games and was a naturally gifted athlete. He was a Triple-A level baseball player in the minor leagues. He once bowled a perfect game, and was a good golfer.\nIn 1928 at 18 years of age, Moore took a job as a pinsetter at Car Barns, a local bowling alley, earning six cents a line. Moore learned fast. For a time he achieved a 233 bowling average. Moore first picked up a cue stick at Car Barns, playing on the single 4 x 8 foot pool table the bowling alley had. According to Moore, he immediately fell in love with the game. Specifically, the game he loved was straight pool (14.1 continuous). This was the main game he competed at during his career. He did, however, play other billiard games. In fact, in later years Moore become U.S. national snooker champion, and came in second at the 1961 First Annual World's One-Pocket Billiards Tournament in Johnston City, Illinois.\n\nStraight pool was the game of championship pocket billiards competition until approximately the 1980s. Then, it was overtaken by \"faster\" games such as nine-ball. In the game, a shooter may attempt to pocket any ball on the table (but the cue ball). The object is to reach a set number of points which is agreed before the game. Professional competition is often played to 150 points. One point is scored for each ball sunk in a pocket that must be called by the player. According to Moore, his high run in the game was 236 ball in a row.\n\nSix months after he first started playing, Moore entered and won the 1929 Michigan State billiard championship. He successfully defended that title in the following three years. During the middle of the Great Depression, however, playing pool for trophies was not a luxury Moore could afford. Instead, he took his game on the road to attempt to make a living gambling.\n\nMoore first partnered with a hustler and exhibition player names Ray St. Laurent. Laurent was a colorful character who sometimes played exhibitions wearing a red cape and mask. He was called \"The Red Devil\" for exhibition events. Laurent helped Moore, but they were not equals on the pool table. One winter evening in Canton, Ohio, St. Laurent was losing badly in a gambling session to Ohioan gambling legend, Don Willis. Willis was known as the \"Cincinnati Kid\". He was considered by many of his peers of the time \"the deadliest player alive\". The wager was 25 cents a ball. This was not a small sum at the time. Moore was providing money for the match. Moore became disgusted by how unevenly matched Laurent was with Willis. Moore told St. Laurent that he could not win and asked him to step aside and let him play. Willis later recalled:\nMoore and Willis became traveling partners after that match. They often traveled on the road with future six-time world champion Luther \"Wimpy\" Lassiter. Because of his skill and well known road partners, Moore's name began to be known in the billiard world. In 1940, the World Pocket Billiards (straight pool) titleholder of that year, Andrew Ponzi, sought out Moore looking for a challenge. At the match arranged, Moore first beat Ponzi out of $80 playing nine-ball. He then beat him at his own game, straight pool. Moore scored 125 points to Ponzi's 82.\n\nAfter Moore's match with Ponzi, he was hired by Ponzi's employer, Sylvester Livingston. Livingston was a man who hosted exhibitions with a lot of top pool talent, including Irving Crane. Crane, like Lassiter, would become a six-time world champion. During 1941, Moore performed 250 exhibitions across the U.S. He earned $5 for matinees, and $7 for evening performances. He lost only one match over the year. During that same time he had straight pool runs of 100 or more points in 24 out of the 250 exhibitions.\n\nBy that time Moore was recognizable for his cowboy characteristics. He customarily wore cowboy boots, a white Stetson hat and a string tie. He kept his hair in a crew-cut, and was rarely seen without a cigar. He was also known for his unusual form of stroke. Moore employed a slip stroke. This is a way of shooting in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re-grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball. Using the slip stroke, Moore was deadly accurate, but could also shoot with great power.\n\nIn 1945, Moore's purchased a home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He would live there for the rest of his life with his wife, Julie Chavez, whom he married in 1949. They had seven children together: sons Jamie, Raymond and Tommy, and daughters Pamela Nathan, Kolma Moore, Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates. Soon after moving to Albuquerque, he became co-owner and operator of the U Cue Billiards Hall in the City. It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore.\n\nThough Moore continued playing on the road—as he would for over 40 years—he began competing and placing in top-tier tournaments. His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner-up finishes that would earn him the nickname \"pool's underpaid prince\" in such publications as Esquire Magazine. The name that stuck with him for life, however, was Cowboy. According to Moore, he became 'Cowboy' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo, but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat.\n\nThe second-place-saga started in 1951 at the two week long, double-elimination, round robin format, World Championship tournament, held that year in Boston. At the competition, Moore was defeated in his last match by Willie Mosconi. His record was seven wins in nine matches, including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Hall-of-Famers, Irving Crane and Arthur \"Babe\" Cranfield.\n\nIn 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition, held once more in Boston, running 93 balls against Lassiter, beating him 150 to 25, but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi, this time sharing second place with Jimmy Caras and Joe Procita. Moore's match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150 to 58 in 19 innings. Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco, but did not place, losing in his last match to Crane, 150-56 in 7 innings.\n\nThe following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship, held that year in Philadelphia. The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA; in its absence being organized by Irving Crane. It was denominated by newspapers, such as \"The New York Times\", as the \"Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship.\" In a career highlight in the penultimate match there, Moore was losing 148 to 8 to Irving Crane. When Crane let him back to the table, Moore ran 142 balls and out. Despite this feat, Moore was dispatched to second place by Lassiter, with a final score of 150 to 95, sharing second place with Crane. The defending champion, Mosconi, did not participate.\n\nMoore's runner-up streak continued in the 1956 World Championship held at Judice's Academy in Brooklyn, New York. He clinched second place, to Willie Mosconi's now almost ubiquitous first, with a 150 to 50 score over Al Coslosky of Philadelphia in 15 innings, a win over Richard Riggie of Baltimore, 150 to 121, with an inspired run of 107 balls, but a loss to Lassiter, 150 to 70 in 7 innings. That same year Moore played Mosconi at a challenge match in Kinston, North Carolina. It was not Moore's day as Mosconi posted a career highlight; a perfect match—150 balls in a row in one inning.\n\nIn all, Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown. He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensinger's Billiards in 1958. The tournament was a challenge match, marathon straight pool race to 3,000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter. It was a tight competition, with Lassiter leading at one point 1,800 to 1,512. Moore battled back and eventually won with a final score of 3,000 to 2,634.\n\nMoore would eventually have ten second-place finishes in world-title competition. Nevertheless, he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play. In fact, later in 1958, the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter, he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two-day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque, with a final score of 500 to 397. Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play. In addition to matches previously mentioned, they vied at Albuquerque's old Chaplin Alley on 1956; at the Highland Bowl in 1958; and later, in matches in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Chicago and Johnston City at the Jansco Brother's Stardust Open, where Moore would win the prize for \"all-around honors\".\n\nIt was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship, seven years after his last first-place finish, that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament. At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City, along the way to first place and the prize of $4,000, Moore defeated: Onofrio Lauri 150 to 117; Joe Balsis 150 to -3; Cisero Murphy 150 to 96; \"Champagne\" Edwin Kelly 150 to 83 in 3 innings; and the ever-present Luther Lassiter, 150 to 41 in 4 innings. The runner up in the tourney was Joe Balsis.\n\nIn addition to competition, Moore served as a technical adviser for billiard-related scenes in television and film, including \"My Living Doll\" starring Julie Newmar and Robert Cummings in 1964, and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\" in 1965.\n\nMoore was inducted into the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame in 1982, the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame in 1994, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He remained competitive in tournament and match play well into his 70s. In 1984, at age 74, Moore won the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition on ESPN. Even in later years he was still deadly on a pool table, running 111 balls three days after his 80th birthday. \"Until the traffic accident I had about a year ago, I was still playing my usual speed\" Moore said in July 1999 at the age of 89. However, Moore's health declined rapidly that same year. He died on November 17, 1999 of natural causes.\n", "id": "212314", "title": "Cowboy Jimmy Moore"}

A minaret is a tower-like structure belonging to a mosque. Its main use is to call the worshippers to prayer, much like a belltower of a Christian church. On 1st May 2007, the Swiss People's Party and the Federal Democratic Union launched a popular referendum. They want to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland. The Swiss people voted in favor of the issue on November 29, 2009. \n\nThere are two disputes that form the basis of the controversy:\n\nThe Swiss Minaret controversy started in the Eastern part of Switerland, in 2005. A Turkish cultural association applied for the permit to build a six metre high tower (a minaret) on the roof of the center where they met. The residents around it did not like the idea. They therefore formed an association to oppose it. The people in this association were biased, they had strong (Christian) religious views. Some of the members of the association were also in the committee that had to assess the building plans. As a matter of course, the plans were rejected. The matter was taken to Court, and the Islamic community lost the case. In 2009, the tower was built despite the previous loss.\n\nThere are other communes where similar scenes happened.\n\nThe two parties (UDC,FDU) tried several motions at the cantonal level to ban minaret-building. This never came to the vote, though, because all cantonal parliaments found the motions unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2007, the parties launched a motion at the federal level.

Others went to Palestine and founded Hakoah Tel Aviv. This led to the relegation into the second class. In the 1937/38 season they were leaders but the occupation of Austria by Germany led to the cancellation of all matches. Like all other Jewish sportsclubs Hakoah Vienna was dissolved during the time of Nazioccupation and lost all their properties.

The population of Gura Humorului was 15,728 as of 2006. The mayor is Marius Ioan Ursaciuc of the National Liberal Party. On May 11, 1899, there was a disastrous fire which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses and businesses were lost in the blaze. It was a World War I battlefield between Austrian and Imperial Russian troops until the Russians were driven out in 1917.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1963 the fossils of prehistoric fish, about 1.90 metres long were discovered in rocks near the town. The fish was an unknown Palaeorhynchus, a kind of mackerel, which lived about 30 million years ago. It was named Palegrhynchus humorensis, after the city. The area was made a special reserve in 1973.\n\nOn October 10, 1941, during World War II, 2945 Jewish men, women and children were sent from Gura Humorului to Transnistria. Most of these people died in the concentration camps. Only about 100 returned to the town after the war, and most of these people then moved to Israel. The former residents have sent money to repair the Jewish cemetery, and the one surviving synagogue.\n\n", "id": "212754", "title": "Gura Humorului"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212824", "text": "Kingsway tramway subway\n\nThe Kingsway tramway subway is a cut-and-cover tunnel in central London. It was built for The London County Council to join two tramway systems called the \"North Side\" and \"South Side\". Used by single deck tramcars only, but an upgrade between 1928 and 1931 meant that double deck trams could use it. The subway was closed in 1952. Part of the subway is now the Strand underpass, but the rest has not been changed very much and still has tram tracks inside it. It is now a Grade II Listed structure.\n\nThe London County Council had two tramway systems called the \"North Side\" and \"South Side\". For a long time they wanted to join the two together. This would allow them to send trams from the \"North Side\" to the Central Repair Depot in Charlton in South East London for overhauls. In 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the Holborn area and rebuild them. This gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway. In 1902, the Council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground (subway). The subway went from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south. From there a line that was not underground would continue over Waterloo Bridge.\n\nHowever, there were legal problems and these delayed the permission that was needed to build the subway and tram route. Permission to build the subway was not given until 1906, and they were still not allowed to build the tram line over the bridge. The tunnel would also only be able to have single-deck trams in it. This was because of a sewer at the northern end of the tunnel and the District Railway at the southern end. When the trams left the subway at the southern end they could turn right along the Embankment to Westminster Bridge or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the Hop Exchange. This latter service was short-lived and the tracks were removed in 1930.\n\nAt the north end the approach near Southampton Row was an open cutting with a 1 in 10 (10%) slope. The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the Fleet sewer. They then rose slightly to enter Holborn tramway station. From here up to Aldwych tramway station the subway was built with a steel roof. Because it was not planned to run a public service south of here at first, the tracks leading towards the Strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits.\n\nThe first public tram through the subway ran on 24 February 1906. It ran from The Angel, Islington to Aldwych. The chairman of the Highways Committee held an opening ceremony. The first journey took 10 minutes to go to Aldwych and 12 minutes to get back. This was also allowing for the horse-drawn vehicles that were using the roads on the overground part of the route. On the 16 November of the same year the routes were extended north from The Angel to Highbury station. The route used special trams built from materials that could not catch fire. Wooden trams, like those used on other routes, were not allowed to go through the subway.\n\nIn the parliamentary session of 1905, plans were submitted for another station at the south end of the tunnel. The station would be underneath Wellington Street. The opening of the new tramway along the Embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster Place to alllow an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo Bridge. A triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade.\n\nThrough services started on 10 April 1908. They ran from Highbury station to Tower Bridge and to Kennington Gate. There was a procession of six cars that went south from the Holborn through to Kennington. They then diverted to Elephant and Castle in order to return through the subway to Angel. The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea. Due to a low bridge this service could only be operated with single-deck vehicles. Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station. Drivers on routes through the tunnel had to have at least two years experience on other services to be considered for these routes.\n\nThe services continued to change for many years, especially when the tram lines over Blackfriars Bridge opened on 14 September 1909. During the 1920s the LCC also realised that for the subway to remain profitable it would need to be able to take double-deck trams. In 1929, it was then decided that the headroom of the tunnel would be increased to . This would be done by raising the roof or deepening the tunnel as appropriate. Work started on 11 September 1929. The work resulted in the replacement of the cast iron tubes with a new steel girder-supported roof. The sewer was also diverted. In some places the trackbed was lowered by . This meant that the walls had to be underpinned with concrete. After the last service ran on 2 February 1930 the tunnel was closed. It did not re-open until 14 February 1930 which was the formal re-opening. Tram number 1931 was used on the new route 31. Public services started on the next day. As well as the whole tunnel being rebuilt, the two tramway stations were as well. Services now ran from Hackney to Wandsworth or Tooting, Leyton to Westminster, Highbury to Waterloo or Norbury and Archway to Kennington.\n\nA weekend service was introduced between Highgate (Archway) and Downham via Brockley. This route closed in 1932. It was long. This made it the longest tram route operated entirely within the County of London.\n\nIn 1937, Waterloo Bridge was re-built. This meant that the side entrance to the tramway had to be moved. A new entrance was built in a position centrally underneath the bridge. This opened on 21 November of that year.\n\nIn 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was formed.They took over the London County Council trams. Soon after this takeover, the LPTB decided to replace all of the trams in London by \"more modern vehicles\". The abandonment programme began in 1935. The trams in the South-West, West, North-West, North and East London were mostly replaced with trolleybuses. This programme carried on quickly until 1940. In 1940, the last tram conversion took place before the Second World War. This left only the South London trams and subway routes 31, 33 and 35 running. The subway routes were the only trams to run into North London during the war.\n\nPrototype Kingsway trolleybus number 1379 was built to test the use of trolleybuses through the subway. The trolleybus had exits on both sides to allow this. However, the tests were unsuccessful. This was because the trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway. They would have had to have used battery power because headroom restrictions made it impossible to use overhead current collection.\n\nIn 1946, it was decided to replace all of London's remaining trams \"as soon as possible\". This time though the replacement would be by diesel buses instead of trolleybuses. The first subway route to be closed was route 31. It closed on 1 October 1950. Routes 33 and 35 were closed at the end of service on Saturday 5 April 1952. The last public services through the subway were 'specials' which ran on the Sunday, shortly after midnight. During the early hours of the next morning all of the remaining trams north of the subway were driven through the subway to the depots south of the Thames.\n\nThe trams in London stopped running on 5 July 1952. After this the tracks on the street were lifted. However, those in the subway mostly remained in place. In 1953 London Transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches. This was in case they were needed for the Coronation. However, proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a movie studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from October 1957.\n\nIn June 1958, the London County Council proposed to use the tunnel for light traffic coming from Waterloo Bridge. This would reduce traffic congestion at its junction with Strand. In April 1962, the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used in this way. Construction began in September of the same year. The subway opened to road traffic as the \"Strand Underpass\" on 21 January 1964.\n\nThe southern section of the abandoned tunnel between the Embankment and the Strand Underpass has been converted into a branch of the Buddha Bar chain of bars and restaurants. This involved the demolition of the pedestrian subways under Waterloo Bridge, and extensive construction in the bridge's undercroft.\n\n", "id": "212824", "title": "Kingsway tramway subway"}

The MacBook Air was the first laptop to implement Apple's precision aluminum unibody enclosure.\n\nThe MacBook Air has been updated four times since the original release. The first revision introduced better performance, a bigger hard drive, and a Mini DisplayPort for peripheral monitors. The second update, introduced with the MacBook Pro series, featured a lower price, better performance, and a longer-lasting battery. It was revised a third time in October 2010 when the outside container was redesigned. At this time Apple began selling another model with a smaller, 11.6-inch (29 cm) screen. The fourth update was released in July 2011.\n\nThe MacBook Air, made for thinness, weighs , was the first MacBook produced using a single piece of aluminum with Apple's unibody technique. The computer has a glossy LED backlit screen and a backlit keyboard, as well as a large trackpad that responds to iPhone-like Multi-Touch gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating. With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the Air's multi-touch trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters.\n\nA hatch that flips down on the right side shows the ports on MacBook Air: a USB port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a stereo earphone jack. The left side of the computer has a MagSafe adapter for power, and there is an iSight webcam and microphone above the screen.\n\nThe MacBook Air was the first compact laptop sold by Apple since the full-featured 12\" PowerBook G4 was stopped in 2006. It was also Apple's first computer with an optional solid-state storage drive. ArsTechnica found \"moderate\" performance improvements of the 64 GB solid-state drive of the first generation Air over the standard 80 GB hard drive in tests. On October 14, 2008, new models were announced boasting improved capacities of 128 GB (solid-state) and 120 GB (hard drive). The Air comes standard with 2 GB non-upgradable RAM. The CPU on the original Air was an Intel Core 2 Duo chip especially designed to be 40 percent the size of the standard Core 2 Duo chip. The current model has a low voltage, small form factor Core 2 Duo \"Penryn\" with 6 MB of cache, running on a 1066 MHz bus. MacBook Air has no user-replaceable parts. The hard drive, memory, and battery are enclosed within the casing, with memory soldered directly to the logicboard. MacBook Air's battery is enclosed within the case but can be replaced using normal screwdrivers, though it is unclear whether this process would void the notebook's warranty. As part of the out-of-warranty service, Apple offers to replace the battery for a fee.\n\nApple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of toxic chemicals like lead, to make it more environmentally friendly. MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring, meets Energy Star Version 5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated EPEAT Gold; its screen is made from arsenic-free glass and does not contain mercury. To reduce the computer's size and weight, several features were sacrificed. It is Apple's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built-in removable media drive. It also omits a FireWire port, Ethernet port, line-in, media card slots, and a Kensington Security Slot.\n\nTo regain the features of an optical drive, users can either use a separately-available external USB SuperDrive, or the bundled Remote Disc software to access the optical drive of another computer. However, this method only allows for disk browsing or software installation; DVD movies or CDs cannot be watched or listened to. The Remote Disc capability is achieved by the computer wirelessly accessing the optical drive of another Mac or Windows PC that has the Remote Disc program installed. It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD. Remote Disc supports netbooting, so MacBook Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer's drive. This feature requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on the remote computer.

Additionally, in the 2008 revision, the hard drive, graphics, front side bus, processor, memory, battery, and port connections were upgraded.\n\nThe MacBook Air was greeted with mixed reception when it was introduced. The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, however, the compromise in features was criticized. The full-sized keyboard, weight of three pounds, thinness, and Multi-Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews, while the limited configuration options, slow speed (in the non-SSD models), non-user replaceable battery, small hard drive, and price were criticized.\n\nDan Ackerman of CNET commented on the original models, \"the design and engineering that went into MacBook Air is extraordinary, but it's certainly a much more specialized product than the standard 13-inch MacBook.\" Ackerman disliked the limited internet connectivity, slow speed, small hard drive, battery, and the price of SSD hard-drive option, however, appreciated the thinness, sturdiness, and the MultiTouch gestures. Macworld's Jason Snell praised the portability, however commented that \"the decision about whether the MacBook Air is a product worth having can be answered by 1 question: How much are you willing to compromise?\"\n\nMacBook Air's launch was accompanied by a television commercial emphasizing its slender design.

Although both these laptops are thinner than MacBook Air's thickest point (0.76 inches/1.94 cm), MacBook Air \"tapers\" from 0.16–0.76 inches (0.4–1.94 cm), leading to some controversy over the \"thinnest\" laptop.\n\nThe Sharp Actius MM10 Muramasas, a thin, tapered notebook, had a minimum height (thickness) of and a maximum height of . It was the thinnest tapered laptop until the release of MacBook Air in 2008. In March 2009, Dell challenged that claim with the release of the Dell Adamo XPS.\n\nThe flip-down hatch on the side of MacBook Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and USB devices, requiring users to purchase an extension cable. Apple has removed the flip-down hatch on the Late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports as on other Macbooks. Since the release of the first-generation product, some MacBook Air users have complained of overheating that caused CPU lockup. The effect can be seen at CPU temperatures as low as and worsens with higher temperatures. Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results: the deactivation of 1 CPU core appears to have been corrected; however, the runaway kernel problem remains for at least some users. The problem is aggravated by system-intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting.\n\n", "id": "212932", "title": "MacBook Air"}

It governed itself (it had autonomy), but was under the overall suzerainty of the British monarch. Amb was ruled by a hereditary prince with the title of Nawab. The Nawab of Amb was the chieftain of the Tanoli tribe of the Hazara. In the Partition of India in 1947, the Nawab gave up the independence the state had previously enjoyed by joining the new country of Pakistan. Amb continued as a distinct state within Pakistan until 1969, when it was merged into the former North-West Frontier Province. The royal status of the Nawab was abolished by the Government of Pakistan in 1972.\n\nThe area in which Amb was located is historically known as Tanawal. This is in the Hazara region in what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The part covered by Amb is called \"Upper Tanawal\", and is now part of Mansehra District. \"Lower Tanawal\" is in the Abbottabad District. The name \"Tanawal\" comes from the name of the tribe that lives there, the Tanoli (or Tanawali). The Tanoli are Muslims. They speak Hindko.\n\nAmb and the area around it have a long history, which goes back to the time of the invasion of the region by Alexander the Great. A settlement called Embolina, located on the Indus River, is mentioned in writings by Arrian and Ptolemy. This is the place from which the Nawabs of Amb took their title.\n\nAmb was once formally known as Mulk e Tanawal (meaning the country of Tanawal). The early history of the region goes back to the centuries before the Mughal Empire. In the early 14th century, the Tanoli or Tanawali tribe arrived here from Central Asia, after coming through Afghanistan. They conquered it and settled here on the banks of the river Indus and a wide area around it, which thus came to be known as Tanawal.\n\nFrom early on, the Tanawal area stayed mostly free from the influence of the Mughals and Sikhs and later had only limited contact with British. The people of Tanawal thus had little or no contact with other places for a long period and remained ignorant and backward. At most times, they would resist outside authority, preferring to be ruled by their own chiefs at a local level. Until the late-18th or early-19th centuries, Tanawal was not one state. It was rather an area where several important Tanoli chiefs had authority over an area of influence. The Hindwal section chiefs remained stronger than the other. In 1772, Mir Haibat Khan, the eldest son of Mir Gul Muhammad Khan, was declared to be the chief of Upper Tanawal. Later, his descendants were made as the Nawabs of Amb under the British Raj, and continued ruling over this territory until 1972.\n\nThe rulers of Amb belonged to the Hindwal branch of the Tanoli. The Tanoli are of Mughal ancestry. The rulers are descendants of a Barlas Turk probably named Ameer Khan Turk but authentic records of the tribe no longer exist beyond the 18th century.\n\nThe Nawabs, or rulers of Amb were:\n\nThe concept of hereditary rulerships was abolished in Pakistan on 1 January 1972. It was done by a change to the constitution. This meant that the Nawab of Amb would no longer be recognised as a ruler. They could also no longer use their old styles and titles.\n\nThe current head of the old/former royal family is Salahuddin Saeed Khan, since 1973.

Bandicoots are protected by law, but the areas they like to live in have been cleared for farming or housing. They are also hunted by dogs, cats and foxes. Rabbits have eaten many of the plants and made it unsuitable for bandicoots. Around Sydney, they listed as an endangered species.\n\nThe long-nosed bandicoot is a small animal, from 20—42.5 cm long with a thin rat like tail, from 7.5—17 cm in length. They weigh between 0.5—1.9kg. They are covered in coarse grey to brown fur, sometimes with a hint of yellow or orange. Their underbelly is a cream color. Being a marsupial the females have a rear opening pouch to carry their young. They have five clawed toes fingers on their front legs.\n\nThe long-nosed bandicoot lives by itself, often chasing away other bandicoots. Their breeding season depends on the region in which they live. The female gives birth to two or three young after a short gestation period of 12 days. The tiny babies, blind and hairless, about 13mm in length, then move to the pouch where they are able to drink milk from the females eight nipples. They leave the pouch at about 54 days. The female is then ready to breed again. they live for between three and five years.\n\nThe long-nosed bandicoot is a nocturnal animal, coming out at night to find and eat insects, beetles, snails, worms, mice, lizards and tree roots. They are able to smell their food to find it. They use their front claws to dig a hole big enough to get their long nose in to find the food. They can be very unpopular in urban areas for digging up gardens. While looking for food they make a shrill high pitched squeak.\n", "id": "213126", "title": "Long-nosed bandicoot"}

These include the Farmers Arms Hotel which was built in 1876, and is now used as a museum. Other buildings are the post office (1890), the old National Bank buildings (1885), the Euroa Hotel (1884) and Blairgowrie House (1890). The first church built in Euroa was the Catholic Church (1867).\n\nThe Euroa court house was built in 1892 at a cost of £1354. It was designed by architect J.T.Kelleher, but many now believe it was the work of A.J.McDonald. The court house was closed in 1989.\n\nSheep farming was a major business, with fine wool Saxon merino sheep being introduced in 1851. Farmers are now making more money from horses.\n\nEuroa is roughly midway between Melbourne and Albury. The area is very flat, although the Strathbogie Ranges about 20 km south east of the town. \n\nEuroa has several retirement villages, one high school, and two primary schools. The Shire of Strabogie is based in Euroa.\n\nThe main road from Melbourne northward is the Hume Highway. A by-pass was built around the town and since then Euroa has been a quiet town with little growth or business. \n\nThe town is located on the main North East railway, and is served by V/Line passenger services.\n\nThe town has an Australian Rules Football team, the \"Euroa Magpies\", competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League. \n\nGolfers play at the course of the Euroa Golf Club on Walters Road.\n\nThree winners of the Victoria Cross for Australia came from the Euroa area:\n\n\n\n", "id": "213129", "title": "Euroa, Victoria"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213216", "text": "Hertha BSC\n\nHertha BSC is a German football club based in Berlin. They started in 1892. Hertha Berlin was one of the founding clubs of the DFB (Deutscher Fußball Bund or German Football Association) in Leipzig in 1900.\n\n\"BFC Hertha 92\" (Berlin Foortbal Club Hertha 92) was formed in 1892. Its name and team colours were taken from a steamship with a blue and white funnel. One of the men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. Hertha is a variation on the name Nerthus, a Germanic fertility goddess.\n\nHertha always played well, but were not financially successful. They won the first Berlin championship final in 1905. Because of money troubles in 1920 Hertha merged with the richer \"Berliner Sport-Club\" to form \"Hertha Berliner Sport Club\". The new team was still successful, but never the best. Hertha BSC was in the German championship final every year from 1926 to 1930, but were only able to win in 1930. Hertha and BSC split in 1930, and Hertha won the championship again in 1931.\n\n\"Hertha\" was Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.\n\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into sixteen top-flight divisions, which saw \"Hertha\" playing in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. The club continued to be successful in their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935, 1937, and 1944. However, they did not do well nationally, and never got past the early rounds of the national championshipships.\n\nAfter World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organisations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. \"Hertha\" restarted at the end of 1945 as \"SG Gesundbrunnen\" (named after a district of northern Berlin) and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin - Gruppe C. The thirty-six teams of the first season of the postwar Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just 12 the next year and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin. By the end of 1949, they had become \"Hertha BSC Berlin\" again.\n\nIn the 1949/50 season the Soviets would not allow \"Hertha\" to play against East German teams, because they had signed some players and a coach who had left the Dresden club \"SG Friedrichstadt\" for West Berlin. A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR-Liga beginning with the 1950-51 season.\n\nThroughout the 1950's there was a rivalry with \"Tennis Borussia Berlin\", but the idea of the two merger between the two clubs in 1958 was rejected.\n\nHertha was a founder of the Bundesliga in 1963 and was Berlin's reigning champion. But Hertha was demoted after the 1964-65 season because the club had tried to bribe players to play in the city after the Berlin Wall had been built, and players did not want to move to the city. To keep a Berlin team in the Bundesliga, \"Tasmania 1900 Berlin\", were promoted instead. Tasmania were the worst side ever in the Bundesliga history. \"Hertha\" returned to the Bundesliga in 1968-69 and became Berlin's favourite side.\n\n\"Hertha\" had to sell the team's former home ground in 1974 when investigations about the match fixing scandal of 1971 showed that the club was 6 million DM (€3 million) in debt.\n\nThe team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success during the 70s but gradually slipped down into the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin where they spent two seasons (1986-87 and 1987-88).\n\nAfter two turns in the Bundesliga (1982-83 and 1990-91) Hertha was immediately relegated after poor performances. \"Hertha\"'s amateur side was more successful, getting to the final of the German Cup in 1993 where they lost 0:1 to Bundesliga side \"Bayer Leverkusen\".\n\nBy 1994 Hertha BSC was 10 million DM (€5 million) in debt. More land had to be sold and a new sponsor and management team were found. By 1997 \"Hertha\" got back into the Bundesliga. The y were the first Berlin club in 10 years to be in the top division. Since then they have generally finished in the top third of the Bundesliga.\n\nMost recently, bright spots for the side have been a continuous string of appearances in international play in the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League beginning in the 1999 season, and the signing of players such as Sebastian Deisler and Brazilian international Marcelinho, named the Bundesliga's player of the year in May of 2005. Hertha has also invested heavily in its own youth football academy, which has produced several players with Bundesliga potential.\n\nThe team was close to relegation in the 2003-04 season, but managed to finished 4th the following season. Hertha only missed out on the Champions League after they were held to a draw on the final day by Hannover 96, which saw Werder Bremen over take them for the spot on the final day. As a thank-you gesture, Werder sent the Hannover squad ninety-six bottles of champagne. In 2005-06 the \"Herthaner\" finished 6th, and qualified for the UEFA Cup by defeating FK Moskva in the Intertoto Cup.\n\n\"Hertha BSC\" plays its matches in Berlin's Olympiastadion. It is biggest stadium in Germany except for \"Borussia Dortmund\"'s Westfalenstadion.\n\nThe Olympiastadion hosts the annual German Cup final and was the site for six matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup as well as the tournament final.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1963, \"Hertha\"'s home ground was the Plumpe in Wedding's Gesundbrunnen district. A new stadium was built there in 1923. \"BSC\" left that site when it joined the Bundesliga in 1963.

It is named after Benoît Mandelbrot, a Polish-French-American mathematician. The Mandelbrot set is important for the chaos theory. The edging of the set shows a self-similarity, which is not perfect because it has deformations. \n\nThe Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation \"z\" = \"z\" + \"c\". In that equation, \"c\" and \"z\" are complex numbers and \"n\" is zero or a positive integer (natural number). Starting with \"z\"=0, c is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of \"z\" never becomes larger than a certain number (that number depends on c), no matter how large \"n\" gets. \n\nMandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979. That was because he had access to IBM's computers. He was able to show how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\". The equation \"z\" = \"z\" + \"c\" was known long before Benoit Mandelbrot used a computer to visualize it.\n\nImages are created by applying the equation to each pixel in an iterative process, using the pixel's position in the image for the number 'c'. 'c' is obtained by mapping the position of the pixel in the image relative to the position of the point on the complex plane.\n\nThe shape of the Mandelbrot Set is represented in black in the image on this page.\n\nFor example, if \"c\" = 1 then the sequence is 0, 1, 2, 5, 26,…, which goes to infinity. Therefore, 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set, and thus is not coloured black.\n\nOn the other hand, if \"c\" is equal to the square root of -1, also known as i, then the sequence is 0, i, (−1 + i), −i, (−1 + i), −i…, which does not go to infinity and so it belongs to the Mandelbrot set. \n\nWhen graphed to show the entire Set, the resultant image is striking, pretty, and quite recognizable.\n\nThere are many variations of the Mandelbrot set, such as Multibrot, Buddhabrot, and Nebulabrot.\n\nMultibrot is a generalization that allows any exponent: \"z\" = \"z\" + \"c\". These sets are called Multibrot sets. The Multibrot set for \"d\" = 2 is the Mandelbrot set.\n", "id": "213304", "title": "Mandelbrot set"}

For example, people may feel euphoric for a short time after orgasm, when in love, or after a very important athletic achievement. Sometimes, people can also feel euphoria during certain religious or spiritual rituals, or while meditating.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213571", "text": "Genetic linkage\n\nGenetic linkage occurs when alleles at different loci do not segregate at random. Mendel's second law is thus broken. \n\nGenes are linked when they are on the same chromosome. They then tend to stay together during meiosis. Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked, due to independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. \n\nThere is some crossing over of DNA during meiosis when the chromosomes segregate. So, alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells. There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apart on the chromosome, as it is more likely that a cross-over will occur between them. The relative distance between two genes can be calculated using the offspring of an organism showing two linked genetic traits. The percentage of offspring where the two traits do not run together is noted. The higher the percentage of offspring showing both traits, the closer on the chromosome the two genes are. \n\nThis was the first technique used for mapping genes on chromosomes. By working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes. This distance is called a \"genetic map unit\" (m.u.), or a \"centimorgan\" and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 is recombinant. A recombinant frequency (RF) of 1 % is equivalent to 1 m.u. A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between a number of traits that are present on the same chromosome, ideally avoiding significant gaps between traits to avoid the possibility of multiple crossovers.\n\n", "id": "213571", "title": "Genetic linkage"}

He was professor at Innsbruck, Austria from 1889–95, then accepted a professorial chair at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Halle, a post he retained until 1921.\n\nRoux's research was based upon the notion of \"Entwicklungsmechanik\" or developmental mechanics. His methodology was to interfere with developing embryos and observe the outcome. Roux's investigations were performed mainly on frogs' eggs to research the earliest structures in amphibian development. His goal was to show Darwinian processes at work on the cellular level.\n\nIn 1888, Roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle. He reported that they grew into half-embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined. This led him to propose his \"mosaic\" theory: after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic, each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design. \n\nAfter a few years Roux's theory was refuted by the studies of his colleague Hans Driesch and later, with more precision, Hans Spemann showed that, as a rule, Driesch's conclusions were correct, but that results like Roux's may be obtained after intervention in certain planes. Despite this early lapse Roux's pioneering mechanical methodology was to prove most fruitful in 20th century biology.\n\nIn a remarkable paper, Roux realised the significance of the linear structure of chromosomes. Their splitting into two equal longitudinal halves assured each daughter cell got the same chromosome complement. Therefore, chromosomes were the bearers of heredity. This was a significant event in cytogenetics.\n\n\n", "id": "213592", "title": "Wilhelm Roux"}

The Dutch Reformed Church held the meeting in order to discuss a very important issue in the Dutch churches that begin with the teachings of Jacobus Arminius and the rise of Arminianism. The first meeting was on November 13, 1618, and the last meeting, which was the 154th, took place on May 9, 1619. \n\nMembers from the Reformed churches in eight different countries were also invited to this meeting. The name \"Dort\" is the English name for the Dutch town of \"Dordrecht\" and is still used as the pronunciation of the name today. This synod, or meeting, is usually called the Synod of Dordt or the Synod of Dordrecht.\n\nThe reason that this meeting was called was to settle an issue that had just been brought up in the Dutch churches after the spread of Arminianism. After Jacob Arminius died, people that believed the same way that he did objected to the Belgic Confession and the teachings of John Calvin and Theodore Beza. Arminius's followers published their problems with the Confession in a paper called The Remonstrance of 1610. The followers of the things listed in this document were called Remonstrants. Calvinists, who followed the teachings of John Calvin, became known as \"Contra-Remonstrants\".\n\nIn \"The Remonstrance\" and some later writing, the Arminians wrote about an alternative to the Calvinist Belgic Confession and mentioned several things that they disagreed with. They taught election on the basis of God knowing who would have faith, a universal atonement, resistible grace and the possibility of walking away from grace. Simon Episopius was the speaker for the 13 members of the Remonstrants who were called to the Synod in 1618.\n\nThe meetings concluded with the views of the Remonstrants being rejected and set out the Reformed doctrine on each of the points. These are sometimes called the Five points of Calvinism and are remembered by the five letters \"TULIP\".\n\n\"The Decision of the Synod of Dort on the Five Main Points of Doctrine in Dispute in the Netherlands\", known as the Canons of Dort, is the reasoning behind the decisions made by the Synod. \n\nThe \"Canons\" are not supposed to be an absolute explanation of the Reformed doctrine, but only explain the five points of doctrine that were being argued over.\n\n\n", "id": "213696", "title": "Synod of Dort"}

His father died when Turgenev was sixteen. He and his brother Nicholas were brought up by their mother. She did not treat them well.\n\nTurgenev went to the University of Moscow for one year and then moved to the University of Saint Petersburg, where he studied Classics and Russian Literature. In 1838 he went to the University of Berlin to study Philosophy and History. Turgenev liked Germany and thought Russia should change their social system to be more like Germany’s.\n\nThe 1840s and 1850s were hard times for writers and artists in Russia. The political system did not allow them to express themselves as they wanted to. Many intelligent Russians left the country and went to England, France and Germany. In 1852 Turgenev himself was put in prison for a month for praising Nikolai Gogol – a famous Russian writer who had been criticised by the ruling powers in the country. In 1854, Turgenev moved to Western Europe and started writing his novel \"Rudin\", which complained about the Russia of the 1840s and 1850s. \n\nThe political system in Russia changed in 1855 when Alexander II took over power from his father Nicholas I. Writers and artists had more freedom from this time. In 1860 one of Turgenev’s most famous novels, \"First Love\", was published.\n\nIn 1862, \"Fathers and Sons\", Turgenev’s most famous novel, appeared. Many people did not like the novel which upset Turgenev and he began to write less.\n\n\"Smoke\" was published in 1867, but again was not popular in Russia. \n\nIn 1879, he received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford in England.\n\nIn later life, Turgenev did not live in Russia much. He lived either at Baden-Baden or Paris, often near the singer Pauline Viardot, who he was having an affair with. He never married, but he did have a daughter with one of his family’s servants.\n\nTurgenev died near Paris on 3 September 1883.

Ernst Mayr thought he was \"one of the great biologists of all time\", and ranked him \"the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century\", after Charles Darwin.\n\nWeismann advocated the \"germ plasm\" theory. According to this, inheritance only takes place by means of the germ cells the gametes, such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body (somatic cells or \"soma\") are not agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells, and more germ cells. The germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. This is referred to as the \"Weismann barrier\". This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Lamarck.\n\nThe idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the modern evolutionary synthesis, though it is not expressed today in the same terms. In Weismann's opinion the random process of mutation in the gametes (or stem cells which make them) is the only source of change for natural selection to work on. Weismann was one of the first biologists to deny the inheritance of acquired characters entirely. Weismann's ideas came before the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work. Though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism, younger workers soon made the connection. \n\nWeismann's demarkation between germ-line and soma rested on the work of (mostly) German biologists during the second half of the 19th century. This was the time that the mechanisms of cell division began to be understood. Eduard Strasburger, Walther Flemming, and the Belgian Edouard Van Beneden laid the basis for the cytology and cytogenetics of the 20th century. Strasburger, the outstanding botanical physiologist of that century, coined the terms nucleus and cytoplasm. He said \"new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other cell nuclei\". Van Beneden discovered how chromosomes combined at meiosis, during the production of gametes. Walther Flemming, the founder of cytogenetics, named mitosis, and pronounced \"omne nucleus e nuclei\" (which means the same as Strasburger's dictum). The discovery of mitosis, meiosis and chromosomes is regarded as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times, and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology.\n\nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in sea urchin eggs in 1876, by Oscar Hertwig. It was described again in 1883, at the level of chromosomes, by Van Beneden in \"Ascaris\" eggs. The \"significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance\", however, was first described in 1890 by Weismann, who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained. Thus the work of the earlier cytologists laid the ground for Weismann, who turned his mind to the consequences for evolution, which was an aspect the cytologists had not addressed. All this took place before the work of Mendel had been rediscovered\n", "id": "213793", "title": "August Weismann"}

He became Professor of Biology and then Professor of Genetics at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHe co-founded, with William Bateson, the \"Journal of Genetics\" in 1910. Punnett is probably best remembered today as the creator of the Punnett square, a tool still used by biologists to predict the probability of possible genotypes of offspring. His \"Mendelism\" (1905) is sometimes said to have been the first textbook on genetics; it was probably the first popular science book to introduce genetics to the public.\n\nReginald Punnett was born in 1875 in the town of Tonbridge in Kent, England. While recovering from a childhood bout of appendicitis, Punnett became acquainted with Jardine's Naturalist's Library and developed an interest in natural history. \n\nAttending the University of Cambridge, Punnett earned a degree in zoology in 1898, and a masters in 1902. Between these degrees he worked as a demonstrator and part-time lecturer at the University of St Andrews Natural History Department. However, by 1902 Punnett was back at Cambridge working in zoology, primarily the study of nematode worms. It was during this time that he and William Bateson began a research collaboration, which lasted several years.\n\nWhen Punnett was an undergraduate, Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance was largely unknown and unappreciated by scientists. However, in 1900, Mendel's work was rediscovered. William Bateson became a proponent of Mendelian genetics, and had Mendel's work translated into English. It was with Bateson that Reginald Punnett helped establish the new science of genetics at Cambridge. He and Bateson co-discovered genetic linkage through experiments with chickens and pea plants.\n\nIn 1908, unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become fixed and ubiquitous in a population, Punnett introduced his problem to the mathematician G. H. Hardy, with whom he played cricket. Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the Hardy–Weinberg law.\n\nIn 1910 Punnett became professor of biology at Cambridge, and then the first Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics when Bateson left in 1912. In the same year, Punnett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He received the society's Darwin Medal in 1922.\n\nDuring World War I, Punnett successfully applied his expertise to the problem of the early determination of gender in chickens. Since only females were used for egg-production, early identification of male chicks, which were destroyed or separated for fattening, meant that limited animal-feed and other resources could be used more efficiently. Punnett's work in this area was summarized in \"Heredity in Poultry\" (1923).\n\nPunnett squares are used by biologists to determine the probability of offspring having a particular genotype.\n\nIf B represents the allele for having black hair and b represents the allele for having white hair, the offspring of two Bb parents would have a 25% probability of having two white hair alleles (bb), 50% of having one of each (Bb), and 25% of having only black hair alleles (BB). The phenotype (in this case the appearance) of the offspring would depend on whether and to what extent one of the alleles was dominant.\n\n\n\n", "id": "213825", "title": "Reginald Punnett"}

Ever since 2005, the club has been named FC Red Bull alzburg.\nOne of the aims of the new owners was to form a team which can play in the UEFA Champions League regularly. This was not reached but the new club was nevertheless successful. In the national league they reached four titles and were four times second. In the 2009/10 UEFA euro League the club won the group stage with 6 victories over FC Villarreal, Lazio Rom and Lewski Sofia. In the Round of 32 they lost versus Standard Lüttich. Also the next two Euro League group stages were reached. In the 2011/12 Euro League they reached the second place in the group stage behind Atletico Bilbao.\n\nIn the 2012/13 Championsleague they failed to beat FC Düdelingen from Luxenbourg. So the team was changed and new players were bought. In the league season they finished as 2nd. In 2013/14 the team became very successful, they became first 11 points before the second. In the Championsleague qualification they failed versus Fenerbahce Istanbul but they qualified for the Group stage, which they ended with 6 wins in 6 matches.\n\nTill 2015 they earned 2 titels and 2 wins in the Austrian Cup.\n\nIn UEFA matches the club is called FC Salzburg due to sponsorship reasons. \n\"As of 18 November 2013.\"\n\n \n\nLook \"FC Liefering\"\n\nAustrian Bundesliga\n\nAustrian Cup\n\nAustrian Supercup\n\nUEFA Cup\n\n\"<nowiki>*</nowiki> as Austria Salzburg\"\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Red Bull take over of SV Austria Salzburg some group of fans were unhappy, because the new club has other colours and did not accept the history of the club. After some negotiations these fans left the club and founded a new one under the name SV (Sportverein) Austria Salzburg. The new club is playing in the Regionalliga West together with the Red Bull Juniors.\n\nIn the meantime Red Bull Salzburg has 44 official fan clubs all over Austria.\n\n", "id": "214058", "title": "F.C.

He was selected for a fellowship to study at Columbia University, then the site of Thomas Hunt Morgan's famous drosophila fly room.\n\nStern accepted an appointment at the University of Berlin after his fellowship ended. In 1931, he was the first to demonstrate crossover of homologous chromosomes in \"Drosophila melanogaster\", only weeks after Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton had done so with maize.\nStern eventually returned to the United States in 1932. He became an American citizen in 1939. From 1933 to 1947, he taught at the University of Rochester. From 1947 until his retirement in 1970, he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he had numerous doctoral students. \n\nIn 1936, he demonstrated that recombination can also take place in mitosis resulting in somatic mosaics, organisms that contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissues. He later demonstrated that there were multiple genes on the \"Drosophila\" Y chromosome, and described the mechanism of dosage compensation. \n\nDuring World War II, he led research for the American government on low dose radiation safety. His laboratory group concluded that there is no \"safe\" threshold below which radiation is not harmful. \n\nAfter the war his research focused on human genetics, pioneering in what is now known as gene regulation. Although not a physician, he engaged in clinical work in human genetics. In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester. The first edition of Stern's pioneering textbook \"The Principles of human genetics\" was published in 1949. Both his teaching and his textbook were instrumental in re-founding human genetics on a non-racist basis, in contrast with pre-war German and American traditions in the subject.

Morgan took his PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 1890, and researched embryology while at Bryn Mawr College. \n\nAfter the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan switched his research to the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\". In 1904, E.B. Wilson invited Morgan to join him at Columbia University. This move freed Morgan to focus fully on experimental work.\nIn his famous Fly Room at Columbia, Morgan was able to show that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics. \n\nMorgan moved to California in 1928 to head the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech). Research was focused on genetics and evolution; experimental embryology; physiology; biophysics and biochemistry. \n\nHe was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933. It was the first one given for genetics, for his \"discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome in heredity\". The prize was not shared with the lab's main researcher, Alfred Sturtevant, a decision of the Nobel Committee which was certainly controversial.\n\nMorgan's early work with \"Drosophila\" was on the associations known as 'coupling' and 'repulsion', discovered by English workers in 1909 and 1910 using the Sweet Pea. These were, in reality, the same phenomenon, which was later called linkage. Morgan's first papers dealt with the demonstration of sex linkage of the gene for white eyes in the fly, the male fly being heterogametic (XY). \n\nDuring his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers, and, as a result of his work, \"Drosophila\" became the main 'model organism' in genetics.

Then arose the scientific charlatan Lysenko, who saw to it that genuine genetics scientists came under the disapproval of Stalin.

Her family moved from Devon, England, where she was born, to Virginia, United States, where she went to school and was raised. As an adult, Ivers moved to Leadville, Colorado where she met her husband Frank Duffield. Duffield was responsible for getting Ivers interested in poker, but he was killed a few years after they got married. Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City, New Mexico, and even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford, the man who killed Jesse James \n\n“Poker” Alice Ivers was born on February 17, 1851 in Devon, England to Irish Immigrants. Her family moved to Virginia when Alice was 12. As a young woman, she went to boarding school in Virginia to become a refined lady. While in her late teens, her family moved to Leadville, a city in the Colorado Territory.\n\nIt was in Leadville that Alice met Frank Duffield, whom she married at a young age. Frank Duffield was a mining engineer who played poker in his spare time. After just a few years of marriage, Duffield was killed in an accident while resetting a dynamite charge in a Leadville mine.\n\nIvers was known for splurging her winnings, as when she won a lot of money in Silver City and spent it all in New York. After all of her big wins, she would travel to New York and spend her money on clothes. She was very keen on keeping up with the latest fashions and would buy dresses to wear to play poker.\n\nAlice met her next husband around 1890 when she was a dealer in Bedrock Tom’s saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota. When a drunken miner tried to attack her fellow dealer Warren G. Tubbs with a knife, Alice threatened him with her .38. After this incident, Tubbs and Ivers started a romance and were married soon after.\n\nAlice Ivers and Warren Tubbs had 4 sons and 3 daughters together. Tubbs and Ivers did not want their children to be influenced by the world of poker, so they moved to a house just northeast of Sturgis on the Moreau River in South Dakota. Tubbs was not only a dealer, but a housepainter as well. It was most likely this house painting that caused him to fall sick with tuberculosis. Warren Tubbs died in 1910 in of pneumonia during a blizzard. To pay for his funeral, Alice had to pawn her wedding ring, which led her back to the poker world.\n\nAlice’s third husband was George Huckert, who worked on her homestead taking care of the sheep. Huckert was constantly proposing to Ivers, yet for a while she did not agree. Eventually, however, Ivers owed Huckert $1,008, so she married him figuring that it would be cheaper than paying his back wages. Huckert died in 1913.\n\nFirst husband Frank Duffield introduced Alice to poker when she accompanied him to his poker games in Leadville. For a while she just attended, watching and observing, but eventually she started to play and gamble along with the men. However, it wasn’t until after her first husband died that she started to play poker seriously.\n\nAlice was in a tough financial position, and after failing in a few different jobs including teaching; she turned to poker to support herself financially. Alice would make money by gambling and working as a dealer. Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City, New Mexico, even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford, the man who killed Jesse James.\n\nBy the time Ivers was given the name “Poker Alice,” she was drawing in large crowd to watch her play and men were constantly challenging her to play. Saloon owners liked that Ivers was a respectable woman who kept to her values. These values included her refusal to play poker on Sundays.\n\nAs her reputation grew, so did the amount of money she was making. Some nights she would even make $6,000, an incredibly large sum of money at the time. Alice claimed that she won $250,000, which would now be worth over three million dollars.\n\nIvers used her good looks to distract men at the poker table. She always had the newest dresses, and even in her 50s was considered a very attractive woman. She was also very good at counting cards and figuring odds, which helped her at the table.\n\nAlice was known to always be carrying a gun with her, preferably her .38. She was also known to smoke a lot.\n\nIn 1910, Ivers opened “Poker’s Palace,” a saloon in Fort Meade, South Dakota, which offered gambling and liquor downstairs, and prostitution upstairs. The saloon was always closed on Sundays, due to Iver’s religious beliefs. However, in 1913, some drunken soldiers disobeyed Iver’s “no work on Sunday” rule and started to get unruly, chaotic, and destructive of the house. It was then that Ivers shot her gun, supposedly to quiet the soldiers down. The shot ended up killing one of the soldiers and injuring another, resulting in Iver’s arrest, along with the arrest of six of her ‘girls’.\n\nIver’s time spent in jail was short, but she got through it with the help of reading the bible and smoking cigars. At the trial, she claimed self-defense and was acquitted. After the trial, her saloon was shut down.\n\nWhile in her 60s, Alice Ivers was arrested several times after the “Poker Palace” incident for being a madam, a gambler, and a bootlegger, as well as her drunkenness. She would comply with the law and pay her fines, but keep her business still. In 1928, she was arrested again for bootlegging and her repeated offenses of holding a brothel. Despite this sentence to prison, Ivers did not end up having to stay, because she was pardoned by then Governor Bulow of South Dakota who did so because of her old age.\n\nAfter being forced to retire by the anger of the military and other people who were upset with her blend of religious elements at her house in Sturgis, Alice’s health began to fail her. Alice Ivers died on February 27, 1930 in Rapid City after a gallbladder operation at the age of 79. Ivers was buried at the St. Aloysius Cemetery in Sturgis, South Dakota.\n", "id": "214179", "title": "Poker Alice"}

He was the first person to use the term genetics to describe the study of heredity, and the chief populariser of the ideas of Gregor Mendel, after their rediscovery in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns.\n\nBateson became famous as a mutationist who believed evolution took place by jumps. Later, Ronald Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane showed that discrete mutations were compatible with gradual evolution: see the modern evolutionary synthesis.\n\nBateson was the first to suggest the word \"genetics\" to describe the study of inheritance, in a letter to Adam Sedgwick, dated April 18, 1905. Bateson first used the term \"genetics\" publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906. Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word \"gene\" to describe the units of hereditary information, De Vries had introduced the word \"pangene\" for the same concept already in 1889 and etymologically the word genetics finds its origin in Darwin's concept of pangenesis.\n\nBateson co-discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett, and he and Punnett founded the \"Journal of Genetics\" in 1910. Bateson also coined the term \"epistasis\" to describe the genetic interaction of two independent traits. So important from 1900 to 1910, he was almost a bystander for the next ten years because he refused to accept the role chromosomes played in genetics. At last, in 1921, a visit to T.H.

It occurs during meiosis. \n\nCrossing over involves the exchange of chromosome segments between non-sister chromatids during the production of gametes. The effect is to assort (shuffle) the alleles on parental chromosomes, so that the gametes carry \"combinations\" of genes different from either parent. This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population.\n\nBy suitable means, the process can be observed directly in stained cells, and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes. The visible crossovers are called chiasma (plural: chiasmata), which is Greek for a cross. F.A. Janssens was the first to suggest what chiasmata meant.\n\nThe large-scale effect of crossing over is to spread variation through a population. This is the main consequence of sexual reproduction compared to non-sexual modes of reproduction.\n\nThe main advantage to the parents is the greater variety in their offspring. This, it is thought, increases the likelihood that some of the offspring will survive and reproduce.

The RFC was followed by the Royal Air Force (RAF), which was founded in March 1918. \n\nTrenchard, who learnt to fly in 1912, eventually became Chief of the Air Staff in 1919. In that position he reorganised the Air Ministry, and laid the foundations of the Royal Air Force. \n\nTrenchard was Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1931 to 1935. The Commissioner is the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to Greater London.\n\nAs a boy Trenchard found learning difficult. He failed many tests and only just got into the British Army as an officer. Trenchard first went to India with the Army and he then asked to go to South Africa because he wanted to fight in the Boer War. During the fighting, Trenchard was shot in the chest and became unable to walk properly because of damage to his back. He returned to England where a doctor told him to go to Switzerland because the air was better than in England. Trenchard became bored and started to bobsleigh. After crashing on a fast bend, Trenchard was able to walk properly - because his back was fixed. After his health got better still, Trenchard returned to the war in South Africa.\n\nIn 1912, Trenchard learned to fly and joined the Royal Flying Corps. He became the second most important man at the Central Flying School in England and had several important jobs in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Trenchard was the man in charge of the Royal Flying Corps in France from 1915 to 1917. In 1918, he was the first man in charge of the Royal Air Force for a short time. He then went back to France to take over the Royal Air Force bombing attacks on Germany. Winston Churchill put him back in charge of the Royal Air Force in 1919. Over the next 10 years, Trenchard started Air Force training bases and made sure that it was used to enforce the law in parts of the British Empire. In the 1930s Trenchard was in charge of the London's police force (the Metropolitan Police) and as an older man he argued for keeping a big RAF. In modern times, some people say that Trenchard was one of the first people to argue for strategic bombing.\n\n", "id": "214446", "title": "Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard"}

He lived in the period known as the Baroque period. His most famous music is his \"Te Deum\". This work begins with a prelude which today is extremely popular. It was the signature tune for the European Broadcasting Union where it was used to introduce programmes such as the Vienna New Year's Concert and the Eurovision Song Contest. It is often used as a voluntary for weddings.\n\nWe do not know much for certain about his early life. He went to Italy where he learned a lot by studying the music of Italian composers. He studied with the composer Giacomo Carissimi for several years.\n\nWhen he returned to France he got a job as musician to the Duchess of Guise who was a rich lady who employed several musicians. He worked for her for many years, both as a singer (he had a high tenor voice known in French as an “haute-contre”), and as a composer. When the great playwright Molière stopped working with Lully he asked Charpentier to work with him. He wrote music for several plays by Molière including \"Le malade imaginaire\". After Molière's died in 1673, Charpentier continued to write for other playwrights such as Thomas Corneille and Jean Donneau de Visé. He often used more musicians than he was allowed (only Lully, the king’s composer, was allowed to use lots of musicians for his performances). In the end Charpentier stopped writing music for plays.\n\nIn 1679, Charpentier was invited to compose for the king’s son, the Dauphin. The Dauphin had a private chapel and Charpentier wrote religious music for him. In 1683 he was given a royal pension. In April of that year he became very ill and could not work for a time.\n\nFrom late 1687 to early 1698, Charpentier was \"maître de musique\" to the Jesuits, Soon he stopped composing big works such as oratorios and concentrated on smaller works for church worship which were sometimes played by a large number of players. He also was music teacher to the Duke of Chartres.\n\nIn 1698 he was made maître de musique at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This was one of the top musical jobs in France (the only better job in sacred music in France was director of the royal chapel at Versailles). He kept this job until his death in 1704. After his death nearly all the works he wrote for the Chapel were destroyed. This was the usual procedure when a maître de musique died. His famous Mass \"Assumpta Est Maria\" has survived. Perhaps that is because it was not composed for the Chapel. \n\nCharpentier’s compositions include oratorios, masses, operas, and many smaller works. He also wrote a lot of music for plays. Many of his smaller works for one or two voices and instruments he called \"air sérieux\" or \"air à boire\" if they are in French, but \"cantata\" if they are in Italian.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

She made her stage debut as Rosine in Beaumarchais' \"Le Barbier de Séville\" in 1962.\n\nShe got her first major break in 1965, while on a theatrical tour in Paris, when she was noticed by French director Alain Resnais, who offered her a role in his movie \"La guerre est finie\", opposite Yves Montand. This led to her staying in France for a time and appearing in two other films; Philippe de Broca's \"Le Roi de Coeur\", opposite Alan Bates, and Louis Malle's \"Le voleur\", opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo.\n\nBack in Canada, she married screenwriter/director/producer Paul Almond in 1967, and starred in three of his films; \"Isabel\" (1968), \"The Act of the Heart\" (1970) and \"Journey\" (1972), winning the Canadian Film Award for best actress for the first two. The couple divorced in 1973, but worked again together in \"Final Assignment\" (1980) and \"The Dance Goes On\" (1991), the latter also featuring their son Mathew Almond (born in 1968). \n\nShe also appeared in Michel Brault's \"Entre la mer et l'eau douce\" (1967) and Claude Jutra's \"Kamouraska\" (1973), based on the novel by Anne Hebert, for which she won her third Canadian Film Award for best actress. \n\nShe made notable appearances on American television (Hallmark Hall of Fame, NBC) in George Bernard Shaw's classic plays; \"Saint Joan\" in 1967, and \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" in 1976, the later opposite Sir Alec Guinness, as well as in Jean Anouilh's \"Antigone\" in 1974 (Great Performances, PBS). \n\nInternational recognition came in 1969, when she portrayed Anne Boleyn in Charles Jarrott's movie \"Anne of the Thousand Days\", opposite Richard Burton's Henry VIII. Her performance won her the Golden Globe Award for best actress in a leading role and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. The following year, she played Cassandra in Michael Cacoyannis's movie version of \"The Trojan Women\", opposite Katharine Hepburn, Vanessa Redgrave and Irene Papas.\n\nFluent in both French and English, she has since worked steadily in the United States, Canada and France. Notable movies have included; \"Earthquake\" (1974), \"L'incorrigible\" (1975), \"Swashbuckler\" (1976), \"Obsession\" (1976), \"Another man, another chance\" (1977), \"Coma\" (1978), \"Murder by Decree\" (1979), \"Monsignor\" (1982), \"Tightrope\" (1984), \"Choose Me\" (1984), \"Dead Ringers\" (1988), \"The Moderns\" (1988), \"Les noces de papier\" (1989), \"Mon amie Max\" (1994), \"The House of Yes\" (1997), \"Eye of the Beholder\" (1999), \"Finding Home\" (2003), etc.\n\nIn 1994, she made headlines when she was chosen to play the lead character in the popular television serie \"\", but quit after the first episode finding the shooting schedule too demanding. \n\nGeneviève Bujold lives in Malibu, California, since 1974 and is the mother of a second son Emmanuel (born in 1980) with companion Dennis Hastings.\n\n\n", "id": "214477", "title": "Geneviève Bujold"}

He became famous for his amazing story of survival and is likely to have inspired Daniel Defoe to write the book \"Robinson Crusoe\".\n\nHe was on an expedition when the captain of the ship, Captain Stradling, left him on an island off the coast of Chile. Selkirk's job on board was the navigator. He controlled where the ship needed to go and where it was at that point in time. He had an important job. He tried to warn the captain about certain repairs that were needed but the captain ignored Selkirk and carried on sailing. Selkirk knew the ship was to drown at any given moment and tried to demand the repairs were taken care of but nobody listened. They had stopped at an island to restock fresh water and supplies. Selkirk said he would rather stay on the island than continue to ride on a dangerous, leaky ship. So there he was left. He had last minute second thoughts and tried to get back onto the ship but Stradling refused. Selkirk was marooned on that island for about four years and had to rely on himself and his skills for survival.\n\nAt the time of his rescue, he had been gone for about four years. He was very familiar with crafting things himself out of resources on the islands and having to use his survival skills. He heard noises and when he went to find out what it was, he saw ships on the horizon. He didn't know if they were on his side or enemies but he knew he had to try. He got their attention and so they sailed over to his island. Once they had beached on the shore, Selkirk came out from the bushes with his hands up. It turned out they were English and on his side. They let him aboard their ship and they were at sea for another year, stopping off at a few places, before returning to England.\n\nWhen he returned, his story was written down by a person in his town and has been made into a slightly different version by Daniel Defoe who named it Robinson Crusoe. 'Robinson Crusoe' has been rewritten many times by lots of different people. There were some differences like how Crusoe was stranded for over twenty years and Selkirk, four.

Later it was discovered that the horse was giving the right answers by watching the reactions of the people who were watching him.\n\nHans was a horse that lived in Germany in the early 20th century. He belonged to a man called Herr Wilhelm von Osten. Van Osten was a teacher who taught maths at a school. He was an amateur horse trainer.\n\nThis was a time when people were becoming interested in how intelligent animals were. This was largely because of what Charles Darwin had been writing about.\n\nVon Osten taught Hans to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell the time and date, read and spell and to understand German. If he asked the horse a question such as: \"What is 12 plus 12\", the horse would tap its hoof 24 times. Von Osten travelled round the country with Hans, showing off his clever horse to the public.\n\nScientists became interested in Clever Hans. The psychologist Carl Stumpf got a group of people together to study what was happening. His assistant Oskar Pfungst was the main investigator. The horse almost always gave the right answer when he could see his owner. He also gave the right answer if someone else asked him a question. This showed that Von Osten was not deliberately giving him secret signs.\n\nPfungst arranged the horse with blinkers, which meant the horse could only see straight ahead. If he could see the person asking him the question, he got the answers right 89% of the time. If the person asking the questions was standing to the side, where the horse could not see, the answers were right only 6% of the time. Also, the horse did not get the answer right if the person asking the question did not know the answer himself.\n\nWhen the horse could answer the question, it started to tap more slowly when it got near to the right answer. Then it stopped when it got to the right answer. This showed that the horse was watching the person asking the question, and it could sense when the person was expecting him to stop. Von Osten probably did not realize that he was giving the horse signals just by looking at him. The horse was, indeed, clever to guess what was wanted of him, but of course it did not understand the mathematics. The final proof was that Pfungst discovered how to signal to the horse, by slightly raising his eyebrows. Then he could get the horse to give any response he wanted.\n\nThis effect is often called the \"Clever Hans effect\". It is used in psychology to describe when an animal or a person senses what someone wants them to do, even although they are not deliberately being given signals. It is important to take this effect into account when testing animals' intelligence or human intelligence. An animal may need to be separated from its trainer if their true intelligence is to be observed. On the other hand, an animal may be upset when it cannot see its trainer, so it might not give the right answer. This problem can often be solved by creating a situation in which the trainer does not know the right answer.\n\nThe Clever Hans effect is famous, and has been used in popular culture. For example, there is an episode of \"The Simpsons\" (\"Smart and Smarter\"), in which Lisa Simpson becomes jealous of her baby sister Maggie because Maggie seems to be even more intelligent than Lisa. Then it is discovered that Maggie has been watching Lisa so carefully that she could sense what the answers were. Lisa is relieved to discover this.\n\n", "id": "214644", "title": "Clever Hans"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214735", "text": "Epigenetics\n\nEpigenetics is the study of changes in gene activity which are \"not\" caused by changes in the DNA sequence. It is the study of gene expression, the way genes bring about their phenotypic effects.\n\nThese changes in gene activity may stay for the remainder of the cell's life and may also last for many generations of cells, through cell divisions. However, there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism. Instead, non-hereditary factors cause the organism's genes to behave (express themselves) differently. Epigenetics works by specific mechanisms, such as DNA methylation.\n\nEpigenetic factors may last into adulthood.\n\nA general definition is \"the study of... gene activity during the development of complex organisms\". Thus \"epigenetic\" can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.\n\nA stricter or narrower definition is \"the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence\". \n\nThe term \"epigenetics\" has been used to describe processes which are not heritable. An example is histone modification. So some definitions do not require heritability. Adrian Bird defined epigenetics as \"the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states\". This definition includes DNA repair or cell division phases, and stable changes across cell generations. It excludes others such as prions unless they affect chromosome function. \n\nThe NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project uses the definition: \"...For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell\".\n\nIn 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, \"stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence\", was made at a Cold Spring Harbor meeting.\n\nA reliable and readable account is from \"The Guardian\" newspaper.\n\nThe best example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotes is the process of cell differentiation. During morphogenesis, generalised stem cells become the cell lines of the embryo which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell – the zygote – divides and changes into all the many cell types: neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, blood vessels etc.\n\nAs the embryo develops, some genes get switched on, while others are switched off or moderated. This process is called gene regulation. There are many molecules inside the cell nucleus which do the job of adjusting the genes' output.\n\nDNA and histones make up what is called chromatin. Epigenetic modifications to the chromatin are copied during cell division. This produces a line of cells, all of which are alike. This is called a tissue.\n\nMeiosis cancels epigenetic changes, and resets the genome to its baseline state, so the process unfolds in each new generation. There are some exceptions to this rule, but none of these exceptions involve changes to DNA base pair sequences.\n\nThis process is different from mutations of the DNA. Genetic mutations change the primary DNA sequence, and mutations can happen in any cell. However, only mutations in cells involved in reproduction can affect the offspring.\n", "id": "214735", "title": "Epigenetics"}

Different tissues have different kinds of cells.\n\nDifferentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism as the organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types. Differentiation is a common process in adults as well: adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover.\n\nDifferentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself. It does involve switching off many genes not needed in a particular tissue. Thus, cells in different tissues may have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome.\n\nA cell that is able to differentiate into many cell types is known as \"pluripotent\". Such cells are called stem cells in animals and meristematic cells in higher plants. A cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types is known as \"totipotent\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214796", "text": "Fitness\n\nFitness in biology is the relative ability of an organism to survive and pass on its genes to the next generation. It is a central idea in evolutionary theory. Fitness is usually equal to the proportion of the individual's genes in all the genes of the next generation. \n\nLike all terms in evolutionary biology, fitness is defined in terms of an interbreeding population, which might or might not be a whole species. If differences in individual genotypes affect fitness, then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations; the genotypes with higher fitness become more common. This is the process called natural selection.\n\nAn individual's fitness is caused by its phenotype, and passed on by its genotype. The fitnesses of different individuals with the same genotype are not necessarily equal. It depends on the environment in which the individuals live, and on accidental events. However, since the fitness of the genotype is an averaged quantity, it reflects the reproductive outcomes of \"all\" individuals with that genotype.\n\nFitness measures the number of the \"copies\" of the genes of an individual in the next generation. It doesn't really matter how the genes arrive in the next generation. For an individual, it is equally \"beneficial\" to reproduce itself, or to help relatives with similar genes to reproduce, \"as long as similar number of copies of individual's genes get passed on to the next generation\". Selection which promotes this kind of helper behaviour is called kin selection.\n\nOur closest relatives (parents, siblings, and our own children) share on average 50% (half) of our genes. One step further removed are grandparents. With each of them we share on average 25% (a quarter) of our genes. That is a measure of our relatedness to them. Next come first cousins (children of our parents' siblings). We share 12.5% (1/8) of their genes.\n\nWilliam Hamilton added various ideas to the notion of fitness. His rule suggests that a costly action should be performed if:\nFitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity.\n\nInclusive fitness is a term which is essentially the same as fitness, but emphasises the group of genes rather than individuals. \n\nBiological fitness says how well an organism can reproduce, and spread its genes to its offspring. The theory of inclusive fitness says that the fitness of an organism is also increased to the extent that its close relatives also reproduce. This is because relatives share genes in proportion to their relationship.\n\nAnother way of saying it: \"the inclusive fitness of an organism is not a property of itself, but a property of its set of genes\". It is calculated from from the reproductive success of the individual, plus the reproductive success of its relatives, each one weighed by an appropriate coefficient of relatedness.\n\nThe British social philosopher Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" in his 1864 work \"Principles of biology\" to mean what Charles Darwin called natural selection. The original phrase was \"survival of the best fitted\". \n", "id": "214796", "title": "Fitness"}

She also sang onstage at the Cavern sometimes, backed by the band that was playing at the time. \"Swinging Cilla\" was well-liked by the Cavern's members and guests.\n\nOne day Brian Epstein visited the Cavern to meet the Beatles, and ask about a record they made, so he could sell copies at his family's music store. Stories rose later that Cilla was working, and she first met Epstein when he gave her his hat and coat. Neither one remembered this later, though, and each believed the story was not true.\n\nEpstein's getting to know the Beatles led to his becoming their manager, and with his help, they won a recording contract. The Beatles' talent and work with music producer George Martin led to hit records. Epstein decided to manage other Liverpool musicians. Along with the bands and male singers he signed up, Epstein chose Cilla as his only female performer. He suggested her stage name (changing White to Black), so she and her family could keep their privacy. Martin also agreed to record her, helping choose songs that would showcase her voice.\n\nCilla became popular first in England and Europe, then in America as the Beatles' music started the \"British Invasion\" there in 1964. One of her first hits, \"Anyone Who Ever Had A Heart\", was recorded earlier by American singer Dionne Warwick. The two records sounded similar, even though Cilla had not heard Warwick's version, and a few people believed she had copied it. Both women later also recorded the theme song for the movie \"Alfie\", but they sounded different.\n\nCilla had other hit records, including \"You're My World\" and a television theme song, \"Step Inside, Love\". Epstein enjoyed working with her, even helping her choose wardrobe for performances and looking after her backstage, but personal problems later took away his attention. He passed away in 1967, after a drug overdose.\n\nIn time, Cilla Black stopped having hits. She remained popular in England, though, and was a welcome hostess and guest on television. She also made appearances from time to time, to sing the songs from her heyday.\n\nIn later years, her health became poor. Arthritis made walking painful, and she was nearly deaf. She admitted that she did not want to live past 75 years old, because she enjoyed her life less and less as she aged.\n\nBlack died of a stroke after a fall at her holiday home near Marbella, Spain, on 1 August 2015, aged 72. Her funeral took place in Liverpool on 20 August 2015.\n", "id": "214805", "title": "Cilla Black"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214889", "text": "Mikhail Bulgakov\n\nMikhaíl Bulgakov ( – 10 March 1940) was a Soviet Russian writer and playwright active in the first half of the 20th century. \n\nHe is best known for his novel \"The Master and Margarita\", which has been called one of the masterpieces of the 20th century.\n\nMuch of Bulgakov's work is best described as magic realism, where fantasy intrudes into what seemed at first to be a straightforward everyday scene.\n\nMikhail Bulgakov was born in Kiev on May 15 1891. Two of his grandparents were priests and his father was an assistant professor. At school Bulgakov developed an interest in Russian writing, European writing, the theatre and the opera.\n\nIn 1913 Bulgakov married Tatiana Lappa. When the First World War started he volunteered with the Red Cross as a doctor. Bulgakov was sent to an area where fighting was heavy, and he was badly injured at least twice. In 1916, he graduated from the Medical School of Kiev University. Bulgakov then joined the White Army with his brothers. They fought against the communists who were taking control of Russia. Bulgakov also fought in the Ukrainian People's Army. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Mikhail and his brothers went to the Caucasus in Western Russia. Mikhail worked as a journalist. Many members of Bulgakov's family left Russia for Western Europe. Bulgakov was not allowed into other countries, however, as he had a disease: typhus.\n\nThe injuries Bulgakov received in the First World War continued to cause him a lot of pain. To ease the pain, he started injecting himself with morphine. He eventually became addicted. He wrote a book about this period called \"Morphine\", which was finally released in 1926.\n\nBulgakov left medicine behind as he was now sure he wanted to be a writer. He moved to Moscow with his wife Tatiana in 1921. Bulgakov eventually divorced Tatiana, and married Lyubov' Belozerskaya in 1924. He published a number of works in the early 1920s. By 1927, however, he was criticised by people who said he was writing against the Soviet government. By 1929, Bulgakov's writing career was in ruins. Government censorship stopped his work and plays being released in the USSR.\n\nIn 1931, Bulgakov got married again, to Yelena Shilovskaya. Yelena inspired one of the main characters in Bulgakov's most famous novel, \"The Master and Margarita\". In the last ten years of his life, Bulgakov continued to write novels, plays and translate works in other languages. Many could still not be published in the USSR of the 1930s. Those that were published were often heavily criticised.\n\nBulgakov did not like the way Soviet system prevented his works being published. He wrote a letter to the Soviet government asking permission to leave the country. He even spoke directly to Stalin on the telephone, asking to be allowed to leave the USSR. Stalin's reply implied that if Bulgakov attempted to leave, he would be killed.\nStalin did allow Bulgakov to work at a small theatre in Moscow, however. Bulgakov eventually worked at the Moscow Art Theatre, but the Soviet system still did not allow him to write as he really wanted. This, and the fact that he was not allowed to go abroad to see his family, made Bulgakov very unhappy.\n\nBulgakov died from problems with his kidneys on March 10, 1940. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n\nThe novel is a satire on the Soviet society. It is covered by a plot in which two apparently unrelated stories alternate chapter by chapter. The first plot theme is the Devil in modern Moscow; the second is the story of Pontius Pilate. Connecting these two themes are Satan himself, and the Master with his devoted lover Margarita. The Master is an embittered author, whose historical novel about Pontius Pilate had been rejected by the Soviet literary committee . \n\nBy means of the plot, Bulgakov deals with some of the deepest issues in life: the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice.\n\nBulgakov started writing the novel in 1928. He burnt the first manuscript of the novel in 1930, seeing no future as a writer in the Soviet Union. The work was restarted in 1931. The second draft was completed in 1936 by which point all the major plot lines of the final version were in place. The third draft was finished in 1937. Bulgakov continued to revise the work, helped by his wife, but was forced to stop work on the fourth version four weeks before his death in 1940.\n\nA censored version (12% of the text removed and still more changed) of the book was first published in \"Moscow\" magazine (#11, 1966 and #1, 1967). The text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was published on a samizdat basis. In 1967 the publisher \"Posev\" (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the first complete version, prepared by Anna Saakyants, was published in 1973, based on the version of the beginning of 1940 proofread by the publisher. In 1989 the last version was prepared by literature expert Lidiya Yanovskaya based on all available manuscripts. \n\nThe novel is autobiographical. Bulgakov is the Master, and his trials and difficulties are very similar to those the Master faces. Margarita is Yelena Shilovskaya, his long-term girlfriend who became his third wife. The burning of the Master's manuscript is just what Bulgakov did, and for the same reasons of despair and frustration. Of course a state literary committee prevented its publication, just as did in the novel. And Bulgakov was fascinated with the confrontation between Christ and Pontius Pilate.\n\nBulgakov never lived to see the manuscript published, nor to enjoy his post-war fame. He died from nephrosclerosis (an inherited kidney disorder) on 10 March 1940. His father died of the same disease, and Bulgakov had long expected his fate.\n\nThe novel has been the basis of films, stage productions, opera, ballet, and television versions.\n\n\n\n", "id": "214889", "title": "Mikhail Bulgakov"}

He was one of the founders (along with Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright) of population genetics.\n\nJack Haldane was a communist, atheist and a writer of popular science books, and articles for the \"Daily Worker\".

Haldane wrote many popular essays on science that were eventually collected and published in 1927 in a volume entitled \"Possible Worlds\". \n\nHe then accepted a position as Professor of Genetics and moved to University College London where he spent most of his academic career. Four years later he became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London.\nHaldane's move to India, initially to the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was influenced by a number of factors. Officially he stated that his chief political reason was in response to the Suez Crisis. He wrote: \"Finally, I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law.\" His interest in India was also because of his interest in biological research, belief that the warm climate would do him good and that India offered him freedom and shared socialist dreams.
