{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233426", "text": "José Raúl Capablanca\n\nJosé Raúl Capablanca y Graupera (Havana, Cuba, 19 November 1888 – New York, 8 March 1942) was a Cuban chess player who was World Chess Champion from 1921 to 1927.\n\nCapablanca was a child prodigy with an astonishing natural talent for the game. He grew up into a cultured and charming man, whom the Cuban government made its roving ambassador-at-large. He was a media celebrity: his travels round the world were reported in newspapers, radio and movie newsreels. In his lifetime, he was probably the Cuban best-known to the rest of the world.\n\nIn December 1921, shortly after becoming World Champion, Capablanca married Gloria Simoni Betancourt. They had a son, José Raúl Jr., in 1923 and a daughter, Gloria, in 1925. According to Capablanca's second wife, Olga, his first marriage broke down fairly soon.\n\nJosé Raúl Capablanca was the second surviving son of an army officer. According to Capablanca, he learned the rules of the game at the age of four by watching his father play, pointed out an illegal move by his father, and then beat his father twice. At the age of eight he was taken to Havana Chess Club, which had hosted many important contests, but on the advice of a doctor he was not allowed to play frequently.\nBetween November and December 1901, he narrowly beat the Cuban Chess Champion, Juan Corzo, in a match. However, in April 1902 he only came fourth out of six in the National Championship, losing both his games against Corzo. In 1905 Capablanca passed with ease the entrance examinations for Columbia University in New York City. He wished to play for Columbia's strong baseball team, and soon was selected as shortstop on the freshman team. In the same year he joined the Manhattan Chess Club, and was soon recognized as the club's strongest player. He was particularly dominant in rapid chess, winning a tournament ahead of the reigning World Chess Champion, Emanuel Lasker, in 1906. In 1908 he left the university to concentrate on chess.\n\nThe San Sebastian tournament of 1911 was \"one of the strongest five tournaments held up to that time\", as all the world's leading players competed except the World Champion, Lasker, who was inactive in serious play at the time. At the beginning of the tournament, Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablanca's presence because he had not fulfilled the entry condition of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments. Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round, and more simply against Nimzowitsch. He astounded the chess world by taking first place, with a score of six wins, one loss and seven draws, ahead of Akiba Rubinstein, Milan Vidmar, Frank Marshall, Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch. His loss, against Rubinstein, was one of the most brilliant achievements of the latter's career. Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championship.\n\nIn 1911, Capablanca challenged Emanuel Lasker for the World Chess Championship. Lasker accepted his challenge while proposing seventeen conditions for the match. Capablanca objected to some of the conditions, which significantly favored Lasker, and the match did not take place.\n\nIn September 1913, Capablanca secured a job in the Cuban Foreign Office, which made him financially secure throughout his life. \"He had no specific duties, but was expected to act as a kind of ambassador-at-large, a well-known figure who would put Cuba on the map wherever he travelled\".\n\nThe St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was the first in which Capablanca played World Champion Emanuel Lasker under normal tournament conditions. The St. Petersburg event was arranged in an unusual way: after a preliminary single-round all-play-all tournament of eleven players, the top five were to play a second stage in a double round format, with scores from the preliminary tournament carried forward to the second contest. Capablanca placed first in the preliminary tournament, 1½ points ahead of Lasker, who was out of practice and made a shaky start. Despite a determined effort by Lasker, Capablanca still seemed on course for ultimate victory. However, in their second game of the final, Lasker reduced Capablanca to a helpless position and Capablanca was so shaken by this that he blundered away his next game to Tarrasch. Lasker thus finished half a point ahead of Capablanca and 3½ ahead of Alekhine.\nAlekhine commented:\n\nAfter the breakdown of his attempt to negotiate a title match in 1911, Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges, which were agreed by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament, including Lasker, and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year. The main points were: the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year; the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games, whichever the champion preferred; and the stake should be at least £1,000 (worth about £347,000 or $700,000 in 2006 terms).\n\nIn January 1920, Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921. The match was played in March–April 1921; Lasker resigned it after just fourteen games, having lost four games and won none. Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an \"even and fascinating fight\" until Lasker blundered in the last game. Kramnik's explanation was that Capablanca was twenty years younger, a slightly stronger player, and had more recent competitive practice.\n\nCapablanca came second at the New York 1924 tournament, 1½ points behind Emanuel Lasker, though two ahead of third-placed Alekhine, with the score of 14/20 (+10 -1 =9). Capablanca's defeat at the hands of Richard Reti in the fifth round was his first in serious competition in eight years. He made another bad start at the Moscow 1925 chess tournament, and could only fight back to third place, two points behind Bogolyubov and ½ point behind Emanuel Lasker.\n\nA group of Argentinian businessmen, backed by a guarantee from the president of Argentina, promised the funds for a World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine in 1927. In the New York 1927 chess tournament, six of the world's strongest masters played each other four times, the others being Alekhine, Rudolf Spielmann, Milan Vidmar, Nimzovich and Marshall, lacking Bogolyubov and Lasker. Before the tournament, Capablanca diffidently wrote that he had \"more experience but less power\" than in 1911, that he had peaked in 1919 and that some of his competitors had become stronger in the meantime. In the event, he finished undefeated, winning the mini-matches with each of his rivals, 2½ points ahead of second-place Alekhine, and won the \"best game\" prize for a win over Spielmann.\n\nSince Capablanca had won the New York 1927 tournament overwhelmingly, and had never lost a game to Alekhine, he was regarded by most pundits as the clear favorite in their 1927 World Chess Championship match. However, Alekhine won the match, played at Buenos Aires, by 6 wins, 3 losses, and 25 draws – the longest World Championship match until the World Chess Championship 1984–85 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov. Alekhine's victory surprised almost the entire chess world.\n\nAfter Capablanca's death, Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory, since in 1927 he had not thought he was superior to Capablanca, and he suggested that Capablanca had been over-confident. Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation, while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition, and had thoroughly studied Capablanca's play. According to Kasparov, Alekhine's research uncovered many small inaccuracies, which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely. Vladimir Kramnik commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins. Luděk Pachman suggested that Capablanca, who was unused to losing games or to any other type of setback, became depressed over his unnecessary loss of the eleventh game, a long, gruelling endgame, featuring errors by both players.\n\nImmediately after winning the match, Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match, on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion – the challenger must provide a stake of US $10,000, of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated.\n\nNegotiations for a return match dragged on for several years, often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight. Their relationship became bitter, and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played.\n\nCapablanca finished fourth, one  point behind the joint winners at Moscow in 1935; Emanuel Lasker's third place at the age of 66 was widely admired. The following year, Capablanca won an even stronger tournament in Moscow, one point ahead of Botvinnik and 3½ ahead of Salo Flohr, who took third place; A month later, he shared first place with Botvinnik at Nottingham, with a mark of (+5 -1 =8), losing only to Flohr; Alekhine came sixth. These 1936 tournaments, the last of Lasker's life, were the only ones in which Capablanca finished ahead of Lasker.\n\nDuring these triumphs Capablanca began to experience debilitating symptoms of hypertension. and could only finish seventh of the eight players at the 1938 AVRO tournament, an élite contest designed to select a challenger for Alekhine's world title. Capablanca's high blood pressure was not correctly diagnosed and treated until after the AVRO tournament, and caused him to lose his train of thought towards the end of playing sessions.\n\n\n", "id": "233426", "title": "José Raúl Capablanca"}

It happened in September 480 BC in the straits between the mainland and Salamis Island. It was part of the Greco-Persian Wars.\n\nAlthough heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general Themistocles to bring the Persian fleet to battle again. The Persian king Xerxes was also anxious for a decisive battle. \n\nThe Persian navy sailed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory, sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships.\n\nAs a result, Xerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year, the rest of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale. Afterwards the Persians made no more attempts to conquer the Greek mainland. These battles of Salamis and Plataea mark a turning point in the Greco-Persian wars; from then on, the Greek cities would take the offensive. \n\n", "id": "233439", "title": "Battle of Salamis"}

It has a wide distribution in Eurasia and north Africa. \n\nThe adult male sparrowhawk has a blue-grey back and wings. His chest and belly have thin orange stripes. Female and young sparrowhawks have brown backs and wings, with thin brown stripes. The female is up to 25% larger than the male. This is one of the biggest size differences in any bird species. \n\nThe sparrowhawk eats mostly small birds which live in woodland. It can be seen in any habitat and often hunts birds in town and city gardens. Male sparrowhawks eat smaller birds like tits, finches and sparrows. Females eat bigger birds like thrushes and starlings. They can kill birds weighing more than .\n\nThe sparrowhawk is seen in Europe, parts of Asia and parts of Africa. Birds that breed in the north migrate south for winter. Birds that live further south stay there, or fly shorter distances.\n\nSparrowhawks build a nest in woodland. The nest is up to 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide and made from twigs. The female lays four or five eggs with pale blue shells. The chicks hatch after 33 days and leave the nest after another 24 to 28 days.\n\nThe proportion of young sparrowhawks which survive to one year old is 34%. More young males die than young females. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The average lifespan is four years. \n\nThe number of sparrowhawks decreased in Europe in the 1950s. Chemicals to kill unwanted insects (\"pesticides\") were put on seeds before they were planted. Small birds ate the seeds and then sparrowhawks ate the small birds. The amount of chemicals in the food chain increased. This affected the sparrowhawks. Some were poisoned and others laid eggs with shells that were too thin. The shells broke before the chicks hatched. The pesticides were banned and the sparrowhawk population increased again. It is now one of the commonest birds of prey in Europe. \n\nThe sparrowhawk's hunting behaviour means people who own homing pigeons or keep birds for food may dislike it. Some people also blame the sparrowhawk for decreases in the numbers of smaller birds. Scientists have found that increased numbers of sparrowhawks did not reduce the numbers of birds living in farmland and woodland in the 1960s. Research in Scotland found that less than 1% of homing pigeons that died were killed by sparrowhawks.\n\nPeople have used the Sparrowhawk for falconry (hunting using a bird of prey) for more than 500 years. It is difficult to train but brave. The sparrowhawk features in some old German myths. It is mentioned in a play by William Shakespeare and a poem by Ted Hughes.\n\nThe sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail. These adaptations help it to fly between trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and can be twice as heavy. When females are larger than males, it is called \"reverse sexual dimorphism\". It is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey.\n\nThe adult male is long from beak to tail, with a wingspan of . He weighs . The male has a slate-grey back and wings (sometimes more blue). His chest and belly have thin red stripes but they can look orange from a distance. His eyes are orange-yellow or orange-red. \n\nThe female is much larger – long, with a wingspan of . She weighs . The female has dark brown or grey-brown back and wings, and brown stripes on her chest and belly. Her eyes are bright yellow to orange. \n\nYoung sparrowhawks have a brown back and wings, with rust-coloured edges to the feathers. They have bigger brown stripes and spots on their chest and belly, and pale yellow eyes. \n\nThe Sparrowhawk's pale underparts and darker back and wings are an example of countershading. This colouration counteracts the effect of light coming from above, and helps to make the bird less visible. In fact, countershading is seen in most animals, including the Peregrine Falcon, the Merlin and other \"Accipiters\". The Sparrowhawk's stripes are typical of markings on birds of prey which live in woodland. \n\nSparrowhawks fly in a pattern described as \"flap-flap-glide\". The glide means that the flight has an up-and-down pattern. In Great Britain, Sparrowhawks living further north have longer wings than birds in the south. The sparrowhawk has a small, hooked beak. It is used for removing the feathers of its prey. The sparrowhawk's long legs and toes help it to catch and eat birds. Its middle toe is very long and is used to grab things.\n\nMost sparrowhawks live for about four years. 34% of young birds survive to be one year old. 69% of adults survive from one year to the next. The oldest known wild sparrowhawk lived for more than 20 years.\n\nYoung sparrowhawks (less than one year old) weigh less than adults. They are especially light in the two months after leaving the nest. There is probably a high death rate at this time, particularly for males. This may be because the smaller males catch smaller food. They cannot catch some of the bigger prey that females can. This means they need to eat more often. A female sparrowhawk of average weight can survive for seven days without eating. A male can survive only four days.\n\nThe sparrowhawk is part of the family Accipitridae and the genus \"Accipiter\". Some English people used to call the sparrowhawk the blue hawk because of the male's colour. Other old names include spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.\n\nThe Swedish biologist Carolus Linnaeus was the first person to describe the sparrowhawk. He called it \"Falco nisus\" in 1758. The French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson moved it into the \"Accipiter\" genus in 1760.\n\nThe current scientific name comes from the Latin words \"accipiter\" (hawk) and \"nisus\" (the sparrowhawk). \n\nThe sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the rufous-chested sparrowhawk of eastern and southern Africa, and possibly the Madagascar sparrowhawk. Eurasian sparrowhawks look slightly different in different parts of their range. Birds in the eastern part of the range are larger and paler. Six subspecies of sparrowhawk are generally recognised:\n\n", "id": "233525", "title": "Sparrowhawk"}

It was first published in three volumes by Joseph Johnson of London in 1801, and was later printed again by Pandora Press in 1986. The book was Edgeworth's second published. The book was noted for showing interracial marriage.\n\nLady Delacour is a \"bel esprit\" (woman of wit), who Belinda at first thinks “the most agreeable—no, that is too feeble an expression—the most fascinating person she had ever beheld (known).” Later, however, after Belinda hears about her sad life, she feels sorry for her. Belinda is very kind to Lady Delacour, who begins to like her. Through Belinda's gentleness, Lady Delacour begins to change. She becomes more caring for her husband and daughter Helena. However, Lady Delacour's sudden untrue jealousy towards Belinda and makes her move to the Percivals' house, where Helena is staying at. Later, Lady Delacour finds out that she was completely wrong and had misunderstood Belinda's good intentions. She becomes very ill, and begs for Belinda to forgiver her and come back. Belinda, accepting her apology, comes, and now Lady Delacour does everything Belinda advises her to do, and makes up with her husband, revealing to him how she is ill, that she had been hiding from everybody except herself and Belinda and her maid. Lord Delacour feels worried for her when he hears this. She takes a surgery, and is told that she is actually not ill at all. The bad doctor she had been going to had given her the wrong medicines, and therefore made her sick. Joyfully, she decides to be a good wife, a sweet friend, and a kind mother. She ends the book by saying, while laughing, “Now, Lady Delacour, to show that she is reformed, comes forward to address the audience with a moral—a moral!—yes,\n\nOur tale contains a moral, and no doubt,\nYou all have wit enough to find it out.”\n\nHer strong character and the very important part she plays in the book make some people think the title should be her name instead of Belinda's.\n\nBelinda Portman is a young lady. She is about seventeen years old. She is “handsome, graceful, sprightly, and highly accomplished.” She has good skills, but is unused to thinking for herself, for her aunt orders her to do everything(though her thoughts are often very different). Belinda is innocent and loving, and loves Clarence Hervey, though she does not even admit it to herself. Mr. Vincent and Sir Philip both want to marry her. She is very forgiving, as seen when she forgives Lady Delacour, but has good self-control over her feelings – for example, she does not blush (turns red) later when people talk about Clarence Hervey, and is not shaken by Mrs. Freke when she said she would be her enemy.\n\nClarence Hervey is a clever and witty young man, who is gallant, and is, as Belinda said at first, “a most uncommonly pleasing young man.” He is shown to have a warm heart, for he asks Lady Delacour to make his peace with Belinda after he spoke badly about her. He admires Lady Delacour, and tries to change her. But after that, he begins to like Belinda. However, he had been secretly taking care of another girl, Virginia, and now, thinking that he must marry Virginia, he tries to forget about Belinda. But later, Virginia shows him that she loves somebody else. So he tells Belinda that he loves her, and they marry.\n\nLady Anne Percival is very different from Lady Delacour. She is a gentle, motherly, reasonable lady. Belinda later also tells Mr. Vincent, when he compares Lady Anne Percival and Lady Delacour, “I have never seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with Lady Anne Percival.” She loves literature, and that makes her a good wife to Mr. Percival. She is kind and motherly, and loves Helena like her daughter. She also treats Belinda kindly, and thinks carefully before she judges people. She wished for Belinda to marry Mr. Vincent. At first, Lady Delacour did not like her, feeling jealous and thinking that Helena liked Lady Anne Percival better than her. However, later at the end, it is guessed that she becomes good friends with Lady Anne Percival.\n", "id": "233588", "title": "Belinda (book)"}

The Axolotl shows neoteny: the larvae do not undergo metamorphosis, so the adults stay aquatic, with external gills. \n\nThe species evolved in the lake underlying Mexico City. Axolotls are used a lot in scientific research because they can regenerate most body parts, are easy to breed, and have large embryos. \n\nAxolotls are closely related to waterdogs, the larval stage of the closely related Tiger salamanders \"Ambystoma tigrinum\" and \"Ambystoma mavortium\". These are common in much of North America and also sometimes become neotenic. The mudpuppies, \"Necturus\", are fully-aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.\n\nWild axolotls are now near extinction due to population growth in Mexico City, and the polluted waters of the lake. Non-native fish, such as African tilapia and Asian carp, have also recently been introduced to the waters. These new fish have been eating the axolotls' young, as well as its primary source of food. The axolotl is currently on the IUCN Red List of threatened species.\n\nCompared with land-dwelling salamanders, the sexually mature adult Axolotl is a chimera (~ mixture) of larval and adult tissues. A mutation in hormone production slows the development of the non-sexual tissues compared to the gonads. So, it ends up as an adult which looks like a larva, except that it is sexually mature. This is an example of neoteny, a type of heterochrony. Axolotls in the lab have reduced pigmentation and end up being a lighter pink color, while axolotls that live in nature are a darker, brown to black color. \n", "id": "233632", "title": "Axolotl"}

Poison gases can kill or injure a person if present in a high enough concentration. There is a diverse range of different poison gases and each has unique properties. Many toxic liquids are also volatile and their vapors are poison gas. \"Poison gas\" can refer to poisons in chemical weapons, but most of them are in fact liquids, for example mustard gas and VX are viscous liquids that are dispersed into fine mists.\n\nIn small amounts, corrosive poison gases usually cause irritation, and may have a smell, but this is not universal. There are several gases that can kill insidiously, without a warning smell or irritation.\n\nAll gases other than oxygen can displace air, and cause death by asphyxiation. This does not make them poison gases. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are two common examples. This has to be taken into account in handling of any compressed or liquified gas. Gases can be also dangerous because they are flammable (easily bursting into flame).\n\nPoison gases can cause injury more easily than solid or liquid poisons because they diffuse (move) in the air, exposing skin, and are easily breathed in. Immediate contact with corrosive gas leads to chemical burns of the skin and lungs. When absorbed into the inside of the human body and into the blood, either by breathing in or through skin, several poison gases cause a poisoning. In a poisoning, medical help is often necessary; simply removing the victim from the gas is not enough to prevent symptoms.\n\n\nPoison gases are used in industry as chemical reagents. The chemical reactions they can be used for are more important than their toxicity. Today, chemists try to avoid the use of poisonous gases, but it is often not possible. Examples of large-volume industrial poisonous gases are hydrogen sulfide, cracked from oil, chlorine, in diverse chemical uses and to disinfect drinking water, and ammonia, which is a valuable fertilizer into itself and can be converted into a range of other fertilizers, in addition to chemical uses.\n\nSome fumigants (chemicals used to kill pests) are also poison gases, for example phosphine, which is used to kill pests living in grains. The advantage of a gas is that it evaporates after use, so that if food is treated with gas, there is no need to rinse it to remove the poison. Some gasses can kill you and some can’t. Gasses have advantages and disadvantages. \n", "id": "233697", "title": "Poison gas"}

The open strings resonate with the D string, producing a special rich sound.\n\nBecause of this, many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major. Examples include Mozart's (No. 2, 1775, No. 4, 1775); Ludwig van Beethoven's (1806); Paganini's (No. 1, 1817); Brahms's (1878); Tchaikovsky's (1878); Prokofiev's (No. 1, 1917); Stravinsky's (1931); and Korngold's (1945).\nIt is also suitable for guitar music, with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings.\n\nFor some beginning wind instrument students, however, D major is not a very good key, because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments. E major has four sharps, which is harder for new learners to play.\n\nStill, the clarinet in B-flat is often used for music in D major. It is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well. However, when some composers write a piece in D minor with B-flat clarinets, they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major.\n\nMost tin whistles are in D, because they are often used in music with fiddles.\n\nIn the Baroque period, D major was seen as \"the key of glory\"; so many trumpet pieces were in D major. Examples include concertos by Fasch, Gross, Molter (No. 2), Leopold Mozart, Telemann (No. 2), and Giuseppe Torelli; sonatas by Corelli, Franceschini, Purcell, Torelli; and \"The Trumpet Shall Sound\" and the \"Hallelujah\" chorus from Handel's \"Messiah\".\n\nAfter the valve trumpet was invented, composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats, so Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E-flat major.\n\n23 of Haydn's 104 symphonies are in D major, making it the most often used main key of his symphonies. A great number of Mozart's unnumbered symphonies are in D major, namely K. 66c, 81/73, 97/73m, 95/73n, 120/111a and 161/163/141a. The symphony came from the overture, and \"D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nScriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Rimsky-Korsakov, he gave an example from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's own operas where a character sang in D major about gold.\n", "id": "233770", "title": "D major"}

This was also followed by Antonín Dvořák in his only C minor symphony and Anton Bruckner in his first two C minor symphonies. \nSince A-flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral music of the 18th century, passages or movements in the key often kept the timpani tuned the same way as they were in the movement before it. For example, Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement. With hand-tuned timpani, there is no time to retune the timpani to A flat and E flat for the slow second movement in A flat. In Bruckner's Symphony No. 1 in C minor, however, the timpani are retuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A-flat major.\n\nEdward Elgar's Symphony No. 1 in A-flat major is probably the best-known symphony in that key.

An equal-tempered scale of G major has exactly the same notes as the A major scale. Key pairs like this are called enharmonically equivalent. So the theoretical key of G major is usually written with the key signature of A major.\n\nA piece of Western music usually has a home key, and a passage within it may modulate to another key, which is usually closely related to the home key. (Usually, close to the original around the circle of fifths.) When the key is near the top of the circle (a key signature of zero or few accidentals), the writing of both keys is easy- a small number of extra sharps or flats is added. But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle (a key signature with many accidentals), enharmonic equivalence may need to be used because simply adding accidentals will result in a key with too many accidentals to be easy to play or write in.\n\nIn each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents \"can\" both be written without double-sharps or double-flats and so do not classify as 'theoretical keys':\nBut when a relative key is on the opposite side of the circle from its home key, then in theory modulating to that key would involve adding so many sharps or flats that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be written in the key signature. The following six keys (which are the parallel major/minor keys of those above) would require one, two or three double-sharps or double-flats:\n\nFor example, if a piece in E major were to modulate up a fifth to B major, which is next to it on the circle and on the same side of the circle, the notation is clear and simple; an extra sharp is added to make five sharps. If it was modulated again, it would become F major, written with six sharps. The next modulation, to C has seven sharps. But the next modulation would be to a theoretical key of G which would need an eighth sharp- for the previous F note to become F in the key signature.

The first residents probably belonged to a subgroup of the tribe. When István I. defeated Koppány, Nyék became a land of the queen. The name of the settlement is mentioned first in 1193 as Neck. Later the names Kápolnás Nyék, Káposztás Nyék, and Fertőfő Nyék are used to mention this rather insignificant place located between Buda and Fehérvár, which is south of the commercial route. As a border village Kápolnásnyék suffered from double taxation during the Turkish occupation (both Hungary and the Turkish Empire collected taxes). Therefore the population of the village decreased considerably and it even became uninhabited during the Turkish campaign of 1543. The inhabitants returned to the village in 1772. \n\nDuring the 19 century Upper and Lower Nyék were differentiated, even after 1861, when the Southem Railway was built. It is mentioned as an independent village first in 1871, to which Pettend was attached in 1898. Mihály Vörösmarty was born here.\n\nThe present appearance of the village was formed in the 1930s, when it became a commercial and service background for the booming tourism of Lake Velencei. The phone system, the gendarme patrol, local medical care, the railway station and the mill were established in this period. The settlement suffered serious injuries in World War II, when the majority of the population also died. The village was also behind in development, compared to other settlements of the region and became a part of Velence by the 1970s.\nKápolnásnyék declared its independence in 1990 and has gone though considerable development since then.

In the tract, Milton tries to defend the freedom of expression. Today, many people see it as one of the best defenses of the freedom of press ever written.\n\nThe tract is named after a speech by Isocrates, a Greek orator of the 5th century. The Areopagus is a hill in Athens, where many councils and tribunals were held. Isocrates wanted to restore one of these tribunals when he wrote the speech. In the speech,Milton argued that the Licensing Order of 1643 should be abolished; censorship had not been part of Greek or Roman societies. Milton uses many passages from the Bible to strengthen his argument. Milton had been censored himself when he tried to publish tracts which were in favor of allowing people to get divorced. \n\nIn \"Areopagitica\", Milton argues that the status that was there before had worked best: By this law, all publications needed an authors name or that of a publisher. According to Milton, it is easy to find the authors or the publishers with this system.

Usually, when people use the word \"defamation\", it means that the statement is not true. In this case, it is against the law. A statement that is defamation is called \"defamatory\".\n\nIn order to be defamatory, a statement has to claim to be a fact instead of an opinion. For example, saying, \"Mr. Jones is mean\" cannot be defamatory, because it is someone's opinion. However, if someone says, \"Mr. Jones steals candy from children\", then the statement is defamatory \"if\" it is not true, because it would be a fact, not an opinion.\n\nIf a defamatory statement is written, such as in a book or in a newspaper, it is called libel.

Carson worked for 15 years as a biologist, scientist and editor in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and then the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Her books were very important in helping the environmental movement grow. She was famous for writing \"Silent Spring\". She also wrote a set of three books about the ocean and what lives in and around it.\n\n\"Silent Spring\" caught the attention of many Americans. Before this not many worried about environmental problems and conservation. The book looked at problems with DDT and other pesticides (chemicals that kill pests, like mosquitoes and flies). It was thought these pesticides were safe, but they were actually causing many birds to die. DDT stayed in insects and fish which were eaten by birds. The birds then laid eggs with thin shells that would break. Some birds, like the Bald Eagle almost disappeared from the United States. In her book Carson said that without changes in how we use pesticides, there may not be birds left at some time in the future. Instead of hearing birds sing in the spring, it would be quiet, and that is how the book got its title.\n\nThis book led to a change in the national pesticide policy and a ban on DDT and some other pesticides. This new grassroots environmental movement, inspired by the book, led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. After her death, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter. There is a National Wildlife Refuge in Maine named after her.\n\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907 in Springdale, Pennsylvania and grew up on a family farm. It was on the Allegheny River, near Pittsburgh. Carson liked to read, and was a talented writer from an young age. She also spent a lot of time exploring around her farm. She began writing stories (often with animals in them) at age eight, and had her first story published at age eleven. She liked to read the \"St. Nicholas Magazine\", which published her first stories. It also published stories by Beatrix Potter, and the books of Gene Stratton Porter, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was a common part of her favorite books. Carson graduated high school in 1925, at the top of her class of forty-four students.\n\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (now known as Chatham University), as in high school, Carson was a bit of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928. She continued writing in the school's student newspaper. Though accepted to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University in 1928, she had to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year because of money problems. She graduated \"magna cum laude\" (highest honors) in 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.\n\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson worked in a laboratory with rats and \"Drosophila\", to earn money for tuition. She wrote her dissertation for her master's degree on how the pronephros in fish developed early in their life. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She wanted to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson had to leave Johns Hopkins to find a full-time teaching job to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, and Carson had to take care of her aging mother. This made the money problem even bigger (this was during the Great Depression, when jobs were hard to find).\n\nHer biology mentor from college helped her get a part-time job with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. Here she wrote for a educational broadcast called \"Romance Under the Waters\" on the radio (this was before television). It was a seven-minute program that ran once a week for a year. It was about aquatic life (mostly fish), to increase public interest in fish biology and in what the Bureau of Fisheries did. This was a job several people before Carson had not been able to do. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay to local newspapers and magazines.\n\nCarson's boss liked what she did, and asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau. He also had her apply to the first full-time job that became available. When she took the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants. In 1936 she became only the second woman to be hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time, professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.\nCarson worked for 15 years in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries and then the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nHer 1951 bestselling book \"The Sea Around Us\" allowed her to work full-time as a nature writer. People recognized her as a gifted writer. Her next book, \"The Edge of the Sea\", and the republished version of her first book, \"Under the Sea Wind\", were also bestsellers. Together, the three books explore all parts of ocean life, from the shores to the surface to the deep sea.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Carson became interested in conservation and the environmental problems caused by new pesticides. At first, she did not want to write about it, but nobody else would write about the problems of pesticides. So she studied the problem, and wrote \"Silent Spring\" (published in 1962). \n\nRachel Carson died young, at the age of 56. She had breast cancer earlier. It was treated, but after several years cancer came back. She died April 14, 1964. \n", "id": "234077", "title": "Rachel Carson"}

It is a key concept in developmental biology and evolution, introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875. It applies to the time a trait appears in the growth of an organism, or to the timing of gene expression in development.\n\nIts importance in biology is to explain the way closely related animals may come to have quite large differences in shape, and size, whilst nevetheless having a rather similar genome. The main components are the time a process starts and stops in development, and the rate at which the process works. \n\nIn his book \"Embryos and evolution\" (1930) Gavin de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony, and especially paedomorphosis, in evolution. Changes to the genes which control timing in development can produce quite striking changes in the adult. de Beer also conceived the idea of \"clandestine evolution\", which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwin's gradual theory of evolution. If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animal's juvenile form, then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all. Then, if the species were to undergo neoteny, the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record, despite having evolved gradually.

It was the first young-adult book written by author Rick Riordan. It is the first book in the \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\" series. The series is about the adventures of modern 12-year-old Percy Jackson after he discovers he is a demigod (half-human, half-god). Percy is the son of a mortal woman and the Greek god Poseidon. Percy and his friends go on a quest (adventure) so that a war between the Greek gods Zeus, \nPoseidon and Hades will not happen.\n\nRiordan finished writing his manuscript in 1994. \"The Lightning Thief\" was first bought by Bantam Books in 1997. Bantam sold it to Miramax Books. Miramax published it on June 28, 2005. The book sold more than 1.2 million copies in the next four years. The book won many awards. In 2007, it was on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for children's books. It was one of the Young Adult Library Services Association's Best Books for Young Adults. It was made into a movie named \"\". The movie was first shown in the United States on February 12, 2010. The sequel to this book is \"The Sea of Monsters\".\n\nPlanning for both \"The Lightning Thief\" and the series began when Riordan started making up stories for his nine-year-old son, Haley. He had started studying Greek mythology (stories) in second grade. He wanted his father to tell him stories about them before he went to sleep. Riordan had a Greek mythology teacher in middle school. He remembered some of the myths, which he then told to his son. Soon, Riordan had told him all the stories. When Haley wanted him to make up new stories using the characters from the myths, Riordan created the character of Percy Jackson. Like Percy, Haley had ADHD and dyslexia. He made up the story of how Percy traveled across the United States to search for Zeus' master bolt. After hearing the story, Haley wanted his father to write a book about Percy and his friends.\n\nIn June 1994, Riordan finished the story. He started looking for agents to publish it. He went to many local colleges to find an editor before finding an agent. He gave his manuscript to his agent and editor to review. At the same time, he gave the book to some sixth, seventh and eighth graders to read and tell him what was good or bad about it. They named the book and helped Riordan describe how Percy's sword (Riptide) worked. In June 1997, Riordan signed with Bantam Books to prepare the book for publishing. In 2004, Miramax Books bought the book. The money was enough for Riordan to quit his teaching job and spend his time on writing. The book was published on June 28, 2005. It sold over 1.2 million copies. The book had hardcover, softcover and audio editions. It has been translated into many languages. It has been published all over the world.\n\n\"The Lightning Thief\" is a fantasy–adventure novel which uses the ideas of ancient Greek mythology in today's world. It is written in a fast-paced, humorous (funny) style.\n\nPercy Jackson is a 12 year old boy. He has ADHD and dyslexia. He has been thrown out of many schools. On a trip with his mother, he meets his friend Grover, a satyr (half-goat, half-human). Grover tells Percy's mother that Percy must go to a camp. When they drive towards the camp, a Minotaur (monster) attacks them and grabs Percy's mother. She dissolves into gold sparkles of light, but Grover and Percy escape.\n\nPercy later wakes up. He learns that he is in Camp Half-Blood, which is a secret training camp for demigods. Percy has to live in the Hermes cabin because he does not know which god his father is. He is under the care of Luke Castellan, the cabin counselor (leader). During a game, the children of the war god Ares attack Percy. He is healed when he steps into a river. When Poseidon's trident appears above his head, Percy learns that he is Poseidon's son. After World War II, Poseidon, Hades and Zeus made an oath (promise) not to have any more children because they were too powerful. However, Poseidon broke the oath by having Percy.\n\nChiron tells Percy to find Zeus' master lightning bolt. Chiron thinks Hades stole the bolt. However, Zeus discovers that Poseidon has broken his oath, and thinks Poseidon told Percy to steal the bolt. He tells Percy that he has ten days until the summer solstice to find it. Before leaving, Luke gives Percy magic shoes. Percy gives them to Grover. Annabeth (a daughter of Athena) and Grover join Percy in his quest to find the bolt.\n\nThey decide to travel west to reach the entrance to the Underworld, which is in Los Angeles. They meet many Greek monsters. They also meet Ares. Ares tells Percy that his mother is alive. When they come near the pit of Tartarus, Luke’s shoes try to pull Grover into it, but he escapes. Percy meets Hades, who also thinks Percy stole the Master Bolt. He also thinks Percy stole his Helm of Darkness. Percy knows that Ares has tricked him when he finds the bolt in his backpack. He runs away from the Underworld. He has to leave his mother there. Percy fights and defeats Ares by hurting the god's heel. Ares gives Percy the Helm of Darkness. Percy gives it back to Hades. Olympus is now present at the top of the Empire State Building in New York City. Percy arrives there to give the master bolt to Zeus.\n\nPercy goes back to camp after hearing that his mother is alive. He meets Luke, who says that he stole the bolt for Kronos. He calls a poisonous scorpion which stings and nearly kills Percy. Percy kills the scorpion first. Chiron cures Percy, who leaves camp. He goes to a new school and stays with his mother instead of staying at camp.\n\n\n\"The Lightning Thief\" received mostly positive reviews. Common Sense Media said \"there are two levels of fun in \"The Lightning Thief\". One is the fast-paced quest of a young hero and his friends to save the world\" and added \"another level of fun here – laughing at the wicked ways the author has updated the gods and monsters for the 21st century\". However, it criticized some parts of the book. They described the prose as \"choppy and attitude-filled\" and complained that \"[t]he characters aren't emotionally involving\". Its overall rating was 4 stars out of 5. \"The New York Times\" praised \"The Lightning Thief\" as \"perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats\". \"School Library Journal\" said in its starred review (which is given to outstanding books) that the book was \"An adventure-quest with a hip edge\" and that \"Readers will be eager to follow the young protagonist's next move\". \"Kirkus\" praised the book and said, \"Packed with humorous (funny) allusions to Greek mythology and clever updates of the old stories, along with rip-snorting <nowiki>[</nowiki>intense<nowiki>]</nowiki> action sequences, the book really shines in the depiction of Percy – wry, impatient, academically hopeless, with a cut-to-the-chase bluntness one would wish for in a hero of old.\" Eoin Colfer, author of Artemis Fowl, called it \"A fantastic blend (mix) of mythology and modern\". \"Publishers Weekly\" also praised the book, regarding it as \"swift and humorous\" and added that the book would \"leave many readers eager for the next installment.\" On April 8, 2007, \"The Lightning Thief\" was ranked ninth on \"The New York Times Best Seller list\" for children's books. When speaking about the various awards, Rick Riordan said:\n\"The ultimate compliment for a children's writer is when the kids like it.\"\n\"The Lightning Thief\" was the winner of the \"School Library Journal\" Best Book of 2005. It was also one of the books in Chicago Public Library \"Best of the Best Books List\", 2005. It was also in the VOYA Top Shelf Fiction List. The book was the Red House Children's Book Award Winner (UK), 2006, and also won Askews Torchlight Award (UK), 2006, and the Mark Twain Award (Missouri Association of School Librarians), 2008. It was an \"ALA\" Notable Book, 2006 and a \"New York Times\" Notable Book (2005). It received the Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award in 2009.\n\nIn June 2007, 20 Century Fox bought feature movie rights to the book. In April 2007, director Chris Columbus was hired to lead the project. Logan Lerman played Percy Jackson, Brandon T. Jackson played Grover Underwood, the satyr, Alexandra Daddario played the role of Annabeth while Jake Abel was cast as Luke Castellan. Pierce Brosnan played Chiron. The movie is titled \"Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief\" and was first shown in the United States on February 12, 2010.\n\nOn June 28, 2005, a 10 hour 25 minute audio book version of \"The Lightning Thief\", read by actor Jesse Bernstein, was published worldwide by Listening Library.\n\n\"Kirkus\" said in their review, \"the narrator’s voice lends a refreshing air of realism to this riotously paced [fast paced] quest tale of heroism that questions the realities of our world, family, friendship and loyalty\". \"AudioFile Magazine\" praised the audiobook, saying both adults and children will be \"spellbound\" when they listen to \"this deeply imaginative tale unfold.\" \"School Library Journal\" both praised and criticized the audio book saying \"Although some of Jesse Bernstein's accents fail (the monster from Georgia, for instance, has no Southern trace in her voice), he does a fine job of keeping the main character's tones and accents distinguishable\".\n\n\"The Lightning Thief\" is followed by \"The Sea of Monsters\". There, Percy and Annabeth rescue Grover, who has been taken prisoner by Polyphemus, the Cyclops. They get the Golden Fleece from Polyphemus' island to save the camp. They are joined by Percy's half brother, Tyson, and Clarisse in this mission.\n\nLike \"The Lightning Thief\", it won several prizes. It was received well by reviewers too. It sold over 100,000 copies in paperback.\n\n\"The Lightning Thief\" was published in many languages. It was published in French, German, Spanish, Finnish, Swedish, Hebrew and Brazilian Portuguese.

Different communication technologies with similar functions are grouped into different logical layers on the OSI Model. Each layer of the OSI Model makes use of functions provided by the layers below it and provides functions that are used by the layers above it.\n\nAccording to the standard OSI Model there are seven layers. Each layer is dependent upon the layers below it to function.\nSome aspects of computer networking, such as management and security, use or are used on every layer.\n\nThe Transport Layer is the level at which system reliability and quality are ensured. This layer manages traffic flow through the network layer to reduce congestion on a network, and performs error checking ensuring quality of service by resending data when data has been corrupted. Some of the most popular methods of encryption and firewall security take place on this layer.\n\nThe Routing Layer works to coordinate related parts of a data conversation to ensure that large files are transferred. In other words, while the data link layer deals with the method in which the physical layer is used to transfer data, the network layer deals with organizing that data for transfer and reassembly. This layer also handles aspects of Routing Protocols, finding the available [best] path(s) from one network to another to ensure delivery of the data.\n\nThe Data Layer is mainly the method in which information from the network is broken down into frames and transmitted over the physical layer. This layer is also responsible for some Error detection and correction and some addressing so different devices can tell each other apart in larger systems.\n\nThe physical layer refers to electrical and physical aspects of devices. In particular, it specifies how a device sends and receives information, such as using copper wires or fiber-optic cables. Examples of this include Ethernet or fiber optic cables, phone cords used for dial-up or DSL services, the coaxial cable used to provide broadband internet, the wires used to connect various components of a computer or even the radio signals used in wireless communication. Other functions of the physical layer include the conversion of signals into something that another layer can use (referred to as a bit), and adjusting the signal to allow for multiple users to use the same connection..\n", "id": "234134", "title": "OSI model"}

The album was recorded in San Antonio and Houston, Texas. The album was Selena's first album to be released by EMI Latin. She signed a record deal with them earlier in the year. \"Selena\" got to number seven on the US Regional Mexican Albums chart. By 1996, 24,000 copies had been sold. The album helped Selena to win \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\" at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards.\n\nSelena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III was the music producer and songwriter for the album. Selena wrote \"My Love\" on her own. \"Sukiyaki\" was translated from Japanese to Spanish. This was done by Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. and Pete Astudillo. The lead single, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" got to number eight on the Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1989.\n\nJosé Behar, president of EMI Latin, went to the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. He was looking for new musicians. After Selena sang, Behar called his boss and told him about Selena. Behar thought he found the next Gloria Estefan. His boss told him that he was \"crazy\". He said this because Behar was only in Texas for a week. Selena later signed with EMI Latin later that year. She was the first artist to sign with them. Recording started in late 1988 and went on until early 1989. Selena recorded most of the songs in San Antonio, Texas at AMEN Studios. \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded in Houston, Texas at Sunrise Studios. Selena wrote \"My Love\" by herself. She wanted the song to be in the album. Her brother A.B. Quintanilla III was the music producer and main songwriter. Their father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. gave the job to A.B. He believed A.B. was good at producing music. \n\nThe only songs A.B. did not write were \"Sukiyaki\", \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", and \"No Te Vayas\". The original \"Sukiyaki\" was in Japanese. Selena's lyrics were a Spanish version of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson. \"Sukiyaki\" had been one of Abraham's favorite songs when he was growing up. \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" was written by Mexican songwriter Alejandro Montealegre. \"No Te Vayas\" was written by Reinaldo Ornelas. A.B. wanted \"No Te Vayas\" on the album because of its reggae sounds. He thought it would make the album \"exotic\" (different) from other Spanish-language albums. He believed this because of the different music genres they had produced.\n\n\"Selena\" was released on October 17, 1989 by EMI Latin. In its first week on the US Regional Mexican Albums chart (December 2, 1989), it was at number 17. It got to its highest place on the chart, number 7, on March 24, 1990. It was on the chart for another three weeks. On May 5, 1990, it was on the chart again, at number 14. That was after the release of \"Ven Conmigo\" (1990). However, it left the charts. It was on the chart again two times in August 1990. \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", \"Mentiras\", and \"Sukiyaki\" were released as singles. The lead single, \"Contigo Quiero Estar\" got to number eight on the Hot Latin Tracks chart.\n\nAt the 1990 Tejano Music Awards, Selena won \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\". Her album \"Selena\" did better than albums from other female singers. As of 1996, 24,000 copies of \"Selena\" have been sold in the United States. 30,000 copies of \"Selena\" were shipped. On August 27, 2002, \"Selena\" was released again. It was part of the \"20 Years of Music\" series. It had one bonus track (\"La Bamba\"). It also had commentaries for each track.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234215", "text": "Mikhail Botvinnik\n\nMikhail Botvinnik (17 August 1911 – 5 May 1995) was a Soviet Russian grandmaster and three-time World Chess Champion. \n\nHe was an electrical engineer, one of the few chess masters who achieved distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive chess. \n\nBotvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union. This put him under some political pressure, but also gave him considerable influence within Soviet chess. He played a major role in the design of the World Chess Championship system after World War II. After his retirement as a player he coached a few select pupils. They included three future World Champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik.\n\nMikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik was born near St. Petersburg into a Jewish family. His father was a dental technician, and a cantor (\"hazzan\") in the local synagogue. His mother was a dentist, which allowed the family to live outside the Pale of Settlement to which most Jews in Russia were restricted at the time. As a result, Mikhail Botvinnik grew up in Saint Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt. \n\nHis father forbade the speaking of Yiddish at home, and Mikhail and his older brother Issy attended Soviet schools. Mikhail Botvinnik later said, \"I am a Jew by blood, Russian by culture, Soviet by upbringing\". \n\nTo test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Nikolai Krylenko organized the Moscow 1925 chess tournament. On a rest day during the event, world champion José Raúl Capablanca gave a simultaneous exhibition in Leningrad. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won their game. \n\nBotvinnik was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department. In January 1929, he played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager got Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department.\n\nHis early progress was fairly rapid. He won the Leningrad Masters' tournament in 1930 with 6½/8, following this up the next year by winning the Championship of Leningrad by 2½ points over former Soviet champion Peter Romanovsky.\n\nIn 1931, at the age of 20, Botvinnik won his first Soviet Championship in Moscow, scoring 13½ out of 17. In late summer 1931, he graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering. In 1933, he repeated his Soviet Championship win, in his home city of Leningrad, with 14/19. \n\nSoon afterwards Ilyin-Genevsky, one of the older masters and a member of the Soviet embassy in Prague, arranged a match between Salo Flohr and Botvinnik. Botvinnik fell two games behind by the end of the first six, played in Moscow. However, aided by his old friend Viacheslav Ragozin and coach Abram Model, he levelled the score in Leningrad and the match was drawn. When describing the post-match party, Botvinnik wrote that at the time he danced the foxtrot and charleston to a professional standard. \n\nIn his first tournament outside the USSR, the Hastings International Chess Congress 1934–35, Botvinnik achieved only a tie for 5th-6th places, with 5/9. He wrote that, in London after the tournament, Emanuel Lasker said his arrival only two hours before the first round began was a serious mistake and that he should have allowed ten days for acclimatization. Botvinnik wrote that he did not make this mistake again. \n\nBotvinnik came first equal with Flohr, ½ point ahead of Lasker and one point ahead of José Raúl Capablanca, in Moscow's second International Tournament, held in 1935. After consulting Capablanca and Lasker, Krylenko proposed to award Botvinnik the title grandmaster, but Botvinnik objected that \"titles were not the point\". However, he accepted a free car and a 67% increase in his postgraduate study grant, both provided by the People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry. \nAn even stronger double-round tournament was played in Moscow in June 1936, and Botvinnik finished second, one point behind Capablanca and 2½ ahead of Flohr. \n\nIn early winter, 1936, Botvinnik was invited to play in a tournament at Nottingham, England. Krylenko authorized his participation and, although his Soviet rivals forecast disaster for him, he scored an undefeated shared first place (+6 =8) with Capablanca, ½ point ahead of the then World Champion Max Euwe and rising American stars Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky, and 1 point ahead of ex-champion Alexander Alekhine. This was the first tournament victory by a Soviet master outside his own country. When the result reached Russia, Krylenko drafted a letter to be sent in Botvinnik's name to Stalin. On returning to Russia Botvinnik discovered he had been awarded the \"Mark of Honour\". Later, in 1937, Botvinnik drew a match of thirteen games against Grigory Levenfish. \n\nBotvinnik won further Soviet Championship titles in 1939, 1944, 1945, and 1952, bringing his total to six – a record he shares with Mikhail Tal. In 1945 he dominated the tournament, scoring 15/17; in 1952 he tied with Mark Taimanov and won the play-off match. In post-Soviet Russia the championship is somewhat less strong, as entrants from the non-Russian countries are lacking. All the same, it is still the strongest national championship in the world, and Peter Svidler has won it six times.\n\nBotvinnik influenced the design of the system which would be used for World Championship competition from 1948 to 1963. Viktor Baturinsky wrote \"Now came Botvinnik's turn to defend his title in accordance with the new qualifying system which he himself had outlined in 1946\". \n\nOn the basis of his strong results during and just after World War II, Botvinnik was one of five players to contest the World Chess Championship 1948, which was held at The Hague and Moscow. He won the tournament convincingly, with a score of 14/20, three points clear, becoming the sixth World Champion. Botvinnik then held the title, with two brief interruptions, for the next fifteen years, during which he played seven world championship matches. \n\nBotvinnik played no formal competitive games after winning the 1948 match tournament until he defended his title. In 1951, he drew with David Bronstein over 24 games in Moscow, +5 =14 -5, keeping the world title. He struggled to draw this match with Bronstein, and had (by his standards) weak tournament results. Botvinnik did not play in the Soviet team that won the 1952 Chess Olympiad in Helsinki: the players voted for the line-up and placed Botvinnik on second board, with Keres on top board; Botvinnik protested and refused to play. Keres' playing record from 1950 to early 1952 had been outstanding.\nIn 1954, he drew with Vasily Smyslov over 24 games at Moscow, +7 =10 -7, again retaining the title. In 1957, he lost to Smyslov by 9½–12½ in Moscow, but the rules then in force allowed him a rematch without having to go through the Candidates' Tournament, and in 1958 he won the rematch in Moscow; Smyslov said his health was poor during the return match. In 1960, Botvinnik was convincingly beaten 8½-12½ at Moscow by Tal, now 23 years old, but again exercised his right to a rematch in 1961, and won by 13–8 in Moscow. Botvinnik's play was better than in the 1960 match, mainly due to thorough preparation. Botvinnik changed his style in the rematch, avoiding the tactical complications in which Tal excelled and aiming for closed positions and endgames, where Tal's technique was not so outstanding. Also, Tal's health was variable. Finally, in 1963, he lost the title to Tigran Petrosian, by 9½-12½ in Moscow. FIDE had by then changed the rules, and he was not allowed a rematch. The rematch rule had been nicknamed the \"Botvinnik rule\", because he twice benefited from it.\n\nIn 1970, Botvinnik retired from competitive chess, and he worked on chess-playing software. There was no significant result from this, but his work as a coach to top young players bore fruit. He died of pancreatic cancer in Moscow.\n", "id": "234215", "title": "Mikhail Botvinnik"}

Other names for them are \"Kuchi Hound\", \"Tāzī\", \"Balkh Hound\", \"Baluchi Hound\", \"Barutzy Hound\", \"Shalgar Hound\", \"Kabul Hound\", \"Galanday Hound\", or sometimes, incorrectly, \"African Hound\". This is a very old dog breed, believed to have existed for thousands of years. It is a type of sighthound, a hunting dog which uses its eyes to spot and chase small animals, like rabbits. They are closely related to other sighthounds, like the Greyhound. Afghan Hounds can run very quickly, and can run short distances at up to 75 kilometers per hour. Nowadays, they are kept as pets, compete as show dogs, and participate in a dog sport called lure coursing, which is similar to rabbit hunting.\n\nTheir face is long and skinny, with ears that drop down on the sides of their head. The Afghan Hound is tall and thin, with a long tail that curls and is held high up in the air.\n\nThe Afghan Hound is one of the most difficult types of dogs to train. Unlike many kinds of dogs, they do not like to listen to commands, and would rather make their own choices. In \"The Intelligence of Dogs\", the Afghan Hound came in last place for \"working intelligence.\" This does not mean that the Afghan Hound is stupid; it means that it is easier to encourage other dogs to follow instructions than the Afghan Hound.\n\nThey like to run, and because they can run very fast, they need to be kept on a leash or in a fenced area. Fences need to be very high to keep the Afghan Hound from escaping, because they can easily jump several meters in the air. Afghan Hounds cannot live in the same house as a cat or any other small animal, as they will try to chase or hunt it.\n\nThis is a quiet dog for indoors, but needs to have regular exercise and play time. They need to have the chance to run in a safe, fenced area at least once a week. If an Afghan gets bored, it can tear things up. This is a friendly dog that is not shy with people or other dogs. Many people who own Afghan Hounds say that they are \"clownish\" and silly, because they are very playful. Afghan Hounds are known to be very sensitive to injuries and complain a lot when they have them.\n\nAfghan Hounds are mostly very healthy dogs, but do get some diseases more often than others. Because their tails are very long and thin, they can hurt them quite easily. These dogs are very sensitive to anesthetic, so if they are getting an operation, the vet must be very careful with the amount of anesthetic given. Their eyes can develop cataracts, which will make the dog blind if they are not removed.\n", "id": "234412", "title": "Afghan Hound"}

This is done using computer models of the atmosphere. Such models describe the current weather conditions, and how they change over time using equations. Using the current weather conditions, the equations can be solved, or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future. The relevant physical parameters, such as pressure, temperature, the direction and the speed of the wind are taken to be functions of time. These are modelled with a system of partial differential equations. This is a dynamic system that is solved numerically. Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN. The equations are approximated. Since this takes a lot of computing power or time, supercomputers are used for this task, most of the time. \n\nThe atmosphere is modelled as a fluid. The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time. The equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.\n\nThe results are usually too inaccurate to be used for predicting the weather at any place. For this reason, meteorologists check the values, and compare them to historical data. In other words, they use the data to help produce the weather forecast.\n\nModel Output Statistics is a statistical model that was developed in the 1960s and 1970s. It uses regression analysis for a fully automated forecast. With it, historical data is analysed automatically. One of its applications is called Direct Model Output. MOS uses both historical data and statistical modeling. Predictions beyond about six hours are unreliable. \n\nAnother well-known model is called Global Forecast System (GFS), which is run by the US weather service, NOAA. It gives a forecast four times a day. Since the information is free, the GFS is often used, especially by smaller weather stations.\n\nThe atmosphere is a chaotic system. A small change of the input values does not necessarily lead to a small change of the output. This is due to the equations of fluid dynamics that are involved. These equations involved are solved or approximated once with the parameters that were observed. This is done several times more, with parameters that are based on the observed values, but which have been changed slightly. Because the computing power is limited, the \"resolution\" of such a model is more coarse. Once all the calculations are finished, they are compared to one another. Calculated results that are \"similar\" indicate that the prognosis is relatively good. In some cases, this means that it is possible to accurately predict the weather for a time of about ten days; in other cases a prediction over even a few days may be difficult.\n\n", "id": "234424", "title": "Numerical weather prediction"}

This book said that French Canadians people made up the Paul Bunyan stories during the Papineau Rebellion of 1837, when they were fighting against England. This would explain why Paul Bunyan's last name is \"Bunyan\", because \"Bunyan\" sounds like the French-Canadian slang word \"Bonyenne\", which is something that they might say when they are surprised, like how people who speak English might say \"Good Grief\" or \"My Goodness\". People told other people stories about Bunyan, and the stories would change a little bit as they spread from person to person. Often, Paul Bunyan is shown in pictures with a giant blue ox named Babe. Historians think that Babe was not created until the 20th century for advertising.\n\nAccording to legend, when Bunyan was born, it took three storks to carry him. (In some stories storks carry babies and drop them off at their parents' houses.). When he became older, he broke every window in the house when he clapped or laughed. When he was seven months old, he sawed the legs off his parent's bed in the middle of the night.

When, the same year, she entered the tournament in Carlsbad, Viennese master Albert Becker ridiculed her entry by suggesting that any player whom Menchik defeated in tournament play should be granted membership into the \"Vera Menchik Club\". In the tournament, Becker himself became the first member of the \"club\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=234589", "text": "History of chess\n\nThe history of chess goes back almost 1500 years. The game originated in northern India in the 6th century and spread to Persia. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently, through the Moorish conquest of Spain, spread to Southern Europe. \n\nIn Europe, the moves of the pieces changed in the 15th century. The modern game starts with these changes. In the second half of the 19th century, modern tournament play began. Chess clocks were first used in 1883, and the first world chess championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw advances in chess theory, and the establishment of the World Chess Federation (FIDE). Chess engines (programs that play chess), and chess data bases became important.\n\n\nThe precursors of chess originated in northern India during the Gupta empire, where its early form in the 6th century was known as Chaturanga. This translates as 'the four divisions', meaning infantry, cavalry, elephantry, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford Companion to Chess\" 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref> \n\nIn Sassanid Persia around 600 the name became \"Chatrang\" and the rules were developed further, and players started calling \"Shāh!\" (Persian for 'King') when threatening the opponent's king, and \"Shāh māt!\" (Persian for 'the king is finished') when the king could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.\n\nThe game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names; in Arabic \"māt\" or \"māta\" مَاتَ means \"died\", \"is dead\". In Arabic, the game became Shatranj. In all other languages, the name of the game is derived either from \"shatranj\" or from \"shah\".\n\nThe following table provides a glimpse of the changes in the names and character of chess pieces, as they passed from one culture to another, from India through Persia to Europe:\n\nChanges in the Arabic names of pieces happened over several centuries after the game arrived in Europe. Most changed were the pieces which had no equivalent in Europe, such as the elephant (al-fil), the visier (an advisor: the firzan or wazir), and the chariot (rukhkh). The greatest variety of names was for the elephant, which was not seen in Europe, and so not used in war. In Spain names derived from Arabic lasted for centuries (alfil, aufin, orfil...). Eventually, all but France used a word for \"bishop\". In a similar manner, vizir eventually became \"queen\", and the chariot became a word for \"castle\". Except, that is, in English, where \"rook\" is obviously a version of \"rukh\". The following table does not capture all these complicated changes.\n\nThe game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe. Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century, it was described in a famous 13th century manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon and dice named the \"Libro de los juegos\".\n\nBuddhist pilgrims, Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East, where it was transformed into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares. Chinese chess and Shogi are the most important of the oriental chess variants. However, it was the changes made in medieval Europe which led to our modern game.\n\nThe game of chess is really two games. There is the original Indo-Arabic game, and there is the modern game, usually called 'international chess'. The transition between the two happened during the change from the medieval world to the modern world, in the Europe of the later 15th century. In fact, the new game of chess was one of the early topics chosen for the new technology of printing.\n\nIn early chess the moves of the pieces were:\n\nThe game could be won by 1. Mating the king; 2. By giving stalemate; 3. By capturing all the opponent's pieces. This kept down the number of draws.\n\nIn Europe some of the pieces got new names:\n\nAbout 500 years after chess first reached Europe, after some smaller experiments, there were big changes in the way the pieces moved. The effect was to make the start of the game run faster, and get the opposing pieces in contact sooner. The changes were:\n\nThese changes made most of the older chess culture obsolete. The slow development in the openings was replaced by gambits and rapid attacks. The relative values of the pieces are changed. The game can now only be won by mate or resignation by one of the players. Originally, this was not seen as a problem, but as technique improved, so did the number of draws. This became a matter for discussion in the early 20th century. The limited number of ways to win changed what players needed to win in the endgame; many endgames which could be won with the old rules now were drawn.\n\nThe first printed work on chess to survive to the present day is Luis de Lucena's \"Arte de axedres\", printed in Salamanca, Spain. It can be dated to 1496 or 1497. It presents a number of chess problems, some of which are in the old rules (\"del viejo\"), some in the new rules (\"dela dama\"). This suggests that the transition is not quite complete, and some readers might not know about the new rules. By 1512, when Damiano published his \"Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi\" in Rome, it only included problems with the new rules, and does not mention the medieval game. The same applies to the Gottingen manuscript, probably written in Spain or Portugal. Though it has been claimed to be earlier, its content suggests it was not written before 1500. England and Germany received the reformed game by 1530. After that, the old game was effectively dead -- in Europe, at any rate. A version of the old game survived in India until recently.\n\nModern chess theory was slow in developing. After the new moves of the pieces, players spent their time playing gambits, and trying to mate each other. The games of Gioacchino Greco (1600– ~1634) clearly show this. The first ideas as to how to win indirectly, 'positionally', started with Philidor. Modern chess has a lot of indirect manoeuvering of a kind the old Arabic players would have understood. They could not attack directly, because their Alfil and Firzān (our bishop and queen) had such limited moves.\n\nOne interesting fact is that the Arabs divided their game into the same three stages which we do today: opening, middlegame and endgame.\n\nAt the start of a game, the Arabic masters took a number of moves before the pieces were in contact with the other side.\n\nThe table, based roughly on square control, suggests the modern game deploys about 20% more force on the board than the older game. However, this understates the case, since the table does not allow for castling, nor the initial optional double move of the pawn. Also, the pawn promotion to the new queen is hugely significant when it takes place. No exact value can be placed on these elements, but perhaps the modern game makes use of up to a third more force than in the original game.\n\nSingle pieces found in archaeology are seldom taken as chessmen; they are much more likely to be general art objects. \"Groups\" of small objects are more likely chessmen if there are of more than two types. Many board games have used two kinds of pieces, but only chess uses six different kinds. A dig might not turn up all six forms, but more than two is indicative of chess. If the forms have characteristic chess figures (foot soldiers, kings, man on horse) this is even more convincing.\n\nThe evidence from archaeology comes mostly from the discovery of early chess sets, and also from rock art: carvings (petroglyphs) and paintings on rock. \n\nThe earliest chessmen found are the Afrosiab collection. In 1977 the Uzbekistan Academy of Archaeology conducted a dig at Afrosiab, near Samarkand. Samarkand is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, and at times it has been one of the greatest cities of Central Asia. Samarkand is on the trade route between China and the Mediterranean (the Silk Road), and so it is a logical place for a trader to store some of his precious goods.\n\nThe Afrosiab finds include seven chess pieces. They are heavily worn, but they include: two foot soldiers with shields and short swords (= our pawns); a war elephant with chain armour and a rider in full battle-dress (= our bishop); a visier (= our queen) with two horses with armed rider; two mounted riders with sword and shield (= knights); and the Shah, on a three-horse chariot, holding a mace-like symbol of power (= our king). That is five out of the six types of piece, and completely convincing as a chess set. The rukh (rook) is also known: it features a three-horse chariot with two men, one driving, and the other armed with sword and shield. \n\nThis group is dated to the 7th–8th centuries, and probably come from the end of the Sassanid Empire just before the Arabic conquest. They are \"representational\", meaning they are small carvings (though somewhat crude) of war men and equipment. Later Arabic sets became abstract shapes, in accordance with their religious teaching.\n", "id": "234589", "title": "History of chess"}

He was the grandson of the opera composer Richard Wagner and great-grandson of the composer Franz Liszt. For 42 years he was director of the Bayreuth Festival, which was created by Richard Wagner for the performances of his operas. At first he was director together with his brother Wieland. After Wieland died he continued to be director until he retired in 2008. He tried to get rid of the festival’s Nazi past, and put on productions which were very symbolic: using lighting effects instead of complicated scenery and heavy costumes.\n\nWagner was born in Bayreuth. His mother, Winifred Wagner (born Williams-Klindworth), was English. She married Richard Wagner’s son Siegfried, who was much older than she was. Although Siegfried was gay they had two sons (Wieland and Wolfgang) and two daughters.\n\nWhen Siegfried died in 1930 Winifred took over the running of the festival. She was friends with Adolf Hitler who often came to the performances. Hitler became a family friend. The children called him “Uncle Adolf” or “Uncle Wolf” (his nickname). When World War II started, Wieland did not have to fight in the army because Hitler said he was too important for German culture. However, Wolfgang had to fight, and he was wounded in Poland, but got better. He started to produce operas in Berlin. Hitler liked him, but he never joined the Nazi party.\n\nDuring the war a lot of Bayreuth buildings were damaged, but not the theatre. The Americans used it for religious services. After the war Winifred was not allowed to run the opera house because of her Nazi past, but Wieland became director and Wolfgang looked after the money. The two brothers started the festival again in 1951. They formed the orchestra again, and invited Hans Knappertsbusch and Herbert von Karajan to conduct. They deliberately avoided using lots of scenery and made use of symbolic ideas, especially lighting.\n\nWhen Wieland died in 1966 Wolfgang was the only director. He continued the modern ideas of his brother, using very simple staging techniques. The production of Wagner’s \"Ring Cycle\" in 1976 by the opera director Patrice Chéreau was particularly important. Many people loved it, others disagreed with it. The production of the Ring Cycle in 1983 by Peter Hall, conducted by Georg Solti celebrated the 100th birthday of Richard Wagner. People argued about this production, too. Since then, many famous people have visited the festival, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the German President Horst Köhler. In 1982 Grace Bumbry was the first black person to sing at the festival (she sang the part of Venus in \"Tannhäuser\". Some of the audience thought this was shocking, but she sang so beautifully that everyone applauded for 30 minutes. She had to take 42 curtain calls.\n\nWolfgang married twice. His first wife was Ellen Drexel. He had two children by this marriage. He argued with them. His son did not like the family’s past Nazi connections, and the daughter Eva argued about the control of the festival. Wolfgang later married Gudrun Mack, with whom he had a daughter Katharina. Eva and Katharina now run the festival.\n\nWolfgang died aged 90 in Bayreuth in 2010.\n\n", "id": "234602", "title": "Wolfgang Wagner"}

People who support supply-side economics believe that taxes punished productivity and if they were lowered, people would produce more goods and services. Many supporters of supply-side economics also support things such as limited government spending, low inflation, and regulating the economy less.\n\nEconomist Arthur Laffer supported supply-side economics with a theory called a . The theory stated that government will get no money if taxes were too high—nobody would pay them—and that the government would not get enough money if taxes were too low. The theory also stated that if taxes were too high, the economy would be less productive and it would give the government less money and that if taxes were low, the economy would be productive and the government would get more money. \n\nSupply-side economics was used while Ronald Reagan was president during the 1980's. Income taxes on the wealthiest Americans were cut from 70% to 50% to 28% during his two terms. Also, capital gains taxes were cut. Supporters of supply-side economics mention that those tax cuts have resulted in economic recovery during the 1980's and the strong economic boom in the 1990's and first decade of the 21st century.\n\nCritics of supply-side economics say that the wealth get handed tons of money in hopes that a very small amount of it will trickle down to the poor, and they call it voodoo economics. Many critics say that supply-side economic policies are bad because it results in a bigger gap between the rich and the poor. They also criticize that the reduction in taxes results in cutting programs for the poor people who need it.

Détente primarily was concerned with relation between USA and USSR but other countries like China, West Germany and most of the European states also played their role in developing it.

They are between the pelvis and the base of the tail. The castor sacs are not glands.\n\nToday, castoreum is used to trap animals. It is used also to make perfumes. It is also used as a drug.\n\nCastoreum is used in perfume-making. It is used to describe the solution from the alcohol-tinted and dried beaver castor. Dried beaver castor sacs are aged for two or more years. They are aged to soften. They are also aged for their harshness to vanish. In the science of perfume, castoreum is mainly used as a smell for leather. It is often used with other ingredients. There are some classic perfumes that use castor. They are Emeraude, Coty Chanel Cuir de Russie, Magie Noire, Lancôme Caractère, Hechter Madame, Carven, Givenchy III, Shalimar, and many \"leather\" perfumes.\n\nModern use of castoreum is rare in medicine. However, the dried pair of castors may still be worth more than the beaver's fur. Castoreum appeared in medicine until the 1700s. It was used to treat many different sicknesses. Some of the sicknesses it helped treat are headache, fever, and hysteria. The Romans believed the smells made by burning castoreum could bring about an abortion. Paracelsus thought it could be used in the treatment of seizures. Medieval beekeepers used it to make more honey.\n\nCastoreum is also used to add to the flavor and smell of cigarettes.\n\n", "id": "234863", "title": "Castoreum"}

He was born into a family of musicians who served at the French court. He became the author of a book on chess which influenced players for many years.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford Companion to Chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref>\n\nHis family name had once been Duncan, until they came from Scotland to Brittany. Danican was then their family name. Then, after their appointment to the court of King Louis XIII in the 17th century, they adopted the name Philidor as a tribute to an Italian court musician called Filidori. Young Philidor was trained in music from an early age, and learnt chess from musicians in intervals between musical numbers. He turned out to be equally good at both activities, though initially the music came first.\n\nPhilidor took chess lessons from the leading French master of the time, du Kermeur, Sire de Légall (known as Légall). After three years, he was on equal terms. In 1746 he found himself in Rotterdam without money, after a tour had ended in the death of a young girl harpsichord player. He started to play chess for money, and came to London in 1747 to play a match against the strongest English player, whom he beat. Thus started his new life. He played chess in London, and wrote light operatic scores for the \"Comédie-Française\" in Paris.\n\nPhilidor started playing regularly about 1740 at the Parisian Café de la Régence. It was there that he played with a friend from 'New England', Mr. Benjamin Franklin. \n\nAt 21 Philidor met the Syrian Philip Stamma of Aleppo, who was a translator and chess player of note. Philidor won by 8½–1⅓. At 29 he defeated his tutor Légall in a match. Unfortunately, none of these games survive, though we do have a number of games from his later career. In 1744, as a teenager, he could play two games of chess simultaneously blindfold, and in Berlin he played three games withought sight of the board. He gave these exhibitions many times. This was thought to be a marvel, though it had been done before, by an Italian priest, Saccheri. \n\nIn 1749 he published a book on chess which was to make his name. The first edition, in French, included a subscription list of prosperous sponsors, such as the Earl of Sandwich and the Duke of Cumberland. An edition in English, \"Chess analysed\", came out in 1750. He revised and extended the book twice, in 1777 and 1790.\n\nOver the years, the book was a steady success. By 1871, it had gone through about 70 editions, and had been translated into English, German, Russian and Italian. Eventually it went through over a hundred editions in ten languages. \n\nAs one commentator said:\nPhilidor's motto \"Les pions sont de l'âme du jeu\" (Pawns are the soul of chess) is a saying which is still taught to young players today. It sums up the idea that the pawn 'skeleton' gives the game its long-term structure, and influences how a game proceeds.\n\nPhilidor’s book was the first (1) that gave detailed annotations on how to play the middlegame, (2) that presented chess strategy as a whole, and (3) that presented the concepts of the blockade, prophylaxis, positional sacrifice, and mobility of the pawn formation (though without fully identifying those ideas).\n\nPhilidor also studied chess endgames, and the book gives generally accurate information about them. An important chess endgame position that he wrote about is called the \"Philidor position\".\n\nHe gave his name to one of the basic chess openings, Philidor's defence. \n\nPhilidor was now received into fashionable society in France and England. He took his mistress with him to Prussia, then back to England. Later, in 1760, he married a singer, and had seven children. Philidor played chess at the Café de la Régence in Paris, and at the Salopian Coffee-house and at Parsloe's chess club in London.\n\nPhilidor's contemporaries had some difficulty believing he could be so good at two such different arts, but he was. His work on comic opera (\"opéra bouffe\") excelled. He wrote 25 such works, four with collaborators (including Rousseau). \"His \"Tom Jones\" (1765) was regarded as the finest work in the theatre... His \"Ernelinda, Princess of Norway\" (1766) so pleased Louis XV that he gave Philidor a pension of 25 \"louis d'or\" (French gold coin) from his own purse\". The English, however, ignored his music, and after 1892 he never returned home. The French Revolution made his connection with royalty a danger.\n\nPhilidor died in 1795, and the \"Comédie-Française\" held a benefit concert for his widow.\n", "id": "234940", "title": "Philidor"}

Quintanilla III. A former Selena y Los Dinos member, Pete Astudillo, co-wrote the song. It was on her third album, \"Entre A Mi Mundo\" (1992). The song talks about a sad woman who is hurting because she has lost her boyfriend and she is explaining how it hurts to lose his love but she is saying that his love was like a flower that has dried up and died. As he says goodbye he takes her heart with him she hopes someday some other woman or his new woman will give him what he is looking for.\n\nThe song was released in the United States and Mexico in October 1992. It was the third single off of the album, following \"La Carcacha\" (\"The Jalopy\"). It was the lead single in both countries. The single reached number-one on the Mexican Singles Chart and the \"MonitorLatino\" charts. This gave Selena her first number-one song as a solo artist. Despite the success, a music video was not produced. \"Como La Flor\" helped Selena to be accepted into Mexico. She toured there for the first time after the single peaked at number-one. \"Como La Flor\" also became one of her signature songs.\n\nVarious recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of \"Como La Flor\", some being non-Hispanic.

At that time it was given the name \"Concepción del Nuevo Extremo\". The new settlement of Concepción was just a few kilometers north of La Frontera (The Frontier), the boundary between Spanish territory and the land of the Mapuche, an American Indian ethnic group that remained independent until the 1870s. The settlement was formally recognized by the Spanish authorities as a town two years later by a royal decree. It was given a coat-of-arms that is still in use today.\n\nEarthquakes and tsunamis, which razed the town in 1570, 1657, 1687, 1730 and 1751, led the authorities to move the town to its current site in the Valle de la Mocha, alongside the Bío-Bío River.\n\nOn February 27, 2010, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the city of Concepción, killing more than 700 people and injuring thousands nationwide. Following the earthquake, geologists relying on global positioning satellite (GPS) data concluded that the city had been displaced roughly 3 meters (10 feet) to the west as a result of the event. Fortunately, the city avoided the tsunami that followed the earthquake.\n\nThe climate of Concepción is classified as Köppen climate classification \"csb\", with a dry summer nadir in February. It has an oceanic influence which keeps temperatures mild throughout the year. Wet snows are possible in winter, but snow does not remain for long.\nThe chart at right provides a climate summary for Concepción.\n\nTo an outsider, there may be confusion between the demonyms of the inhabitants of Concepción and the nearby city of Penco. Due to the previous location of Concepción being where Penco currently stands, inhabitants of Concepción are called \"penquistas\" while inhabitants of Penco are known as \"pencones\".\n\nConcepción is one of the most active cities in Chilean rock music and many famous rock groups in Chile started up in Concepción.\ncepción has the second largest concentration of universities in Chile, and is home to three major universities.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235179", "text": "Mass versus weight\n\nIn the physical sciences, mass and weight are different. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in the object. Weight is a measure of the force on the object caused by a gravitational field. In other words, weight is how hard gravity pulls on an object. This means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earth's surface, but if it is moved from the equator to the North Pole, its weight will grow by 0.5% because of the increase in the earth's gravitational field.\n\nMass is measured in kilograms or pounds. A one-liter volume of water has a mass of one kilogram. Weight is measured in newtons, the standard unit for force. A one-kilogram mass placed on a bench presses down on the bench with almost ten newtons of force. \n\nThe weight of something is the value measured at the Earth's surface. Unfortunately the common terms used to describe the weight of an object are units of mass such as kilograms or pounds. For almost all of human history weight has been measured on the surface of the Earth. Here, the weight is proportional to the mass. Objects which have the same mass have the same weight. An object with the twice the mass of another will also have twice the weight. As a consequence it is common practice to use the two words, mass and weight, as if they mean the same thing, and to use kilograms or pounds as the units for both mass and weight. Using the same terms to describe and measure the two different properties has led to confusion between these two properties, mass and weight. Mass and weight are not the same thing.\n\nGenerally, mass refers to how \"heavy\" something is. However, mass is really an \"inertial\" property; that is, the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. According to Newton's second law of motion, as expressed in the formula an object with a mass, \"m\", of one kilogram will accelerate, \"a\", at one meter per second per second (about one-tenth the acceleration due to Earth's gravity) when acted upon by a force, \"F\", of one newton.\n\nIt is possible to feel the difference between weight and mass by suspending an object with a mass of over ten kilograms on a rope with a length of two or more meters. If a person pushes upwards against the underneath of the object with one finger they will feel the weight of the object. If they push momentarily against the side of the suspended object with one finger they will feel the mass of the object. (It is important that they do not push the object sideways far enough to begin to raise it.)\n", "id": "235179", "title": "Mass versus weight"}

He bombarded the assembly with two bombs. They were shouting slogans of revolution and threw pamphlets.\n\nAfter the bombarding, they surrendered. He was held on this charge in prison.

Leftist and Muslim militant authors, works critical of the government, and works with sections or topics that are seen as sexually or culturally controversial have been banned from the book fair. During the 2000 book fair, Islamist protests became violent. That year, more than 2000 members of Muslim student groups protested outside Al-Azhar University. This led to rare public protests against the Egyptian government, violence, 75 arrests and a number of injuries. The students were protesting an Egyptian Ministry of Culture publisher printing and selling copies of the 1983 novel \"A Banquet for Seaweed\" by the Syrian writer Haidar Haidar. After the protests, two members of the government printing house were also arrested for \"disparaging religion\" and publishing a work \"offensive to public morals\".\n\nIn later years a number of books from foreign publishers have been taken by Egyptian authorities. These have included works by Czech Milan Kundera, Moroccan Mohamed Choukri, Saudi Ibrahim Badi, Lebanese Hanan al-Sheikh, and fellow Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury In 2005, Egyptian police arrested a number of book sellers and activists at the book fair. Two Egyptian journalists were arrested for giving out \"false propaganda against the government\" and others for presenting socialist work.\n\n\n", "id": "235344", "title": "Cairo International Book Fair"}

During the 1920s, he was one of the hypermoderns, and won many tournaments. In 1927, he became World Champion by beating Capablanca. The match of 34 games was the longest world championship match held until 1985.\n\nIn the early 1930s Alekhine dominated tournament play, and won top-class tournaments by large margins. He also played first board for France in four Chess Olympiads, winning prizes in each. His tournament record became less good from the mid-1930s onwards; alcoholism is often blamed for this. Although Alekhine offered Capablanca a rematch on the same terms that Capablanca had set for him, negotiations dragged on for years. It became clear that Alekhine would never let the match take place. Meanwhile, he defended his title with ease against Bogolyubov in 1929 and 1934.\n\nAlekhine was defeated by Euwe in 1935, but regained his crown in the 1937 rematch. His tournament record was now uneven, and rising stars (such as Keres and Botvinnik) threatened his title. Negotiations for a title match were halted by the start of World War II in 1939.\n\nAlekhine was known for his attacking style: he was good at turning an initiative into a win. He was the first world champion to work hard on opening theory. Alekhine was the first to be a full-time dedicated professional of the modern type. He said he spent eight hours a day studying the game, and produced many innovations in chess openings.\n\nAlekhine was declared an \"Enemy of the Soviet Union\" after making anti-Bolshevik statements in 1927. However, after his death, the Soviet chess leaders called him \"one of the founders of the Soviet School of Chess\". He is still highly regarded as a chess writer. His finest works were his collections of his own games, which influenced many players.\n\nAlekhine was a brilliant player with a poor character: \"Not everyone liked his personal character, but all admired his chess genius\". That he sometimes lied, and was often half-drunk is mentioned by all his biographers. He married a Russian baroness in 1920, which legitimised their seven-year-old daughter. The following year he married a Swiss woman, and obtained permission to leave Russia. This marriage, which was probably bigamous, broke up soon after. Later he married twice more. He settled in Paris, becoming a naturalised French citizen. He studied law at the Sorbonne, and claimed to have got a doctorate there in 1925: he was known widely as 'Dr. Alekhine'. Researchers have failed to find any trace of this in the records of the Sorbonne. Having at last won the world title, Alekhine used every device to avoid giving Capablanca a return match. He remarked to a friend \"Somehow the match will never take place\".\n\nAlekhine stayed in Nazi-occupied Europe during the war, where he played in tournaments organised by the Nazis. Anti-Semitic articles appeared under his name. Although he later claimed they were forged by the Nazis, the original manuscripts in his hand were found amongst his last wife's effects when she died.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\" 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-866164-1</ref> Whether Alekhine was personally anti-semitic is not so clear. He had good relationships with some Jewish chess players, and his fourth wife was Jewish. Negotiations with Mikhail Botvinnik for a world title match were proceeding in 1946 when Alekhine died in Portugal. \"It is not too callous to say that he was fortunate to have died at that time. Feeling was very strong in France against those who came under suspicion of collaboration with the enemy\".\n\nAlekine wrote over twenty books on chess. Some of the best-known are:\n", "id": "235346", "title": "Alexander Alekhine"}

Some of his poems are \"Paul Revere's Ride\", \"The Song of Hiawatha\", and \"Evangeline\". He was also the first American to translate Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\". He was one of the five Fireside Poets. He was one of the most influential persons in the culture of the 1800s in the USA.\n\nLongfellow was born in Portland, Maine and studied at Bowdoin College. He then spent time in Europe. He returned and became a professor at Bowdoin and, later, at Harvard College. His first major books of poetry were \"Voices of the Night\" (1839) and \"Ballads and Other Poems\" (1841). Longfellow retired from teaching in 1854 to spend more time writing. He lived the rest of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts, living in George Washington's old headquarters building. His first wife, Mary Potter, died in 1835 after a miscarriage. His second wife, Frances Appleton, died in 1861 after her dress caught fire. Longfellow had difficulty writing poetry for a time after she died. He mostly worked on his translation. He died in 1882.\n\nLongfellow mainly wrote lyric poems which are known for their musicality. His poems often told stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet while he was alive. He was also successful in other countries. Some criticized him for imitating European styles and for writing poems for everyday people. In 1884, Longfellow became the first non-British writer for whom a commemorative bust was placed in Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey in London. He is the only American poet represented with a bust.\n\nLongfellow was born in Maine. One of his grandfathers was a state Senator and the other grandfather had been a Revolutionary War general and a Congressman. Then following his graduation in 1826 from Bowdoin College, where he was a classmate of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Longfellow went to Europe to study.\n\nWhen he returned to the United States three years later, he taught European languages, first at Bowdoin and then at Harvard.\n\nAfter 18 years of teaching at Harvard, he resigned his position because he felt it interfered with his writing.\n\nHe was a commanding person in the culture life of 19-century America, a romantic who identified with the great traditions of European literature and thought. Also at the same time, he was rooted in American life and history that charged his imagination with amazing themes and made him ambitious for success.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Longfellow received many honors, including honorary degrees from Cambridge and Oxford Universities in England. After his death, a bust of Longfellow was placed in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey—the first American to be so honored. In the late 19th century, Longfellow was without a doubt the most popular American poet.\n\n\n\nSources\nOther\n", "id": "235446", "title": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow"}

It was first performed at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London on 1 December 1951. It is based on the short novel \"Billy Budd\" by Herman Melville. The libretto for the opera was written by E.M.Forster and Eric Crozier.\n\nBritten originally wanted the part of Billy Budd to be sung by Geraint Evans, but Evans found that the notes were too high for his voice, so he sang a different role, and the role of Billy Budd was sung by Theodor Uppman. The first performance was a great success.\n\nIn the original version the opera had four acts, but in 1960 Britten made some changes to the opera, making the story fit into two acts. Not everybody agrees about which version is the better one.\n\nFamous baritones who have sung the role of Billy Budd include Thomas Allen, Simon Keenlyside, Richard Stilwell, and Thomas Hampson. There are no women in the opera at all.\n\nThe story takes place on board the battleship HMS \"Indomitable\" in 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars. There is a short prologue at the beginning, and an epilogue at the end, during which the old captain is thinking back about the story which happened many years earlier. The rest of the opera tells that story.\n\nCaptain Vere, an old man, is thinking back on his life and his time in the navy. He thinks about what happened to Billy Budd some years earlier, and he feels sad because he was not able to save him.\n\nThe crew of the Indomitable are working on deck. There is a new man working there (the Novice). He slips and bumps into an officer. The novice is cruelly flogged (beaten) for this. At the same another crew member comes with three new young men who have been pressed (forced) into coming to work on the ship. One of these three men is Billy Budd.\n\nBilly Budd is very happy at his new job. He does realize how cruelly he is going to be treated. The man in charge of the crew is Claggart. He is the Master-at-Arms, and he is very cruel. He says he thinks Billy Budd is a fine young man, although he has a stammer. Billy happily says goodbye to the ship he used to work on, called \"Rights of Man\". He does not see the irony in that ship’s name (there he did at least have some rights, but now he is to be treated badly. The word “indomitable” means: “something that cannot be defeated”.) Claggart does not like Billy’s attitude, and tells Squeak to watch him carefully.\n\nThe Novice comes back from his flogging. He is in such pain that he cannot walk. Billy is shocked, but thinks he himself will not be treated like that so long as he obeys the ship’s rules.\n\nDansker tells the new men that Captain Vere's nickname is \"Starry Vere,\". Billy thinks that he must be a good man and swears loyalty to him, although he has not seen him yet. In the four-act version Captain Vere comes on deck and encourages the men to do well in battle.\n\nIn his cabin, Captain Vere talks with his officers about the French revolution. They talk about the mutinees that have happened in the British Navy. The officers say that Billy might cause trouble, but Vere thinks his men are all good.\n\nWhen Billy finds Squeak looking through his belongings he becomes angry and his stammer gets worse. He knocks Squeak to the ground. Claggart seems to be on Billy’s side, so he is not punished. However, Claggart wants to be evil to Billy. He gives some money to the Novice and tells him he should persuade Billy to start a mutiny, and that he should give Billy the money as a bribe. The Novice does not dare to refuse. Billy refuses the bribe and thinks he will be rewarded, but Dansker warns him that Claggart is dangerous. Billy is too naïve to understand what Dansker is saying. They sing a duet in which Billy sings how wonderful life is on the ship, and Dansker is trying to warn Billy about Claggart: “Jemmy-legs is down on you”.\n\nClaggart begins to tell Vere that Billy could cause trouble, but is interrupted when a French ship is seen. The Indomitable attacks, but loses sight of the enemy in the mist. Claggart returns, and tells Vere that Billy poses a threat of mutiny. Vere does not believe him and sends for Billy so that Claggart may talk to him.\n\nLater, in Vere's cabin, Claggart repeats the false charge in Billy’s presence. Once again, Billy begins to stammer because he is so angry. Unable to speak, he hits Claggart and kills him. The Captain has to get the officers together. They decide Billy is guilty and sentence him to be hanged. Billy begs Vere to save him, and the officers ask him what they should do, but Vere stays silent. He goes into the cabin where Billy is being held. The music suggests that the captain is telling Billy about his death sentence.\n\nDansker brings Billy a drink. He tells him that the crew are willing to mutiny for his sake, but Billy accepts his fate. In the early morning the crew gather on deck and Billy is executed. Just before he dies he praises Vere, singing: \"Starry Vere, God Bless you!\", and the rest of the crew echo his words.\n\nVere, as an old man, remembers Billy's burial at sea. He thinks about how the young man had blessed him as he died, and he realizes that this was real goodness. Vere is now at peace with himself. The orchestra stops playing and Vere’s voice is heard as the lights fade.\n\n\n", "id": "235518", "title": "Billy Budd (opera)"}

It is the second-largest city in Uzbekistan and the capital of Samarqand Province. \n\nThe city is on the old Silk Road between China and the West, and is an Islamic centre for scholarly study. In the 14th century, it became the capital of the empire of Timur (Tamerlane), and is the site of his mausoleum, the Gur-e Amir. The Bibi-Khanym Mosque remains one of the city's most famous landmarks. The Registan was the ancient centre of the city. \n\nIn 2001, UNESCO added the 2,750-year-old city to its World Heritage Site list as \"Samarkand – Crossroads of Cultures\".\n\nSamarkand is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, prospering from its location on the trade route between China and the Mediterranean (Silk Road). At times Samarkand has been one of the greatest cities of Central Asia.\n\nFounded circa 700 BC by the Persians, Samarkand has been one of the main centres of Persian civilization from its early days. Alexander the Great conquered it in 329. \nAt the start of the 8th century Samarkand came under Arab control. Under Abbasid rule, the legend goes, the secret of papermaking was obtained from two Chinese prisoners in 751. This led to the first paper mill in the Islamic world being founded in Samarkand. The invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world, and from there to Europe.\n\nSamarkand was sacked by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1220 . Some of the people survived, but later Samarkand suffered at least one other Mongol sack. The town took many decades to recover from these disasters. In \"The Travels\" of Marco Polo, where Polo records his journey along the Silk Road, Samarkand is described as \"a very large and splendid city...\" He also writes about a Christian church in Samarkand, which miraculously remained standing after a portion of its central supporting column was removed.\n\nIn 1370, Timur the Lame, or Tamerlane, decided to make Samarkand the capital of his empire, which extended from India to Turkey. During the next 35 years he built a new city and populated it with artisans and craftsmen from all of the places he had conquered. Timur gained a reputation as a patron of the arts, and Samarkand grew to have a population of about 150,000. \n\nIn 1499, the Uzbek Turks took control of Samarkand. They moved the capital to Bukhara and Samarkand went into decline. The city came under Russian rule in 1868. The Russian section of the city was built after this point, largely to the west of the old city.\n\nThe city later became the capital of the Samarkand Oblast of Russian Turkestan and grew in importance still further when the Trans-Caspian railway reached the city in 1888. It became the capital of the Uzbek SSR in 1925 before being replaced by Tashkent in 1930.\n", "id": "235561", "title": "Samarkand"}

For decades, the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake \"response spectrum method\" which, also, contributed to the proposed building code's concept of today.\n\nHowever, those \"response spectra\" are good, mostly, for single-degree-of-freedom systems. Numerical \"step-by-step integration\", applied with the \"charts of seismic performance\", seems to be a more effective method of analysis for multi-degree-of-freedom structural systems at severe process of earthquake excitation.\n\nThe design of structures rests on authorized engineering procedures, principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure. Those criteria are consistent just with the contemporary state of the knowledge about building structures. Therefore, the building design which blindly follows some seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage.\n\nThe price of poor seismic analysis may be enormous.

The village was built on what was once an island, during the last Ice Age. The island was known as safe, and secure, and was inhabited even at that time. According to the records, the place name means \"place where there is water, at times\". There used to be a church in the village, around 800 AD. Unfortunately, this church was destroyed by the Hungarians around the year 900.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235602", "text": "Japanese American internment\n\nJapanese American internment happened during World War II, when the United States government forced about 110,000 Japanese Americans to leave their homes and live in internment camps. These were like prisons. Many of the people who were sent to internment camps had been born in the United States.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and declared war on the United States. Many Americans were angry, and some blamed all Japanese people for what had happened at Pearl Harbor. They spread rumors that some Japanese people knew about the attack ahead of time and had helped the Japanese military. The FBI and other parts of the United States government knew that these rumors were not true, but did not say anything.\n\nJapanese Americans began to feel that other Americans were becoming upset with them. For example, John Hughes, a man who read the news on the radio in Los Angeles, California, spent about a month saying bad things about Japanese Americans. There were reports of businesses that had anti-Japanese signs. For example, a barber shop put up a sign saying \"Free shaves for Japs\" and \"not responsible for accidents.\" A funeral home hung a sign saying \"I'd rather do business with a Jap than an American.\"\n\nIn February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. This order said that people who lived in some parts of the country could be taken out of those areas for any reason. While the order did not use the exact words \"Japanese Americans\", people knew that those were the people who would be taken out of those areas. The areas included all of California and the western parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. (See the area marked \"exclusion zone\" on the map on this page.) This was where most Japanese Americans lived at that time.\n\nTo keep Japanese Americans from leaving these areas on their own, the government stopped many of them from taking money out of their bank accounts. This made it harder for them to move. \n\nJapanese Americans were given only 48 hours to leave for internment camps in other states. They were only allowed to carry one bag with them, and could not bring radios or cameras.\n\nIn total, the United States forced over 110,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps.\n\nAbout 80% of the Japanese-American people who lived in the continental United States were forced to leave their homes and live in internment camps. More than three out of every five of these people were born in the United States, and were United States citizens. About half of the people sent to the camps were children.\n\nMost of the Japanese Americans who were interned lived in the continental United States. About 160,000 Japanese Americans lived in the state of Hawaii, but only a little over 1,000 of them were interned. Because there were so many Japanese American people living in such a small state, interning them would be almost impossible. \n\nThere were three government agencies that ran camps. Ninety percent of the Japanese Americans were in camps run by the War Relocation Authority (WRA). Only Japanese Americans lived in the WRA camps. \n\nTen percent of the Japanese Americans were in mixed-race camps. These were either run by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) or the United States Army. Many different people were interned in INS and Army camps. These people included:\n\nWRA camps were surrounded by barbed wire. They were also guarded by soldiers who waited in watchtowers holding guns.\nSome people were shot. For example, James Wakasa, who stepped outside the barbed wire fence, was shot and killed. The guard who shot him said that Wakasa was trying to escape, but the Japanese Americans in the camp did not believe the guard. Most of the camps were many miles away from the coast, and often in rural areas. Many of the camps were in the desert, which was uncomfortable for many of the Japanese Americans who were not used to that type of climate. This also meant that even if somebody escaped, there would be nowhere for them to go. \n\nIn the camps, people had to stand in line to eat or to go to the bathroom.\n\nOne famous camp was Manzanar, which was in California. Many Japanese from Los Angeles and San Francisco were sent there. Other camps included Poston in Arizona and Minidoka in Idaho. There were a few camps outside of the western U.S., such as Jerome in Arkansas. Japanese Americans were often crowded into small spaces, such as race tracks, before being sent to the camps.\nThe camps tried to provide medical care. Many of the people who worked in the camp hospitals were Japanese American doctors and nurses who lived in the internment camps. However, there were not enough doctors and nurses, and not enough medical supplies. Also, conditions at the camps helped cause some diseases. For example:\nA total of 1,862 people died from medical problems while in the internment camps. About one out of every 10 of these people died from tuberculosis.\n\nBy 1943, the government allowed some Japanese Americans to leave the camps to work or go to school. However, the government would not let them return to the West Coast. Some Japanese Americans were even allowed to serve as soldiers in the U.S. Army, and many served with honor in Europe. \n\nIn 1944, the United States government said that it would stop putting Japanese Americans in internment camps. The people who were placed in the camps were given $25 and a bus ticket home. However, it would take more than 40 years for the government to apologize to Japanese Americans for what had happened. In 1988, the government said it was sorry and paid $20,000 to people who had been sent to internment camps. Canada paid $21,000.\n\n", "id": "235602", "title": "Japanese American internment"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235614", "text": "Hominid (novel)\n\nHominid is a novel by Austrian writer Klaus Ebner. The story takes place millions of years ago and tells some days in the life of a group of hominids who live in Central Africa. The book was published by the Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008. \n\n\"Hominid\" takes place several million years ago in the Central African region between rainforest and savanna. The main characters are australopithecus afarenses, a hominid mostly living on trees that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told in the first person by the main character, Pitar. In thinking about his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his family to civilization: \"Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on\". His linguistic knowledge, thoughts and sayings are those of modern man, including a big knowledge about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Several comments made by Pitar about a particular object that has not been invented or developed yet, add to the funniness of the scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who says Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who often refers to Chinese philosophy.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to convince the other characters to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken over leadership from Thorn, who had died shortly before. The group builds windbreaks so that they may descend more often from the trees, which has a higher risk of being attacked by wild animals on the ground. Costello and Re are rivals. Re not only questions the leading abilities of Costello, but also wants to possess Costello's females. To calm down the arising quarrel, Pitar tries to found a parliament in order to settle conflicts peacefully. Whereas Costello thinks the parliament would be a forum in which he can strengthen his power, quoting from famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln, the other members ruin the idea because they have no discipline and feel indifferent.\n\nOne of the subplots of the novel shows the love between Pitar and Maluma, a female member of the group. Costello pretends the group of females would be his personal harem, but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar, she breaks off her relationship with the leader. On each day, the characters discover new things. On the seventh day, everyone is exhausted from their work and needs rest. However, the calm is broken by the attack of a saber-toothed cat. Several members of the family are killed, including Costello, which allows Re to come to power. Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the group, saying: “We should leave in time, leave Re and his new Reich, which, when I'm taking into account Thorn's previous reign, would be the Third over here.” Pitar and Maluma leave toward the savanna in a move that remembers both the expulsion from paradise and the Out of Africa theory.\n\nThe novel has seven chapters, \"Day 1\" to \"Day 7\", with the action of each chapter taking place on consecutive days. The chapter titles refer to the seven days of the biblical Creation. Only odd-numbered chapters tell the love story. Writer Karin Gayer mentions in her review that the love story of Pitar and Maluma, and its positioning within the text, offers \"a second interpretation of the beginning and the end\".\n\nIn conversation with the Viennese regional leader of publisher Arovell, Ebner talked about the hidden meanings of his characters' names.\n\n\nThe idea to give prehistoric characters present-day knowledge and a modern language already arose in 2006. Since the author believed that this topic would not be enough for a longer novel, he did not continue working on it at first. The final impulse came with the literature prize Wiener Werkstattpreis in February 2008. The publication of a book offered by publisher FZA was an integral part of the award, and the publisher limited this book to 100 pages. For this purpose Ebner wrote and finalized his story and published the book in October of the same year. Publisher FZA introduced the work to the public in Vienna.\n\nHeinz Gerstinger means the book would be a “history of the awakening of the spirit of mankind”. The author has the events glided “into the playful by his gently irony”. Several reviewers underline the novel's ironic and satirical aspect. The names of the characters, Latin quotations and idioms add to this as much as the parallelism between the seven days of Creation and scientific hominization. Ingrid Reichel points out the perfect publication date, just in time for the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwin's evolution theory. Like other reviewers, who had written about Ebner's earlier books she underlines the complex use of a detail rich language which is “steeped in subtle insensitive humor”.\n\nThe many expressions in foreign languages, mostly in Latin, are untranslated in the first edition. In her review, Ingrid Reichel invites the publisher to add a glossary to a new edition. The author published such a glossary on his own website.\n\nDespite many clear allusions to several world religions, Ingrid Reichel says that the novel is a book for “readers with humor, for reasoners (…), for darwinists, on no account for creationists, to a lesser extent for people of faith, but rather for atheists, … and fundamentalists drop out entirely”. Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when mentioning the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the story's society and the social matriarchy, the first resembling Chimpanzee communities and the second those of Bonobos. In addition, she points out the strength of the women characters. With regard to these underlying comparisons she says: “On another level we are struck by the permanent verbal mix of the ape-like and the human, a combination which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we, who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense, should finally classify man.”.\n\n\n\n", "id": "235614", "title": "Hominid (novel)"}

There are many different methods of strength training, the most common being the weight/gravity training and the training with the help of resistive equipment.\n\nWhen properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased bone, muscle, tendon and ligament strength, improved joint function, reduced potential for injury, increased bone density, a temporary increase in metabolism, improved cardiac function.\n\nTraining commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental increases of weight, elastic tension or other resistance, and uses a variety of exercises and types of training equipment to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity.\n\nStrength training differs from \"bodybuilding\", \"weightlifting\", \"powerlifting\", and \"strongman\", which are sports rather than forms of exercise, although training for them totally depends on strength training. Many other sports use strength training as a part of their training regimen, notably football, lacrosse, basketball, hockey and track and field.\n\nSome samples of strength training exercises in a gym are presented in the picture gallery below.\nThe basic principles of strength training involve a number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance, size or shape by overloading of a group of muscles. Specific combination of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: sets with fewer reps can be performed using more force, but have a reduced impact on endurance.\n", "id": "235678", "title": "Strength training"}

Its task is to collect, archive, document and record bibliographically all German and German language publications from 1913 on, foreign publications about Germany, translations of German works, and the works of German-speaking emigrants published abroad between 1933 and 1945, and to make them available to the public. The German National Library maintains co-operative external relations on the national and international level. For example, it is the leading partner in developing and maintaining bibliographic rules and standards in Germany and plays a significant role in the development of international library standards. The cooperation with publishers is regulated by law since 1935 for the Deutsche Bücherei Leipzig, since 1969 for the Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt.\nDuties are shared between the facilities in Leipzig and Frankfurt am Main, with each center having a specific specialty area. A third facility, the Deutsches Musikarchiv Berlin (founded 1970), deals with all music-related archiving (both printed and recorded materials).\n\nAlready in 1848, there had been plans for a German national library. After the restauration, they were not followed any longer. The stock of books already in existence was stored at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. \nIn 1912, the town of Leipzig, seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair, the kingdom of Saxony and the Börsenverein der Deutschen Buchhändler (Association of German booksellers) agreed to found a German National Library located in Leipzig. Starting January 1, 1913, all publications in German language were systematically collected (including books from Austria and Switzerland). In the same year, Dr. Gustav Wahl was elected as the first director. In 1946 Dr. Georg Kurt Schauer, Heinrich Cobet, Vittorio Klostermann and Professor Hanns Wilhelm Eppelsheimer, director of the Frankfurt University Library, initiated the re-foundation of a German archive library based in Frankfurt am Main. The federal state representatives of the book trade in the American zone agreed to the proposal. The city of Frankfurt agreed to support the planned archive library with personnel and financial resources. The US military government gave its approval. The Library began its work in the tobacco room of the former Rothschild library, which served the bombed university library as accommodation. As a result there are two libraries in Germany, which assume the duties and function of a national library for the later GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively. Two national bibliographic catalogues appear, which are almost identical in content.\n\nIn July 2000, the DMA also assumed the role as repository for GEMA, Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte, a German music copyright organization. Since then, music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA, which covers both national archiving and copyright registration. The 210,000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA.\n\nWith the unification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the Deutsche Bücherei Leipzig and the Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt am Main were merged in the new institution Die Deutsche Bibliothek. The \"Law regarding the German National Library\" came into force on 29 June 2006. The expansion of the collection brief to include online publications set the course for collecting, cataloguing and storing such publications as part of Germany's cultural heritage. The Library's highest management body, the Administrative Council, was expanded to include two MPs from the Bundestag. The law also changed the name of the library and its buildings in Leipzig, Frankfurt am Main and Berlin into \"Deutsche Nationalbibliothek\".\n\nThe Deutsche Musikarchiv Berlin (DMA, German Music Archive) is the central collection of printed and recorded music and the music-bibliographic information centre for Germany. It is a federal agency founded in 1970 with the task to collect all music published in the country. Its precursor was the Deutsche Musik-Phonothek (1961–1969). Situated in Berlin's Lichterfelde, the DMA constitutes a department of the German National Library (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek). The DMA is planned to move to Leipzig, to be housed in an extension of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek in Leipzig. Construction work began in 2006 and is to be completed in 2009.\nPublishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law (since 1973) to deliver two copies of every edition to the archive. One copy is kept at the DMA in Berlin, the second is deposited in the music collection of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek in Leipzig.\n\nThe main building of the German National Library in Leipzig was built 1914–1916 after plans of the architect Oskar Pusch. The impressive facade is 160 m long and faces the \"Deutscher Platz\". The building was opened on October 19, 1916, one day after the monument for the Battle of the Nations. Emperor Wilhelm II had already left in a huff, as the Leipzig citizens did not conform to Prussian Imperial ideology. The building lot of the library had been donated by the city of Leipzig, while Friedrich August III, king of Saxony provided the funds for the building.\nOn the facade, the portraits of Otto von Bismarck, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Johannes Gutenberg are displayed. Statues represent Technology, Justice, Philosophy, Medicine etc. The central reading room contains a picture by Ludwig von Hofmann, depicting Arcadia in Art Nouveau-style. The Library includes a museum for books and letters as well.\n\n24.1 million items\n\n\n\n", "id": "235697", "title": "German National Library"}

(Compare tone.) Intonation and stress are two main elements of linguistic prosody.\n\nAll languages use pitch semantically, that is, as intonation, for instance for emphasis, to convey surprise or irony, or to pose a question. Tonal languages such as Chinese and Hausa use pitch to distinguish words in addition to intonation. \n\n\"Rising intonation\" means the pitch of the voice increases over time; \"falling intonation\" means that the pitch decreases with time. A \"dipping intonation\" falls and then rises, whereas a \"peaking intonation\" rises and then falls.\n\nThe classic example of intonation is the question-statement distinction.\nFor example, northeastern American English, like very many languages (Hirst & DiCristo, eds. 1998), has a rising intonation for echo or declarative questions (\"He found it on the street?\"), and a falling intonation for \"wh-\" questions (\"Where did he find it?\") and statements (\"He found it on the street.\"). Yes or no questions (\"Did he find it on the street?\") often have a rising end, but not always. Some languages like Chikasaw and kalaallisut have the opposite pattern: rising for statements and falling with questions.\n\nDialects of British and Irish English vary substantially, with rises on many statements in urban Belfast, and falls on most questions in urban Leeds.\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, \"global\" rising and falling intonation are marked with a diagonal arrow rising left-to-right and falling left-to-right , respectively. These may be written as part of a syllable, or separated with a space when they have a broader scope:\n\nHere the rising pitch on \"street\" indicates that the question hinges on that word, on where he found it, not whether he found it. \n\nHere, as is common with \"wh-\" questions, there is a rising intonation on the question word, and a falling intonation at the end of the question. \n", "id": "235698", "title": "Intonation (linguistics)"}

Absurdists think that the human condition is essentially absurd because humans are always looking for meaning, and also completely unable to find meaning. In philosophy, this is called \"the Absurd\". In this case \"absurd\" means that it is not possible to be done by humans.\n\nAbsurdists, most notably Albert Camus, believe that when human beings realize this fundamental absurdity they have different reactions. One reaction is suicide, but this is not generally considered to be a viable solution by Absurdists; suicide is in and of itself the most absurd action possible. Another reaction is to believe in something higher (Camus gave religion as an example of this, although he went on to criticize its merit as a solution to fundamental absurdity), when they see that there is no meaning they can find in the universe (which is what absurdism says is the basic state of human experience). The final reaction is to accept the absurd, and also to keep trying to overcome it. Camus believed that a human being could become happy by finding meaning in their relationship with the absurdity of their existence.\n\nPerhaps the most notable absurdist philosopher is Albert Camus.

It was the 7th named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. Grace began over the Azores on October 4, and had wind speeds of 65 mph (100 km/h). However, the storm did not last very long, and cold water temperatures caused it to weaken. The storm died out on October 6 over England. The storm was farther north and east in the Atlantic than most tropical storms. \n\nGrace had only minor effects on land. While it was passing through the Azores, islands near the storm felt strong winds and some rain. In Portugal, the storm partly caused heavy rain that caused flooding. What was left of Tropical Storm Grace hit parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In this area, of rain fell and winds became strong, although there was no bad damage.\n\nTropical Storm Grace came from a large extratropical cyclone that formed on September 27, 2009, to the east of Newfoundland. It began to show signs of becoming a tropical cyclone. By October 1, convection began to form near the center of the storm. The next day, the convection began to disappear, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stopped watching it. The storm moved in a loop near the Azores for the next two days. During October 4, convection formed again near the center of the storm. It became a tropical storm near São Miguel Island. However, the NHC first thought it did not become a tropical storm until later.\n\nThe NHC named the storm \"Grace\" at 11:00 AST on October 4. It was the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm had some strong convection and an eye-like feature (a clearing at the center). Grace was over waters that are normally too cold for tropical storms to exist. However, because there was not much wind shear, it was able to stay together. Grace moved towards the northeast. The storm became slightly stronger as it moved over colder waters. Winds in the storm were estimated at 70 mph (110 km/h) early on October 5. However, the NHC found later that Grace's highest winds were actually a little weaker, at 65 mph (100 km/h). \n\nA large cyclone near Grace caused the storm to weaken. By this time, the storm was over waters, likely stopping further strengthening. Early on October 6, Grace merged with a weather front over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Just before this, the lowest air pressure in the storm was recorded at 986 mbar (hPa; 29.12 inHg). What was left of Grace continued for about 18 hours before dissipating in the Celtic Sea early on October 7. Although the NHC officially called Grace a tropical storm, the French meteorological service said it should not have been called a tropical cyclone. They argued that the formation of Grace was more like a non-tropical storm than a tropical one.\n\nWhen Grace was over the Azores, a few islands had light rain and high winds. Wind gusts reached on Ponta Delgada. On October 6, the storm's rainbands caused heavy rain and strong winds in parts of Portugal. This flooded some streets. In the mountains, wind gusts may have been stronger than .\n\nBecause the storm was moving so fast when it reached the United Kingdom, the rain was not heavy. In Ireland, of rain fell in the city of Cork. Winds in the city were . Rainfall in the country peaked at in Wexford. The strongest winds were Force 8 on the Beaufort scale, meaning gale-force. Near the coast of Wales, a buoy recorded winds of , as strong as a small tropical storm. Late on October 6, Grace moved over Wales, bringing heavy rain and high winds. A ship called the \"Cap Castillo\" recorded winds of on October 5. At that time, the ship was about south of the storm's center. \n\nIn real time, Grace was not named as a tropical storm until it reached the latitude 41.2°N. This would have been the second farthest-north that a tropical storm formed in the Atlantic. Only Tropical Storm Alberto of 1988 had formed farther north. However, at the end of hurricane season, it was found that Grace actually became a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than people first thought. As a result, it formed at 38.5°N, which is further south. However, the storm's location was still unusual.\n\nThe NHC said that the formation of Grace was not predicted by meteorologists (weather men). The first mention of the low pressure area that became Grace said it would not become a tropical or subtropical storm. For three days, it was not mentioned in the NHC's tropical weather outlooks until just before it became a tropical cyclone. The lack of forecasts was blamed on the storm's unusual location.\n\n\n", "id": "235735", "title": "Tropical Storm Grace (2009)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235836", "text": "Weight training\n\nWeight training is a common type of strength training. It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks to oppose the force generated by muscles. Weight training uses many different special things to help certain areas of muscle and different kinds of body motions.\n\n\"Weight training\" is not bodybuilding, Olympic weightlifting, or \"powerlifting\"; these are sports and not training. Weight training is a part of these sports' training.\n\nWeight training has many similarities with other kinds of strength training. Each uses the ideas of Repetitions (or reps), Sets, Tempo, and Rest in different kinds of body motions to increase strength.\n\nFor a certain body motion or exercise, \"reps\" are doing the motion again and again with no rest between.\n\nA \"set\" is a number of reps and a time of rest. 3 sets of 10 reps would be doing the motion 10 times, resting, doing it again 10 times, resting, and doing it ten more times, then resting.\n\nThe \"tempo\" of an exercise means the speed one motion is done. A particular exercise may require you to move down then up, but one person may go down and come up in 2 seconds, while someone else may move slower and take 10 seconds. So 10 reps will take 20 seconds for the first person, but 100 seconds for the second. Most times slower motion is more difficult.\n\nRest has no different meaning for weight training, but it is very important. During rest no motion is necessary. Different kinds of weight training use different rest times between sets. Some use as little as 30 seconds and others can use as much as 8 minutes.\n\nWeight training has similarity to bodybuilding, but they have different objectives. Bodybuilding uses weight training to help make muscles larger and goodlooking, without care for more strength. They train to make their muscles larger and get low levels of body fat. Many weight trainers train differently and for the result of being strong and doing difficult things for a long time while not thinking about dropping body fat far under normal.\n\nWeight training is a safe kind of exercise when the motion is slow, controlled, and careful. In similarity to many things, doing it wrong or without care can result in hurting oneself.\n\nEach different weight training exercise is used only for a certain muscle area or group of muscles. This muscle area is the \"primary\" muscle area for that certain exercise or motion. After a number of reps in a set the motion will become difficult. People will then sometimes try to use other muscle areas to help the primary muscle area with the motion by jerking or making a small change in the motion. This is bad form. The reason this may hurt somebody is that these other areas may not be strong enough to move the same weight as the primary area, and they may be strained if used.\n\nAn example: in the squat exercise the person may sometimes use the back muscles if they are bent too far forward at the bottom of the motion. The squat exercise will use only the leg muscles if the person carefully keeps his back straight.\n\nMany people who use weight training spend 5 minutes stretching their muscles using special stretching motions and body positions. There is scientific work that says stretching helps make the chance of hurting oneself smaller.\n\n\"Warming up\" is also used to make the chance of hurting oneself smaller. A \"warm up\" is a few sets of an exercise done before other exercises that is done at much easier weight. These sets help move blood into the muscles and make lifting higher weight safer.\n\nGood use of breath is another thing to think about. There is a very small chance of blackout or stroke if the person exercising is straining too much and they hold their breath while doing the motion of an exercise. This is why many give advice to breathe out during the difficult part of the motion (for example, when lifting up breath out and breath in when coming down for many exercises).\n\nAs with many kinds of exercise, weight training people should drink enough water. Some say a weight training person should drink about 200ml of water every 15 minutes. Drinking a \"sports drink\" similar to Gatorade does not help more than water for water needs, but may help with some kinds of salts that you may need after exercise. If a very large amount of water is used it is possible to drink too much water, so use of care is important.\n\nSome kinds of weight training exercise need a helper or \"spotter\" to help make the motion safe. For example the bench press. Because the weight is directly above the body, a \"spotter\" or helper is used by many people in this exercise. The helper will stand behind the head of the person doing the exercise. If after doing some of the exercise the person doing the exercise cannot move the weight, the \"spotter\" will help the person move the weight back up to the starting position by taking hold of the bar and lifting together with the person.\n\nIt is safe to do many exercises without a spotter. Many exercise machines are made to be safe for use alone. But it is always more safe to do weight training exercise with other people near who can help if you get hurt.\n\nIf an exercise causes sudden pain that is very sharp, with similarity to being cut with a knife, that is bad pain and you should stop the exercise. But all weight training exercises will slowly cause muscles to be tired and cause small strain in the muscle area they use. When some people say \"no pain no gain\" they mean the tired feeling and small strain will help make you stronger. But sharp sudden pain is bad and may mean someone was hurt (this will not help you be stronger!).\n\nBeing hurt this way may mean no \"warm-up\" was done.\n\nMany people will get medical advice before starting weight training to make certain they are healthy enough to do the exercises. People who are old or who have needed medical help in the past should get medical advice before weight training.\n\nMost people mean isotonic weight training when they talk about weight training. Isotonic lifting is done with a smooth tempo during the reps.\n\nPlyometric weight training uses sudden motions to help people do things like jump higher (see the animated GIF to the left) or strike with more power. These are motions which must be done quickly and with power. Because these types of exercise may use jerking motion, it is more important to do a long warm up and stretch before attempting these exercises.\n\nAn \"isolation\" exercise is made to use only one muscle or a small muscle area. A compound exercise is made to use a larger muscle area that uses more muscles. It is still good form to do a compound exercise that uses more than one muscle area if the exercise is made to use the other areas.\n\nFor example: a pull-up uses the muscles on top of the arm to help the back muscles in this exercise. It is compound. A bicep curl uses only the muscles on the top of the arm. This is an isolation exercise.\n\nMost isolation exercises are very special and need a special apparatus to help them. Compound exercises are more natural. An isolation exercise may be used when one muscle is less strong than others it is used with in a compound motion. Also bodybuilders use isolation exercises to make goodlooking muscles.\n\nWeight training strengthens bones, helping to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis. By increasing muscular strength and improving balance, weight training can reduce falls by elderly persons as well.\n\nWeight training also is important to keep muscle strong when on a diet to drop fat. Without weight training or other strength training a person on a diet may drop muscle with the fat when they go down in weight.\n\n\n", "id": "235836", "title": "Weight training"}

In modern times the word \"gang\" is often used to refer to a group of people who commit crimes together. Members of criminal gangs may be called gangsters.\n\nThere are several reasons why people join gangs. Lots of people who join gangs are young people. One reason that people join gangs is a chance to make money through doing things like selling illegal drugs or stealing. Another reason, especially for younger people, is a chance to have a place where they belong. A third reason is boredom.\n\nGang members often use graffiti to tell other gangs that an area is part of their \"territory\" and that other gangs should stay away. Graffiti is also used to send other messages. Members of a gang often dress similarly or have the same tattoos.\n\nGang violence refers to illegal acts of violence performed by gangs.

This music is a mixture of heavy metal and traditional folk music. Folk instruments are used a lot and sometimes traditional singing styles are also used.\n\nThe earliest example of folk metal was the English band Skyclad. Their first album \"The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth\" was made in 1990. In 1994 and 1995 more folk metal bands appeared in Europe and Israel. Some of these early bands were the Irish band Cruachan, the Israeli band Orphaned Land, and the German band Subway to Sally. Each band started to develop their own kind of folk metal. These styles became Celtic metal, Oriental metal and Medieval metal.\n\nIn the 1990s, folk metal was not well known and there weren't many folk metal bands. In the early 2000s, folk metal became a lot more popular. It was especially popular in Finland. Some bands in Finland were Ensiferum, Turisas, Korpiklaani, Finntroll and Moonsorrow.\n\nDifferent bands play folk metal music in different ways. A lot of different instruments are also used. Many bands have six or more members so they can play many different instruments at the same time. A few bands also use keyboards to make the sound of folk instruments.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235970", "text": "Howard Staunton\n\nHoward Staunton (1810 – 22 June 1874) was an English chess master. He was the world's strongest player from 1843 to 1851. This is based on his 1843 match victory over the strongest French player, Saint-Amant. Staunton was the main organizer of the first international chess tournament in London 1851. It was organised to help celebrate the 1851 Exhibition at Hyde Park. These events helped to make London the world's leading chess centre. The winner of the tournament, Anderssen, then became recognised as the world's strongest player.\n\nStaunton ran a chess column in the \"Illustrated London News\" from 1845 to his death in 1874. He edited the \"Chess Player's Chronicle\", the first important chess magazine in English, from 1841 to 1854. He won matches against all the top players of the 1840s. \n\nIn 1847 he entered a parallel career as a Shakespearean scholar. Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851. In 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between Staunton and Morphy, but they failed. Morphy's biographer alleged that Staunton misled Morphy to avoid the match, but Staunton said he had retired from serious play.\n\nStaunton's understanding of positional (strategic) play was far ahead of his rivals. His chess articles and books were widely read, and encouraged the development of chess. His \"Chess-Player's Handbook\" (1847) was a standard text-book for decades. He played and popularised two of the most important modern openings, the Sicilian Defence, and the English Opening. Staunton was a controversial figure in his time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. There is no doubt that he was the supreme figure in the chess world of the mid-19th century. His books, and his writing for newspapers and magazines, had world-wide influence.\n\nNothing is known about his early life. It is not even known whether 'Howard Staunton' was his name at birth. Staunton's birth certificate has never been found; he claimed 1810 as his year of birth. His parents and his place of birth are unknown. \n\nOn 23 July 1849 Staunton married Frances Carpenter Nethersole, who had eight children by a previous marriage.\n\nIn 1849 Nathaniel Cook registered a chess set design, and Jaques of London got the manufacturing rights. Staunton advertised the new set in his \"Illustrated London News\" chess column, pointing out that the pieces were easily identifiable, very stable, and good-looking. At the start, the label for each box was signed by Staunton in ink; later, his signature was printed on the Jacques label. He got a royalty on every set sold. The design became popular, and 'Staunton pattern' sets been the standard for competitive events ever since.\n\nStaunton was twenty-six when he took a serious interest in chess. In 1838 he played many games with Captain Evans, the inventor of the Evans Gambit, and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre. He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master H.W. Popert. From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a chess column for the \"New Court Gazette\". He then became chess editor of the magazine \"British Miscellany\", and his chess column developed into a separate magazine, the \"Chess Player's Chronicle\", which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s.\n\nEarly in 1843 Staunton prevailed in a long series of games against John Cochrane, a strong player. A little later that year he lost a short match (2½-3½) in London against the visiting French player Saint-Amant, who was the best French player at that time.\n\nStaunton challenged Saint-Amant to a longer match to be played in Paris at the Café de la Régence for a stake of £100 (equivalent to about £75,000 today). Staunton took Thomas Worrall and Harry Wilson to Paris as his assistants; this is the first known case where seconds were used in a chess match. Staunton gained a seven-game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning the match 13-8 (eleven wins, four draws, and six losses) in December 1843.\n\nSaint-Amant wanted a third match, but Staunton was initially unwilling as he had developed heart trouble during the second match. After a long, difficult negotiation, which he reported in the \"Chess Player's Chronicle\", Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844, but he caught pneumonia while traveling and almost died; the match was postponed and never took place.\n\nSeveral modern commentators regard Staunton as \"de facto\" World Champion after his match victory over Saint-Amant, although that title did not yet formally exist.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford. p390 ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref>\nIn 1845 Staunton began a chess column for the \"Illustrated London News\", which became the most influential chess column in the world and which he continued for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"H/W\"></ref> Although his articles mostly focused on over-the-board play, a significant number featured correspondence chess. Some followed with enthusiasm the progress of promising youngsters, including Paul Morphy. Staunton produced over 1,400 weekly articles for the \"Illustrated London News\".\nThe first chess match by electric telegraph took place in 1844, between Washington and Baltimore. In April 1845 Staunton and Captain Kennedy travelled to Gosport to play two games by telegraph against a group in London. Staunton took a long-term interest in this solution to the difficulties of travel, and reported telegraph games in the \"Illustrated London News\". In 1871 his report of a telegraphic match between Sydney and Adelaide calculated that the 74 moves of the longest game had traveled a total of 220,000 miles (not much less than the distance between Earth and Moon).\n\nIn 1847 Staunton published his most famous work, \"The Chess-Player's Handbook\", which is still in print. It contained over 300 pages of opening analysis, and almost 100 pages of endgame analysis. He still found time for two matches in 1846, comfortably beating two professionals.\n\nStaunton proposed and then took the lead in organizing the first ever international tournament in 1851. He thought the Great Exhibition of 1851 presented a unique opportunity, because the difficulties that obstructed international participation would be greatly reduced. \n\nThe committee had also organized a 'London Provincial Tournament' for other British players, and promoted some of the entrants to play in the International Tournament to get the right number of players for a knock-out tournament.\n\nThe tournament was a success, but disappointing for Staunton personally; in the second round he was knocked out by Anderssen, who won the tournament convincingly; and in the play-off for third place Staunton was narrowly beaten by Elijah Williams. Perhaps Staunton over-stretched himself by acting as both a competitor and the Secretary of the organizing committee. In 1852 Staunton published his book \"The Chess Tournament\", which recounted in detail the efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. \n\nThe London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organized a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players, many of whom had competed in Staunton's tournament. The result was the same – Anderssen won.\n\nIn the mid-1850s Staunton got a contract to edit the text of Shakespeare. This edition appeared in parts from 1857 to 1860; the work was praised in reviews.\n\nWhile Staunton was busy with the Shakespeare edition, he received a courteous letter from the New Orleans Chess Club, inviting him to that city to play Paul Morphy, who had won the first American Chess Congress. Staunton replied, thanking the Club and Morphy \"for the honour implied in your selection of me as the opponent of such a champion\". Staunton pointed out that he had not competed for several years and was working six days a week (on editing Shakespeare), and so he could not possibly travel across the Atlantic for a match. He also wrote in the \"Illustrated London News\" that he \nChess historian H.J.R. Murray wrote that Staunton's letter and article should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, and one of the main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton.\n\nUpon arriving in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer saying that the challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given time to get back into practice, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. In September the \"Illustrated London News\" printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter. The main criticism against Staunton was never his failure to play Morphy. As Lord Lyttleton put it in a letter to Morphy:\n\nStaunton continued writing the chess column in \"Illustrated London News\" until his death in 1874, greeting new developments with enthusiasm. In 1860 he published \"Chess Praxis\", a supplement to his 1847 work \"The Chess Player's Handbook\". The new book devoted 168 pages to presenting many of Morphy's games and praised the American's play. Five years later Staunton published \"Great Schools of England\" (1865), whose main subject was the history of major English public schools but which also presented some progressive ideas: learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged; corporal punishment is to be avoided and fagging should be abolished. Most of his later life was spent in writing about Shakespeare, including: a photo lithographic reproduction of the 1600 \"Much Ado about Nothing\" in 1864 and of the first folio of Shakespeare in 1866. He wrote articles on \"Unsuspected corruptions of Shakespeare's text\", published from 1872 to his death. All these works were highly regarded at the time. When he died suddenly of heart disease, on 22 June 1874, he was at his desk writing one of these papers. At the same time he was also working on his last chess book, \"Chess: theory and practice\", which was published posthumously in 1876.\n\nA memorial plaque now hangs at his old residence of 117 Lansdowne Road, London W11. In 1997 a memorial stone bearing an engraving of a chess knight was raised over his grave at Kensal Green Cemetery in London, which had previously been unmarked and neglected.\n", "id": "235970", "title": "Howard Staunton"}

He was born to Armenian parents, and brought up in the capital of Armenia, Yerevan. Before his chess career, he was a street cleaner.\n\nPetrosian got the USSR national master title in 1947, and his chess improved rapidly when he moved to Moscow that year. By coming second in the 1951 USSR championship he qualified for the FIDE Interzonal tournament in Stockholm next year. There, he qualified for the World Championship Candidates tournament in Zurich 1953. He came fifth, and was awarded the title of International Grandmaster.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nYears followed when he made no visible progress, and others had the chance to challenge for the world title. Vasily Smyslov and Mikhail Tal both won the world title, yet lost it back to Botvinnik in return matches. At last, in 1962, Tigran won the Candidates tournament, and became the new challenger to Botvinnik. Petrosian also won the very strong Soviet Championship four times, in 1959 (Tbilisi), 1961 (Moscow), 1969 (Moscow), and 1975 (Yerevan).\n\nBefore the title match started, FIDE changed the rules so that somebody who lost the world championship in a match would not automatically get a return match. The rule that allowed for return matches had been criticised for giving Botvinnik too great an advantage over his rivals. \n\nIn the match Petrosian started shakily, losing the first game and just escaping with a draw in the second game. From then on he was in control, and won the match (best of 24 games) by +5 –2 =15. In 1966 he defended the title against Boris Spassky, and won 12½–11½. The victory was rather more emphatic than the score suggests. In 1969 Spassky was again the challenger, and this time Petrosian lost 10½–12½. \n\nPetrosian played in every world championship cycle from 1951 to 1980, when he lost a quarter-final match against his old enemy, Viktor Korchnoi.\n\nPetrosian's record in Chess Olympiads was unsurpassed. He played for the USSR in nine Olympiads, and this is a summary of his overall results: +79 –1 =50.\n\nPetrosian was one of those players who set out to stifle the opponent's chances before they take action themselves. He was a student of Nimzovich's ideas of prophylaxis. Capablanca was another such player, but his chess was pure and simple. Petrosian's was profound and complex. He has been much admired by grandmasters, but was not so popular with lesser players. Like Capablanca, he was somewhat lazy, and did not strive to win every game. At his peak, he was the best player in the world at manoeuvring in complex positions, and an outstanding endgame player.\n\n", "id": "236175", "title": "Tigran Petrosian"}

For example, it would be too dangerous to completely veto big pieces of legislation (like the budget for the military or the budget for other government departments), but with the line-item veto, the President could choose to keep what he or she thinks are the good parts of the bill and reject the bad parts of the bill.\n\nPeople who do not like the line-item veto say that it is bad because it gives the President too much power over Congress and believe that it goes against the checks and balances created by the U.S. Constitution. Other criticisms include the possibility that the president's individual vetoes of line items make the bill different than what Congress voted for.\n\n", "id": "236181", "title": "Line-item veto"}

Monetarism is the theory that how much money the government prints each year has a huge affect on the economy. He supports the government printing the same low rate of money each year rather than a different amount each year.\n\nFriedman was born in Brooklyn, New York to a Hungarian-Jewish family. He was raised in Rahway, New Jersey. Friedman studied at Rutgers University, at Columbia University, and at the University of Chicago. He worked thirty years in Chicago with George Stigler as a leader of the Chicago school of economics.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Milton Friedman's idea of monetarism gained popularity and he became an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nFriedman believed that the government control over the economy should be limited. He supported cutting taxes, lowering government spending, getting rid of government rules that limited the economy and letting parents choose which school their taxes paid for. His political views were libertarian. He was against forcing people to join the army, and said that getting rid of United States military conscription was the thing he was most proud of doing.\n\nThroughout several decades, Friedman made many documentaries, books, and interviews to express his views to the public. The main books he wrote were \"Capitalism and Freedom\" and \"Free to Choose\".\n\nFriedman married Rose Director in 1938. Together, they had a son and a daughter. He was agnostic.\n\nFriedman died of heart failure in San Francisco, California, aged 94. He was survived by his wife and his two children. His remains were cremated and scattered over the San Francisco Bay area.\n\n", "id": "236182", "title": "Milton Friedman"}

The electron configuration describes where the electrons are inside orbitals. The structure of the Periodic table of elements is partly based on electron configuration.\n\nThere are four kinds of electron configurations: s, p, d, and f orbitals. S orbitals are roughly sphere-shaped, p orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell, d orbitals are usually shaped like a four-leaf clover, and f orbitals form a mathematically complex shape. An atom can have more than one orbital: in fact, all except hydrogen do. Similarly, atoms can have more than one of each kind of orbital.\n\nThe electron configurations fill up with electrons in an unchanging order.\n", "id": "236187", "title": "Electron configuration"}

It is between the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the north. It goes towards the east to a line between the head of the Ross Ice Shelf and Eights Coast. It stretches between 158°W and 103°24'W. The area between the Rockefeller Plateau and Eights Coast is included. This is because Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd had an important role in its exploration. Admiral Byrd named the territory in 1929. It was in honour of his wife. He applied the name to the territory that was explored in that year.\n\nThe area is very , even for Antarctica. Because of this, most of it (the east part of 150°W) has not been claimed by any country. The territory is not a nation itself. Because of this, it is the largest single unclaimed territory on Earth. Together with Eights Coast, immediately to the east of Marie Byrd Land, it has an area of 1,610,000 km².\n\nIn 1939, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt told members of an Antarctic expedition to claim some Antarctic territory. Members of this expedition and later ones seemed to do so, but no official claims were made before 1959, when the Antarctic Treaty System was set up. Some maps in the United States have shown this as US territory. The Defense Department of the US Government has also said that there was a solid basis for a claim for the territory. This was because of the activities there before 1959. \n\nThe portion west of 150°W is part of Ross Dependency.\n\nThere are five areas, which are listed from west to east:\n\nMarie Byrd Land hosted the Operation Deep Freeze base Byrd Station (NBY; 80°S, 119°W). This began in 1957, in the hinterland of Bakutis Coast. Byrd Station was the only big base in the interior of West Antarctica for many years. In 1968, the first ice core to fully go through the Antarctic Ice Sheet was drilled here. The year-round station was left in 1972. Between 1972 and 2008, the station was only occupied during the summer months. It was named again as Byrd Surface Camp. Byrd Station was opened again in 2009-2010. This was to support operations in northern West Antarctica.\n\nByrd Station provided a template for the doomed Antarctic base in the horror movie \"John Carpenter's The Thing\".\n\nIn 1998 and 1999, a camp was operated at the Ford Ranges (FRD) in western Marie Byrd Land. The camp supported a part of an US Antarctic Program (USAP) airborne survey. The survey was started by UCSB. It was supported by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics.\n\nIn 2004-05, a large camp, Thwaites (THW), was made by the USAP 150 km north of NBY. This was in order to support a large airborne geophysical survey of eastern Marie Byrd Land by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics.\n\nIn 2006, an important encampment, WAIS Divide (WSD) was made on the divide between the Ross Sea Embayment and the Amundsen Sea Embayment. This was in easternmost Marie Byrd Land. This was made in order to drill a high resolution ice core over the next three years.\n\nOn Ruppert Coast of Marie Byrd Land is the Russian station Russkaya. It was occupied 1980-1990. It is also used as a summer-only station. \n", "id": "236197", "title": "Marie Byrd Land"}

Following the Herzegovinian Rebellion started in 1875 and the Bulgarian Uprising in April 1876, the Great Powers agreed on a project for political reforms both in Bosnia and in the Ottoman territories with a majority Bulgarian population.\n\nThe Great Powers were represented at the conference respectively by:\n\n\nOf these, Lord Salisbury, Count de Chaudordy and Baron von Calice were Ambassadors Plenipotentiary to the conference, while Count Ignatyev, Sir Henry Elliot, Count de Bourgoing, Baron von Werther, Count Zichy and Count Corti were the resident Ambassadors of their countries in Constantinople.\n\nThe US Consul General in Constantinople, Eugene Schuyler also took an active part in drafting the conference decisions.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was represented at the conference by:\n\nMithat Pasha was the Grand Vizier (First Minister), and Saffet Pasha the Foreign Minister of Turkey. Although the Turkish representatives participated in the plenaries of the conference, they were not invited to the preceding working sessions at which the Great Powers negotiated their agreement.\n\nLord Salisbury and Count Ignatyev played a leading role in the process. Ignatyev was trying to dispel British misgivings about Russia’s assumed role of a protector of the Orthodox Slavs being but a disguise of its drive to take over the Bosporus and Constantinople itself and thus – as Prime Minister Disraeli feared – potentially threaten the vital Mediterranean routes to British India. On his part, Salisbury saw the conference as a promising opportunity for mapping out a comprehensive deal with Russia over their conflicting territorial ambitions in Central Asia.\n\nThe conference envisaged the creation of an autonomous province including Bosnia and most of Herzegovina, while a southern part of the latter was to be ceded to Montenegro.\n\nThe Great Powers agreed on a substantial Bulgarian autonomy to take the form of two new Ottoman provinces (vilayets) established for the purpose: Eastern, with capital Tarnovo, and Western, with capital Sofia.\n\nThe conference determined that, as of the late 19 century, the Bulgarian ethnic territories within the Ottoman Empire extended to the Danube Delta in the northeast, Kastoria in the southwest, Kirklareli and Edirne in the southeast, and Niš in the northwest. These territories were to be incorporated into the two Bulgarian autonomous provinces as follows:\n\nThe Great Powers elaborated in detail the constitutional, legislative, executive, defense and law enforcement arrangements, cantonal administrative system, taxation, international supervision etc. for the proposed autonomous provinces.\n\nThe agreed decisions of the six Great Powers were formally handed over to the Ottoman Government on 23 December 1876, dismissing the opening Turkish suggestions that the Conference's mission might have been obviated by a new Ottoman Constitution approved by Sultan Abdul Hamid II that same day. In the subsequent conference plenary sessions Turkey submitted objections and alternative reform proposals that were rejected by the Great Powers, and attempts to bridge the gap did not succeed. Eventually, on 18 January 1877 Grand Vizier Mithat Pasha announced the definitive refusal of Turkey to accept the conference decisions.\n\nThe failure of the Ottoman Government to implement the decisions of the Constantinople Conference triggered the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War, depriving at the same time Turkey – in contrast to the preceding 1853–1856 Crimean War – from Western support.\n\nTsarigrad Peak in Imeon Range on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the conference (‘Tsarigrad’ being the old Bulgarian name for Constantinople).\n\n\n\n", "id": "236216", "title": "Constantinople Conference"}

In its most basic form it contains only four ; flour, salt, baking soda, and buttermilk. Yet it can be changed when you add other ingredients. For instance, if you add a little sugar, some raisins, then cut in some butter, it may become a \"Raisin\" soda bread.\n\nSoda bread does not use yeast to get its rise, instead the rise comes from baking soda reacting with the acid (soured milk or buttermilk). This makes it a 'quick' bread that can be made in under 15 minutes. The important thing to remember is to have mix and the dough quickly and lightly. This will give you a bread that is dense, but not doughy, with a tender, slightly . Once the dough is formed into a round, a cross is cut on the top of the bread, which divides it into quarters called farls.\n", "id": "236327", "title": "Soda bread"}

She was the wife of King James VI and I.\n\nAnne, the second daughter of King Frederick II of Denmark, married James in 1589 when she was 15 years old. She gave birth to seven children but only three lived to become adults. One of these children was the future Charles I. She often used Scottish politics when she fought with James about her son, Prince Henry. She also used them in her arguments about his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne seems to have loved James at first. However, they later became cooler towards one another and lived separately. However, though they both had respect and even some love for one another.\n\nIn England, Anne was more interested in art than politics. She built a beautiful and culturally rich court of her own. After 1612, she became ill and later stopped being in the center of court life. She was said to have died a Protestant. However, some proof suggests that she may have been a Catholic at some time in her life.\n\nHistorians have often thought of Anne as a queen who was light, selfish, and not very important. Recently, however, many people point out Anne's independence and importance as an encourager of the arts in the Jacobean age.\n\nAnne was born on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg. Her birth came as a blow to her father, King Frederick II of Denmark, who had been hoping for a son. Anne's mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, however, was only 17. Three years later she did give birth to a son. He was the future Christian IV of Denmark.\n\nAnne was sent with her older sister Elizabeth to Güstrow, in Germany. She was to be raised there by her grandparents on her mother's side. They were the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg. This was because the Danish court was very wild at this time. King Frederick was famous for heavy eating and much drinking. He was also unfaithful to the Queen. Compared to this, in Güstrow, Anne enjoyed a quiet and stable life in her early years. Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow. However, two years later, in 1579, the Rigsraad, or Danish Privy Council, successfully asked him to move to Denmark. Anne and Elizabeth came back with him.\n\nAnne enjoyed a close and happy family education in Denmark. This was mostly because of Queen Sophie. She took care of the children herself when they were ill. A great number of people from all over Europe wanted to marry Anne and her older sister. Among these people were James VI of Scotland. He liked Denmark because he thought of it as a kingdom with good religion and a good trading partner. Scottish ambassadors had at first tried to make him marry the oldest daughter. However, Frederick betrothed Elizabeth to Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick. He promised the Scots instead that \"for the second [daughter] Anna, if the King did like her, he should have her.\"\n\nSophie's position became harder after Frederick's death in 1588. She had to join in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian. However, she worked harder than Frederick in making people marry. She was able to overcome difficult points about the dowry and the position of Orkney. She sealed the agreement by July 1589. Anne seems to have been very excited about the match. On 28 July 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler said that Anne was greatly in love with James. He said that \"it were death to her to have it broken off\". He added that she proved her love in a great number of ways. However, Fowler also suggested that James did not return Anne's love, and he liked men better than women. This would not have been told to the 14-year-old Princess. At this time, she was faithfully embroidering shirts for her fiancé. Meanwhile, 300 tailors worked on making her wedding dress.\n\nEven if these rumors were true, James needed a royal marriage. This was because he needed to keep up the Stuart line. \"God is my witness,\" he explained, \"I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were a barren stock.\" On 20 August 1589, Anne and James were married separately, but to one another. This is called a \"proxy marriage\". Their marriage took place in Kronborg Castle. The ceremony ended with James's representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.\n\n", "id": "236339", "title": "Anne of Denmark"}

His name comes from grandfathers Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and Frederick II of Denmark.\n\nPrince Henry was widely seen as a bright heir to his father's throne. However, he died before his father because of typhoid fever. Because of this, the English and Scottish thrones' power went to his younger brother Charles.\n\nSeveral places in Virginia Colony were named in honor of Prince Henry before and after his death.\n\nHe was born at Stirling Castle and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland when he was born. His father made Alexander Erskine, Earl of Mar, take care of him. He did not let his mother take care of him. This was because James worried that the mother's slight liking for Catholicism might have some effect on the son. Although this made lots of fights between Anna and James, Henry was kept under the care of Mar's family until 1603. This was when James became King of England and his family moved south.\n\nSir George Lauder of The Bass was his teacher until he went to England. Sir George was a Privy Counsellor – described as the King's \"familiar councillor\" – and he was also taught in music by Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger.\n", "id": "236340", "title": "Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales"}

She was famous from the 1950s to the mid- 1970s for singing some of the great roles in the operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss. She was known for the naturalness of her singing as well as for her beauty.\n\nDella Casa’s father was an Italian-Swiss doctor. Her mother came from Bavaria.\nShe studied singing with Margarete Häser at the Zürich Conservatory. Her first performance in opera was singing Madame Butterfly in Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" at Solothurn-Biel Municipal Theater in 1940. She joined the ensemble of the Zürich Municipal Opera House in 1943 and stayed there until 1950. \n\nIn 1946 Della Casa sang the part of Zdenka in Richard Strauss's opera \"Arabella\" in Zürich, and again the following year when she sang for the first time at the Salzburg Festival where she was to sing many times during her career. After the performance, Richard Strauss himself said: \"That girl will be \"the\" Arabella someday!\" In the same year, she sang for the first time at the Vienna State Opera House, singing Gilda in Verdi's \"Rigoletto\". Soon she moved to Vienna and joined the ensemble of the Vienna State Opera House. In 1949, she sang at La Scala Opera House in Milan as Sophie in Richard Strauss's \"Der Rosenkavalier\" and Marcelline in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\". She was invited to move to Milan, but she chose to stay in Vienna.\n\nDella Casa appeared in Britain for the first time singing the part of Countess Almaviva in Mozart's \"Le nozze di Figaro\" at the Glyndebourne Festival. She sang the part of Arabella for the first time at the Bavarian State Opera House in Munich in 1951. She was to become most famous for this role. She sang Eva in Wagner's \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\" at the Bayreuth Festival in 1952, but she did not like the atmosphere there with all the arguments, so she never returned to Bayreuth. From 1953 to 1968 she sang regularly at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York where she was extremely popular.\n\nWhen the Vienna State Opera House was restored in 1955 there was a special performance of \"Der Rosenkavalier\". She sang the part of the Marschallin, so she had sung all three famous soprano roles in that opera: the Marschallin, Octavian and Sophie.\n\nShe continued to sing many great operatic roles at the Salzburg Festival, including the part of the Marschallin in 1960 under the conductor Herbert von Karajan, celebrating the newly-built Salzburg Festspielhaus.\n\nShe sang a few dramatic roles, such as Salome in \"Salome\" at the Bavarian State Opera House in Munich in 1961, but mostly she sang lyrical roles. When the famous soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf first sang at the Met she sang the part of the Marschallin in \"Der Rosenkavalier\" with Della Casa singing Octavian..\n\nAfter singing Arabella in Salzburg in 1974, she surprised everyone by announcing her retirement. She gave up her musical career and enjoyed a quiet, domestic life.\n\nShe made several complete opera recordings including her singing of Countess Almaviva in \"Le nozze di Figaro\" (Erich Kleiber conducting) and the role of Arabella in \"Arabella\" (Georg Solti conducting). These recordings are still thought of as among the finest ever made. She made a wonderful recording of Richard Strauss' \"Vier letzte Lieder\" \"(Four Last Songs)\" (Karl Böhm conducting) in 1953.\n\nIn 1947, she married Yugoslavian-born journalist Dragan Debeljevic. They had one daughter, who became very ill when she was young. Her daughter says that, later in life, when Lisa had her own health problems, she was able to give back to her mother some of the love and care that she herself had received as a child.

They liked monody, which means a tune with a simple accompaniment. This was different from polyphony in which several things are being sung at once.

Sinclair wrote this book to show the sufferings of the working class and to show the corruption of the American meatpacking industry during the early-20th century. The book writes about the poverty, bad living and working conditions, and sorrow among the working class. The sad state of turn-of-the-century work is placed for the American public to see, suggesting that something needed to be changed to get rid of American \"wage slavery\". The novel is also an important example of the \"muckraking\" tradition begun by journalists such as Jacob Riis.\nUpton Sinclair came to Chicago with hopes of writing \"The Jungle\". When he came to the lobby of the Chicago Transit House, a hotel, he was quoted as saying, \"Hello! I'm Upton Sinclair, and I'm here to write the \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" of the Labor Movement!\". He rented living quarters and immediately began walking its streets, talking to its people and taking pictures. One Sunday afternoon, he worked his way into a group of Lithuanian immigrants getting together for a wedding party, \"Behold, there was the opening scene of my story, a gift from the gods\". He was welcomed there and was with them until two in the morning.\n\n\"The Jungle\" was first published in a series in 1905. \"After five rejections\", its first edition as a book was published by Doubleday, Page & Company on February 28, 1906, and it became an immediate best seller and has been in print ever since.\nThe main character is Jurgis Rudkus, a Lithuanian man who emigrates to the United States with his fifteen year old fiance Ona Lukoszaite and their extended family. He marries her in Chicago and then soon gets a job at Durham's, a factory in Chicago. The factory mistreats him and Ona and their family. Eventually Ona dies of blood loss because the greedy midwife will not help her because the Rudkus family do not have enough money. Stanislovas, a child in the family who worked in a factory, is killed by an accident while working.

It also used by members of the House of Hohenzollern. At the moment, the title is used by Prince Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern) and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Neslé, Prince d'Orange.\n\nThe title was at first related to a self-ruling state called the Principality of Orange. It lies in the south of what we now call France. The land was the property of the house of Orange and from 1544 of the house of Orange-Nassau. \n\nThe last of the original princes, René of Nassau, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent after he died. William the Silent was not related to the original house of Orange, but was the legal heir.\n\nIn a war in 1673, Louis XIV of France took over the lands of the principality and added them to his own royal domain. This was part of the war against the stadtholder William III of Orange. Louis XIV then gave the principality to Louis of Mailly-Nesles, marquis of Nesles (1689–1764), a very remote relation of the original princes of Orange. His descendant still claims the title today. In 1714, Louis XIV allowed Prince Louis Armand of Bourbon-Conti to use the land of the Principality to make money. Prince Louis Armand died in 1727 and the principality was merged in the Crown in 1731.\n\nWilliam III died without legitimate children. This meant that the principality was seen as inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia . He handed over the principality's lands but not the title to France in 1713. France supported his claim. In this way, the territory of the principality was no longer a separate state, but became a part of France. Through the Treaty of Utrecht. A new \"Principality of Orange\" was created by the King of Prussia as part of the duchy of Gelderland.. The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918.\n\nJohn William Friso of Nassau was chosen as the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. John William Friso was also related to William the Silent through the female line. Several of his descendants became stadtholders. They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance (inheritance of lands to the brother rather than the sons of the king) . This way of inheriting is similar to the way William the Silent inherited from his cousin René. The claim to the title is also on basis of the testament of Philips William, Maurice and William III. Although they claimed the title \"Prince of Orange\", France never allowed them to obtain anything of the lands of the principality itself. It is from this tradition that later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day royal family of the Netherlands, also hold the title.\n\nUntil 1340, it was customary for all sons of the prince of Orange to inherit the title. \nOnly the direct line of descent to Raimond V is shown here.\n\nAs personal title of nobility:\n\nAs royal title for the heir apparent:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "236493", "title": "Prince of Orange"}

The letter asked William to force the ruling king, his father-in-law James II of England to make William's Protestant wife Mary, James's oldest daughter, the heir.

He lost it to Emanuel Lasker in 1894. He also lost a rematch with Lasker in 1897.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nBorn a Jew in Bohemia, Steinitz studied mathematics at the Vienna Polytecnic, and won the Vienna chess championship in 1861 with a score of 31/32. After playing in the London 1862 tournament, he stayed in London as a professional player in clubs and coffee houses. He won a series of matches against all the best English and other players living in London. This established him as one of the best player in the world.\n\nSteinitz beat Adolf Anderssen in 1866, and some think he should be regarded as world champion from this date. \n\nApart from the chess, this match was a landmark in chess organisation. It was the first event to be timed by clocks. The time for each move was recorded by hand. The totals for each player could then be added. This was the first practical step taken to make sure each player had the same total thinking time available. It had always been a problem that some players took much longer than others, unfairly so. Timing also helped to keep the total time for play within bounds. Eventually, special chess clocks were designed, and the idea has spread to other two-person games such as Go.\n\nSteinitz beat Johannes Zukertort in 1872, and again later in 1886. This last match all agree was for the world championship. Zukertort was a brilliant and boastful player, who was also resident in London for many years. Both the men wrote for chess magazines, and there was a good deal of rivalry. \n\nSteinitz did not win a really strong tournament until London 1872, and did not finish above Andersson until Vienna 1873. He came equal first at Vienna 1882, and second (to Zukertort) in London 1883, both top-class events. In general, his tournament play was not so outstanding as his match play. In match play he was the best of his day: he won 24 matches running until Lasker beat him.\n\nAs a younger man, Steinitz played in the all-out attacking style that was common in the 1860s. Later, he developed a new positional style of play and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style. His new style was controversial, and some even branded it as 'cowardly'. Some of Steinitz's games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school. \n\nSteinitz was argumentative, and was often in disputes with other chess writers. He was a prolific writer in chess magazines, and defended his ideas vigorously. The debate was bitter and sometimes abusive: it became known as the 'Ink War'. By the early 1890s, Steinitz' approach was more widely accepted and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him, especially his successor as world champion, Emanuel Lasker.\n\nLasker summed up the new style as: \n\nSteinitz left England for the United States in 1886, and became an American citizen in 1888. \n\nHe was given an enthusiastic reception, played several exhibitions, many casual games, a match for stakes of £50 with a wealthy amateur, and slightly more serious matches with New World professionals. The match with the Cuban champion Celso Golmayo Zúpide was abandoned when Steinitz was leading (eight wins, one draw, one loss). His hosts even arranged a visit to New Orleans, where Paul Morphy lived.\n\nWhile based in New York he played matches against Zukertort (St Louis 1883), twice against Russia's Mikhail Chigorin (Havana 1889 & 1892), Isidor Gunsberg (New York 1890/91). Finally, there were the two losing matches against Emanuel Lasker, (Philadelphia/New York/Montreal 1894 and Moscow 1896/97). These were all for the world championship. There were also a dozen matches against lesser masters, including four against J.H. Blackburne, the leading English professional.\n\nThe book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament, written collectively by the players, described Steinitz as follows:\n\nSteinitz died in poverty, having spent some of his last years in a New York mental institution. His second wife and their two young children survived him, and a fund of $1050 was raised to help them.\n\n", "id": "236541", "title": "Wilhelm Steinitz"}

Dynamism stemmed from the teachings of the 'Hypermodern movement', which challenged the dogma found in more classical teachings, such as those of Wilhelm Steinitz and Siegbert Tarrasch.\n\nThe rating system invented by the late Professor Arpad Elo, and used by FIDE since 1970. The system gives a four-figure number which shows how well a player has scored in those games which have been entered into the database. It is an estimate of strength based on results, and is widely used to place players into categories. 2500 and above is grandmaster level.\n\nThe stage of the game with few pieces or when queens are exchanged and the middle game is over.\n\nA special method of capturing, only available to a pawn on its fifth rank. See \"En passant\" rule.\n\nWhen neither player has an advantage. \n\nMay mean:\n\nDeveloping the bishop at the squares b2, g2, b7 or g7. Also, moving a pawn one square forward to allow this. It is a hallmark of the hypermodern openings: the bishops there do not occupy the centre, but influence it.\n\n\"Fédération Internationale des Échecs\": the International Chess Federation. The overall governing body of the game.\n\nThe game is drawn if 50 moves are played \"with no captures and no pawn moves\". This is to prevent a player forcing his opponent to play on in a position where no win is possible, yet where three-fold repetition has not happened. The rule is ancient: the Arabic version of the game, Shatranj, had a 70-move rule.\n\nThere is an exception to the 50-move rule. There are some positions which require more than 50 moves to win, yet have no captures or pawn moves. They are rare, and many players never see such an event in their lifetime. The circumstance is as follows. Suppose a computer study has shown that a particular position can be won in 58 moves (without pawn moves or captures), but not fewer. This is proved because a computer can try out every alternative. Then the case is published (so FIDE can list it for arbitrators). The cases listed by FIDE in 1988 were:\n\nWhat FIDE did for these cases was to extend the 50-move rule to 75 moves. However, still more cases were found, many with far more moves needed. At that, FIDE decided to cancel the extension. Now the 50-move rule applies to all games without exception.\n\nLittle images of pieces used in diagrams and printed chess scores (moves).

The phrase \"open file\" is used when no pawn blocks a file. The phrase \"semi-open file\" is used when only one pawn blocks a file. \n\nA double attack when one piece, such as a knight, attacks two or three pieces at once.\n\nA method for recording positions. The board is read from a8 to h8, and rank by rank from the black side to the white side. Then the result is written down by hand, putting numbers for blank squares. \nUpper case letters (capitals) are used for white pices; lower case letters for black pieces. rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR is the starting position.\n\nA chess opening in which a player offers a pawn (or more) for fast development and an attack. Examples:\n\nGrading or rating: a number which indicates how likely one player is to beat another. A competitive ranking list based solely on results.\n\nThe situation where a player, in error, moves a piece to where it can be captured without an exchange. For instance, player A. just hung his or her bishop.\n\nA group of players in the early 1920s who had new ideas on openings; and any of the openings they promoted.\n\nI \n\nThe situation where one player is making threats, and his opponent must respond to them. The attacking player is said to \"have the initiative\" and can often dictate the way the game develops. \n\nIsolated pawns do not have a pawn of the same colour on either of the adjacent files. An Isolated Queens Pawn, or 'IQP' for short, is one of the most common types of Isolated Pawns. Openings with an IQP lead to distinctive <nowiki>middlegame</nowiki> strategies.\n\nMeans 'I adjust'; said before adjusting a piece on the board during a game. Usually occurs when a player has made a move, and carelessly left the piece overlapping the square.\n\nKriegspiel ('War game') is an unorthodox chess game in which the players only know for certain the moves of their own pieces. They have to deduce where the opponent's pieces are by questioning an umpire. It is played on three boards with partitions between them. The umpire sits with the middle board with the true position. Players are permitted to ask two kinds of question. \"Can I move here?\" and \"Are there any?\" (meaning pawn captures). The umpire replies accordingly. Checks and captures are announced by the umpire, and provide more clues. The game was invented by Henry Michael Temple (1862–1928).\n\nChess played with human beings as pieces on a giant board. A spectacle which has been performed since the 15th century. Usually, masters or other celebrities decide the moves, and a steward with a stick instructs the 'pieces' where to move.\n\nLuft, the German word for \"air\" (sometimes also \"space\" or \"breath\"), is sometimes used for a space made by a pawn move. Especially it means a space made for the king to avoid a back rank checkmate. \n\nQueen or rook.\n\nNot a game, but a series of games. Used of team events or a series of games between two players.\n\nThe part of the game which follows the opening. Plans are formed, based on the position, and put into action.\n\nBishop or knight.\n\nThe method of writing down chess moves. See also Forsyth notation.\n\nThe start of the game, about a dozen moves. Openings have names, and extensive theory has been worked out by masters. Traditionally, the opening ends when minor pieces (knights and bishops) have been developed, and players have castled. However, modern openings go much further, into the early middlegame. See development.\n\nA line in a particular opening. For example, in the Sicilian defence there are many different lines which are called variations.\n\nOverworked, also known as overloaded, is a tactical weakness in chess where a piece is tasked to defend multiple threats at the same time. In many cases, this results in the overworked piece being unable to move and/or being forced to prioritize which task it can preform in order to mitigate loses.\n\nA situation arising from opposite-side castling. One, of both players, advance their pawns towards their opponent's king. This is usually not done on same-side castling, as advancing the pawns in front of one's own king is generally unsafe.\n\nWhen a piece does not move because to do so would expose a more valuable piece to capture. Pins against the king are absolute because it is illegal to move the pinned piece.\n\nPlay dominated by long-term manoeuvring, not short-term attacks and threats. It needs judgement more than calculation. The term is contrasted with tactics.\n\nA chess problem is an artificial construction, not part of the game, but using a board and pieces. It is a separate intellectual activity. Chess problems have a history as long as the game itself, and their own terminology. The Arabs (9th/10th centuries) used specially composed positions (\"mansurbat\") as teaching devices; the idea of specifying a set number of moves to mate is European. Problem solving tournaments are held, and there is a World Championship for problem solvers. There are also international prizes for problem composers.\n\nPromotion is what happens when a pawn reaches the 8th rank. Then it must be changed for a piece: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same colour (player's choice). Normally, the pawn is \"queened\", but in some cases another piece is chosen, called 'under-promotion'.\n\nA key concept of positional chess. It is a move, or sequence of moves, to deal with an opponent's plan before it starts. Sometimes one can completely stop the threat; sometimes one just makes the plan relatively harmless. The idea was spelled out in detail in Nimzovich's books \"My system\" and \"Chess praxis\". Prophylactic moves are often seen in games by Capablanca, Petrosian and Karpov.\n\nThe idea of choosing the layout of the pieces on the back row at random. The point is to avoid opening knowledge. White picks the pieces out of a bag and places them left to right; Black places his pieces on the corresponding squares. Alternatively, each player places his own pieces at random, producing two different arrays. The idea has been tried several times in the last 200 years, but has never caught on. There are problems. Usually special rules are needed for the king (castling?) and the bishops (no two bishops on the same colour squares). More serious is the great difficulty players experience in getting the pieces to work together. \n\nThe horizontal eight lines on the board, labelled 1 to 8.\n\nRapidplay (FIDE Laws, Appendix B) is a game where each player has a set time for all the moves. That time can be from 15 to 60 minutes. Players need not record the moves. The touch & move rule is usually put aside by the organiser; if so starting the opponent's clock is the official end of a move. In other words, a player can change his mind so long as his own clock is running.\n\nRemoving the Defender, also known as removing the guard is a chess tactic where a chess piece is either captured or forced to move in order to eliminate the protection of an opponent's piece.\n\nTo concede loss of the game. A resignation is usually done by stopping the clock, and sometimes by offering a handshake or saying \"I resign\".\n\nAlso known as a family fork, results when a knight simultaneously attacks the opponent's king, queen, and rook.\n\nThe intentional loss of material to get a more important result. Often the start of a combination.\n\nThe intentional exchange of piece of greater value for a piece of smaller value in order to get a more important result. For instance, the exchange of a rook for a minor piece (bishop or knight), or the exchange of a queen for a rook.\n\nThe sheet of paper used to write down the moves of a game in progress. During formal games both players must record the game using a score sheet.\n\nMade when a game is adjourned. Score sheet with move and position are placed in an envelope, and played on the board when the game is resumed.\n\nWhen a master plays a number of opponents at the same time. Usually arranged as a ring of tables, with the master moving round inside, and the opponents outside. Players move when the master arrives at their board, master replies and moves on.\n\nLike a pin, but the valuable piece is in front. So black B, white K and white R on a diagonal in that order wins the rook.\nUnlike the fork, a skewer only works with a line piece (B, R, Q).\n\nWhere a player is not in check, but has no legal moves. It is a draw in modern chess.\n\nA chess or endgame study is a position which is made to show an interesting point. It is usual for studies to be endgame positions. Unlike chess problems, studies are connected to the game.\n\nA term in positional chess, where a player loses ground because he/she has to make a move. See Zugzwang.\n\nA series of symbols are in wide use. They help annotate games of chess.\n\nShort-term attacks requiring exact calculation, sometimes called 'forcing sequences'. It is contrasted with positional play, which is long-term strategy.\n\nIn chess, a single move. A loss of a tempo would be taking two moves where one would do. This may, or may not, be critical in the early stages of a game.\n\nArticle 4 of the Laws of Chess. If the player to play touches a piece, it must be moved if possible. If there is no legal move, then the player may make any legal move. See also J'adoube, which permits adjustment of pieces without penalty.\n\nTo arrive at the same position from different move orders. Common in certain openings, such as the Modern defence.\n\nA trebuchet is a type of reciprocal zugzwang occurring in pawn endgames, where each King is attacking the others pawn and whoever it is to move loses.\n\nA position, usually in an ending, where the player to move loses because he/she must move. A more complex definition is given by Hooper:\n\nAn \"in between move\", where a player, instead of playing the expected move, first inserts a move which the opponent must answer, before making the expected move.\n", "id": "236553", "title": "List of chess terms"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236580", "text": "Hypermodern\n\nThe hypermoderns were a school of chess players who set out to rethink some of the principles of chess openings. The name was given to them by the Polish-French grandmaster Tartakower.\n\nThe key idea was, in reaction to the older ideas of Siegbert Tarrasch, to dispute control of the centre by more subtle methods. Whereas old theory was to occupy the centre with two or three pawns immediately, the hypermoderns concentrated more on attacking the opponent's centre. A characteristic first move was 1Nf3 with White, or 1...Nf6 with Black, especially in reply to 1d4. To 1e4 they favoured an asymmetric defence such as 1...e6 or 1...c5 rather than the classical reply 1...e5. \n\nNimzovich was the founder, and Alekhine, Tartakower, Réti, Grünfeld, and Bogolyubov all took part. All were top grandmasters of the 1920s and 30s. Several modern openings owe their popularity to this group: Alekhine's Defence (1e4 Nf6); Réti's Opening (1Nf3); the King's Indian Defence (1d4 Nf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 Bg7); the Grünfeld Defence (1d4 Bf6 2c4 g6 3Nc3 d5) and the Modern Defence (1...g6).\n", "id": "236580", "title": "Hypermodern"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236592", "text": "Confidence interval\n\nIn statistics a confidence interval is a special form of estimating a certain parameter. With this method, a whole interval of acceptable values for the parameter is given instead of a single value, together with a likelihood that the real (unknown) value of the parameter will be in the interval. The confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample, and hence differs from sample to sample. The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called confidence level. Very often, this is given as a percentage. The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level. People may speak about the \"95% confidence interval\". \nThe end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits. For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be.\n\nThe calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process – it is primarily a \"parametric\" method. One common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal. As such, confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics, though changes can be made to add robustness.\n\nThe term \"confidence\" has a similar meaning in statistics, as in common use. In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty. In statistics, a claim to 95% confidence simply means that the researcher has seen one possible interval from a large number of possible ones, from which nineteen out of twenty intervals contain the true value of the parameter. \n\nA machine fills cups with margarine. For the example, the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250g of margarine. As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250g, with a standard deviation of 2.5g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of \"n\" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. The weights of margarine are \"X\", ..., \"X\", a random sample from \"X\".\n\nTo get an impression of the expectation μ, it is sufficient to give an estimate. The appropriate estimator is the sample mean: \n\nThe sample shows actual weights \"x\", ...,\"x\", with mean:\n\nIf we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g. There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter \"μ\". How do we calculate such an interval? The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample \"X\", ..., \"X\" and hence random variables themselves.\n\nIn our case we may determine the endpoints by considering that the sample mean from a normally distributed sample is also normally distributed, with the same expectation \"μ\", but with standard error \"σ\"/√\"n\" = 0.5 (grams). By standardizing we get a random variable\n\ndependent on the parameter μ to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter \"μ\". Hence it is possible to find numbers −\"z\" and \"z\", independent of \"μ\", where \"Z\" lies in between with probability 1 − α, a measure of how confident we want to be. We take 1 - α = 0.95. So we have:\n\nThe number \"z\" follows from the cumulative distribution function:\n\nand we get:\n\nThis might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter \"μ\" between the stochastic endpoints \n\nand\n\nThis does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval. Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. In 95% of the cases \"μ\" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. Our 0.95 confidence interval becomes:\n\nAs the desired value 250 of \"μ\" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.\n\nThe calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. We cannot say: \"with probability (1 − α) the parameter \"μ\" lies in the confidence interval.\" We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases μ will be in the calculated interval. In 100α % of the cases however it does not. And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. That's why we say: \"with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, \"μ\" lies in the confidence interval.\"\n\nThe figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ. If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. We'll never know; we are stuck with our interval.\n", "id": "236592", "title": "Confidence interval"}

As they move into the open land, the family groups come together into groups several hundred strong, led by adult males that work together to protect the others from predators.\n\nBaboons are omnivores (they eat both plants and meat). They eat grasses, roots, insects and other small animals, like lizards, small mammals, fish, birds, and snakes. In some places, they steal food from humans.\n\nLeopards, cheetahs, African wild dogs, lions, hyenas and people hunt the baboon. To scare the predator away, baboons can show their eyelids, show their teeth, chase the predator, and make noise.\n\nTo understand their lives, one must see them in their natural environment. \n", "id": "236653", "title": "Baboon"}

It lives in the waters of northern Australia. It is a very deadly jellyfish. The Irukandji is only 2.5 centimeters (with bell and tentacles) in diameter. This makes it hard to find. The Irukandji is believed to be the most poisonous in the world. Some people are not sure if that is true. \n\nThe Irukandjis' name comes from an Australian Aboriginal tribe. The tribe lived in the Palm Cove region of North Queensland. When the Irukandji people were stung by the Irukandji, there are many . This includes:\n\nSometimes, people may also get on their lungs (pulmonary oedema), hypertension, and heart failure.\n\nThe Irukandji has killed at least two swimmers in Australia. In 2002, Richard Jordon came to Australia as a tourist. He was a 58 year old British man. He was stung while swimming off Hamilton Island. Jordon died a few days later. There may have been more deaths which doctors did not know were caused by the jellyfish.\n\nThe Irukandji is related to another jellyfish. This is the box jellyfish, \"Chironex Fleckeri\". Irukandji was identified in 1964 by a Cairns doctor, Jack Barnes. Because of this, its scientific name is named after him. When people were getting hurt in the sea, Barnes was sure it was because of a jellyfish. He put on diving equipment and lay on the sea floor for six days until he discovered it. When Barnes discovered the Irukandji jellyfish, he tested its sting on himself, his son, and a lifeguard. They all had to be taken to the hospital.\n\nIrukandji has stingers - not only on its tentacles, but also on its bell. It is very small and weak. Because of this, sudden force may kill it. So, it cannot be kept in a normal aquarium. The first Irukandji jellyfish in was born in Townsville, Queensland.\n", "id": "236673", "title": "Irukandji jellyfish"}

The gold was on the top of Victoria Hill and was part of the Old Hill Reef. Alluvial gold was found in both Adelong Creek and Golden Gully in the same year. Adelong quickly became an important goldfield. Adelong Post Office opened on 1 January 1859.\n\nBy 1859 a number of gold reefs were being mined, including the Old Reef and the Great Victoria Mine. Between 1859 and 1876, 3,798 kilograms of gold was mined. During the gold rush the population grew to more than 30,000 people. Over 25 tonnes of gold was mined from 1857 to the close of the mines in 1914. The National Trust of Australia has listed the main street of Adelong and a number of buildings as being important historical places.\n\nA number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area. Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways.\nDuring the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines. Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery. The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s. One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s. A small town, Cornishtown, was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940s.\n\nAfter the gold rush, farming became the main business in the area. This was mainly Merino sheep and beef cattle. Over the last 20 years a tourists have come to visit because of the pleasant scenery and gold mining history. The famous Adelong Falls, with its rich gold-mining past, is an ideal spot to for a picnic or to explore the local area.\n", "id": "236806", "title": "Adelong, New South Wales"}

In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the idea, and in modern times Alan Turing, the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker, put some thought into the idea. He was not a very good chess player, but was one of the creators of the first British computer. He is also credited with the creation of Computer science.\n\nThere are two types of chess programs. One plays against a human opponent; the other helps the user become a better player. The two types can be made to work together, though they have different functions and work in different ways.\n\nChess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents. Many have been created; they can play at master level, though their processes are quite different from those of a human being.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik, but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner.\n\nCompetitions are run by putting engines against each other, and the results are published. There is a World Computer Chess Championship, in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins. Software may also be rated on other scales, such as ease of usage.\n\nFritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist, published by ChessBase. It is the current market leader. There is also a different kind of Fritz called \"Deep Fritz\" that is made for multi-processing. The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12. They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin, who said that \"Fritz is like a woman that you can't get with. It just drives (makes) you to think in ways you've never thought before\".\n\nShredder is a leading engine. It is also owned by ChessBase. It comes in various forms: Shredder 12, Deep Shredder 12; Shredder Classic. It has a reputation of being hard.\n\nRybka, a product by Vasik Rajlich, is Shredder's main rival. Rybka 4 is their latest version.\n\nChess databases do not actually play. They give access to the recorded history of master chess. There are two components. First, there is the software, which lets one search and organise the database material. Then there is the actual database, typically one to four million games.\n\nIn practice, databases are used for two purposes. First, for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings. Second, to look up specific opponents to see what they play, and prepare against them beforehand.\n\nThe existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age.\n\nChessBase is the biggest database, and widely used by masters. Although it can be used online, most users download the software and data onto their laptop. Then they take the laptop to tournaments, to help prepare for games. Players may not use computers or any other aid during games, but much preparation goes on behind the scenes. ChessBase has to be purchased, and it is not cheap.\n\nThis is a Dutch magazine for advanced players, which runs an on-line database called NicBase as part of its services. NicBase is free, and has over a million games.\n\nChessgames.com runs an on-line database of games. It is partly free, but requires registration. Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription. It has over half a million games on its database.\n\nThere are websites which a player can join (for a fee) and play on line. In this case, the subscriber will play against other subscribers, not a computer. All standards of players are amongst the members, and various events are on offer at different rates of play.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236882", "text": "Chess notation\n\nChess notation is a method for writing down chess moves: after a player makes a move, both players write it down. This is compulsory in all organized chess events \n\nThe system must have these elements: the move number, the piece moved, the square it starts from (optional), the square it goes to, and other relevant information such as captures, and castles.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> There are other notations for recording positions.\n\nThere have been ways of describing moves from quite early on. Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic (9th century) and from Europe (13th century). These early notations are usually quite cumbersome; \"The pawn of the king forward two houses\". This kind of notation is called \"descriptive\". In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view, e.g. 1 P–K4 P–K4. A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called \"algebraic\". In this notation a square has only one label, e.g. 1 e4 e5.\n\nThe moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notation. Usually algebraic chess notation is used. In algebraic notation, each square has one and only one name (whether you are looking from White's side of the board or Black's). Here, moves are written in the format of: abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved. For example, Qg5 means \"queen moves to the g-file and 5th rank\" (that is, to the square g5). If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square, one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved, e.g. Ngf3 means \"knight from the g-file moves to the square f3\". The letter P showing a pawn is not used, so that e4 means \"pawn moves to the square \"e4\"\".\n\nIf the piece makes a capture, \"x\" is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on. Example: \"Bxf3\" means \"bishop captures on f3\". When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial. For example: exd5 means \"pawn captures on d5.\"\n\nIf a pawn moves to its eighth rank, getting a promotion, the piece chosen is written after the move, for example e1Q or e1=Q. Castling is written by the special notations 0–0 for kingside castling and 0–0–0 for queenside. A move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation \"+\" added. Checkmate can be written as # or ++. At the end of the game, 1–0 means \"White won\", 0–1 means \"Black won\" and ½-½ is a draw.\n\nChess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols. For example: ! means a good move, !! means a very good move, ? means a bad move, ?? a very bad move (sometimes called a \"blunder\"), !? a creative move that may be good, and ?! a doubtful move. For example, one kind of a simple \"trap\" known as the Scholar's mate, as in the diagram to the right, may be recorded in full notation:\n\n1. e2-e4 e7-e5<br>\n2. Qd1-h5?! Nc8-c6<br>\n3. Bf1-c4 Ng8-f6?? (3...Qe7 is better)<br>\n4. Qh5xf7# 1–0\n\nHere is a famous short game in the more usual short notation:\n\nThis is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces. Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess. Since it avoids initial letters for pieces, it is more international.\n\n\nIn addition to the Forsyth notation, positions may be recorded in this simple fashion:\n", "id": "236882", "title": "Chess notation"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236889", "text": "Akiba Rubinstein\n\nAkiba Rubinstein (Stawiski, Poland, 12 December 1882 – 15 March 1961, Antwerp, Belgium) was a Polish chess Grandmaster in the first part of the 20th century. Around 1910 he was one of the three best players in the world.\n\nRubinstein was Jewish, and his family planned for him to become a rabbi. However, he did not finish his studies, and chose to devote himself to chess entirely. The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev. He learned to play chess when he was 16,<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford Companion to Chess\". Oxford.</ref> and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź. \n\nRubinstein's best period was from 1907 to 1912. It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907, and a shared win at St. Petersburg in the same year. It closed in a string of wins in 1912. He won five consecutive major tournaments that year: San Sebastian, Piešťany, Breslau (the German championship), Warsaw and Vilnius (although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca). Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from \"Chessmetrics\" support this conclusion, placing him as world #1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914. Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker, and was eclipsed by José Raúl Capablanca after 1911.\n\nRubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship: he was unable to raise enough money to meet Lasker's financial demands. In the 1909 St. Petersburg tournament, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor result at St. Petersburg tournament 1914, not reaching the final pool of five players. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I.\n\nAfter the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster, but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency. Nevertheless, he won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws. A year later he won an Olympic silver. \n\nAfter 1932 he withdrew from tournament play, mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life. He suffered from a fear of people and society. He lived then in a sanitorium, and later rejoined his family. \n\nRubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards. He left behind no literary works (perhaps because of his mental problems), but a great heritage in his games. During World War II he was placed in an asylum. One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps, he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt.\n\nHe was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground. Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames.\n\nHe originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queen's Gambit declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6 (Rubinstein - Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation, which stems from the Slav defence.\n\nToday, he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo-Indian defence.\n\nThe Rubinstein Trap, a trap in the Queen's Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice. One version of the trap runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead. \n\nThe Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj, with a glittering list of top-flight winners.\n\n\n\n", "id": "236889", "title": "Akiba Rubinstein"}

He was born in one of the poorest parts of Peru, at the end of the nineteenth century. His father worked in a gold mine by the River Inambari. Martín sometimes went to work with his father too. He saw his first photographer there at the mine. Chambi learned the basic techniques from a photographer at the Santo Domingo Mine. This meeting fired his ambition.\n\nChambi tried to work as a professional photographer after this. He traveled to the city of Arequipa in 1908, where photography was more developed. Many professional photographers lived in Areqiupa. They had developed individual photographic styles and professional techniques.\n\nChambi was an apprentice in the studio of Max T. Vargas. After nine years he created his own studio in Sicuani in 1917. He published his first postcards in November 1917. \n\nIn 1923 he moved to Cusco and opened a studio there. In Cusco he photographed rich society people and poor indigenous people. During his career, Chambi also travelled all over the Andes. He photographed the landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236906", "text": "Reception history of Jane Austen\n\nThe reception history of Jane Austen shows how Austen's works, at first having modest fame, became wildly popular. Her books are both the subject of great study and the center of various fan culture. Jane Austen, the writer of such works as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813) and \"Emma\" (1815), has become one of the most famous novelists in the English language.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's books did not make her very famous. Like a great number of women writers at that time, she chose to publish her books secretly. Only among people in the aristocracy, her writing was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were thought fashionable by members of high society. However, they received only a few good reviews. By the mid-nineteenth century, her works were respected by people who were learned in literature. They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever. In 1870, her nephew published \"Memoir of Jane Austen\". This showed her to a wider public as \"dear, quiet aunt Jane\". After this, her works were published again in popular editions. By the twentieth century, lots of groups had formed. Some praised her and some defended her from the \" masses\". However, they all claimed to be true Janeites, or people who really appreciated Austen.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, scholars made a collection of her works (the first for any British novelist). But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a \"great English novelist\". In the second half of the twentieth century, people began studying Austen more and more, and in different ways. For example, they studied her works artistically, ideologically, and historically. The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century. As they grew, criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends. In the late twentieth century, fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs. They praised Austen, her time, and her works. In the early twenty-first century, Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels. They also support Austen's work in television and film.\n\nJane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close family. Her family was in the lower part of the English gentry. Her family's steady support was very important to Austen's development as a writer. For example, Austen read her first drafts of all of her books to her family. In this way, she received encouragement and help. In fact, it was her father who first tried to put her book in print. Austen's training as a writer lasted from when she was a teenager until she was about 35. During this time, she experimented with different literary forms. This included the epistolary novel (novel in letters), which she tried and did not like. She wrote and revised three important novels and began a fourth. When \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1815) came out in print, she became a successful writer.\n\nHowever, novel-writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century. This was because it made them famous. It also made people think them . So like a great number of other female writers, Austen published her books secretly. In time, though, her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy. In one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her to his home. His librarian showed her around and said that the Regent liked her books very much. The librarian added that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to it to the Prince\". Austen did not like the prince, who spent a lot of money. She did not want to follow this suggestion. However, her friends persuaded her to follow it. Therefore, \"Emma\" was dedicated to him. Austen refused the librarian's suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the prince's daughter's marriage.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised \"Northanger Abbey\" (1817) and wrote \"Persuasion\" (1817). She also began another novel, which was later titled \"Sanditon\". She could not finish it before her death. Austen did not have time to see \"Northanger Abbey\" or \"Persuasion\" through the press. However, her family published them as one book after she died. Her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\". This short biography made people think of Austen as a quiet aunt who wrote in her free time. \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives (purposes) ... [S]o much did she from , that no accumulation of fame would have induced (made) her, had she lived, to affix (put) her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress.\" However, Austen shows excitement in her letters about getting her books in print. She was also interested in how much money the books would make. Austen was a professional writer.\n\nAusten's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and clever use of free indirect speech. They are also remarkable for their burlesque and irony. They criticize the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century. They are part of the change to nineteenth-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen laughed at \"love at first sight, the primacy (first importance) of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the of the hero, the sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed (declared) indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel of parents\". Austen's stories, though comic, focus on the way women depend on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. She was also concerned with moral problems, like Samuel Johnson, who strongly influenced her.\n\nAusten's books quickly became fashionable. Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them. Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough wrote about \"Sense and Sensibility\" in a letter to a friend. She said: \"it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\" The 15-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to Marianne Dashwood. She remarked, \"I think Marianne & me are very like in \"disposition\", that certainly I am not so good, the same , &tc\". \"Pride and Prejudice\" was enjoyed by Richard Sheridan, a person who wrote plays. He told a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of Lord Byron, wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior (good) work.\" She added that \"is the most \"probable\" fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that \"Mansfield Park\" was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\". Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the writer Maria Edgeworth, that \"[\"Mansfield Park\"] has been pretty generally admired here\". Edgeworth later said that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".\n\nHigh society liked and approved of Austen's novels. However, they received few reviews while she was alive. There were two for \"Sense and Sensibility\". \"Pride and Prejudice\" received three. \"Mansfield Park\" received none. There were seven for \"Emma\". Most of the reviews were short, careful, and approving. They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books. Brian Southam writes about these reviewers: \"their job was merely to provide brief (short) notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit (good) of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\". \n\nFamous writer Walter Scott wrote the longest and deepest of these reviews. He was asked by publisher John Murray to review \"Emma\". \"Emma\" had come out in print (without saying who the writer was) in the March 1816 issue of the \"Quarterly Review\". Using the review as a way to praise the novel, Scott praised Austen's works. He praised her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking of that which is daily (every day) taking place around him\". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence (difference) from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826 about Austen. This later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\nAlso read again and for the third time at least Miss Austen's very finely written novel of \"Pride and Prejudice\". That young lady had a talent for describing the and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going, but the exquisite touch which renders (makes) ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!\n\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\" were published together in December 1817. They were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's great use of realism was proof of a limited imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" thought differently. He praised Austen for her \" invention\". He was also pleased with Austen's stories because they mixed familiar scenes with surprising twists. Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her works. For example, they wrongly understood her use of irony. Reviewers thought \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" were stories of virtue overcoming vice.\n\nIn the \"Quarterly Review\" in 1821 another review came out. Richard Whately was an English writer and theologican. He published the most serious early review of Austen's work. Whately compared Austen and great writers such as Homer and Shakespeare with favor. He praised the dramatic quality of her stories. He also said that the novel was a real, respectable genre of literature. He argued that imaginative literature, especially , was very valuable. He even said they were more important than history or biography. When it was well done, as Austen's works were, Whately said that novels wrote about human experience that the reader could learn from. In other words, he believed that it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer. He wrote: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's [\"sic\"] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge (admit) it.\" No better criticism of Austen was put in print until the late nineteenth century. Whately and Scott had begun the Victorian era's view of Austen.\n\nAusten had a great number of readers who liked and respected her in the nineteenth century. According to critic Ian Watt, they liked her \" to ordinary (usual) social experience\". However, Austen's works were not exactly what her Romantic and Victorian British audience liked. They wished for \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and color in the writing\". Victorian critics and audiences liked the work of writers like Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Compared to them, Austen's works seemed narrow and quiet. Austen's works were put in print again beginning in late 1832 or early 1833. Richard Bentley printed them in the \"Standard Novels\" series, and remained in print for a long time after that. However, they were not bestsellers. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".\n\nThe people who read Austen saw themselves as clever readers. They were the few. This became a well-known theme of Austen criticism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. George Henry Lewes was a philosopher and literary critic. He spoke about this theme in a series of articles in the 1840s and 1850s. \"The Novels of Jane Austen\" was put in print in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1859. In there, Lewes praised Austen's books for \"the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid (help) from superfluous elements\". He also compared her to Shakespeare. He argued that Austen was not good at making up plots. However, he still enjoyed the dramatic quality of her works. He said: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense (very strong); but his interest never wanes (stops) for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators (viewers) of the little drama.\"\n\nWriter Charlotte Brontë liked Austen's writing because they were truthful about everyday life. However, Brontë called her \"only shrewd (clever) and observant\". She said there was not enough passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work seemed formal and narrow. In a letter written to G.H. Lewes in 1848, Brontë said that she did not like \"Pride and Prejudice\". She said:\n\nSoon after Austen's works were printed in Britain, they appeared in some European countries. They began appearing in 1813 with a French translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\". It was quickly followed by German, Dutch, and Swedish editions. They were not always easy to get in Europe. Austen was not well known in Russia. The first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Austen’s works were translated into various European languages. However, Europeans did not see her works as part of the English novel tradition. This was partly because of the changes made by translators. They put in sentimentalism into Austen's works. They also failed to put in her humor and irony. Therefore, European readers more often thought of Walter Scott's style as the English novel.\n\nThe great changes made by her translators made the Continent receive Austen differently than in Britain. For example, the French writer Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's \"Pride and Prejudice\", conversations (talks) between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by calm, proper ones. In Jane Austen's work, Elizabeth said that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's). She says this is because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze (surprise) the whole room\". However, this becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") Cossy and Saglia explained, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied (not given) and gender distinction introduced\". Austen’s works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition. Because of this, people were more interested in the works of French realists like Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. Austen was also treated as a romantic writer in Germany.\n\nFor years, people thought the same of Austen as Scott and Whately. Only a few people actually read her novels. In 1870 the first important Austen biography, \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh and printed. This changed the way people thought of Austen. When it came out in print, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased greatly. The \"Memoir\" made people think of an untrained writer who wrote . People thought Austen was a quiet, middle-aged unmarried aunt. This made them feel that her works were safe for respectable Victorian families to read. The \"Memoir\" made Austen's books be printed again in great numbers. The first popular editions came out in 1883. They were a cheap series printed by Routledge. This was followed by editions with pictures, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, critics still said that only people who could really understand the deep meaning of Austen's books should read them. However, after the \"Memoir\" was printed, much more criticism about Austen was printed. More came out in two years than had come out in the last 50 years.\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh printed a family biography. It was titled: \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record\". William and Arthur were both part of the Austen family. It was based mostly on family papers and letters. It is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \", staid (steady), , and at times vivid and suggestive\". The authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the \"Memoir\". However, they did not go much beyond the family records and traditions they always had. Therefore, their book offers only facts. It does not offer much interpretation.\n\nIn the last part of the nineteenth century, the first critical books about Austen's works were printed. In 1890 Godwin Smith printed the \"Life of Jane Austen\". This began a \"fresh phase in the critical \". This began \"formal (official) criticism\". People began focusing on Austen as a writer and analyzing the ways that made her writing special. Southam said that there was much more Austen criticism around 1780. He also said that the reviews became better. However, he was troubled at the \"certain uniformity\" in them:\n\nWe see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface 'finish'; for the realism of their fictional world, the variety and vitality (strength) of their characters; for their pervasive humour; and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery. The novels are prized for their 'perfection'. Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection, achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy.\n\nRichard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen were some of the best reviewers. In a review of the \"Memoir\", Simpson said Austen was a serious but ironic critic of English society. He began two interpretative themes: using humor to criticize society and irony as a means of moral study. He continued Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, and wrote that Austen:\n\nbegan by being an ironical critic; she manifested her by direct censure, but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her , humour, irony, the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks, are her characteristics.\nSimpson's essay was not well-known. It did not a lot of influence until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Margaret Oliphant was another important writer whose criticism of Austen did not have much influence. She described Austen as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint (control),' with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose works are very 'calm and cold and keen'\". This kind of criticism was not fully developed until the 1970s. This was when feminist literary criticism began.\n\nAusten's works had been in print in the United States from 1832. However, it was only after 1870 that Americans began seriously considering Austen's works. As Southam says, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too , too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\". Austen was not democratic enough for Americans. Also, her books did not have the frontier themes that often came out in American literature. The way Americans thought about Austen was represented in an argument between William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. Through his essays, Howells helped make Austen much more popular. Twain, however, used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. In his book \"Following the Equator\", Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" changed the way they described Austen as she became more and more popular. The eighth edition (1854) called her \"an elegant novelist\". The ninth edition (1875) praised her as \"one of the most distinguished (remarkable) modern British novelists\". Austen novels began to be studied at universities. Her works also began to come out in histories of the English novel. Most people still thought of her as \"dear aunt Jane\", the way she was first presented in the \"Memoir\". Howells had made this picture of Austen famous by his essays in the \"Harper's Magazine\". Writer and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania for Austen that grew in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". It was only after the \"Memoir\" was printed that readers grew to like Austen as a person. Until then, literary elites had said their enjoyment of Austen showed how clever they were. However, around the 1990s, they grew troubled at how popular Austen's works became. They began calling themselves \"Janeites\". They wanted to show that they were different from the people who they thought did not understand Austen properly.\n\nAmerican novelist Henry James liked Austen. Once he said she was as great as Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding - \"the fine painters of life\". But James thought Austen was an \"unconscious\" artist who was \"instinctive and charming\". In 1905, James said he did not like the public interest in Austen. He said it was more than Austen's \"intrinsic merit (worth) and interest\" deserved. James said that this was mostly because of the \"stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, their material pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"\n\nReginald Farrer, a British travel writer, did not like the sentimental image of \"Aunt Jane\". Instead, he wanted to study Austen's fiction in a new way. In 1917, he published a long essay in the \"Quarterly Review\". Jane Austen scholar A. Walton Litz called it the best single introduction to her works. Southam calls it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship. Farrer claimed that Jane Austen was not unconscious (disagreeing with James). He said that she was a writer of great concentration and a sharp critic of her society. He called her \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\". Farrer was one of the first critics who saw Austen as a writer.\n\nThe light of Austen scholarship was beginning to shine through several important early works. These works helped Austen become well accepted in the . The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar Andrew Cecil Bradley's 1911 essay. This essay was \"generally (largely) regarded (seen) as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\". Bradley pointed out Austen's ties to eighteenth-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson. He argued that she was a moralist as well as a humorist. According to Southam, this argument was \"totally (completely) original\". Bradley separated Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels. Scholars still separate Austen's works as Bradley did today. The second original early-twentieth-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman. His edition of Austen's works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman edition has been the basis for all editions of Austen's works after that.\n\nAfter Bradley and Chapman, Austen scholarship grew very quickly in the 1920s. British writer E. M. Forster pointed out Austen's works for his idea of the \"round\" character. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\"—\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short essay about her, a study of the books Austen read and their influence on her writing, and a study of Austen's style and \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that critics before her had all worked in a way \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\". She wished to study all of Austen's works, style, and techniques together. Critics after Lascelles agreed that she studied them well. Lascelles was interested in Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. In this she was much like Bradley before her. But around this time, some fans of Austen began to worry that her works were being enjoyed by only a few people. They were fearful that Austen was being criticized only by academics. This was an argument that continued to the beginning of the twenty-first century.\nMid-century revisionist views started to become popular, and scholars began studying Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, adding to Farrer, wrote an essay called \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\". He argued that Austen did not support society's customs, and that her irony was not funny but bitter. He also claimed that Austen wanted to show the faults of the society she wrote about. Through her use of irony, Austen tried to protect herself as an artist and a person from the behavior and practices she disliked. Almost at the same time, British critic Q. D. Leavis printed \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\" in \"Scrutiny\" in the early 1940s. In there, Leavis argued that Austen was a professional, not an amateur (untrained), writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\" (1952). This was written by Martin Mudrick, who saw Austen as lonely, defensive, and critical of her society. He carefully described the connection between Austen's attitude towards the literature of her time and how she used irony to show the difference of how society was, and how she thought it could be. An important British critic, F. R. Leavis, said in \"The Great Tradition\" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction. Ian Watt agreed, and helped shape the arguments about the genre of the novel. The revisionist views and Leavis's words helped Austen to have a great reputation among academics. They agreed that she \"combined (put together) <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to (better than) both\".\n\nAfter the Second World War, people began studying Austen more deeply, and in different ways. A great number of people have studied Austen as a political writer. Critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels , criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting and an open class hierarchy.\" In \"Jane Austen and the War of Ideas\" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was greatly influenced by the principal moral and political arguments of her time, and that she had a partisan, firmly conservative and Christian position in these arguments. Alistair M. Duckworth in \"The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels\" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important society, which should be conserved (kept), improved, and passed down to future generations. As Rajeswari Rajan notes, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now study include: \"the Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus (against) country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied (kept) a reformist position between these extremes\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979). \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" explores the \"explosive anger\" of nineteenth-century female English writers under their \"decorous (proper) surfaces\". This work, together with other feminist criticism of Austen, has made people see her as a \"woman\" writer. The interest these critics showed in Austen made people discover and study other women writers in Austen's time. Also, when Julia Prewitt Brown's \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's \"Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction\" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's \"Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel\" (1988) were printed, scholars were no longer able to argue that Austen was firmly \"apolitical, or '\". Kirkham, for example, said that Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft were quite similar. She called them both \"Enlightenment feminists\". Johnson also places Austen in an eighteenth-century political tradition. However, she notes the influence Austen received from the political novels of the 1790s written by women.\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s, and 2000s ideological, postcolonial, and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993) to \"Mansfield Park\", arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early nineteenth century. In \"Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health\"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\" (2003) which connects artistic concerns with queer theory.\n\n", "id": "236906", "title": "Reception history of Jane Austen"}

It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan. It is claimed by neither country right now. It is sometimes given the name the Bir Tawil Triangle, because even though it's not an exact triangle, it's made out of two triangles that share a border. The longer side is in the north of the area. It runs along the 22° north circle of latitude. \n\nThe administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902. Their political boundary was set in 1899. It was set as the 22° north circle of latitude. This area lies south of the 22° parallel. East-to-west, the area is between long in the south. It is long in the north. It is between and wide north-to-south. It is also in size. \n\nThe Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902. This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan, Egypt. At the same time, the Hala'ib Triangle north of latitude 22° north, and northeast of the area, came under Sudanese administration. This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan. The two \"triangles\" border at one point, a quadripoint.\n\nIn 1899, the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel. At that time, the United Kingdom ruled the area. In 1902 the UK drew a separate \"administrative boundary\". Using this boundary, a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration. It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo, both geographically and culturally. The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum.\n\nEgypt claims the original border from 1899, the 22° north circle of latitude. This would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902. This would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states claim the Hala'ib Triangle. Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked. There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories. It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area. This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land. As a result, Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state.\n\nIn the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil (جبل طويل in Arabic, located at ).

He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism.\nTarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s.

This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament.

His \"Dreihundert Schachpartien\" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the \"praeceptor mundi\", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine \"One of the monuments of our game\".\n\nTarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the \"Deutsch Schachzeitung\", the German-language chess magazine.

It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967. Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa. The holiday greeting is \"Joyous Kwanzaa\".\n\nKwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s. It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage. \n\nThe name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase \"matunda ya kwanza\", meaning first fruits of the harvest. \n\nDuring the early years of Kwanzaa, Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas, that Jesus was psychotic, and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun. However, as Kwanzaa became more popular, Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included. He stated in the 1997 \"Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community, and Culture\", \"Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday.\"\n\nMany Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas.\n\nKwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa, or \"Nguzo Saba\" (originally \"Nguzu Saba\"—the seven principles of blackness). Karenga said that this \"is a communitarian African philosophy,\" . It consists of what Karenga called \"the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world.\" These seven principles comprise \"Kawaida\", a Swahili term for tradition and reason. Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles, as follows:\n\nKwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed, corn and other crops, a candle holder with seven candles, called a kinara, a communal cup for pouring libations, gifts, a poster of the seven principles, and a black, red, and green flag. The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles.\n\nDuring Kwanzaa, families also decorate their households with objects of art. They use colorful African cloth such as kente, especially the wearing of kaftans by women. Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used. It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors. Libations are shared, generally with a common chalice (\"a shared cup\"), \"Kikombe cha Umoja\", passed around to all people present. A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections, libations, a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness, reflection on the Pan-African colors, a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history, a candle-lighting ritual, artistic performance, and, finally, a feast (Karamu). The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is \"Habari Gani?\" which is Swahili for \"What's the News?\"\n\nCultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa, an annual celebration held at the John F.

The games were released in Japan on September 18, 2010, in Europe on March 4, 2011, and in North America on March 6, 2011. The games have 156 new Pokémon, which brings the total to 649. These games introduce the largest amount of Pokémon in any generation.\n\n\"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\" are role-playing games where the player captures creatures called Pokémon. They can use them to battle against other Pokémon. One of the new features in the games are triple battles, which allows players to battle three Pokémon against three Pokémon. Alongside triple battles are Rotation Battles. Players still send out three Pokémon, but only one can battle at a time. The player can switch the position of their Pokémon during their turn. Also new is that the seasons change, and areas in the game have falling leaves in the fall, and snow in the winter.\n\n\"Pokémon Black\" and \"White\" take place in the Unova region, which is based on New York City and its surrounding area, unlike past games being based on regions of Japan. The plot of the game follows a new Pokémon trainer who is on a journey to become a Pokémon master. They do this by battling other trainers such as Gym Leaders, and finally the Elite Four. During this journey, the player meets an evil team known as Team Plasma, who look like knights. Team Plasma wants to make a new world where Pokémon are away from humans. After taking them down, the player must track down the first members, the Seven Sages, and battle them.\n\n", "id": "237070", "title": "Pokémon Black and White"}

He was recognised as the best player in the world for much of the time between 1851 and 1870. He won three great international tournaments: the first in London 1851, then London 1862 and Baden-Baden 1870. Anderssen was somewhat less good in matches, and lost in 1858 to Paul Morphy and, narrowly, to Steinitz in 1866. He was also a chess problem composer.\n\nAnderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered—including the Baden-Baden 1870 tournament, which is comparable to modern strong GM tournaments. His last success was at Leipzig in 1877 where he came second equal with Zukertort, behind Paulsen. He was then nearly 60.\n\nHe is still famous for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the 'Immortal Game' (1851) and the 'Evergreen Game' (1852). He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an elder statesman of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.\n\n", "id": "237085", "title": "Adolf Anderssen"}

They have been used where information needs to be classified. Examples are image, document, or speech recognition, and information retrieval.\n\nIt is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes' discovery in the 1740s called Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe term \"Bayesian networks\" was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects:\n\nIn the late 1980s, the seminal texts \"Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems\" and \"Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems\" summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study.\n\nInformal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore, in the form of Wigmore charts, to analyse trial evidence in 1913.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237113", "text": "Sexual intercourse\n\nSexual intercourse (or simply called sex) is the insertion and thrusting of a male's penis into a female's vagina. People and animals that sexually reproduce use sexual intercourse to have an offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus or copulation and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together. The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic, as is the case with snails. Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the same sex.\n\nHumans sometimes engage in behaviors that do not include the penetration of sexual organs, such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non-sexual organs (fingering, fisting). These behaviors are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse.\n\nTwo animals coming together for the purposes of sexual reproduction is called mating. Most animals only mate when the female is at the point of estrus, which is the most fertile period of time in its reproductive cycle. In certain animals, sexual intercourse is not only used for reproduction, but has taken other functions as well. These animals include bonobos, dolphins, and chimpanzees which also have sexual intercourse even when the female is not in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex partners. In most instances, humans have sex primarily for pleasure. This behavior in the above mentioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure, which in turn strengthens social bonds.\n\nMany governments have laws relating to sex. Forcing someone to have sex who does not want to, called rape, is a serious crime in many countries. There are other forms of sex that may also be against the law, such as incest, sex with minors, sex outside of a marriage, prostitution, homosexual sex, sex with animals, as well as others.\n\nSexual intercourse is the natural and most common way to make a baby. It involves a man and woman having sex without birth control until the man ejaculates, or releases, semen from his penis into the woman's vagina. The semen, containing sperm (which is made in his testicles), moves to the Fallopian tubes, and if it finds an ovum on its way, it will try to fertilize it. If this works, the now fertilized ovum sticks to the side of the uterus and the woman becomes pregnant. The fertilized ovum then develops into a human. Medically, it is called a pregnancy until birth.\n\nCertain species of animals also have sex for other purposes than to bear offspring. These include Humans, bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins. These species also are among those known to engage in homosexual behaviors.\nIn both humans and bonobos, the female has a relatively concealed ovulation. Neither male or female partners commonly know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One reason for this may be that sex partners of these species form strong emotional bonds. The partners come together for more than just sexual intercourse. In the case of humans, long-term partnership is more important than immediate sexual reproduction.\n\nHumans, bonobos and dolphins show cooperative behaviour. In many cases, this behaviour has shown better results than what an individual can achieve alone. In these animals, the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction and has taken additional social functions. Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals. Overall, such cooperation also benefits each member of the group in that they are better able to survive.\n\nIn humans, sexual intercourse seems to serve three types of purposes,which do not exclude one another:\n\nIn the late 20th century, very effective forms of contraception (birth control) were developed allowing a man and women to help prevent a baby from being made when they have sex. One type of contraception is a condom. This is a piece of rubber that covers the penis that a man can wear during intercourse, which stops the man's semen from going into the woman's vagina. This does not always work though because the condom may rip or tear. Another well-known type of contraception is called the Pill, which a woman takes every day. When a woman is \"on the Pill,\" she and her partner may have sex any time they wish with very little chance of making a baby. It is recommended that a couple who have a sexual relationship use two forms of contraception. That way if one fails the other is a 'backup'. \nContraception allows people to keep \"sex for fun\" separate from \"sex to make children\". For example, a fertile couple may use contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational). At the same time, this experience may strengthen their relationship, and a stronger relationship may mean that they will better be able to raise children in the future.\n\nWho people like to have sex with depends on their sexuality. Men who like to have sex with women, and women who like to have sex with men are heterosexual or \"straight\". Men who only like to have sex with other men, and women who only like to have sex with other women are homosexual or \"gay\". A different word to describe a woman who only likes to have sex with other women is \"lesbian\". Some people like both men and women, which is called being bisexual. Others do not feel sexual attraction at all, and are referred to as asexual.\nApproximately 1.5% of the UK's population in 2010 was bisexual or gay.\n\nSome diseases can be caught by having sex. These diseases are called sexually-transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nSome examples of STIs include chlamydia infection, syphilis and gonorrhoea. A virus called HIV causes AIDS, which cannot be cured and can lead to death.\n\nUsing Latex condoms or oral dams reduce the chance that a few types of diseases will be passed on, but it not entirely effective for all STIs. Birth control (like \"the Pill\") can prevent pregnancy, but won't prevent sexual infections.\n\nSome STIs can also be spread in ways other than having sex. For example, herpes simplex and hepatitis B could be caught by a virgin without having sex, but can also be caught through sex. Some types of STIs can spread from contact between the genitals, mouth, anus, skin, eyes, and (rarely) infected surfaces; this depends a lot on the type of STI and how it spreads. Some common diseases like HPV can cause warts and cancer in the genitals or anus or throat.\n\nThere exists an HPV vaccine that prevents some sexually-transmitted strains of HPV; however, the vaccine only works if you get vaccinated before becoming infected. The vaccine is approved of for both men and women, but is often not required in the U.S. due to politics.\n\nThere are many other kinds of sex. Two of them are oral sex and anal sex.\n\nOral sex is when one partner uses the tongue, mouth, or throat to excite the other partner's sex organs.\n\nSlang for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: \"going down on\", \"giving a blowjob\", or \"giving head\". The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. When a man performs fellatio on himself, it is called autofellatio. Few men are able to do this.\n\nPeople can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex, such as herpes (which can be passed between the mouth and groin), HIV and even oral cancer.\n\nAnal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into the sexual partner's anus. Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself, however, semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina, and pregnancy may rarely occur. Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another. It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear, bleed and get infected with bacteria. For safety and pleasure partners often use condoms, female condoms and/or lubrication.\n\nA painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse due to physical, psychogenic and emotional causes. Doctors call the condition as \"dyspareunia\". It occurs in women and men. The condition affects up to one-fifth of women at some point in their lives.\n\n\n", "id": "237113", "title": "Sexual intercourse"}

He was the greatest chess player of his era and an unofficial world champion. This was widely accepted when he defeated Adolf Anderssen, with seven wins, two loses, and two draws, in 1858. Morphy was also one of the first great chess prodigies in the modern era.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref>\n\nMorphy was a Creole of mixed inheritance. He was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a father of Portuguese, Irish, and Spanish ancestry, and a mother who was a French Creole. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was musically talented. Morphy grew up in an atmosphere of culture where chess and music were the typical highlights of a Sunday home gathering.\n\nMorphy taught himself, and by nine he was good by the standards of the local players. At 12 he defeated the Hungarian professional Löwenthal in three casual games. Then he played little chess until he had qualified in law in April 1857. He then entered the first American Chess Congress in New York, and won it easily. Next, he accepted an invitation to play in a tournament in Birmingham, England. That started his famous European tour. He beat everyone of note in England, though Staunton avoided a match.\n\nIn Paris he beat Harrwitz, the house professional, at the Café de la Régence. He then won easily against Anderssen, who was a bit out of practice. One of his feats was simultaneous play against five strong players, winning two, drawing two and losing one. In summary, he proved he was the best at that time. On his return home he toured the East Coast cities, accepting testimonials, banquets and applause. He wrote a chess column for a year in the New York Ledger in 1859–60. \n\nQuick and simple development leading to a direct attack: that was Morphy's method. His openings were first-rate for their time. He brought off some outstanding combinations and sacrifices, and his best games are still a model for young players. His games mark the high point of the romantic movement in chess, where players would play all out for direct attacks. This style was later squashed by better defensive technique, especially for the black side in the openings. Out of this came Dr Tarrasch's classical principles, and the idea that no game can be lost without a mistake being made. The chess of the 1890s came to look quite different from Morphy's games, partly because he had forced players to think more clearly about what they were doing.\n\nMorphy soon gave up chess, but his law practice was disrupted by the American Civil War (1861–1865). He was opposed to secession, and did not serve in the Confederate Army. Morphy traveled to Havana and to Paris, where he had a married sister, but refused invitations to play in public. His law practice never took off, and he never worked or played chess again. The last years of his life were marred by mental illness bordering on paranoia. He suffered from distrust, obsessions and delusions, and showed erratic behavior.\n\nMorphy died at 47, in his bathtub, perhaps of a stroke. He was the first of several great American players to have a short chess career. Pillsbury died young, reputedly of syphilis, and Bobby Fischer, like Morphy, stopped voluntarily, while still a young man. Fischer showed symptoms of mental illness of a similar kind to Morphy's.\n", "id": "237224", "title": "Paul Morphy"}

The name Bidatsu\"-tennō\" was created for him posthumously by later generations.\n\nHe was the second son of Emperor Kimmei. His mother, Ishi-hime, was a daughter of Emperor Senka.\n\nHis palace in Yamato Province was called Osada no Miya of Iware.\n\nAlthough he had many children, none of them would ever become emperor. According to \"Gukanshō\", Bidatsu had four empresses and 16 Imperial children (6 sons and 10 daughters).\n\nIn the 15th year of Kimmei's reign, Bidatsu was named Crown Prince.\n\nIn the 32nd year of Kimmei's reign (572), the emperor died; and his successor was Bidatsu. This was confirmed in ceremonies.\n\nBidatsu's reign was marked by power struggles about Buddhism. The two most important men in the court of Bidatsu were Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya. Soga supported the growth of Buddhism, and Moriya wanted to stop it.\n\nBidatsu suffered from an unknown disease which afflicted him with sores. Probably, he was the first royal victim of smallpox in Japan.\n\nIn the 14th year of Bidatsu's reign (585), he died; and the succession (\"senso\") were passed to his younger half-brother who became known as Emperor Yōmei. \nAccording to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (\"kofun\").

It often means someone or something lasting longer than expected. \n\nLongevity usually includes thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of science fiction and utopian novels.\n\nLongevity stories are cultural traditions and lore about exceptional human longevity, with or without \"eternal youth\". These stories include sincere beliefs of claims of extreme age. Each category of belief is based on a different motivation for claiming exceptional age.\n\nStories of exaggerated longevity have been around since the earliest civilizations. The first longevity narratives were probably the patriarchal/matriarchal claims, which are often an attempt to link humans to the gods or to God due to fuller life. In some religious traditions there are claims that, if one follows a certain philosophy or practice, one can become immortal or at least live to an extreme age.\n\nFountain of Youth narratives describe some natural source that provides healing and particularly longevity and youthful health. An extension and adaptation of the fountain of youth concept is the idea that a particular place, rather than a substance, carries what is needed to attain extreme age, and that a person seeking extreme longevity needs to move to a special district.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau predicts that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. However, the UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and caution that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate their projections.\n\n\n", "id": "237303", "title": "Longevity"}

She is by far the strongest female chess player in history, yet she has never played in the Women's World Chess Championship. In 1991 she got the title of Grandmaster (GM) at 15 years, 4 months. She was, at that time, the youngest person to do so. Polgár is now ranked number 51 in the world, the only woman on FIDE's \"Top 100 Players\" list; she has been ranked as high as eighth.\n\nJudit and her two sisters were educated at home by their father. She always preferred playing in the open events, making it clear from the start that she wanted to become the true world chess champion regardless of gender. This considerably annoyed the Hungarian Chess Federation, which had visions of winning the Women's World Championship after decades of Soviet domination. Paid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federation, the family did play in two female-only events. The Hungarians (nicknamed 'Polgaria') won the Women's Chess Olympiads, with a team packed with Polgárs, in 1988 and 1990. Zsuzsa, Judit, Sofia (the least strong sister) and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time. \n\nIn 1994 Judit suffered a controversial defeat at the hands of then-world champion Garry Kasparov, the highest-rated chessplayer of all time. Kasparov changed his mind after making a losing move and then made another move instead. According to chess rules, once a player has released a piece s/he cannot make a different move, so Kasparov should have been made to play his original move. However, Polgár did not challenge this because she says there were no witnesses and an arbiter was not around. She was also unaware at the time that the re-move was caught on tape by a television crew. The tournament director was criticised for not forfeiting Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him.\n\nIn the event, Polgar has not reached the top of the game (very few do), and now is the mother of two children. Nevertheless, she has broken the gender barrier in chess: she has proved that a woman can reach the top ten. Her sister, Susan Polgar, who now lives in the U.S.A., did become Women's World Champion, and also a full Grandmaster.\n\n", "id": "237376", "title": "Judit Polgár"}

He argued that allowing human emotions to express themselves was important. For this reason, he tried to strengthen the position that Chinese literature had in Japan. Sorai had a large following with his teachings and created the Sorai school, which would become an influential force in Japanese Confucian scholarship.\n\nSorai was born the second son of a samurai (a warrior) who served as the personal physician of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi (徳川綱吉). Tsunayoshi would become the fifth shogun. Sorai studied the Zhu Xi version of Song Confucianism, and by 1690 he became a private teacher of Chinese classics. In 1696, he started serving Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, a senior councilor to Tsunayoshi. Tsunayoshi died in 1709. At that time Sorai stopped using the teachings of Zhu Xi and started to develop his own philosophy and school. Sorai is credited with the creation of kō shōgi, an unusual form of chess.\n\nSorai wrote many influential works where he showed what he thought were the two basic problems of the philosophy of Song Confucianism. The first was with the bakufu-domain system, which by the eighteenth century was in trouble. Sorai doubted that it was enough that each person wanted to find their ethical good. He argued that solving the political crisis of the time required more than perfecting moral character. He also saw that the Chinese sage kings were not only concerned with morality, but also with government itself. The second point where Sorai disagreed with Song Confucianism was that he felt it was putting too much emphasis on morality and that it repressed human nature, because human nature was based on emotion. \n\nHe felt that these weaknesses were not weaknesses of Confucianism; in his view, Song Confucianists interpreted the classic works of the Four Books and the Five Classics the wrong way. In Soraiu's view, they did this because they \"did not know the old words\". Sorai consulted the ancient works to get more reliable knowledge. He stated that the ultimate form of scholarly knowledge was history. For him, these works were the best source, even though the present was constantly changing. Sorai thought that study of philosophy began with the study of language. In this he was highly influenced by the Ancient Rhetoric school of the Ming period. This movement saw the Qin and Han periods as the model for prose, and the Tang period as a model for poetry. The Sorai school introduced in \"Selections of Tang Poetry\" to Japan, where it became very popular. This work is thought to have been edited by Li Panlong (李攀竜 1514-70), who was a founder of the Ancient Rhetoric school. As a result of this, Sorai's school is also known as the Ancient Rhetoric (\"kobunji\" 古文辞) school today. Sorai's school saw \"Selections of Tang Poetry\" mainly as a means of accessing the Five Classics. In this viewpoint it was different from other Confucianist schools. Sorai would also accuse other Confucianists in Japan, such as Hayashi Razan, of relying too heavily on Song sources such as Zhu Xi.\n\nSorai also did not agree with other teachings of Song Confucianism. One was that the \"Way\" was not a predetermined principle of the universe, but rather an establishment of men: the ancient sages had described it in the Confucianist classic works. These provided for the \"Way\", which was divided by rites (\"rei\" 礼) and music (\"gaku\" 楽). The rites gave social order and music gave inspiration for the heart. In this it directly allowed for the flow of human emotions, something that the moralist philosophy of Song Confucianism did not agree with. Sorai argued for the opposite, and wanted people to be enriched through music and poetry. He taught that literature should be cared for, because it was an important part of human expression. As a result, Chinese writing began to thrive in Japan and became an accepted art form. In this way, several great writers of Chinese composition of that time were followers of his school.\n\nSorai was a supporter of the samurai class. While most old institution decline because of leadership problems, the samurai, he felt, were best able to solve this problem with a system of rewards and punishment. Sorai also saw problems with the merchant class at the time: he accused them of conspiring to lock prices. He did not support the lower classes either, though. He argued, \"What possible value can there be for the common people to overreach their proper station in life and study such books [as the Confucian classics]?\"\n\n\"Master Sorai's Teachings\" is a record of Sorai's teaching and his exchanges with his students. The text was edited by his own students and contained their questions followed by his answers. The work was not released until 1724, but it is thought to have actually been written around 1720. In it he writes that literature is not so much intended for instruction in morality or governance, rather it simply allows human's emotions to flow. From this, answers to the former topics may be found. While Sorai sought to redefine the sources of Tokugawa legitimacy, his purpose was clearly to strengthen the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate.\n\nSome scholars criticised Sorai's work and found his teaching was impractical. Goi Ranshū believed that Sorai was motivated to surpass Itō Jinsai, another leading Confucianist. Goi thought that Sorai had used Itō's arguments to the level of absurdity. Goi felt that Sorai's teachings would cause a lot of damage to moral philosophy if they were followed. Another scholar critical of Sorai's teachings was Nakai Chikuzan, who was also familiar with Goi's opposition to Ogyū Sorai. Goi wrote his opposition to Sorai in his essay \"Hi-Butsu hen\". This essay was written in the 1730s, but not published until 1766. The published essay had been edited by Chikuzan and his brother. Nakai later wrote his own, highly emotional, response to Sorai's beliefs in his work \"Hi-Chō\" (1785). In this work he rejected the idea that individuals could not improve themselves through moral choices. He also claimed individuals were able judge if external ideas and actions were true or just. Denial of these morals, he felt, would leave only \"rites and rules\" to be followed.\n\n\n", "id": "237452", "title": "Ogyū Sorai"}

Adam Smith made it known to a wider audience in 1776. At that time, absolutism was the main form of government in Europe. These regimes needed money to finance a large military, the many people who worked in the government. The monarchs and princes also needed money in order to finance their lifestyle. These governments were also very nationalistic. For this reason, mercantilism is seen as a form of economic nationalism. \n\nThe theory of mercantilism holds that the prosperity of a nation depends on its supply of capital, and that the global volume of international trade is \"unchangeable\". Economic assets (or capital) are bullion (gold, silver, and trade value) held by the state, and is best increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations (exports minus imports). \n\nThe theory assumes that wealth and monetary assets are identical. Mercantilism suggests that the ruling government should advance these goals by playing a protectionist role in the economy by encouraging exports and discouraging imports, notably through the use of tariffs and subsidies. The theory dominated Western European economic policies from the 16th to the late-18th century.\n", "id": "237461", "title": "Mercantilism"}

Using X-ray crystallography results from Maurice Wilkins' biophysics team at King's College London, Crick and James Watson discovered that DNA has what is called a \"double helix structure\". \n\nThis means that DNA is made of two chains wound round each other to make a spiral. Only one of the chains carries information, but the two chains together makes the molecule more stable. DNA is the basis of heredity for almost all forms of life today.\n\nCrick, Watson and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1962. Their work sparked a huge amount of research in molecular and cell biology and, as a result, many subsequent Nobel awards have been made.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1950s Crick helped sort out the way proteins are synthesized. In 1958, Crick's listed all the key features of the protein synthesis process:\n\nThe adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic \"ribonucleic-protein complexes\" became known as ribosomes. An important step was later realization (in 1960) that the messenger RNA was not the same as the ribosomal RNA. \n\nThe next fundamental question was the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Crick also used the term \"central dogma\" to summarize an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way:\n\nIn his thinking about the processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made clear the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology.\n\nIn the final phase of his career, Crick and Christof Koch published a series of articles on consciousness (1990–2005).\n\nCrick decided to focus his work on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick's book \"The Astonishing Hypothesis\" made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences.\n\nThe Francis Crick Institute is a planned £660,000,000 biomedical research centre to be in London. The Francis Crick Institute is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, Imperial College London, King's College London, the Medical Research Council, University College London (UCL) and the Wellcome Trust.

The condition seems to be very rare, and related to the nerves. It may also be psychological. There is currently no treatment for this condition. A lot of information about this condition comes from different case studies done between 1913 and 2003. Most of what is known is from a single patient, called LM. LM was a 43 year old woman who was treated in a hospital in 1978, after she had suffered a stroke. \n\nCurrently, motion blindness is thought to be caused by a change to the regions of the brain that are responsible for sight. This change is usually a result of damage done to the brain, and affects the way the brain \"decodes\" visual information. It is possible that only \"visual\" motion processing is affected because this is done in a separate area of the brain, which is different from the area that does motion processing in general. The same can happen to the perception of color, that is the patient can have a form of color blindness, which is known as achromatopsia. Unlike most other forms of color blindness, which are caused by changes in the eye, this one is caused by changes in the brain. \n\nPeople who suffer from motion blindness have \"normal vision\": They can see different objects sharply, can tell the distance between them (that one is \"farther away\" than the other) and they see the different colors the objects might have. This applies to shapes, objects and faces. They do, however, not see the objects move. Besides simple perception, akinetopsia also disturbs motoric tasks which rely on visual perception, such as reaching for objects and catching objects. When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important.\n\nPatients with akinetopsia have problems with many tasks in their daily life. One patient, LM, described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult \"because the fluid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier\". She did not know when to stop pouring, because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising. LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations, because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed. LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room: \"people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving\". LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty.\n\nCurrently, three conditions are known that cause motion blindness:\n", "id": "237523", "title": "Motion blindness"}

It was opened in 1860 and soon became the most important theatre for opera and ballet in Russia. Many great operas and ballets of the 19th century were first performed there, including the greatest stage works by Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nThe Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet, Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra. The conductor Valery Gergiev has been the general director there since 1988.\n\nThe theatre is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna, wife of Tsar Alexander II. There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance hall. The theatre's name has changed several times during its history, because of different political parties that were in power.\n\nThe theatre building is commonly called the \"Mariinsky Theatre\". The companies that use it have kept the famous \"Kirov\" name, which it got during the Soviet period in honour of the murdered Leningrad Communist Party leader, Sergey Kirov (1886-1934).\n\nThe first ballet groups to perform in St Petersburg were Italian ballet dancers in the early 18th century. Catherine the Great wanted a Russian theatre to be built. It was built in 1783. It was called Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (“Kamenny” is the Russian word for “stone”. It was used to distinguish the building from the wooden theatre that was being used.). The building we see today dates from 1860. It opened with a performance of Glinka’s opera \"A Life for the Tsar\". It was called the Mariinsky Theatre, named after the Empress Maria Alexandrovna. The great choreographer Marius Petipa put on the first performances of many famous ballets such as Tchaikovsky’s \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in 1890, \"The Nutcracker\" in 1892, Alexander Glazunov's ballet \"Raymonda\" in 1898, and an updated version of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" (with Lev Ivanov) in 1895.\n\nWhen the theatre became the main home of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886, the theatre was improved. Many operas were performed there, including first performances of Mussorgsky's \"Boris Godunov\", Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Golden Cockerel\", Tchaikovsky's \"The Queen of Spades\" and \"Iolanthe\", Prokofiev's \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Cinderella\", and Khachaturian's \"Spartacus\" were also produced there.\n\nThe imperial and Soviet theater was the home of many great impresarios, conductors, and musicians. The Vaganova Academy of Russia Ballet, the ballet school of the Mariinksy Theatre, started the careers of Mathilde Kschessinskaya, Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky, Marina Semenova, George Balanchine, Galina Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Irina Kolpakova, Galina Mezentseva, Altynai Asylmuratova, and in more recent times famous dancers like Ulyana Lopatkina, Diana Vishneva, and Svetlana Zakharova.\n\nYuri Temirkanov was Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988. He conducted many modern and classical operas. Since 1988, Valery Gergiev has brought even more fame to the theatre. It has now got links with many of the world's great opera houses, including the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera, the Opéra Bastille, La Scala, La Fenice, the Tel Aviv Opera, the Washington National Opera and the San Francisco Opera. Today, the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities.\n\n", "id": "237603", "title": "Mariinsky Theatre"}

In 2004, the conservatory had around 275 teaching members and 1,400 students.\n\nThe conservatory was founded in 1862 by the Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein. When he resigned in 1867, he was followed by Nikolai Zaremba. The great composer Rimsky-Korsakov joined the teaching staff in 1871. The conservatory was named after him in 1944. \n\nIn 1887, Rubinstein returned to the Conservatory to try to improve it. Students who were not very good had to leave, and he also got rid of some of the professors and made the entrance examinations harder. He resigned again in 1891.\n\nThe building we see today was built in the 1890s where the Bolshoi Theatre of Saint Petersburg had stood. It still has the grand staircase and landing from that historic theatre. As the city changed its name in the 20th century, the conservatory was renamed \"Petrograd Conservatory\" (Петроградская консерватория) and then the \"Leningrad Conservatory\" (Ленинградская консерватория).\n\nToday, it is a famous Russian composition school whose graduates have included great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237642", "text": "Mikhail Tal\n\nMikhail Tal, known as \"Mischa\", (Riga, 9 November 1936 – Moscow, 28 June 1992) was a Soviet–Latvian chess player, a Grandmaster, and the eighth World Chess Champion.\n\nTal played in 21 Soviet championships, winning it six times, a record only equalled by Botvinnik. He was a member of eight Soviet teams which won the gold medal in chess Olympiads. He won the individual gold medal five times.\n\nHe holds the records for both the first and second longest unbeaten streaks in competitive chess history. Many authorities consider him to have been the greatest attacking player of all time.\n\nTal won the strong 1958 Interzonal tournament, and the Candidates' tournament in Yugoslavia, 1959. In the Candidates he finished first, with 20/28 points, ahead of Paul Keres with 18.5, followed by Tigran Petrosian, Vasily Smyslov, Bobby Fischer, Svetozar Gligorić, Friðrik Ólafsson, and Pal Benko. Tal he won all four individual games against Fischer, and took 3½ points out of 4 from each of Gligorić, Olafsson, and Benko. This shows his complete dominance over the less strong players.\n\nIn 1960, at the age of 23, Tal defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in the Moscow World Championship match, by 12.5–8.5 (six wins, two losses, and thirteen draws). This made him the youngest-ever world champion, a record later broken by Garry Kasparov. Botvinnik, who had never faced Tal before, won the return match against Tal in 1961 by 13–8 (ten wins to five, with six draws). Between the matches Botvinnik thoroughly analyzed Tal's style, and turned most of the return match's games into close manoeuvres and endgames, rather than the complicated tactical melées which were Tal's preference.\n\nTal's short reign atop the chess world made him one of the two so-called 'winter kings' who interrupted Botvinnik's long reign from 1948 to 1963 (the other was Smyslov, world champion 1957–1958).\n\nTal played in a total of six Candidates' tournaments and match cycles, though he never again earned the right to play for the world title. In 1962 at Curaçao, he had serious health problems, having undergone a major operation shortly before the tournament, and had to withdraw three-quarters of the way through, scoring just seven points (+3 -10 =8) from 21 games. \n\nPoor health was part of his life. Tal was an alcoholic, and a chain smoker.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\" 2nd ed, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref> At 23 he had a diseased kidney, and his health became uncertain. He recovered much of his form when, after some years, the kidney was removed.\n\nEleven years after he lost the world championship, he had a record sequence of results. From July 1972 to April 1973, Tal played 86 consecutive games without a loss (47 wins and 39 draws). Between 23 October 1973 and 16 October 1974, he played 95 consecutive games without a loss (46 wins and 49 draws), shattering his previous record. These are the two longest unbeaten streaks in modern chess history.\n\nTal was a charming and brilliant man, who was always willing to talk about chess with players of all standards. His early death was much mourned, though it was not unexpected. The Mikhail Tal Memorial tournament is held in Moscow each year since 2006 to honour his memory.\n\nThe extent of Tal's alcoholism was quite astonishing. Vlastimil Hort, the top Czech player of the 1960s and 70s, has given a vivid account. Hort played at the Moscow tournament of 1963, with many of the top Russians. When he was due to play Tal, his opponent showed up very late, and drunk. He almost fell asleep at the board. Tal staggered away from the board, and returned with shaking hands, and unable to light a cigarette. Hort later found out that Tal had been grabbed by other Russians, and doused with cold water! Tal still managed to draw the game.\n\nTal was an outstanding commentator on his games. These have been translated into English:\n\n\n", "id": "237642", "title": "Mikhail Tal"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237707", "text": "Game port\n\nThe Game port is a port that is present on some PC hardware, and hardware similar to it. This port lets the connection of analog devices used to control computer games, such as joysticks. In most relevant hardware designs for personal computers in 2010, the port is an integrated component on the sound card, another I/O card, or the motherboard itself. Starting with Windows Vista Microsoft no longer supports this port with drivers from the Operating System, but third party drivers are still available. There are also drivers that allow to map the game port to an USB device.\n\nUnlike most other ports present on the PC, the Game port is an analog port. This means that signal first needs to be changed to digital form, a task which is usually done by an analog-to-digital converter. In the early days, most joystick designs were digital, which made them easier to build and cheaper. The game port has a 15-pin DSUB interface, most home computers that used digital joysticks had a 9-pin one. This made existing joysticks incompatible with the new interface.\n\nDigital joysticks are easy for programmers to access. The signal is already digital, and only gets transferred to the PC. Analog signals are much harder to use, they need careful software interrupt driven programming (to get a useful signal). Interrupts use the main CPU of the system. Digital circuits can use Transistor–transistor logic, which does not use the CPU.\n\nThe usual implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator. Both together form a sort of simple ramp-compare ADC. This system is polled periodically and reset at precise moments to read an input. This must be done more than 30 times every second to provide a responsive game input. The actual acquisition frequency and value usually depend on the joystick's resistance inside, noise, CPU speed and the total joystick-capacitor's RC time constant.\n\nIts analog nature has also been the cause of a great number of problems. One problem was that all kinds of joysticks needed \"calibration\". This was true even for arcade-style ones. The reason for this was that no game controller and no joystick produced the same measurements each time. These depended on the exact way acquisition was made. Some of the worse designs even depended on the speed of the CPU. Also, all kinds of PC game ports suffer from electrical noise.\n\nThe calibration procedure is still needed at some point, even under modern operating systems such as Windows XP. Usually, it consists of moving the joystick around all of its axes to measure the maximum axis excursion values, no matter if the joystick uses analog signals (from potentiometers) or digital signals (using microswitches or contacts). USB joysticks, on the other hand, do not need calibration. This is because USB sends digital signals.\n\nIn the days of DOS, every game using the game port(s) had to do its own calibration, often each time the game started, and some poorly coded calibration routines even failed to work consistently and properly, rendering some joysticks unusable with some games. With Windows XP, only one calibration per joystick is enough, which is thought \"valid\" until the joystick is unplugged.\n\nCertain applications and games are able to use some analog joysticks even without explicit calibration, under certain restricted conditions. A system of a joystic and game port that is not calibrated can give a \"direction\", at best. It can not give an intensity. For this setup, an analog joystick can be \"self calibrated\" just by leaving the joystick in the middle position and taking a measurement, and then using some arbitrary or adaptive threshold to detect movement and excursion from the middle position. The limitation of this method is that the reading of the same joystick over the same game port can change over time, and some joysticks cannot work at all with this method. Also, the joystick must be in the middle position at least once when the implicit \"self calibration\" takes place, even if this is not directly stated.\n\nMicrosoft declared it would no longer include support for game ports in operating systems beginning with MS-Windows XP Professional x64 edition, reasoning that USB-based gaming equipment had become more common. This leaves game port support up to the manufacturer of the device (i.e. Sound card or USB converters) the game port ships on.\n\nSome advanced game port joysticks supports more than 4 buttons (e.g. 6 or 8) but typically require a special device driver for the additional buttons to work properly, since the game port does not have actual hardware support for more than 4 distinct buttons.\n\nThis can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick (i.e. button 5 through 8 are mapped to the signals to the axis pins meant for the second joystick - resulting in the issue of the two buttons mapped to the same axis being not simultaneously usable), using some normally \"unused\" pins, or changing the joystick's circuits (and related software) to read a 4-bit state code from the four button inputs, thus giving up to 16 button combinations (albeit with some limitations e.g. some buttons may not be held down) or a combination of both techniques.\n\nHigh-end game port joysticks such as the Microsoft SideWinder rely on multiplexing a proprietary data stream through the 4 standard button inputs and sometimes through the \"unused\" pins, achieving full support for a rather high number of buttons (e.g. 16 or 20) while special features such as daisy-chaining multiple joysticks, force feedback or joystick programming become possible in some cases.\n\nThe obvious drawback is the need for a special device driver to interpret the joystick input, and making its use time consuming and operating system-dependent, while the joystick is usually unusable without a special driver (unless multiple operating modes are supported).\n\nSome hardware and DIY enthusiasts have found ways to connect a wide array of input devices to the game port and even found other applications for it, such as voltage or current measurement or simple interfacing and data acquisition.\n\nThe original game port design by IBM (released in 1981 as a separate expansion card for the first IBM PC) initially allowed four analog axes and four buttons on one port, allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected, although this required a special \"Y-splitter\" cable and is not fully supported by some combined midi/game ports usually found on sound cards.\n\nSome poorly implemented game ports (usually built-in on old motherboards and I/O cards) did not fully support either 4 axes or 4 buttons, making only the use of a single 2-axis and 2-button joystick possible.\n\nThe 15-pin game port is no longer provided on presently manufactured PCs, though adapters exist that allow older joysticks and controllers to connect via USB. However, Microsoft's Vista operating system natively lacks all game port support, even for USB adapters.\n\nGame ports use DA-15 connectors (also incorrectly called DB-15). Since the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to sound cards about 1990, these connectors usually double as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a game port with MIDI instruments, one requires a cable with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only), and support most MPU-401 standard applications for Windows and DOS. The official \"proper design\" for a game port-MIDI adapter can be found at this MIDI page.\n\n", "id": "237707", "title": "Game port"}

Depending on the drug, either volunteers or patients suffering from a disease or condition are enrolled in a study. In general, a number of the people taking part will receive the real drug, or a good treatment, and the rest of the people will receive a treatment or drug that has no effect, called a placebo. These tests are statistical tests.\n\nExamples of study designs:\n\nClinical trials were first introduced in Avicenna's \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025 AD, where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs. He wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances. He laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications, which still form the basis of modern clinical trials:\n\n\nOne of the most famous clinical trials was James Lind's demonstration in 1747 that citrus fruits cure scurvy. He compared the effects of various different acidic substances, ranging from vinegar to cider, on groups of afflicted sailors, and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after 6 days.\n\nFrederick Akbar Mahomed (d. 1884), who worked at Guy's Hospital in London, made substantial contributions to the process of clinical trials during his detailed clinical studies, where \"he separated chronic nephritis with secondary hypertension from what we now term essential hypertension.\" He also founded \"the Collective Investigation Record for the British Medical Association; this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative clinical trials.\"\n", "id": "237722", "title": "Clinical trial"}

From about 1937 to 1962 he was one of the top four players in the world.\n\nKeres narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasions. He came equal first in the 1938 AVRO tournament, which led to negotiations for a world championship match with Alexander Alekhine, but the match never took place due to World War II. Instead, he played a 14-game match with ex-World Champion Max Euwe in the Netherlands, December 1939 – January 1940. Keres won a hard-fought struggle by 7.5–6.5 (+6 =3 –5). This was a superb achievement: not only was Euwe a former World Champion, but he had enormous experience at match play, far more than Keres. \n\nEstonia had enjoyed independence after World War I, but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. Keres came second to Botvinnik in the 1941 Leningrad/Moscow Absolute Championship of the USSR. Soon Estonia was annexed again, this time by the Nazi forces. After the war it was seized again by the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the war he took part in the 1948 World Championship match-tournament of five top players, which decided the successor to Alekhine. This was won by Botvinnik, and Keres came equal third with Reshevsky. He was then the runner-up in the Candidates' tournament on four consecutive occasions: 1953, 1956, 1959 and 1962. Keres won the USSR championship three times, in 1947, 1950 and 1951. The latter was probably the strongest-ever Soviet championship; it had ten other players who had played in Candidates' tournaments, three of whom won the world title.\n\nKeres played for the USSR in seven successive Chess Olympiads, wining seven team medals, and five individual board medals. Due to these and other strong results, many commentators consider Keres to be the strongest player never to become World Chess Champion. He was nicknamed \"The Crown Prince of Chess\".<ref name=H/W>Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nKeres was always a man, and never missed the opportunity to say he was an Estonian, not a Russian. When he played at the annual Hastings tournament in 1954/55, a KGB man sat on a chair outside his room at night. He was there \"to prevent the grandmaster being disturbed\". Paul's demeanor at the board was always totally calm. From looking at him, you could not tell how much time he had left, or what kind of position he had. He had mastered the art of self-control, and his nickname amongst other players was 'Old Stoneface'. \n\nBotvinnik thought his death was \"the greatest loss suffered by chess since the death of Alekhine\". In his opinion, Keres failed to reach the top because of \"a tendency to fade somewhat at decisive moments in the struggle\". A rumour that the Soviets had persuaded him to lose deliberately to Botvinnik in the 1948 World Championship has no evidence to back it up. \n\nKeres memorial tournaments are held in Tallinn every two years.\n\n\n", "id": "237781", "title": "Paul Keres"}

She also acted as a regent for her son, Louis XIV of France. During her regency (1643–1651) Cardinal Mazarin served as France's chief minister.\n\nThe birth of Anne of Austria was at Benavente Palace in Valladolid, Spain. She came into the world just five days before her future husband, Louis XIII. She was baptized \"Ana María Mauricia\". She was the oldest daughter of Habsburg parents, Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria. She was called the \"Infanta of Spain and of Portugal\", \"Archduchess of Austria\", \"Princess of Burgundy and of the Low Countries\". Anne's mother died early at the Valladolid. She died after giving birth to a third daughter, Marguerite. Anne was 11 years old when she was betrothed to Louis XIII. Her father, Philip, gave her a dowry of 500,000 crowns. He also gave her a great number of beautiful jewels. They had some fears that Louis XIII would die early. Anne's father said that if this happened, Anne must return to Spain with her dowry, jewels, and wardrobe. Shortly after, on November 1615, Anne and Louis were married separately, but to one another. This is called a \"proxy marriage\". They were both 14 years old.\n\nLouis's mother, Marie de' Medici, continued to be the Queen of France. She did not discuss things with her daughter-in-law. Anne, with her Spanish ladies-in-waiting, continued to live according to Spanish custom. She failed to improve her French.\n\nThe duc de Luynes tried to make the queen and king closer. He sent away the Spanish ladies and hired French ones instead. Some of the more famous ones are the princesse de Conti and Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, the duchesse de Chevreuse. She was his wife. He also organized court events that would bring the queen and king together more happily. Anne began to dress in the French manner.\n\nHowever, a number of 'wretched miscarriages' again made their relations cold. On 14 March 1622, while playing with her ladies, Anne fell on the stairs. She suffered her second miscarriage. Louis angrily blamed her. He was also upset with Mme de Luynes for not being careful enough. After this, the King grew to dislike the influence the duchesse de Luynes had over Anne. He disliked the duchesse even more when Luynes died (December 1621). Anne remained without a child for 16 more years.\n\nThrough his life Louis had a cool behavior towards Anne. He was always fearful that his wife \"had a great passion for the interests of Spain\". In 1625 the English George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, shocked the French court by admitting his passion for Anne. Madame de Motteville said that, \"if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband, it would have been Buckingham\".\n\nSurprisingly, while there was such a strain between Anne and Louis at this time, Anne suddenly had a baby. Suspicious people suggested that Cardinal Richelieu was the child's parent. Another, more likely suggestion, was that there was one night with a storm that stopped Louis from going to Saint-Maur and made him sleep with the queen instead. This was the night of 5 December 1637. However, the official newspaper, the \"Gazette de France\", does not mention if they slept in the same room.\n\nA royal birthing-bed was made ready. It was three feet wide, and had two long sticks made of wood for Anne to hold while she was giving birth to her baby. On 4 Saturday September, Anne finally went into labor. She gave birth in the sight of the court. This was so that if her child was a boy, it would not be changed for a girl, or a living baby to a dead one. The child was safely delivered. The \"Gazette de France\" called it \"a marvel when it was least expected\", and Anne had a son for the first time in 22 years.\n\nThe queen's joy in Louis was very great. One of her servants said, \"She takes great joy in playing with him ... it is her great pleasure in life.\" There are a great number of suggestions as why she did not show such a great love for Monsieur, her second son.\n\nAlmost exactly two years after Louis, Anne had another son, Philippe. He was born on 22 September 1640. He was known as 'Monsieur'. This was the official title for the king's second son.\n\nIt is said that Anne of Austria died from breast cancer in a convent. Her lady-in-waiting, Madame de Motteville, wrote the story of the queen's life in her Mémoires d'Anne d'Autriche.\n\n", "id": "237801", "title": "Anne of Austria"}

The book was first printed in 1943.\n\nThe theme of Rand's fictional story is the belief that selfishness can be ethically good for people in a workplace. Altruism can actually make a person a servant or slave to other people. This novel has many themes that support philosophies of objectivism, and capitalism. There are themes that are against the idea of communism. The use of architecture and skyscrapers in this novel show that humans are able to do great things. Rand's belief in the novel is that a person should only work at something they love doing.\n\nIt is 1922 in Stanton; one of America's best colleges for architects. Howard Roark has just been kicked out of Stanton because he wants to design modern buildings made with glass, concrete and steel. But his professors want him to just design the same old style buildings. Roark's roommate, Peter Keating, is given an award when he graduates, just after Roark is expelled. Keating is offered a job in New York at Francon & Heyer, a company that makes traditional old style buildings.\n\nRoark goes to New York, so he can find Henry Cameron, the inventor of skyscrapers. Roark gets a job at Cameron's company. He is designing modern buildings, but he does not earn much money. Keating is becoming rich because he designs traditional buildings for millionaires.\n\nKeating meets his old girlfriend, Catherine Halsey. She tells him that her uncle is Ellsworth Toohey, a well-known writer for a Wynand newspaper, named the \"Banner\". Even though Keating wants to meet Toohey, he wants to wait until he is more successful and famous. Then he can impress Toohey, who is an architecture expert, in the hopes of a new job with even more wealthy income.\n\nRoark loses his job because his boss, Cameron, gets sick and has to take retirement. Roark looks for new jobs but is told no, because he is too original. Keating wants Roark to work for him so that he can steal some of Roark's ideas. Keating decides to help Roark, because in the past, Roark helped him with his projects at college and also at Francon & Heyer. After Roark works for Francon & Heyer for a few days, he asks if he can design a building in a modern style. He is told he has to leave or design the building in an old fashion style. \n\nHe finally finds work with John Eric Snyte, an architect who hires Roark because Snyte likes to mix different styles. A famous writer, Austin Heller comes to Snyte and asks for a house. Snyte gives all the architects the task of designing the house. He then puts all the sketches together to be shown. Heller says he only likes the modern parts; so Roark tears up the drawings, telling Heller that wants to design the house on his own. Snyte fires Roark, but it is too late because Heller has accepted the deal. Roark then designs Heller's house, which leans over a cliff. He then also gets to design other buildings by himself.\n\nRoark gets very proud of himself; so he turns down a lot of new jobs because he still hates designing old buildings. He becomes so poor he has to close his business and he refuses to take any money from Heller. He finally takes a job in Connecticut, working in a quarry.\n\nKeating wants to marry Catherine, but the boss of Francon & Heyer, Guy Francon, tries to introduce him to his daughter, Dominique. She writes for the Banner and knows Ellsworth Toohey. Keating meets Dominique after she and Guy have an argument and she makes fun of Keating. She keeps writing bad reviews of buildings that are being made by architects who have no talent. She goes on holiday to her father's country house in Connecticut. Guy Francon owns the house and the quarry. She is walking one day and meets Roark. She is attracted to him because he is working at drilling granite and seems masculine to her. But she is always behaves rudely to him and never says how much she is attracted to him. \n\nDominique goes back to her house and breaks her fireplace so that Roark will have to come up and repair it and she can see him again. When Roark arrives, he rapes Dominique, even though he does not really want to hurt her. Roark then leaves and gets a phone call from a rich businessman asking him to design a new shop for him.This person had seen Heller's house and tried to find Roark. So Roark travels back to New York.\n\nHoward Roark is a gifted architect who is expelled from college for trying to have original ideas and think for himself. He does not want to compromise in order to obey authority. He does not care what people think about him.\n\nPeter Keating is planning to get rich by just doing what was popular, instead of being original like Roark. He says and thinks that because of that, he will be more successful than Roark. In the end, Keating admits that he is a failure and he was being used by others.\n\nEllsworth Toohey is the antagonist (or the bad guy) of the story. He tries to stop Roark from being successful by controlling people who are weaker or timid. He believes in collectivism (when people join a group and they lose their own identity). He only helps people who he thinks are not very smart and not very talented. Dominique believes he is trying to control the Wynand newspapers.\n\nGail Wynand is the owner of a newspaper that appeals to the opinion of the public. He thinks he is a failure because he made his newspaper company just to be popular and so he can become rich. \n\nHenry Cameron is Roark's mentor. He invented skyscrapers and designed modern buildings that most architects hated, because they weren't traditional enough. Cameron thinks that Wynand is his enemy, because he writes a newspaper that has different ideals. Wynand understands that he is unhappy and becomes friends with Roark because he respects him. Cameron becomes an alcoholic and dies early in the story.\n\nDominique Francon is a woman who is afraid of having great things such as love because society can destroy those great things. She marries Peter Keating first, then Gail Wynand. Roark changes her view of life and he also marries her.\n\n", "id": "238032", "title": "The Fountainhead"}

It is a small fox which lives in the Arctic. The fox is about 10-12 inches high (25–30 cm) and it weighs from 6.5 to 21 pounds (2.7-4.5 kg).The females tend to be smaller than the males. The Arctic fox has a round body shape, short nose and legs, and short, fluffy ears. It has a deep thick fur which is brown in summer and white in winter. Arctic foxes live for about 3 to 6 years. \nThis fox can live in the cold north even when it is -30F. Their thick fur keeps them warm. The fur of the Arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal. Its broad, fluffy paws let it walk on ice and snow to look for food. The Arctic fox has very good ears so that it can hear small animals under the snow. When it hears an animal under the snow, it jumps and punches through the snow to catch its victim. The Arctic fox eats any meat it can find. They eat lemmings, arctic hares, eggs and dead bodies of animals. The foxes also eat plants sometimes.\n\nArctic foxes do not hibernate. They grow thicker fur in the Autumn, and put on more than 50% of their body weight as fat for insulation and as energy reserves.\nIt takes 53 days for the pups to grow in the mother before they are born. The mother can produce 5-8 cubs but sometimes as many as 25. Both the mother and the father help to raise their young pups. The young females leave the family and form their own groups and the males stay with the family. Arctic foxes form pairs in the breeding season. Litters are born in the early summer. The parents raise the young in a large den under the ground. The pups are born with brown fur and as they grow older it turns white.\n\n", "id": "238038", "title": "Arctic fox"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238181", "text": "Aida\n\nAida (or, Aïda) is an Italian opera in four acts. The music was written by Giuseppe Verdi. The libretto (story and words) was written by Antonio Ghislanzoni. The opera is based on a story written by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette. \"Aida\" was first performed at the Opera House in Cairo on December 24, 1871. This production starred Antonietta Anastasi-Pozzoni as Aida, Pietro Mongini as Radames, Eleonora Grossi as Amneris, and Francesco Seller as Amonasro. \n\nAida (pronounced \"ah-EE-dah\") is the name of the main female character in the opera. It is an Arabic girl's name meaning \"visitor\" or \"returning\".\n\nIn 1865, Verdi wrote \"Don Carlos\" for the Paris Opéra. The libretto for this opera was written by two young men, one of whom (Camille du Locle) would be instrumental in bringing \"Aida\" into the world. \n\nVerdi had become increasingly dissatisfied with librettos during the 1860s. Du Locle sent him many librettos, both comic and tragic. None of these pleased Verdi. Du Locle sent him a sketch by Auguste Mariette of an invented story with an Egyptian theme.\n\nIn 1869, someone (possibly du Locle) asked Verdi to write an opera for a distant land. Verdi refused; he could not find a suitable plot. In early 1870, du Locle asked Verdi to accept the proposal made the previous winter. This opera was commissioned by the Khedive of Egypt who wanted to celebrate the construction of a new theater in Cairo that had been built in honor of the Suez Canal. Verdi refused. Du Locle continued to make suggestions for operatic treatment. Only one interested Verdi. This was an Egyptian sketch by Auguste Mariette, a French Egyptologist. Du Locle turned the sketch into French prose. Verdi asked his publisher for an Italian librettist and Antonio Ghislanzoni was chosen.\n\nThe Egyptians are at war with the Ethiopians. Aida is an Ethiopian who has been captured and made slave to Amneris, the daughter of the King of Egypt. Aida is the daughter of Amonasro, the King of Ethiopia. The Egyptians are unaware of this. Amonasro plans to invade Egypt to free his daughter. In the meantime, Aida and Radames, a young Egyptian soldier, have fallen in love. The jealous and suspicious Amneris loves Radames, too. She senses that he loves another, but she does not know it is Aida. \n\n\"Scene 1: A hall in the palace of the King of Egypt in Memphis.\"\n\nRadames hopes to lead the Egyptian army against the invading Ethiopians. Ramfis, the high priest, tells him that the gods have chosen the leader of the army. Ramfis leaves to tell the King of the gods' choice. Radames would like to be made the head of the Egyptian army. He wants this, not just to receive military glory, but because he hopes it will enable him to marry Aida. He sings of his love in \"Celeste Aida\" (\"Divine Aida\"). \n\nAmneris enters. She is in love with Radames. She would like him to be a military hero. She is worried that he is in love with someone else. She notices how he looks disturbed when Aida comes in and wonders whether she is the girl Radames loves.\n\nThe King, the High Priest, Ramfis, and the whole palace court enter. A messenger announces that the Ethiopians, led by King Amonasro, are marching towards Thebes. The King says that the Egyptians must fight the Ethiopians. He makes Radames leader of the army. The crowd leaves for the Temple of Vulcan where Radames will be consecrated to his task. \n\nAida, too, wants Radames to be a hero. Left alone, she calls out, \"Ritorna Vincitor\" (\"Return the victor\"). She is ashamed that her love for Radames conflicts with her love for her father and her people. She begs the gods to have pity on her, \"Numi, pieta del mio soffrir!\" (\"Gods, pity my suffering!\")\n\n\"Scene 2: Inside the Temple of Vulcan\"\n\nIn the dark halls of the temple of Vulcan, sacred weapons are given to Radames. All pray for his coming trials and for his victory in battle. The priestesses perform a sacred dance. The solemnity of the scene is in sharp contrast to the emotional scenes that have preceded and follow it. As the scene ends, Radames joins the priests in other rituals. \n\n\"Scene 1: The chamber of Amneris\"\n\nAct 2 takes place two years later. Ramades and the Egyptian army have won their battle against the Ethiopians. Dances take place to celebrate the victory. Amneris wants to find out whether Aida and Radames really do love one another. She talks to Aida. She pretends to be sorry that the Ethiopians (Aida’s people) have lost their battle. Aida says she cannot be happy until she knows what has happened to her father and brothers. Amneris now tells Aida a lie. She tells her that Radames has been killed. When Aida breaks down in tears, Amneris tells her that it was not true, and that Radames is alive. Aida is relieved to hear this. Amneris is now angry. She tells Aida that she knows she and Radames are in love. She tells her that she herself also loves him. She threatens Aida, telling her that she, Aida, will crawl in the dust while she, Amneris, is made queen.\n\n\"Scene 2: The grand gate of the city of Thebes\"\n\nRadames and the Egyptian army march into the city to celebrate their victory. The Ethiopians who have been captured are brought before the crowd. One of them is the Ethiopian king, Amonasro, father of Aida, although the Egyptians do not know who he is. Aida rushes to her father. She explains to the crowd that Amonasro is her father. Amonasro tells the Egyptians a lie: he says that the Ethiopian king (he himself, of course) has been killed in battle. Aida, Amonasro and the captured Ethiopians all plead with the Egyptian King to save them, but the Egyptians want them to be put to death. Radames pleads with the king to spare Aida and Amonasro. The King rewards Radames by saying he can be King of Egypt and that he can marry his daughter, Amneris.\n\nAida and Amonasro remain as hostages to make sure that the Ethiopians do not take revenge for their defeat.\n\n\"On the banks of the Nile, near the Temple of Isis\"\n\nAs Amneris goes to pray before her wedding, the priests chant prayers. Aida wonders why Radames wants to meet her. Amonasro goes to Aida and tells her she must find out from her lover, Radames, which way the Egyptian army are going to march to fight the Ethiopians. Aida refuses to do this at first, but her father says that, if she doesn’t and her people are killed, it will be her fault. She changes her mind.\n\nWhen Radames comes she suggests to him that they flee together. Radames refuses at first, but Aida manages to persuade him. He tells her the route the army are going to take. Amonasro, who has been listening secretly, then comes out of hiding and reveals that he is the King of Ethiopia. Radames feels he has betrayed his country because he revealed a military secret. He refuses to flee with Aida and her father. The guards capture him.\n\n\"Scene 1: A hall in the Temple of Justice. To one side is the door leading to Radames' prison cell\"\n\nAmneris asks to see Radames. Radames refuses to defend himself. He is relieved to hear Aida is still alive and that she hopes to get back to her own country. Amneris does not like to hear him say this. Radames is tried before the court. He refuses to defend himself, and he is sentenced to death.\n\n\"Scene 2: The Vault in the Temple\"\n\nAmneris wants to try to save Radames, who is a prisoner in a dark vault. Radames thinks he is alone. He is astonished and unbelievably happy when he finds Aida there. She had hidden herself in the vault. She tells him that she wants to die with him. That is their fate. As Amneris prays, Aida dies in Radames' arms.\n\nThe music of the opera is excellent all the way through. There are quiet songs of incredible beauty as well as big chorus numbers. The music is all famous, but among the most well-known parts are the aria that Radames sings near the beginning of act One in which he dreams of victory in battle and marrying Aida, the Ethiopian slave. The song is called \"Celeste Aida\" (\"Heavenly Aïda\"). The Chorus in Scene ii of Act II, \"Gloria all'Egitto, ad Iside\" (\"Glory to Egypt, to Isis!\") is one of the most famous marches ever written.\n\nThe opera has been adapted for movies several times, e.g. in a film made in 1953 starring Lois Maxwell and Sophia Loren, and a Swedish production in 1987.\n\nIn 1998, the opera was turned into a Broadway musical with music by Elton John.\n\n", "id": "238181", "title": "Aida"}

Sex is a method of reproduction which is widespread among living things. It requires two individuals of the same species.\n\nUsually the sexes are separate. Sex may be determined in one of two ways:\n\nWhere both sexes occur on the same individual, that individual is an hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodite systems can be found in some animals, for example snails, and in most flowering plants.\n\nFor many species sex is determined by environmental factors experienced during development. Many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination. The temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism. In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1-2 °C.\n\nMany fish change sex over the course of their life. This phenomenon is called \"sequential hermaphroditism\". In clownfish, smaller fish are male, and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female. In many wrasse the opposite is true–most fish are female at birth and become male when they reach a certain size. Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime, but at any given point they are either female or male.\n\nIn some ferns the default sex is hermaphrodite, but ferns which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by hormones remaining to develop as male.\n\nThe most usual way to determine sex is by genes. That way, an organism's sex is determined by the genome it gets. \nThe alleles that influence sexual development may or may not be on the same chromosome. If they are, that chromosome is called a sex chromosome, and the genes on it are called 'sex linked'. Sex is determined either by the fact that there is a sex chromosome (which can be missing), or by the number of them. Because genetic sex determination is determined by matching chromosomes, there are usually the same number of male and female offspring.\n\nHumans and other mammals have an XY sex determination system: the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for male development. The default sex, in the absence of a Y chromosome, is female. XX mammals are female and XY are male. XY sex determination is also found in other organisms, including the common fruit fly and some plants. In some cases, including in the fruit fly, it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome.\n\nBirds have a system that works the other way round: It is called \"ZW sex-determination system\". The W chromosome has factors for female development. By default (if the chromosome is missing), the organism will be male. In this case ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. In both XY and ZW sex determination systems the sex chromosome carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller, carrying little more than the genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex.\n\nMany insects use a sex determination system based on the number of sex chromosomes. This is called XX/XO sex determination–the O indicates the absence of the sex chromosome. All other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. In field crickets, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female. In the nematode \"C. elegans\" most worms are self-fertilizing XX hermaphrodites, but occasionally abnormalities in chromosome inheritance regularly give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome–these XO individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).\n\nOther insects, including honey bees and ants, use a haploid-diploid sex-determination system. In this case diploid individuals are generally female, and haploid individuals (which develop from unfertilized eggs) are male. This sex-determination system results in a highly biased sex ratio, as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis.\n\nSometimes an organism develops the appearance of both males and females. It is then an intersex, and is rare. Even though such organisms may be called hermaphrodites, this is not correct, because in intersex individuals either the male or the female aspect is sterile.\n", "id": "238251", "title": "Sex determination"}

In Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and South America, the frequency band from 1880 MHz to 1900 MMHz is used. In the United States, the band is 1920-1930 MHz.To be sold in the US, only small changes need to be made to DECT equipment. These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as baby monitors and wireless networks.\n\nA newer standard that is similar to DECT is called CAT-iq\nThe DECT standard fully specifies how a portable unit, such as a cordless telephone, can access a fixed network using radio waves. It is different from other standards like GSM in that it does not say how the fixed network is made. The communication with the fixed network is done through a base station which is called \"Radio Fixed Part\", and terminates the radio waves. The base station then uses a gateway to connect the calls to the fixed network. In most cases, the connection will be to the telephone network. Certain units also allow a connection to newer technologies, such as Voice over IP. Some baby phones also use DECT technology. Such baby phones do not have a gateway.\n\nMany PABX systems installed in offices have a part that is capable of doing DECT. Many system vendors now also offer systems, where communication with voice over IP, or with the classical phone network are possible. In such systems, the communication with the handsets is done using DECT, and the PABX is capable of doing SIP. Some vendors propose WLAN-based solutions to connect the handsets, but this solution is often more complex than using DECT.\n\nDECT has different profiles. A domesic DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP) system typically has the following abilities:\n\nThe DECT suite of standards has other interoperability profiles. In particular the DPRS (DECT Packet Radio Services) bring together a number of prior interoperability profiles to use DECT as a wireless LAN and wireless internet access service. With good range (up to 200 m indoors and 6 km using directional antennae outdoors), dedicated spectrum, high interference immunity, open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbit/s, DECT appeared at one time to be better than Wi-Fi. The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space, between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers. The first DECT product to reach the market, Olivetti's Net, was a wireless LAN, and German firms Dosch & Amand and Hoeft & Wessel built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT.\n\nDECT came into use in the mid 1990s, too early to find wide application for wireless data. Whilst contemporary providers of Wi-Fi struggled with the same issues, providers of DECT retreated to cordless telephones where they could make money immediately. They could not sell in the United States, due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time. By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged, and the U.S. had opened up to DECT, well into the new century, the industry had made Wi-Fi better, and DECT's time as a wireless data transport was past.\n\nIronically, the failure of DECT as a data protocol became a strength when DECT 6.0 phones finally appeared in the U.S. in late 2005. By this time, the ISM bands had become crowded in the U.S., especially the 2.4 GHz band which is used by both the most common variants of Wi-Fi, 802.11b and 802.11g, and many cordless phones; thus interference between unlicensed devices has become common in these bands. However, because Wi-Fi does not operate in the UPCS band and DECT devices negotiate with each other for the available spectrum, not only are DECT 6.0 phones immune from this type of interference, their operation does not impair other nearby devices operating on the same frequency, which is a common issue with 2.4 GHz cordless phones.\n\nDECT operates in the 1880-1900 MHz band and defines ten channels from 1881.792 MHz to 1897.344 MHz with a band gap of 1728 kHz. Each base station frame provides 12 duplex speech channel with each time slot occupying any of channel. DECT operates in multicarrier/TDMA/TDD structure. DECT also provides Frequency-hopping spread spectrum over TDMA/TDD structure. If frequency hopping is avoided then each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each time slot can be assigned to a different channel in order to take advantage of frequency hopping and avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashion.\n\nGeneral references:\nSpecific references:\n\n", "id": "238556", "title": "Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications"}

It is split into two parts: Future World and the World Showcase. Future World has many rides and shows about technology, including space travel and how people interact with nature. The World Showcase is split into sections representing eleven countries, sharing the culture of each country there. The symbol of the park is Spaceship Earth, a huge building that looks like a golf ball and has a ride inside.\n\nWalt Disney's original plan for Epcot was for it to be a neighborhood for people to live in with many modern machines aiding their lives. It was going to be called the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which is where the name EPCOT comes from. Disney died before he could start his plan, and later the new owners of the Walt Disney Company changed the plans into a theme park.\n\nFuture World is in the front of the park. Its theme is technology. Spaceship Earth is near the entrance. The ride inside of it is a journey through human methods of communication, from ancient cave paintings up to the Internet and beyond.\n\nPast Spaceship Earth are many rides and attractions about technology. Innovations is two buildings full of games and shows that use new inventions for making life easier.\n\nThere are also two buildings with similar themes: Living with the Land and the Living Seas. Living with the Land has a boat ride inside about the history of farming. It also has a food court that serves food made from the plants grown there. The Living Seas is an aquarium with a ride featuring characters from the movie \"Finding Nemo\". In the aquarium are many kinds of sea creatures, including dolphins, sharks and manatees.\n\nOther rides in Future Word include Test Track, which is about how cars are tested for safety before being sold, and Mission: Space, which is a pretend trip to the planet Mars. Ellen's Energy Adventure stars Ellen DeGeneres and Bill Nye the Science Guy and is about the history of energy, from the time of the dinosaurs up to today's solar power and wind power.

It was the only Italian victory against the Allies that was won without help from Germany.\n\nWhen Italy declared war in May 1940, the Italian troops were not prepared for a prolonged war in Eastern Africa. As a consequence, Mussolini ordered only some limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of Kenya, Egypt and Sudan.\n\nIn June 1940, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, the Governor-General of \"Italian East Africa\", convinced the Italian Supreme Command (\"Commando Supremo\") to plan a campaign to conquer a British colony: British Somaliland. The King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III and Mussolini agreed and at the beginning of August the campaign was ready to start.\n\nThe Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi and included five colonial brigades, three \"Blackshirt\" battalions, and three bands (\"bande\") of native troops. The Italians had the 2nd Light Tank Company and the 322nd Medium Tank Company (13 L3/35 light and 12 M11/39 medium tanks), artillery, and, most important, superior air support. The Italians numbered about 4,800 and about 30,000 native troops.\n\nThe Italians were opposed by a British contingent of about 4,000 soldiers consisting of the \"Somaliland Camel Corps\" (commanded by Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater), elements of the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion \"King's African Rifles\" (KAR) and the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment, the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment, and the \"2nd Battalion, Black Watch\".\n\nIn the early hours of 3 August 1940, the Italian army crossed the border between Italian East Africa (called by the Italians \"Africa Orientale Italiana\") and British Somaliland.\n\nThe Italians attacked with military columns in three directions: to the north toward the port of Zeila, to the center toward Adadlek and to the south toward Odweina.\n\nOn 5 August the port of Zeila was occupied after heavy fighting and every possibility of help from French Somaliland for the retreating British was cut. The northern Italian column then proceeded south along the coast and occupied the village of Bulhar.\n\nThe Italian central column, commanded by Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone faced more difficulties because of the mountainous terrain and was stopped by the English at the Karrin Pass, before Hargeisa.\n\nColonel Arthur Reginald Chater, used his camel corps to skirmish with and screen against the advancing Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces pulled back towards Tug Argan.\n\nOn 6 August, within three days of the invasion, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were taken by the Italians. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined to launch attacks against the main British and Commonwealth positions at Tug Argan.\n\nOn 7 August the British and Commonwealth forces in British Somaliland received reinforcements with the arrival of the 1st Battalion \"2nd Punjab Regiment\". On 11 August, a new commander, Major-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, reached Tug Argan.\n\nThe defensive positions of the British army were centered around six hills overlooking the only road toward Berbera. \nOn 11 August an Italian brigade commanded by De Simone attacked the hill defended by the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment and captured it with heavy casualties. The British launched two unsuccessful counterattacks but the next day were forced to abandon two other nearby hills.\n\nOn 14 August the Italians began to encircle the British defenders from their eastern positions, and the defenders' situation started to look critical.\n\nAfter three days of battle, early on 15 August Godwin-Austen (fearing an imminent encirclement) concluded that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile. He contacted the British Middle East Command headquarters in Cairo, Egypt and requested and received permission to withdraw his forces from British Somaliland.\n\nThe determined effort of the \"Black Watch\" battalion, which covered the retreat, allowed the entire British and Commonwealth contingent to withdraw to Berbera with minimal losses.\n\nWhilst the British made their fighting retreat to Berbera, the British Royal Navy had constructed an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials. The two main Italian columns (the central and the southern) were united at the village of La Farruk, approximately 30 km south of Berbera.\n\nFrom Bulhar the third Italian column reached the area of Berbera on 14 August but the British defenders were able to hold them off. On 16 August they started to embark troops onto the waiting ships and had completed the evacuation by the afternoon of the following day, departing for Aden in the Arabian peninsula. They had little interference in this operation as a result of a fierce bayonet charge against the Italians by the Black Watch at Barkasan The Somaliland Camel Corps, rather than evacuate, was disbanded and dispersed.\n\nOn 19 August the Italians took control of Berbera and then moved down the coast to complete their conquest of British Somaliland. The British colony was annexed by Mussolini to the \"Italian Empire\" in Italian East Africa.\n\nAccording to Italian historians, during the campaign to conquer British Somaliland the casualties were 250 for the British army and 205 for the Italian.\n\nBut, according to the British account of events, total British casualties were 260 and Italian losses were estimated at between ten and twenty times higher.\n\nThis campaign in Somaliland was like all the others of the Axis: it initially started with a victory, then after a period of time (like the campaigns in the Balkans, in the Philippines or in Russia), finished with a complete defeat. But in the specific case of the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, the defeat (that happened in spring 1941) was followed by nearly two years of Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia.\n\nBritish Somaliland remained part of the Italian East Africa until March 1941 when the 1st/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd/15th Punjab Regiment returned from Aden to re-occupy the territory.\n\n\n\n", "id": "238604", "title": "Italian conquest of British Somaliland"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238661", "text": "Shen Bao\n\nShen Bao (Chinese: 申報; Pinyin: Shēn Bào) was a newspaper published in Shanghai, China. It was published between April 30, 1872 and May 27, 1949, making it the longest running for any newspaper in China. The name has also been transliterated as Shun Pao or Shen-pao. In English, the newspaper was usually called Shanghai News. The name is short for \"Shenjiang Xinbao\". Shenjiang is a short form of Chunsheng jiang, the old name for the Huangpu River.\n\nThe paper was started by Ernest Major (1841-1908), in 1872. Major was a British businessman. \"Shen Bao\" was one of the first modern Chinese newspapers. Major returned to England in 1899, and the newspaper was reorganised to be Major Company Limited. According to Zhou, Major was different from other foreign newspapers in two areas: From the start, he made it clear, that the newspaper would be for Chinese readers, and not for foreigners. He therefore picked those news and issues that would be interesting to Chinese. Secondly, he made Chinese compradors responsible for running the business and he had Chinese editors select the news and write the editorials. He was very successful: The Chinese compradors used their ties with the community, raised the circulation, and obtained advertisements. This made the paper cheaper than those of the competition. The Chinese editors knew what their readers wanted to read about.\n\n\"Shen Bao\" played an important role and helped form public opinion at the end of the 19th century. The paper ran a campaign against hiring young women as waitresses in opium dens. According to the campaign, this made it difficult to distinguish between what could be tolerated, and what could not, because it implicitly said these women would also provide sex services in the dens. Most of the dens with this practice were in the French Concession. The campaign said that one of the reasons this problem existed was that there were foreigners in Shanghai. There was an uproar, and the practice was banned; in reality little was done to eradicate it, though.\n\nThe newspaper was innovative: It used new printing technologies, sent a military correspondent to cover the Sino-French War in Vietnam in 1884 and used vernacular (\"baihua\")\" Quickly it got the reputation of being one of the best newspapers in China. It was bought by a Chinese in 1909. In the early 20th century it had a circulation of 30.000 copies a day. 9.000 of them in Shanhai, and the rest was for other parts of China. \"By the early 1920s its circulation was 50,000; by the end of the decade 100,000; and by the mid 1930s, 150,000.\"\n\nThe paper's offices were in the International Settlement, \"about a block away from the Central Police Station.\" At first, the paper had eight pages, with news, essays, and advertisements as well as imperial decrees and memorials. \"Because the editorial policies followed the principle of 'reporting whatever possible and letting the readers determine the truth,' many interesting but unfounded rumors were often included as news.\" After 1905, it increased its size to twenty pages.\n\nShen Bao was founded as a commercial newspaper.

In 1905, it started to change its orientation: On New Year's Day it quoted Liang Qichao's constitutionalist slogans. In 1907, the paper was sold to Xi Zipei (1867-1929), Xi Zipei used to be a comprador\nof the paper. Xi Zipei was influenced by Zhang Jian. The paper changed and became quite liberal and strongly supported the constitutional movement. \"It had the following sections: editorials, international news, domestical news, local news, industry and trade, law and society, sports and education, literature and art, and advertisements. In addition to reporting important political news stories, it had many special columns and supplements such as \"ziyou tan\" (free discussion), automobile, education and life.\" In 1912 control was transferred to Shi Liangcai. \"In the 1930s, Shi was a strong supporter of the Human Rights Defence Alliance established by Madam Soong Qing Ling.Soong Qing Ling was the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat-sen, with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun.\"\n\nIn 1934, the newspaper made the government angry, because it had a strong attitude against the Japanese. \"On November 13, Shih Liang-ts'ai, its owner and editor-in-chief, was mysteriously assassinated on the Shanghai-Hangchow Highway\"; responsibility for his murder has been laid at the feet of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, Chiang Kai-shek's much-feared secret police. In 1938, with the city under Japanese control, Norwood Francis Allman (1893-1987), an American lawyer who had been U.S. Consul in Shanghai in the early 1920s, was asked by the paper's Chinese owners to take over as editor; \"Time\" wrote in 1940: \"A fluent Chinese linguist, Allman reads every story that goes into Shun Pao, writes editorials, corrects editorials written by staff members. He serves without pay.\" The paper was on bad terms with the Japanese, and in 1940 a Chinese assistant editor was killed and his head left on the street as a warning to journalists. During World War II the paper passed into the hands of collaborators with the Japanese occupation, but after the war Pan Gongzhan, an influential Kuomintang party official who had been an editor on the paper in the late 1920s, became its publisher and Chen Shunyü its chief editor. In May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took Shanghai and shut down the newspaper was.\n\nThere is a complete collection of the paper's issues in the Shanghai Library.\n\n", "id": "238661", "title": "Shen Bao"}

The first was between Great Britain and China and lasted from 1839 until 1842. The Second Opium War was from 1856 to 1860. The Second Opium War was also known as the \"Arrow War\" or \"Anglo-French War\" in China. French soldiers also took a big part in this war. Early in the 19th century, British merchants began secretly taking opium into China. They wanted to balance their purchases of tea for export to Britain. In 1839, China said that opium was not allowed. In Canton in south China, which is now called Guangzhou, the Chinese destroyed a lot of opium that they had taken from British merchants. Great Britain was unhappy about this and sent gunboats to attack Chinese coastal cities. China had no modern weapons so they were defeated. China was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing with the British and another one called the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue.\n\nThe wars were about many other things than opium. They were also about opening China to European and American trade and colonizations. \n\nBritish merchants began selling opium to China. At that time, opium was grown in India and not in China. Opium is an addictive drug. It is sometimes used to treat disease. However, opium can also be used as a psychoactive drug that changes the user's state of mind. Opium had been used in traditional Chinese medicine for a long time before the British came, mostly to treat disease. \n\nWhen the British began importing large amounts of the drug, the Chinese began using opium for its mind-changing effect. More and more people grew addicted to opium. So, the British were able to export more and more opium. By selling this drug, the British slowly began to make more money on their exports to China than they spent on their imports of Chinese goods. British exports of opium to China increased greatly. They went from an estimated 15 tons in 1730, to 75 tons in 1773. Opium was shipped in \"chests\". Every chest had 140 pounds (67 kilograms) of opium inside.\n\nOpium is a naturally occurring substance found in the seeds of the opium poppy. Opium, which contains morphine, is extracted from the poppy seeds and used to produce heroin. Heroin was invented after the wars.

These objects cool in the night. When they cool, the thin layer of air around them cools too. This makes some water vapor condense on the object. The condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled. The temperature when condensation begins is called the \"dew point\". If the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 °F (0 °C), the dew turns into frost. Most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the atmosphere. However, some studies suggest that it also comes up through the soil and then condenses on the ground. This happens, though, only when conditions are right.\n\nDew forms best when the atmosphere is clean, the air is calm, and there is not much wind. It does not always form in the night and outdoors, though. They also work when eyeglasses get steamy in warm, wet rooms. Dew may also happen in industrial processes. However, people use the word condensation more often than dew.\n\nIn the Old Testament dew is used as a symbol.

The zoo was founded in 1868. This was when the Lincoln Park Commissioners were given a gift of a pair of swans. In 1874, the swans were joined by a bear cub. This was the first animal bought for the zoo. The bear became quite good at escaping from its home. It could often be found wandering around Lincoln Park at night. The first bison ever born in captivity was born in Lincoln Park. Marlin Perkins, who later gained fame as the host of the television program \"Wild Kingdom\", was director of the zoo from 1944 until 1962. Now, Lincoln Park Zoo is home to a wide variety of animals. The zoo includes polar bears, penguins, gorillas, reptiles, monkeys, and other species totalling nearly 1,250 animals. Also located in Lincoln Park Zoo is a burr oak tree which dates to 1830, three years before the city was founded. Lincoln Park Zoo is one of four zoos in the Chicago area, the others being the large Brookfield Zoo, and the minor Phillips Park Zoo, and Cosley Zoo. Lincoln Park Zoo is the only one within the Chicago city limits.\n\nTwo sections of Lincoln Park Zoo have been set aside for children. The first is the Pritzker Family Children's Zoo. The Children's Zoo contains an indoor structure for children to play in. People used to be able to pet animals at the Children's Zoo, but in recent years, due to health concerns, Lincoln Park Zoo has stopped this at the Children's Zoo. Also, baby animals who are rejected by their parents are no longer kept in the Children's Zoo because the zoo has found that it is harder to reintroduce them into their habitats once they grow up if they are kept away from their own species. The second area of the zoo for children in the Farm-in-the-Zoo, presented by John Deere. This small farm contains pigs, cows, horses and other animals which can be found on farms. Children can feed and pet the animals. In addition, the cows are milked in public for children to see. Regenstein Center for African Apes is home to Keo, the oldest male chimpanzee in a North American zoo.\n\nNear the southern end of Lincoln Park Zoo, one can rent a paddle boat for a spin around the Lincoln Park Lagoon. The Lagoon is surrounded by trees and offers a relaxing time (and, of course, paddling exercise). Kayakers and canoers also take to the lagoon and one can often see scullers as well.\n\n\n", "id": "239021", "title": "Lincoln Park Zoo"}

Skay Diplodocum had integrated along with his brother William Beilinson, Topo D'Aloisio, Isa Portugheis and Bernardo Rubaja.\n\nAlthough music was always an essential part of the shows by Patricio Rey in the first presentations in theaters in La Plata numbers were put on stage plays and ballet, while ricotta redonditos true distributed among the public.\nBy the '78 are presented in theaters under the Capital. Between 1979 and 1980 the band distance: Poly Skay and move to Mar del Plata and Indian Valeria del Mar.

At that time also had joined the band of choristers Bay Bisquits (Vivi Tellas, Faithfull Marianne and Elizabeth Sebastian). Also involved the journalist Henry Symms, reciting monologues and the introduction of the show.\nJournalist Gloria Guerrero published back in December 1982: \"A is impartial, is not siding with anyone, but sometimes it's impossible.

And because it is very difficult to find out otherwise, as these delusional punks do not advertise a horn nothing to do. The news \"run\" and the theaters are filled \"(G.Guerrero in Humor, December 1982).\nIn December 1984 they recorded \"Gulp\", the first plate, in studies of MIA, with Lito Vitale as an operator and a guest musician. The money for this independent production came from a common pool formed by a percentage of the profits from each show.

It is large glass bottle, usually lined on both the inside and the outside with some type of metal foil. Some of the early ones had water inside. They allow the experimenter to collect a large amount of charge.\n\nThey are the first form of electrical storage. These methods are known today as 'condensers' or 'capacitors'. \n\nThe first electrical storage jar was created by Dean Edwald von Kleist on 11 October 1745. He was the dean of the cathedral of Cammin in Pomerania, on the north coast of Germany (at that time a separate country). He was interested to find whether static electricity could be stored in a bottle, because he knew that electricity could not pass through glass. He thought he might be able to capture and hold a small amount. He only had a small experimental friction generator.\n\nHe underestimated how much electricity a small medicine bottle could hold by thousands of times. A peculiarity of electricity allows it to continue flowing into the bottle provided the outside of the bottle has an electrically conductive surface connected to the earth. This neutralises the pressure from the charge trying to flow back out.\n\nIn von Kleist's case, this electrically conductive surface was just his hand, but it was enough to allow a very substantial charge to enter and remain in the jar through a nail he had driven through the cork.\n\nWhen he accidentally touched the nail, he received such a shock that it threw him across the room. He had made a connection between the inside charge and the accumulated outside charge, and since these were opposite signs (one positive and the other negative) all the accumulated charge flowed through his body.\n\nHe didn't understand why this jar stored so efficiently, but he send a scrambled description to some associates in Berlin, and one copy was sent on to von Klein's old university associate Andreas Cunaeus where it ended up in the hands of Pieter van Musschenbroek, who was the University of Leyden's main physics professor. He worked out that the storage capacity was vastly improved only if the flask was held in the hand, and his letter to scientist in France gave the jar the name \"Leyden jar\".\n\nFor many years the Leyden jar was the main tool of electrical storage, and it remained so until the invention of a chemical battery and electrical generators of the type we use today.\n\n", "id": "239356", "title": "Leyden jar"}

A large number of third-wave punk bands cite this album as a big influence on their work.

He made the band The Bad Shepherds and performs and writes for the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band.\n\nEdmonson was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire. He is married to comedienne Jennifer Saunders. They have three daughters.\n\nPlayed by Adrian Edmondson, Vyvyan is a psychotic punk metal medical student. He has orange-dyed & spiked hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. In the episode \"Interesting\", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible on the side of his head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other large objects. He never harms Mike, whom he respects, and often addresses as \"Michael\". He despises Rick more than he does Neil - when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode \"Boring\", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but not Rick, whom he refers to as \"a complete bastard.\" Ironically, this antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates. Unlike Neil and Rick, Vyvyan appears to come from a working-class background (something Rick incorrectly believes himself to have).\n\nVyvyan owns a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group (\"SPG\" for short) whom he is very fond of, although SPG is also frequently subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence, although it is usually provoked, such as when SPG bit Vyvyan in \"Flood\" or plugging in the TV after Vyvyan swallowed it in \"Bomb\". His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who before \"Boring\" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is.\n\nVyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength (surviving a pickaxe through his head, moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head) and eats just about anything: televisions, dead rats, caviar and cornflakes with ketchup.\n\nIn \"Bambi\" Vyvyan displays impressive mathematical talent (working out instantly that he has worn his three pairs of knickers 269 times each since their last wash), yet also that he cannot tell the time, although he was earlier able to point out that it was midnight without any difficulty.\n\nIn the episode \"Flood\", he develops a potion to transform a person into an axe-wielding homicidal maniac (he claims \"it's basically a cure... for not being an axe-wielding homicidal maniac... the potential market's enormous!\"). He has more friends than the others but apparently \"he doesn't like any of them.\" He frequently causes havoc or damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb to \"pep it up a bit\" and adding a small car engine to the vacuum cleaner as previously it \"looked a bit on the tentative side\" - which then proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's (the vacuum also prompted one of the few clashes between Vyvyan and Mike; when Mike admonished Vyv not to use it anymore, Vyv replied by calling him a \"poof\").\n\nVyvyan is the only member of the group to own a car - a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides, although he is not the only house member who can drive - during Summer Holiday Rick is briefly seen driving the stolen double decker bus.\n\nEdmonson is married to comedian Jennifer Saunders and they have three daughters, Ella, Beattie and Freya.

Darts was first played around the 1870s. Until 1930s all dart boards were made out of wood that had to be soaked in water day before.\n\nA normal board is 17 and three-quarter inches in diameter and split into 20 sections, plus there are two circles in the middle, an outer ring and a triple ring (the ring halfway from the bull). Throwing the dart on the green ring (known as the \"single bull\") scores 25 points and the red spot (the \"bull\") scores 50 points. The 20 sections around the outside of the two circles each have a number from 1 to 20. The outer ring scores double the points and the triple ring scores triple. The highest score that can be made by throwing three darts in one round is 180. This is where all three darts hit the triple 20.\n\nThe 20 numbers are arranged in a random order, and is still the order in the present day.

The band is named after the monster from It, Stephen King's novel of the same title. Pennywise's most successful line-up, which remained together for 13 years (from 1996 to 2009), consisted of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They kept their original line-up until original bassist Jason Thirsk killed himself in 1996, because he had issues with his alcoholism. After that Bradbury replaced him. In August 2009, Lindberg left Pennywise and was replaced by Ignite singer Zoli Téglás.\n\nPennywise has released nine studio albums. After releasing two EPs in 1989, the band signed to Epitaph Records (a label owned by Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz) in 1990. Their two first albums were not very successful. Pennywise's next album, \"About Time\", became a mainstream success. It was the band's first album to appear on the top 100 on the \"Billboard\" music chart and chart outside the United States. By this time, a number of punk bands, such as Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid and NOFX, had hit the mainstream, but Pennywise did not want to be signed to a major label. When Bradbury joined in 1996 following Thrisk's death, Pennywise made even more popular albums and eventually became celebrities.\n\nTheir best known song is Bro Hymn form their self-titled debut album.

She is the only chess player in history who has won nine Chess Olympiads. Maia is one of the very few women who has won a top-class grandmaster tournament. Chiburdanidze's FIDE Elo rating in the January 2010 list is 2514, and she is still the 11th highest rated female player in the world.\n\nMaia Chiburdanidze was born in Kutaisi, Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, USSR and started playing chess around the age of eight. She became the USSR girls' champion in 1976 and a year later she won the Soviet women's title. In 1977 she was awarded the title of Woman Grandmaster.\n\nChiburdanidze finished 2nd in the Tbilisi Women's Interzonal (1976), thereby qualifying for the 1977 candidates matches. She advanced through to the Candidates Final, where she beat Alla Kushnir by 7½–6½ to set up a world title match in Pitsunda, Georgia, against Nona Gaprindashvili, the reigning women's world champion. Chiburdanidze defeated Gaprindashvili by 8½–6½. Then 17, she was and still is the youngest to win the Women's World Chess Championship.\n\nShe successfully defended her title four times. In 1981 she drew a tough match 8–8 against Nana Alexandria, in Tbilisi, but kept the title as Champion. Three years later she played Irina Levitina in Volgograd, Russia and won convincingly by 8–5. The next defense came against Elena Akhmilovskaya in Sofia in 1986, and Chiburdanidze won the match by 8½–5½. In 1988 she retained her title again by narrowly winning a match in Telavi, Georgia against Nana Ioseliani by 8½–7½.\n\nShe was awarded the grandmaster title in 1984. She was the second woman, after Gaprindashvili, to be awarded the title.\n\nXie Jun of China won the right to challenge for the world championship in February 1991. Chiburdanidze lost her crown to the young Chinese player in Manila by 8½–6½. Her reign was the third longest, at 14 years, behind only that of the first women's champion, Vera Menchik, who reigned for 17 years from 1927 until her death in 1944, and that of Gaprindashvili's 16 years.\n\nShe has attempted to regain the world title but, with the rise of the Chinese women and the formidable Polgár sisters, this has not proved possible.\n\nChiburdanidze, like many of the top women players, is not impressed with 'women's chess' in general, and she prefers to play chess with men. She has played extensively in men's tournaments around the world and her best form was seen in the 1980s and early 1990s. She was 1st in tournaments at New Delhi (1984) and Banja Luka (1985) and equal third at the very strong Bilbao 1987. In the next decade she finished 1st at Belgrade (1992), Vienna (1993) and Lippstadt (1995).\n\nShe was a key member of the USSR team that dominated the women's Olympiads of the 1980s. When Georgia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, she played board 1 for the new Georgian national team that won four gold medals, in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 2008.\n\nShe also played in the European Team Championships of 1997 when Georgia won the gold medal.

Soon after, Hung became seriously ill. In a fever, Hong saw himself in the \"Thirty-third Heaven\". He said that he saw a man called the Venerable (Respected) in Years. The Venerable in Years gave Hong a sword and told him to destroy the demon-worshipers who had rebelled against the Venerable in Years. With the help of the Venerable in Years's son, Hong saw himself doing battle against the demon forces.\nShortly after he became healthy again, Hung read the Old Testament and believed it showed his vision was right. He felt that he had met with God and that God had chosen him for a son.\n\nNimade wanted to know more about Christianity. The missionaries he met disagreed with Hung's vision. They did not agree that he was the brother of Jesus. Hung left them and decided to make his own cult. In Hung's cult, God was the Father, Christ was the Son and Elder (Older) Brother, and Hung was the Younger Brother. He called the New Testament the Former Testament. He called his own ideas the New Testament. Hung's friend Yang Xiuqing used to sell firewood. Yang claimed to be able to act as a voice of God, to direct the people and gain political power.\n\nChina was very weak at this time, and the people were hungry. People began to join Hung's new religion. By 1851 he had a ten-thousand-man army. The rebels cut off their pigtails and made their hair loose. This showed that they were in rebellion to the Manchu.\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion lasted from 1851 to 1864. It has been guessed that in the fighting 20 to 30 million people died. At last, corruption of the rebellion's leaders made people angry. Hong committed suicide in June 1864.

She was the Women's World Chess Champion from 1996 to 1999. In October 2005 Polgar had a FIDE rating of 2577, making her the second-ranked woman in the world at the time, after her sister Judit Polgár. She has been inactive and has not played in official competition since 2004.\n\nPolgar is head of the Susan Polgar Institute for Chess Excellence at Texas Tech University, and a chess writer and promoter. She had been on the Executive of the United States Chess Federation, but was stripped of her membership after a complicated internal struggle.\n\nSusan was born and brought up in Budapest, Hungary, and now lives in Lubbock, Texas. She recently moved from Forest Hills, Queens in New York City, where she ran the Polgar Chess Center and the Susan Polgar Foundation, which gives chess training to children, especially girls.\n\nPolgar and her two younger sisters, Judit and Sofia, were part of an educational experiment carried out by their father László Polgár. He and his wife Klara educated their three daughters at home, with chess as the specialist subject. \n\nIn January 1991, Polgar became the third woman to earn the Grandmaster title. Much is made, by her supporters, of the fact that Polgar had got the three GM norms and a rating over 2500. Nona Gaprindashvili was awarded the Grandmaster title in 1978 mainly as a result of winning Lone Pine International 1977, but she did not quite make the usual 24 games required at that time. Maia Chiburdanidze was awarded the GM title in 1984 for winning at New Delhi (1984), and for beating Nona Gaprindashvili and two others in matches for the Women's World Chess Championship. However, before Polgar reached the title, Chiburdanidze had more than achieved the traditional GM qualifications by her performances at Banja Luka and Bilbao. \n\nPolgar had tended to avoid women-only tournaments, but she abandoned this when she entered the 1993 cycle for the Women's World Championship. She became the Women's World Champion at her second attempt in 1996. Two years later, her title defense against Xie Jun of China was scheduled to take place in November, 1998. However, Polgar requested a postponement because she was pregnant and also FIDE had been unable to find a satisfactory sponsor. Ultimately, in 1999, a match was arranged, but under conditions to which Polgar objected – firstly because she had recently had a child, and had not had sufficient time to recuperate, and secondly because the match was to be held entirely in China, the home country of her challenger. She also wanted a significantly larger prize fund.\n\nWhen Polgar refused to play under these conditions, FIDE declared that she had forfeited the title, and instead organized a match between Xie Jun and Alisa Galliamova for the Women's World Chess Championship, which was won by Xie Jun. Polgar sued in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland for monetary damages and the restoration of her title. In March 2001, the case was settled, with Polgar withdrawing her claims and FIDE agreeing to pay Polgar's attorney's fees in the amount of $25,000. Since Xie Jun had already been crowned Women's World Champion, FIDE could not restore the title to Polgar. Polgar has not participated in subsequent Women's World Championship cycles.\n\nPaid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federation, the family did play together in two female-only events. The Hungarians (nicknamed 'Polgaria') won the Women's Chess Olympiads, with a team packed with Polgárs, in 1988 and 1990. Zsuzsa, Judit, Sofia (the least strong sister) and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time. \n\nThe United States Chess Federation named Polgar \"Grandmaster of the Year\" in 2003, the first time a woman has won that honor. In that same year (2003), Polgar also became the first woman to win the US Open Blitz Championship, against a field which included seven grandmasters. She won that title again in 2005 and in 2006.\n\nShe helped train and played the top board for the United States women's team at the 2004 Chess Olympiad held in October in Majorca, Spain. Overall, the team won the silver medal, and Polgar won an individual gold medal. This was not her first Olympiad: she has a total of ten Olympiad Medals (five Gold, four Silver, and one Bronze). She has played 56 games in the Olympiads, never losing a single game.\n\nIn 1994, Polgar married computer consultant Jacob Shutzman, and moved to New York. They had two sons, Tom and Leeam, but later divorced. In December 2006, she married her long time business manager and friend, Paul Truong.\n\nPolgar has written several books:\n\nPolgar is also a chess journalist, with columns in \"Chess Life\", \"Chess Life for Kids\", \"ChessCafe\", \"Chess Horizons\", \"Georgia Chess\", \"Chessville\", \"Empire Chess\", \"School Mates\", and \"Europe Echecs\".\n\n", "id": "239840", "title": "Susan Polgar"}

It is a reusable robotic spacecraft based on the smaller X-40. The X-37 began as a NASA project in 1999, then was transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004. The X-37 had its first flight as a drop test in April 2006 at Edwards AFB. The spacecraft was launched in April 2010 to begin a United States Air Force mission.\n\nIn 1999, NASA chose Boeing to design the vehicle. The vehicle was built at the California branch of Boeing's Phantom Works. At the end of 2002, a new $300 million contract was awarded to Boeing in the framework of NASA’s Space Launch Initiative.\n\nThe X-37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in September, 2004. The program has become a secretive, though it is not known whether DARPA will maintain this status for the project.\n\nIn June 2005, the X-37 completed a captive-carry flight underneath the White Knight at Mojave Spaceport, Mojave, California. Through the second half of 2005, the X-37 underwent structural upgrades including reinforcement of the nose wheel supports. Further captive-carry flight tests and the first drop test were expected mid-February 2006.\n\nMarch 2006 was scheduled for the X-37's first free flight but a snow storm covered the area, dropping snow on the Mojave. The next flight attempt in March was canceled due to high winds. In late March the X-37 flew, but a flaw prevented the free flight and the vehicle returned to the ground still docked with its White Knight carrier. In April 2006, the X-37 made its first free glide flight. During landing the vehicle ran off the runway. After the vehicle was repaired, the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 (KPMD) in Palmdale, California for the remainder of the flight test program. White Knight continued to be based at Mojave, but would ferry over to Plant 42 when flights were scheduled. Five additional flights were performed, at least one of which is believed to have been a free flight with a successful landing.\nIn November 2006 the U.S. Air Force announced it would develop the X-37B from the NASA X-37A. The Air Force version is designated X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV). The OTV program builds on industry and government investments by DARPA, NASA and the Air Force. The X-37B effort will be led by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and includes partnerships with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Boeing is the prime contractor for the OTV program. The X-37B can remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time.\n\nThe Secretary of the Air Force states the OTV program will focus on \"risk reduction, experimentation, and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies, in support of long term developmental space objectives.\"\n\nThe X-37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, but following the \"Columbia\" accident, it was transferred to a Delta II. It was then transferred to the Atlas V following concerns over the spacecraft's aerodynamic properties during launch.\n\nThe first orbital flight of the X-37B, was launched on an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida in April 2010. The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing, and then will land at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California .\n\nA second X-37B is being manufactured for a test mission scheduled for 2011.\n\nThe main engines are fueled by JP-8 kerosene, a military standard jet fuel. The maneuvering engines are fueled by hydrogen peroxide. This is wrong, the propellants were changed to hypergols long ago when it was a NASA program.\n\nThe X-37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the Space Shuttle cargo bay, but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical.\n\nThis vehicle has the potential to become the United States' first operational military spaceplane, after the cancellation of Dyna-Soar in 1963. It is expected to operate in a velocity range of up to Mach 25 on reentry. Among the technologies to be demonstrated with the X-37 are improved thermal protection systems, avionics, the autonomous guidance system, and an advanced airframe. The on-board engine is the Rocketdyne AR-2/3, which is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and JP-8.\n\nThe X-37's aerodynamic design was derived from the Space Shuttle, hence the X-37 has a similar lift-to-drag ratio, and a lower cross range at high altitudes and mach numbers than the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle.\n\nThe test vehicle, which was used as an atmospheric drop test glider, had no propulsion system. Instead of an operational vehicle's payload bay doors it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership. Most of the thermal protection tiles were 'fake', made of inexpensive foam rather than ceramic; a smaller number of the X-37's tiles were actual TPS tiles, and TPS blankets were used in areas where heating would not have been severe enough to require tiles.\n\nFollowing their missions, X-37B spacecraft are to land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California with Edwards Air Force Base as an alternate site.\n\n", "id": "240094", "title": "Boeing X-37"}

The first barcodes stored the numbers using lines (bars).\nThe first use of barcodes was to label railroad cars, but barcodes were not a big success until they were used in supermarket checkout systems. The first product that used a barcode was a pack of Wrigley's Juicy Fruit Gum sold on June 26, 1974. Barcodes are now used for many purposes.\n\nNorman Joseph Woodland and Bernard Silver developed the modern barcode, and were granted a patent for it in 1952. The idea was to make the checkout of articles easier, using a code which was inspired by Morse code. In 1959, David Collins developed a system for tracking railroad carriages which used barcodes. This system was unreliable, because of dirt on the barcodes. In the 1970s, the system was abandoned, but in the 1980s, a similar system which used radio tags was introduced.\n\nThere are different barcode types, which use different designs:\nThe standard barcode uses changes in lines and spaces to store numbers in a code that computers can read. The lines are read by a scanner and changed into numbers. It is designed that it can be read forwards or backwards, so the user does not have to be careful how a product is put in front of the reader. A laser line can be used to scan (read) the changes. The laser scanners are also called barcode readers. Since this laser line scans in one direction (left or right), this is called a 1D barcode.\n\nNewer 2D systems use symbols other than bars and can hold more information, but they are also called barcodes. They need to be scanned left or right, and up or down (two directions). These can also be read from an image by special software. Smart phones can have an app to read some of these 2D systems from a picture, particularly QR codes. This is becoming increasingly popular as more apps are able to utilise such features to help the user obtain access to websites and special resources, such as being used in 'digital cities', such as Bordeaux.\n\nBarcodes — especially the Universal Product Code, UPC — have slowly become an important part of modern life. They are used in many places, and the technology is constantly improving. Some modern uses of barcodes are:\n\nIn sales, the use of barcodes can provide up-to-date information to help the business.

Design management encompasses the ongoing processes, business decisions, and strategies that enable innovation and create effectively-designed products, services, communications, environments, and brands that enhance our quality of life and provide organizational success.\" \nThis means that design management is not limited on a single design discipline. In his 'Classification of Design' (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes; design management operates in and across all three categories:\n\nDesign management is not independent from the organization and product context, and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organisation and market:\n\nSupportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient ('doing the things right') and effectively ('doing the right things'). Depending on a multitude of factors (such as industry, company size, design focus, market situation and the position / role of design within the company), design managers have a broad range of job profiles, with very different roles, activities and responsibilities.\n\nIt is difficult to exactly trace the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise. Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines (e.g. architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering) and movements (e.g. system theory, design methodologies) and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to design nor to management.\n\nHistorical development of design management: \nDesign management can be divided by its different fields of application into the three different levels: \n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\n", "id": "240222", "title": "Design management"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240226", "text": "Middlegame\n\nThe middlegame is the part of a game of chess after the opening.\n\nThe middlegame begins when most of the pieces have been developed. It is where most games are won and lost. Many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press.</ref> \n\nThe simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well (see examples in English opening and French defence).\n\nA middlegame position has a structure, caused by the opening. These are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position:\n\n• Material: changes in the balance of material are critical. To lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game. If the players are evenly matched, then a rough material balance of pieces is normal. Material balance is often quite static: it doesn't change for many moves. On the other hand, material may be sacrificed, usually for a direct attack on the opposing king.\n\n• Development: the opening may have left one player with a lead in development. That player has the initiative, and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out. It is a temporary asset: if a lead in development is not used effectively, it will disappear.\n\n• The centre: in the centre pieces have their greatest effect, and some (such as the knight) attack more squares in the centre than at the sides. The player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage.\n\n• Mobility: a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to. Almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility. Look for open files for the rooks, and open diagonals for the bishops. Outposts are what knights need, places where they can't easily be dislodged.\n\n• King safety: where is the king? Ideally, a king should be castled, and kept behind a screen of pawns. Many other things may happen in practice. If a king is weak, it may be put under direct attack. If the kings castle on opposite wings, and queens are on the board, both players may try to assault the enemy king. \n\n• Pawns provide the skeleton of a position. They move slowly, and may become blocked for many moves. Everything takes place round the pawns. Different openings produce different pawn structures. In this way openings influence the whole game. Notice these things when they occur:\n\nWhat the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!\n\nThe Tarrasch variation of the French defence gives us: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nd2 c5 (3...Nf6 is popular) 4.exd5 exd5 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.dxc5 Bxc5 8.0-0 Ne7 9.Nb3 Bd6 10.Re1 0-0 11.Bg5 Bg4 and so on. Now the opening is over, and all the pieces are developed. This line is quiet, and mostly about the centre.\n\nThe isolated black QP is what gives the middlegame its character. The pawn itself is both a weakness and a potential source of strength. It controls the very important square e4, but leaves the equally important d4 much weaker. The position is fairly equal, but the database shows that White has an advantage of about 7%.\n\nIn the English opening this line became popular: 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 e6 3.e4 c5 4.e5 Ng8 5.Nf3 Nc6 6.d4 (this is the critical move: White tries to take advantage of his development at the expense of a pawn) 6...cxd4 7.Nxd4 Nxe5 8.Ndb5 a6 9.Nd6+ Bxd6 10.Qxd6 f6 11.Be3 Ne7 12. Bb6 (looks like it wins the Q) Nf5 and now both 11.Qc5 and 11.Bxd8 give White an advantage of only 2.4%.\n\nThe variation involved a number of middlegame themes: rapid development, material sacrifice, exploiting weak squares. In total, it is a frantic struggle for the centre.\n\nRapid development is the benefit of the old-style gambits. An opening such as 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 (known as the Danish Gambit) is virtually never played nowadays, but White does get good value for his pawn(s). Some trainers recommend young players try this out to learn how to get the best out of rapid development.\n\nMany middlegames are played around blocked or semi-blocked pawn chains. The pawn chains are decisive in deciding the players' plans. These plans often involve a K-side v Q-side struggle, with each player attacking his opponent's pawn base.\n\n1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 Ne7 7.Qg4 Qc7 (7...0-0 is possible) 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qxh7 cxd4 10.Ne2 and so on. The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric: White owns the kingside, and Black owns the queenside.\n\nThis example, from the Winawer variation, is an extreme case. Each side plays a maximum of moves attacking the opponent's weak side, and as few moves as possible defending his own weak side. This is a general principle for these unbalanced K-side v Q-side positions.\n\nHere is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame. In the diagram to the left, White will operate mainly on the Q-side, and Black on the K-side. The reason for this is that the black d6 pawn and the white e4 pawn are the bases of their pawn chains. It was Nimzovich who pointed out that such pawns are usually the most vulnerable to attack.\n\nWhite, to play, may wish to cope with Black playing 10...Nf4. He can do this by playing 10.g3, or by playing 10.Re1 so that if 10...Nf4 11.Bf1 will preserve the bishop (in this position an important defensive piece). Or maybe White will plough ahead with 10.c5, the key move on the Q-side. \n\nChessBase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were:\n\nThe data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for 10.Re1. What the player does is note the features on the board, and formulate a plan which takes the features into account. Then the player works out a sequence of moves. Of course, in practice, the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step!\n\nSafety of the king is probably the most common theme in the later middlegame. This example is a classic. Two pawns up, White could win the endgame by exchanging queens. However, he thought he saw something better.\nThis is a skewer, because if the black queen moves aside, then Rxg7+ gives mate.\nThis brilliant reply puts its finger on White's weak point: the back rank.\n\nTraditionally the value of the Pieces has been as follows:\n\nKasparov's version:\n", "id": "240226", "title": "Middlegame"}

This system uses a videocassette tape to record video and sound, which can be watched on a television. A DVD/VHS combo can record(write) on VHS tapes, read off VHS tapes, and additionally, read from DVD discs. A few can also record on DVD. VHS was so popular that during the 1990s, the terms \"video cassette\", \"video tape\", or even just \"video\" usually referred to the VHS format.\n\nVHS cassettes can be recorded using a video camera. They can also be recorded with a video cassette recorder, or VCR. A VCR can use a VHS cassette to record broadcast television.\n\nThis system was created in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan (also called JVC). VHS was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the 1980s and 1990s, but now DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) and Blu-ray have become more popular as they can be easier to use, the quality is higher, they last longer, and the discs and players are cheaper to make. Pre-recorded VHS movies are no longer made, except for a few independent films, but blank VHS tapes and VHS VCRs are still made.\n\nMany companies developed different systems for recording video on a tape cassette, but the first VTR (short for Video Tape Recorder) to become popular and make money was the Ampex VRX-1000, which was introduced in 1956 by Ampex Corporation. It cost US$50,000 in 1956 (over $400,000 in 2016 money), and US$300 (over $2,000 in 2016 money) for a 90-minute reel of tape. Because it was so expensive, it was made and sold only for professional recording.\n\nWhile Kenjiro Takayanagi, a television broadcasting pioneer, was the vice president of JVC, he decided that his company could make money by developing and selling VTRs in Japan, and at a lower price. In 1959, JVC developed a two-head video tape recorder, and by 1960 they had a color television version for professional broadcasting. In 1964, JVC released the DV220. It would be the company's standard VTR until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1969, JVC worked with Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric (who owned Panasonic) to design a video recording technical standard for Japanese consumers. They developed the U-matic tape format in 1971, which was the first format to become a technical standard for VTRs. The U-matic format was successful in business and some video broadcasting. However, few people bought U-matic VTRs to use at home because they were still very expensive, and the tapes could only record short time periods of video.\n\nSoon after, Sony and Matsushita stopped working on the project. They started to work on their own video recording formats. Sony started working on Betamax and Matsushita started working on VX. JVC released the CR-6060 in 1975, which was based on the U-matic format. Sony and Matsushita also produced their own U-matic machines.\n\nIn 1971, JVC engineers named Yuma Shiraishi and Shizuo Takano started a team to develop a VTR for people to use at home.\nBy the end of 1971, they created an diagram titled \"VHS Development Matrix\", which listed goals for JVC's new VTR.\n\n\nIn 1972, video recording industry in Japan started to lose money. JVC had to find ways to spend less money, so it stopped developing the VHS project. However, Takano and Shiraishi continued to work on the project by themselves, even though the company was not giving them any money to use. By 1973, the two engineers had built a prototype.\n\n", "id": "240257", "title": "VHS"}

The people who worked at Boeing called the plane the \"Dash 80\". It was made to show airlines how good jet aircraft were.\n\nThe Dash 80 was the prototype for the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and the Boeing 707. It was made in less than two years. \n\nOnly one was made. It is now in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\n\nTwo things made Boeing think about making a jet airliner. The first reason was because of the Boeing B-47 Stratojet. The second reason was because of the world's first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet. \n\nIn 1950 Boeing made some details on a jet airliner which they called the \"Model 473-60C\". Airlines were not sure about jet planes because they successful with propeller planes like the Douglas DC-4, DC-6, Boeing Stratocruiser and Lockheed Constellation.\n\nBoeing had sold a lot of planes to the military but they were not very successful with airlines. Douglas was the most successful airliner maker at the time. Boeing thought that the only way to get airlines to buy a jet plane was to show them one.\n\nBoeing wanted its jets to have different model numbers from its propeller planes. The names of the propeller planes all started with 300. The numbers 400, 500 and 600 were used by missiles and other things, so Boeing made the model number of the jets 700. The first jet would be the 707.\n\nThe Dash 80 was wide. Boeing wanted to make the 707's fuselage wide. By the time the 707 was made, its fuselage was in diameter. The decision to change it did not make many delays, because the Dash 80 was mostly made by hand.\n\nBy early 1952 the Dash 80 was designed and Boeing's managers allowed it to be made. The Dash 80 was made at Boeing's Renton factory. \n\nThe Dash 80 was finished on May 15, 1954, which was 18 months after the making started. \n\nSome problems were found with the engines and brakes. The brakes once completely failed when the plane landed, so it went over the runway.\n\nPeople from Aircraft Industries Association (AIA) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) came to the 1955 Seafair and Gold Cup Hydroplane Races on August 6, 1955. The Dash 80 was supposed to make a simple flight above them, but the Boeing test pilot did two barrel rolls instead.\n\nThe next day, the pilot was told never to do it again. However, the pilot said it was completely safe. \n\nA Boeing test pilot who made the first Boeing 777 flight on June 12, 1994 was told \"No rolls.\"\n\nAfter the first 707 was made in 1957, the Dash 80 was changed into a test planes for other things. It tested things for the new Boeing 727. To do this, another engine was put in at the back. \n\nThe Dash 80 was put in storage in 1969. On May 26, 1972 Boeing gave the Dash 8- to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. For 18 years the plane was in a \"desert boneyard\" in Arizona. Boeing took it back and restored it. The Dash 80's last flight was to Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. on August 27, 2003. It was painted in its first ever colours and it was sent to the Steven F.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=240345", "text": "Woolmer Green\n\nWoolmer Green is a village in Hertfordshire, England.\n\nSituated between the villages of Welwyn and Knebworth, Woolmer Green was first settled in the Iron Age. The Belgae colonised the area in the 1st century BC, and later it was settled by the Romans. Many Roman artefacts have been found in the surrounding area with a Roman bath house existing at nearby Welwyn. The village was at the junction of two thoroughfares, the Great North Road and another road called Stane Street (or Stone Street) from St Albans. The route of this road runs across the parish along the path of Robbery Bottom Lane, continuing on as a public bridleway to Datchworth and then Braughing, on its eventual way to another major Roman town, Colchester.\n\nThomas de Wolvesmere is recorded as having lived in a dwelling here in 1297, and his name is considered to have led to the current name of the village.\n\nWoolmer Green has always been one of those places which is “neither here nor there”. In the Middle Ages part of the village was in Mardleybury Manor, part in Rectory Manor, with the northern part owing allegiance to Broadwater Manor or Knebworth. Things have not changed; the village is still at the point where the Districts of North Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire and Welwyn Hatfield meet. \n\nApart from the trade generated by travellers, life in Woolmer Green was agricultural and feudal until the middle of the nineteenth century. Things started to change, however, when the railway arrived in 1850 (although the nearby station in Knebworth was not opened until 1884 after intervention from Viscount Knebworth). The village school, which was opened a few years after this, obtained much funding from the railway.\n\nIn 1863, only a gunsmith and a shoemaker were listed in the trade directory. By 1898, when the population of Woolmer Green stood at 363 and that of Knebworth at 382, there were five shops including two beer retailers; no mention in the trade directory of the many ‘front room shops’! This level of service persisted until recent years with a general store and Post Office, a baker, a small supermarket and a butcher. These have all now closed.\n\nThe main road through the centre of the village was still the Great North Road down which thousands of cattle and sheep were driven ‘on the hoof’ to London markets each year. The area around Knebworth and Woolmer Green provided what was probably the last overnight stop for the animals and their drovers before they reached London.\n\nDuring the 20th century the village became a popular destination for tourists travelling to and from London as it lies on the old Great North Road from London to Edinburgh. Many who passed along the road would have visited the cottage inhabited by the late Harry McDonald, who for many years adorned both the cottage and garden with intricate carvings of animals and other objects. He became famous as the Woodcarver of Woolmer Green. The Woodcarvers Cottage, as it came to be known, was demolished after his death.\n\nPrior to the millennium year, 2000, Woolmer Green was part of the parish of Welwyn for local government purposes. In that year, however, the parish gained its independence from its neighbour, and the inaugural meeting of the Parish Council was held in May 2000. The first chairman of the new Woolmer Green Parish Council, Judith Watson, was instrumental in achieving the separation.\n\nThe boundary between Woolmer Green and Welwyn parishes is formed by the path of the East Coast Mainline railway. The small viaduct to the south of the Parish, at the end of Robbery Bottom Lane, follows the same basic design as the long Digswell Viaduct. It was designed by William Cubitt and built by Thomas Brassey between 1848 and 1850 for the sum of £4,643. There are seven arches with a height above the roadway of 17m and a length of 60m. The viaduct and the bridges over London Road and Heath Road are all original, dating from when the railway was first built, although they have been strengthened and the parapets raised.\n\nImmediately to the south of the viaduct the railway enters the first of two tunnels (with a very short open section in the middle) between Woolmer Green and the station at Welwyn North. The first tunnel heading south was the site of a notorious accident in 1866.\n\nThere was a temporary railway halt at Woolmer Green during the war which was used by soldiers, but nowadays the nearest station is just down the road at Knebworth.\n\nThe parish has an excellent modern Village Hall and adjoining sports field which are very actively used by the community. The hall was opened in November 1990 by local celebrity Barry Norman and is licensed for wedding ceremonies.\n\n", "id": "240345", "title": "Woolmer Green"}

She was also the second wife of King James II. Mary was a very firm Catholic. She married James, Duke of York, (the future James II) in 1673. He was the younger brother of Charles II. Mary was not interested in politics. Instead, she was devoted to James, and gave birth to two children who lived to become adults. They were Louise Mary and the Jacobite James Francis Edward Stuart, who became known in history as \"The Old Pretender\".\n\nMary was born as a princess of the Italian Duchy of Modena. She is mostly remembered for the birth of James Francis Edward. Most of the English people thought he was not really Mary's son. They believed he had been secretly brought into the birth-room in a warming-pan to continue King James II's Catholic rule. The privy council investigation declared that the story was false. However, James Francis Edward's birth was one of the reasons why the Glorious Revolution happened. In the Glorious Revolution, King James II was deposed by his daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange.\n\nThe \"Queen over the water\"—as Jacobites (followers of James II) called Mary—was exiled to France. She lived with her family in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which Louis XIV of France had given her. Louis XIV's liked Mary, but thought James was not interesting. When James died, Mary spent a lot of time with the nuns at the Convent of Chaillot. When James II died in 1701, the Jacobites saw James Francis Edward as king. Because he was too young to rule, Queen Dowager Mary acted as regent until he became 16. Later, \"James III\" was forced to leave France because of the Treaty of Utrecht. This left Mary without any family in France (Princess Louise Mary had died of smallpox). Mary died of breast cancer in 1718. She was kindly remembered by the people in France at that time.\n\nMary Beatrice d'Este was the older child of Alfonso IV, Duke of Modena and his wife Laura Martinozzi. She was born on 5 October 1658 NS in Modena. Her only sibling, Francesco, became a Duke when his father died in 1662. This was the year Mary became 4. Mary and Francesco's mother Laura was firm with her children. She acted as regent of the duchy until her son grew older. Mary's education was very good. She spoke French and Italian well, and had a knew much of Latin and, later, English.\n\n", "id": "240364", "title": "Mary of Modena"}

He was a military hero during the Texas Revolution.\n\nThe city of Sherman had some human and environmental problems over the years. For example, a huge tornado happened in 1896. A race riot, which is a type of violent protest, happened in 1930 after a black man was accused of raping a white woman. People from the town burned the man in his jail cell and took his body into the streets. The people also burned down the black business district.\n\nHowever, Sherman continued to grow, especially when an Army Air Field for pilot training, Perrin Air Force Base, was built there in 1941. Perrin Field was closed in 1971.\n\nSherman is about 65 miles north of Dallas at the intersection of U.S. Highway 75 and U.S. Highway 82. It has a number of public schools and colleges. It even has its own symphony orchestra, which is not common for a city of its size. Manufacturing is a big part of the local economy. Also, several national companies have plants in Sherman.
