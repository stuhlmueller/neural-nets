For example, knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is, but it will give some \"hint\". In the same way, knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature, but will make certain temperatures \"more or less likely\". These \"hints\" or \"changes in likelihood\" are explained and measured with mutual information.\n\nTo calculate mutual information, the probability (chance) of all possible events, and the probability of them happening at the same time, is needed. For example, to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius, how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March.\n\nThe formula requires the summation, or adding up, of many terms or numbers. Every possible outcome has its own term. From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature, we will use the following variables:\n\nThis means m(3) equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March. This is 31/365, or about 0.085, since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March.\n\nOne term would be as follows:\n\nIn this formula, \"log\" means logarithm.\n\nAdding all possible terms together gives the value for mutual information.\n\nThe larger the mutual information, the more you can learn about one random value (e.g. month) when told another (e.g. temperature).\n\n\n\n\n\nMutual information does not change based on which random value is revealed. This means we know just as much about \"temperature when told the month\" as we know about \"the month when told the temperature\".\n\nMutual information is difficult to compare. If we calculate mutual information for weather and another value for a card game, the two values cannot easily be compared.\n\n", "id": "169900", "title": "Mutual information"}

The brackets are now often removed, as in 90377 Sedna, according to what the astronomer wants. In practice, however, for any reasonably well-known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry, and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation: Sedna, .\n\nThe rule for moons of minor planets, such as the formal designation (87) Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus, is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used, on and off, for the moons of the planets since Galileo's time. \n\nComets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center, but use a different cataloguing system.\n\nBy 1851, there were 15 asteroids, all but one with their own symbol. The symbols were becoming less and less simple, and, as they had to be drawn by hand, astronomers found some of them hard to draw. This difficulty was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould in 1851, who suggested numbering asteroids in the order that they were found, and placing this number in a circle as the symbol for the asteroid, such as ④ for the fourth asteroid, Vesta. This practice was soon coupled with the name itself into an official number-name designation, \"④ Vesta\", as the number of minor planets increased. By \"ca\" 1858, the circle had been simplified to brackets, \"(4)\" and \"(4) Vesta\", which was easier to typeset. Other punctuation such as \"4) Vesta\" and \"4, Vesta\" was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949.\n\nThe major exception to the convention that the number tracks the order they were or the order that they're orbit was calculated is the case of Pluto. Since Pluto was originally called a planet, it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of \"planet\" that didn't include it.

It has less leather and is lighter than most Western saddles. \n\nThe Western saddle is used for horse activities where the rider must work cows. It is also used for showing and barrel racing. The biggest difference is it has a horn on the front. This was used originally for tying the rope to, so when a cow was roped it would be tied to the saddle.\n\nThe there are many different types of English and Western saddles. All are designed for a specific purpose. So while they might look different, they all help the rider for the sport or activity for which they were designed. For example, a rider would not want to jump in a Western saddle because the horn would make it hard for them to stay in the correct position over the jump. A rider would not want to work cows in a jumping saddle because they would not have a horn and because the Western saddle puts the rider in a better position for working cows.\n", "id": "170098", "title": "Saddle"}

It can also contain oils of lavender, rosemary, thyme, petitgrain (orange leaf), and jasmine.\n\n\"Eau de Cologne\" is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in Cologne in 1709 by Giovanni Maria Farina (1685-1766), an Italian perfumer from Santa Maria Maggiore Valle Vigezzo, Italy. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: \"I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain\" (Eckstein p.8). He named his fragrance \"Eau de Cologne\", in honour of his new hometown. \n\nThe Original \"Eau de Cologne\" composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to \"nearly all royal houses in Europe\" (Farina Fragrance Museum information leaflet). His ability to produce a constantly homogenous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of \"Eau de Cologne\" prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of \"Eau de Cologne\" and even Farina. \n\nGiovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in Cologne since 1709 by Farina opposite the Jülichplatz and to this day remains a secret.

He was the second son of a poor fisherman. He worked when he was young because his father died and his mother and older brother were sick. Because of this, he did not learn how to read and write very well.\n\nIn 1841, when he was fourteen years old, the fishing boat he worked on ran into a storm and was turned over. He and the people with him were on the ocean for five days. They landed on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where no people lived. They spent 143 days on that island. An American ship passed by the island and John Manjiro and the others were saved.\n\nAt this time, Japan was a closed country. The American ship or any non-Japanese ship could not enter Japan. Also, any Japanese who left Japan were killed by the Japanese government if they returned to Japan. Most of the people saved from the island were taken to Hawaii. The captain of the ship liked John Manjiro and took Manjiro with him. Manjiro saw a map of the world for the first time and saw how small Japan was in the world. Manjiro was named “John Mung” by the captain. He was adopted by the captain of the ship and lived with the captain’s family in the United States. \nManjiro learned English, math, measurement, navigation, and shipbuilding at school. He spent all of his time to studying to be a captain. He learned new ideas from the Western world. For example, democracy and equality between men and women.\n\nManjiro returned to Hawaii and bought a boat. He and his friends from the fishing boat started to sail back to Japan in December of 1850. Japan was still a closed country. Because of this, he was investigated by the Shogunate (the rulers of Japan) for a long time. \n\nIN 1851, Manjiro return to his village in Japan. \n\nAround this time, Shimazu Nariakira, a historical person in Japan, was interested in English and shipbuilding. John Manjiro began working as an English teacher. He had a strong friendship with many statesmen. He was even asked to be a statesman himself. \n\nIn 1853-1854, Manjiro was the interpreter for Matthew C. Perry when the Americans first came to Japan. \n\nIn his later years, Manjiro visited American friends. By then, he could not speak English very well any more. He died in 1898 at the age of 71 years old.\n\nJohn Manjiro was actually born as Nakahama Manjiro (Manjiro is a Japanese first name). The name \"John\" comes from the name of the ship he was saved by when on the island in 1841. The name of the ship was \"John Howland.\" The captain gave Manjiro this name. In 1938, Ibuse Masuji, a Japanese writer, first used the name \"John Manjiro.\" From this book came the name of \"John Manjiro.\"\n\nManjiro had problems translating because he was not good at translating English sentences. This was because he had not learned basic grammar when he was young. He was used as interpreter when Commodore Perry came in 1863. Manjiro pronounced English just as he heard it. His pronunciation was different from present-day English. Japanese based their pronunciation of English at the time on Manjiro’s pronunciation. They were able to be understood by Americans and English people.\n\nThere is a musical about Manjiro in Japan. It is called \"The Dream of John Manjiro\".

However, because they are so far away, it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved, and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference. Because of this, for a long time, most people thought that the stars did not move at all. Even the ancient Greeks, who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move, such as stellar precession, did not discover proper motion (although they probably suspected it). \n\nProper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius, Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around 130 BC. However, even after more than 1,800 years, they had moved less than half a degree.\n\nProper motion is useful to astronomers in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion (meaning they move faster across the sky) than stars that are farther away. For example, Barnard's star has the largest proper motion of any star, moving 10.3 arcseconds per year. This is equal to one quarter of a degree, or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky, in only 87 years. It is the second-closest star to the Earth at 5.98 light years away.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170258", "text": "Origin of birds\n\nThe origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution. Birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs during the Mesozoic era. \n\nThomas Henry Huxley (\"Darwin's bulldog\"), who was a comparative anatomist, made a study of this nearly 150 years ago. He compared the first fossil bird, \"Archaeopteryx\", with a small theropod dinosaur, \"Compsognathus\". They are two fossils from the same place and time: the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, Germany. The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period, about 144 million years ago. \n\nHuxley's papers on \"Archaeopteryx\", and the origin of birds, were of great interest then, and still are. He showed that the two fossils were almost identical, except for the front limbs and feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\". \n\nHe united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida, and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs.\n\nAll palaeontologists since Huxley agreed that \"Archaeopteryx\" evolved from reptiles, but many thought it was derived from an earlier type than dinosaurs. It took a long time before they agreed with Huxley. Almost all now think that early members of a group of small carnivorous dinosaur were ancestral to birds. \n\nThe group most favoured as ancestral is the Paraves or Eumaniraptora, which includes the dromaeosaurs and the troodonts. The dromaeosaurs include \"Velociraptor\" and \"Deinonychus\" but, of course, it would have been an earlier type of dromaeosaur, perhaps from the lower Jurassic. Dromaeosaurs have several traits we used to think were special to birds: hollow bones with holes for air-sacs, limbs with many bones either lost or fused, clavicles fused into wishbones, and feathers. \n\nThe discovery of feathered dinosaurs and birds in the Lower Cretaceous of China was what finally convinced palaeontologists. What seems to have happened is this. Theropod dinosaurs evolved feathers for heat regulation rather than flight. From then, a small group began to use them for primitive flight. This group is represented in the Jurassic by \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Anchiornis\".\nHuxley had pointed out that \"Archaeopteryx\" was a mixture of reptile and bird features. Without the feathers and arms, its skeleton looked just like that of \"Compsognathus\". We now know its bone growth physiology was much slower than modern birds, and more like that of its dinosaur ancestors. This means it would take longer after hatching before it could fly. A modern precocial bird takes for 3–6 weeks from hatching to flying. In \"Archaeopteryx\" this milestone might have taken about 18 weeks. It might have taken two to three years to reach its final adult size. The evolution of the physiology of modern forms occurred later in the group's history. They have had over 140 million years to evolve after \"Archaeopteryx\". This is an example of mosaic evolution, where some characters in a transitional form are basal, while others are remarkably advanced.\n\n\"Anchiornis huxlei\" is so far the only dinobird fossil known which lived before \"Archaeopteryx\". It was found in Liaoning, China. The strata dates to the mid-late Jurassic period, 160 to 155 million years ago. There are also feather-bearing non-flying dinosaurs from the Jurassic of China, such as the maniraptoran \"Epidexipteryx\". \"Epidexipteryx\" is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record, about 152 to 168 million years ago. \n\n\"Anchiornis\" had large wings, made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand (as in modern birds) as well as flight feathers on the hind legs, forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings. The forewing of \"Anchiornis\" was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers. The primary feathers in \"Anchiornis\" indicated poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relatives. In \"Microraptor\" and \"Archaeopteryx\", the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing, making the wings appear long, narrow, and pointed. However, in \"Anchiornis\", the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist, making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded, less flight-adapted profile.\n\nSo the animal could glide, but probably not fly.\n\n \n\nFlying gave the birds access to many new habitats, and an adaptive radiation took place. We see the results of this rapid evolution in the Chinese fossils from the Lower Cretaceous, which are more varied, and mostly more advanced, than \"Archaeopteryx\". There are now 31 different bird genera from the Lower Cretaceous of China. It is also clear, from the tail feathers of \"Confuciusornis\" (one of the Chinese fossils), that some of these birds were already using feathers for signalling and display, just as they do today. Like heat regulation, using feathers for display may be much earlier than flight. \"Confuciusornis\" is the fifth oldest bird fossil, about 25 million years after \"Archaeopteryx\". \nMost dinosaurs died out in the K/T extinction event, at the end of the Cretaceous. The only ones that survived were the birds. The birds, therefore, are not just the descendents of reptiles, but the descendents of theropod dinosaurs. Birds are the last surviving dinosaurs.\n\nThe pigments preserved in a 120 million year old fossil bird have been revealed using X-rays. A team scanned the beautifully preserved fossils of \"Gansus yumenensis\" and \"Confuciusornis sanctus\". Their study, published in the journal \"Science\", revealed the chemical fingerprint of pigments that once tinted the ancient bird's feathers. The trace metal copper is a marker for the dark pigment eumelanin. \"The X-ray technique was so sensitive that it was able to show that each molecule of copper it detected was being tugged and squashed into a particular shape because it was bound within a eumelanin molecule\".\n\nResearch of this kind has now been repeated several times.\n\nThis is an informal grouping of theropods closest related to birds. These groups are small dinosaurs. They definitely have pennaceous feathers (like birds), and therefore probably temperature regulation. One proposed classification is: \n\n\nThe earliest example of a dinobird is a troodont, \"Anchiornis huxlei\", from the Upper Jurassic. This specimen pre-dates \"Archaeopteryx\" by 5–10 million years, and predates any other feathered dinosaur from its location (Liaoning Province, China) by 25–35 million years. This species had long feathers on its hind limbs as well as fore limbs, and could glide, but probably not fly. \n\nAt least this clade of theropods had well-developed genuine feathers before the first known bird. Feathering in other groups of theropods is still uncertain. One compsognathid, \"Sinosauropteryx\", has plumaceous feathers, as does \"Shuvuuia\", another small theropod. Apparently, many small theropods carried feathers, whose function was thermoregulation (to keep warm).\n\nThere is now evidence that many early bird groups went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period (K/T extinction event). This is the same time that the other dinosaurs went extinct.\n\nResearchers dated the fossils to within 300,000 years of the boundary layer at the end of the Cretaceous.\n\nAll living birds are Neornithes, a subclass in traditional taxonomy. The Ornithurae is the natural group made up of modern birds and their extinct relatives. Their relatives include \"Ichthyornis\" and \"Hesperornis\", and some of the Chinese Cretaceous birds. They all have a plough-shaped pygostyle, a bone at the end of the tail which allows the tail feathers to fan and retract. Other groups of birds became extinct in the K/T extinction event.\n\n\"Gansus\" is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous, somewhere between 115 to 105 million years ago in what is now Gansu province, western China. It may be the oldest-known of the Ornithurae, depending how that group is defined. \n\nUnder any definition, all living birds, including taxa as diverse as ostriches, hummingbirds and eagles, are descended from basal ornithurans, many of which were semi-aquatic. It is now thought possible that all modern birds descended specifically from a semi-aquatic bird similar to \"Gansus\". Thus, while \"Gansus\" is not necessarily a direct ancestor of today's birds, it is closely related to such an ancestral species.\n\n", "id": "170258", "title": "Origin of birds"}

Gatorade is currently manufactured by PepsiCo, distributed in over 80 countries. The beverage was first developed in 1965 by researchers at the University of Florida, to replenish the combination of water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes that the school's student-athletes lost (in sweat) during rigorous athletic competitions. Its name was derived from the collective nickname of the university's athletic teams, \"the Gators\".\n\nOriginally produced and marketed by Stokely-Van Camp, the Gatorade brand was purchased by the Quaker Oats Company in 1983, who was bought out by PepsiCo in 2001. As of 2010, Gatorade is PepsiCo’s 4th-largest brand, on the basis of worldwide annual retail sales. It primarily competes with Coca-Cola's Powerade and Vitaminwater brands worldwide; plus, Lucozade Sport in the United Kingdom. Within the United States, Gatorade accounts for approximately 75 percent market share in the sports drink category.\n\nThere are many other flavours of Gatorade, including:\n\nGatorade is the official sports drink of NASCAR, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, USA Basketball, National Hockey League, Association of Volleyball Professionals, US Soccer Federation, Major League Soccer, and other professional and collegiate athletic organizations, providing supplies of the drinks to sponsored teams in some cases. Distribution was extended to include the U.K. in 2008, coinciding with an agreement designating Gatorade as the official sports drink of the Chelsea F.C. Gatorade's 1991 \"Be Like Mike\" ads featured Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, a North American basketball team which had just won its first National Basketball Association championship at the time. The ads began airing in August 1991 and the phrase \"Be Like Mike\" became household lingo in America. In more recent years, the Gatorade brand has continued to employ professional sports athletes in the promotion of its products. Primary endorsers in the 2000s have included Major League Baseball player Derek Jeter, National Hockey League player Sidney Crosby, National Basketball Association player Dwyane Wade, PGA Tour golfer Tiger Woods, and National Football League quarterback Peyton Manning. Gatorade is the official sports drink of 's home video affiliate, Viva Video, Inc.\n\nGatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations, most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports. The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower, originally called the \"Gatorade Dunk,\" where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an American football game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt, of the New York Giants, doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986-87. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports.\n\nGatorade has also achieved status as the cliché representative for sports drinks in American media, for example, in the film Clerks, the character Dante is at one point forced to give free Gatorade to his hockey teammates, and in the film \"The Waterboy\", Adam Sandler is told that \"the water sucks\" and that Gatorade is superior.\n\nGatorade\n", "id": "170403", "title": "Gatorade"}

Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points \"near\" another point, called a neighbourhood of the point. A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point. If one did not have the concept of open sets, one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way. If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as \"any\" set containing that point, it might just include that point and that point only, not any points near it, or points far away.\nWe also have the concept of \"closed sets\", which are complements of open sets. That is, all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set.\n\nOpen sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness. The union of any number of open sets must be open, and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed. (The second rule only works for a finite number of closed sets. That is because in many cases a set containing a single point is closed. Any set is made of points. If the second rule applied to an infinite number of closed sets, then \"every\" set would be closed.) As a special case, the set containing every point is both open and closed. The set containing no points is also both open and closed.\n\nA set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170677", "text": "Algorithm\n\nAn algorithm is a fancy to-do list for a computer. Algorithms take in zero or more inputs and give back one or more outputs.\n\nA recipe is a good example of an algorithm because it tells you what you need to do step by step. It takes inputs (ingredients) and produces an output (the completed dish).\n\nThe words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian mathematician called Al-Khwārizmī (Persian: خوارزمی‎‎, c. 780–850).\n\nInformally an algorithm can be called a \"list of steps\". This is nice, but it doesn't say much about algorithms.\n\nFormally, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that can be done by a Turing machine.\n\nAlgorithms can be written in regular English, but it takes a long time to do so. Instead, algorithms are written in pseudocode, flow charts, or programming languages. Algorithms are usually meant to be run by a computer.\n\nThere is usually more than one way to solve a problem. There may be many different recipes to make a certain dish which looks different but ends up tasting the same when all is said and done. The same is true for algorithms. However, some of these ways will be better than others. If a recipe needs lots of complicated ingredients that you do not have, it is not as a good as a simple recipe.\nWhen we look at algorithms as a way of solving problems, often we want to know how long it would take a computer to solve the problem using a particular algorithm. When we write algorithms, we like our algorithm to take the least amount of time so that we can solve our problem as quickly as possible.\n\nIn cooking, some recipes are more difficult to do than others, because they take more time to finish or have more things to keep track of.\nIt is the same for algorithms, and algorithms are better when they are easier for the computer to do. The thing that measures how\nhard an algorithm is called \"complexity\". When we ask how complex an algorithm is, often we want to know how long it will take a computer to solve the problem we want it to solve.\n\nThis is an example of an algorithm for sorting cards with colors on them into piles of the same color:\n\n\nThese are examples of algorithms for sorting a stack of cards with many different numbers, so that the numbers are in order.\n\nPlayers start with a stack of cards that have not been sorted.\nThis algorithm goes through the stack of cards, one card at a time. This card is compared to the next card in the stack. Please note that this position only changes in step 3. This algorithm is called bubble sort. It is slow.\n\n\nLet us take a stack of the cards with the numbers \"5 1 4 2 8\", and sort it from smallest number to biggest one using this algorithm. In each step, the algorithm compares the elements written in bold. The top of the stack of cards is on the left-hand side.\n\nFirst pass:\n( 5 1 4 2 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) Here, the algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps them.\n( 1 4 2 5 8 ) formula_1 ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) These elements are already in order, so the algorithm does not swap them.\nSecond pass:\nNow, the stack of cards is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know this. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.\nThird pass:\nFinally, the array is sorted, and the algorithm can stop.\n\nThis is an easy-to-understand algorithm for sorting. Computer scientists called it \"Bubble sort\", because smaller elements will rise to the top, changing their position in each run. Unfortunately, the algorithm is not very good, because it needs a long time (many passes through the stack of cards) to sort it.\n\nThis algorithm uses another idea. Sometimes solving a problem is difficult, but the problem can be changed so it is made of simpler problems that are easier to solve. This is called recursion. It is more difficult to understand than the first example, but it will give a better algorithm.\n\n\nThis works with two stacks of cards. One of them is called A, the other is called B. There is a third stack that is empty at the start, called C. At the end, it will contain the result.\n\nJohn von Neumann developed this algorithm in 1945. He did not call it \"Sorting by numbers\", he called it \"Mergesort\". It is a very good algorithm for sorting, compared to others.\n\nThe first algorithm takes much longer to sort the cards than the second, but it can be improved (made better). Looking at bubble sort, it can be noticed that cards with high numbers move from the top of the stack quite quickly, but cards with low numbers at the bottom of the stack take a long time to \"rise\" (move to the top).\nTo improve the first algorithm here is the idea:\n\n\nThis algorithm was developed by C. A. R. Hoare in 1960. It is one of most widely used algorithms for sorting today. It is called \"Quicksort\".\n\nIf players have cards with colors and numbers on them, they can sort them by color and number if they do the \"sorting by colors\" algorithm, then do the \"sorting by numbers\" algorithm to each colored stack, then put the stacks together.\n\nThe sorting-by-numbers algorithms are more difficult to do than the sorting-by-colors algorithm, because they may have to do the steps again many times. One would say that sorting by numbers is more \"complex\".\n\n\n", "id": "170677", "title": "Algorithm"}

He was also the first black person with an African background to come to Australia. He was the first bushranger to have a reward offered for his capture.\n\nCaesar was most likely born in Madagascar, in about 1763. He was a slave on a sugar plantation (farm) in the West Indies. He ran away and went to London. On 17 March 1786, he was in court at Deptford, Kent for stealing 240 shillings. He was sent to the new country called Australia as a convict for seven years. He left on the Alexander, a convict transport ship in the First Fleet, in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788.\n\nOn 29 April 1789 he was caught stealing food. Two weeks later he escaped into the bush, taking food, an iron cooking pot, and a musket (gun) taken from a sea army officer (Marine) named Abraham Hand. He could not catch enough animals to eat, and he began to steal food from the settlement. On 26 May he stole food from a brick making gang at Brickfield Hill and was nearly caught. On June 6 he tried to steal food from Zachariah Clark, who was the assistant in charge of the new colony's food supplies. Caesar was caught by a convict named William Saltmarsh.\nIn July 1789, David Collins, the colony's Judge-Advocate, said that John Caesar was the hardest working convict in the new colony. He said that he was a large man with a lot of muscles, but he was always hungry. He would eat food meant to last two days in one meal, and would then need to steal more food from others. All his thefts were about getting more food.\n\nAfter he was captured, Collins said Caesar was a \"wretch\" (a person) who did not care if he died. Caesar told Collins that he would make it if was hanged, he would turn into a joke by playing a trick on the executioner. Governor Arthur Phillip however, thought Caesar would be more use working and sent him to Garden Island, where he would work in with his legs tied with iron chain. He was well behaved and the chains were soon taken off.\n\nCaesar soon escaped again; on 22 December used a canoe to get off the island, taking a week's worth of food. He stole a musket, and lived by taking food from gardens and taking the food of Aboriginals after scaring them away with his gun. After he lost the gun at Rose Hill, and was attacked by the Aborigines, leaving him wounded in several places. He gave himself up on the 31 December to an officer at Rose Hill.\n\nOn 6 March 1790, Caesar was sent to Norfolk Island. There he had one daughter, later named Mary Ann Fisher Power, to Ann (e) Power. He was taken back to Sydney in 1793, and began stealing from the farms and huts again. He was caught and then flogged (hit 500 times with a whip). This did not make any difference; Caesar said that \"all that would not make him better.\"\n\nIn 1795 Black Caesar ran away for the last time, and formed a gang of runaways. On 29 January 1796, a reward of five gallons of rum was offered by Governor John Hunter for his capture. Every day there were reports of missing things, but he was able to avoid being captured until 15 February. A man named Wimbow, who had been searching for days, found him in an area of thick bush called Liberty Plains and shot him. He died soon after. \n\n", "id": "170678", "title": "John Caesar"}

In the 1500's, soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus, called a musket, supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen. By the start of 1700's, a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus. When the bayonet was added, there was no longer a need for pikemen, and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers. The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800's, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the \"rifled musket\" gave way to the rifle, and \"muskets\" were no longer used.\n\nMusket calibres ranged from to . A smoothbore musket, firing at a single target, was only accurate to about to . Rifled muskets in the 1850's were much better, able to hit a man sized target at up to .

The neutral antimatter they are working to trap is antihydrogen. This is the antimatter version of hydrogen, the first atom in the periodic table. Antihydrogen, like hydrogen, has two oppositely charged particles. Hydrogen has a proton and an electron, and so antihydrogen would have an antiproton and a positron. A positron is the common name for the antielectron.\n\nThe ALPHA collaboration has its experiment at CERN in Geneva in Switzerland. CERN is the only place in the world that can provide \"slow\" antiprotons that can be easily captured by ALPHA. ALPHA then brings these antiprotons into contact with positrons and form antihydrogen. \n\nAntihydrogen has, like many atoms and especially hydrogen, a small magnetic dipole moment. A dipole moment is another way of saying that the atom behaves a bit as if it was a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole. Normally such small magnets are attracted to other magnets. However, some atoms in some states behave such that they are repelled by magnetic fields. This means that the atoms could possibly be trapped in space by making a minimum of the magnetic field. ALPHA is trying to do just that with antihydrogen. By a clever arrangement of magnets, ALPHA has a so-called magnetic minimum trap, in which antihydrogen may be trapped. \n\nThis is a difficult process. The magnetic forces on these atoms are quite weak, so the trap can only contain antihydrogen atoms of very low motional (kinetic) energy, that is at very low temperature. The current state-of-the-art ALPHA trap can contain antihydrogen atoms in their ground state if they are colder than about 0.5 Kelvin (i.e. 0.5 degrees above absolute zero). ALPHA is currently working on making such cold antihydrogen.\n", "id": "170684", "title": "ALPHA Collaboration"}

The \"key\" part of the meaning–what someone needs to unlock the real story–changes from book to book. For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person. For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author.\n\nAuthors usually write these types of stories (instead of telling the whole truth) to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved can't sue them. A couple of movies that are written like this are Citizen Kane (a movie about a man a lot like William Randolph Hearst) and Dreamgirls (a movie about a Motown group a lot like The Supremes).\n\nBecause it comes from French, the plural of roman à clef is \"romans à clef\".\n", "id": "170721", "title": "Roman à clef"}

In the 780s Egbert was forced into exile by Offa of Mercia and Beorhtric of Wessex, but on Beorhtric's death in 802 Egbert returned and took the throne. He was the father of Athelwulf of Wessex.\n\nEgbert was the son of Ealhmund, King of Kent. He was descended from Ingeld, brother of Ine of Wessex. In 786 he made a bid for the throne of Wessex after the death of Cynewulf. Offa of Mercia however, made Beorhtric king instead. As a youth Egbert was seen as a problem for Beorhtric. He didn't want Egbert in England. While Beorhtric was negotiating to marry Offa's daughter he asked that Egbert be handed over to him. While Offa was considering doing just that, Egbert fled Mercia and at some point left England. He appears to have been welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. This is at the time Frankish ports were closed to English ships and trading. Offa had offended Charlemagne by his son marry one of Charlemagne's daughters. While at the Frankish court Egbert married a noblewoman, Redburga. She was possibly a close relative of Charlemagne. Egbert and Redburga had a son born in Francia, Athelwulf, about 795. In 802 Beorhtric died. Egbert returned to become King of Wessex, probably with military aid from Charlemagne.\n\nHis first few years as king are not well recorded. It is very probable that he used this time to reorganize his army and his administration. Egbert formed an alliance with Wulfred, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. In 825 the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, invaded Wessex. Beornwulf had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex. In what Frank Stenton called \"one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history\" Egbert defeated Beornwulf. This was the end of the Mercian kings dominating England. Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Essex was later lost to the Danes. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.\n\nEgbert then defeated all of Mercia in 829. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London. In 830 Wiglaf returned to power in Mercia, but the gains of Kent and southwest England remained with Wessex. Egbert died 4 February 839. He left a territory larger than any other Wessex king since Ine. He was the \"bretwalda\" or overlord of Anglo-Saxon England until Wiglaf returned in 830. Even so, he remained the most powerful king during his time.\n\nTogether he and Redburga had:\n\n\n", "id": "170812", "title": "Egbert of Wessex"}

He was the first of a of kings who ruled Scotland for over two centuries.\n\nMalcolm was born in 1031, the son of king Duncan I of Scotland and his wife; a cousin of Siward, Earl of Northumberland. When his father was killed in 1040 Malcolm did not succeed to the throne. At the time the system alternated between different lines of the same royal family. So the king chosen from a different royal line was Macbeth, who had killed Duncan I in battle. Malcolm killed Macbeth in battle in 1057, but Lulach, MacBeth's stepson was selected as king. This broke the pattern of alternate selection. Lulach ruled only ruled a few months until he was killed. Malcolm finally succeeded Lulach and changed the succession to his own sons and their descendants. This made Scotland like other European countries in keeping the same dynasty on the throne.\n\nMalcolm was in his late twenties when he finally became king. Malcolm would lead a total of five raids into England starting in 1061. The Norman Conquest of England caused many to leave England. Malcolm welcomed several into Scotland. These included Edgar Atheling, his sisters Margaret and Christina as well as their mother. Raised at the court of St. Stephen of Hungary she was beautiful, wise, and very religious. Malcolm was at once taken with her and asked her to marry him. She refused as she and her sister were destined to be . But after a time she finally accepted. By his marriage to Margaret he gained an interest in the English throne. \n\nEdgar Atheling joined the uprising in the North of England in 1069 but it failed and William the Conqueror sacked York as punishment. Malcolm joined in but too late as Edgar left England on a Danish ship. Malcolm had long claimed Cumbria and Northumberland and made another raid on Bamburgh. He took so many captives that it was said there was an English slave in every house in Scotland. In 1071 William came north with a large army. He came as far as Abernethy but Malcolm wanted peace. William agreed to give him twelve English manors and pay a yearly fee. Malcolm had to give his son Malcolm as a hostage but this made him a vassal of the English king. \n\nEdgar Atheling returned to Scotland the next year. He had been offered land on the border near Normandy by the French king. Malcolm told him to take it and settle down. He then gave Edgar gold and silver and sent him off to live in France. But Edgar soon returned having been shipwrecked on his journey. This time Malcolm advised him to make peace with king William of England. Edgar did and received a castle as a residence in England. In 1079 William and his son Robert were fighting in Normandy. Malcolm raided into England again being welcomed in Northumberland. But William sent his brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux north to punish Northumberland and Robert to raid into Scotland. Once more Robert and Malcolm settled their differences and were at peace again. In 1092, during the reign of William Rufus Malcolm raided England yet again. Peace was again renewed with William Rufus. But William failed in one of his promises to Malcolm, so in 1093 the Scots invaded England again. This time Malcolm III died while fighting at Alnwick Castle. His son Edward died there also. Margaret, his queen died of grief after hearing the news of the death of her husband and their son.\n\nAbout 1059 he married Ingibjorg, the widow of Thorfinn Sigurdson, Earl of Orkney.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171103", "text": "Steve Hart\n\nSteve Hart (1860 – June 28, 1880) was an Australian bushranger and a member of the Kelly Gang. A close friend of Ned Kelly's brother, Dan Kelly, Hart was caught up in the murder of three policemen at Stringybark Creek. He was killed during the siege at Glenrowan, Victoria.\n\nHart was born at Three Mile Creek, near Wangaratta, Victoria, in 1859. His parents, Richard Hart and Bridget Young had come from Ireland. They had other children, Richard 'Dick' Hart (Jr.), Hugh Hart, Thomas Hart, Nicholas Hart, Esther 'Ettie' Hart, Jane Hart and Winifred Hart.\n\nHart was a small man, and a very good horse rider. His brother Nicholas was a jockey. One story says Steve worked as a jockey around Beechworth and Wangaratta, and won 'The Benalla Handicap' after a protest was upheld. He did not open farm gates, and always jumped them with his horse.\n\nIn 1877, Hart was sent to Beechworth Gaol for 12 months for stealing 13 horses. He met Dan Kelly while in prison. When he was let out of gaol he went to Bullock Creek to look for gold with Dan Kelly. He is reported to have said here's to \"...a short life, and a merry one.\" He was at Bullock Creek while Dan and Ned Kelly were in hiding from the police. The gang, which on that day included Joe Byrne, heard gun shots and discovered a police search party camped nearby at Stringybark Creek. The next day the gang went to the camp to take the policemen's guns. Three policemen were killed and the gang were made outlaws, which meant that they could be captured dead or alive for a reward. At this time the police did not know Hart was a member of the gang. As a member of the Kelly Gang he often rode around in women's clothes to avoid being caught. During the search for the Kelly Gang, the police were told to stop women riders to see if they were really women. The stories of how Ned's sister, Kate Kelly, did things to help the gang, were probably really about Steve Hart.\n\nHart took part in the bank robberies at Euroa and Jerilderie. At Euroa he met an old school friend of his, Francis 'Fanny' Shaw (sometimes known as Maggie Shaw) and through her, the police found out his name. Hart also stole a watch from Robert Scott, the bank manager. When a bank worker, Bob Booth, asked him for something to remember the visit by, Hart gave him a lead bullet carved with the letter 'H'.\n\nAt Jerilderie in 1879, the Kelly gang held many people hostage in the Royal Hotel before robbing the bank. Hart stole a watch from Reverend Gribble, a parson at the Protestant church. Ned told Hart he was a common thief and made him give the watch back. After Jerilderie, Hart went into hiding with the gang for most of 1879, although Hart did go to a St.Kilda doctor to be treated for a foot problem.\n\nIn June 1880 Ned Kelly came up with a plan to get his mother released from prison. Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Beechworth and killed their friend Aaron Sherritt who they thought was a police spy. They knew this would bring many police by train to Beechworth to capture them. In the meantime Hart and Ned Kelly had gone to Glenrowan and forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They hoped the police train would crash, and then wearing home made armour they would capture the surviving policemen. These would be held as hostages until Ellen Kelly was set free.\n\nHart and Kelly forced many people of the town into a small hotel owned by Ann Jones. They were joined by Dan Kelly and Byrne who had ridden quickly across country from Beechworth. They waited at the hotel for the police. The plan failed when news of the Sherritt murder took a long time to reach Melbourne. The people kept at the hotel were becoming difficult to keep under control. Ned Kelly let one man go free at 3.00am, the school teacher Thomas Curnow, who said he had to get home to his wife. Instead he went to the train line and was able to stop the police train safely. The police went to the hotel and began shooting. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired. Joe Byrne was shot dead in the front room of the hotel. Ned Kelly left the hotel in the early morning, probably to meet with other men who were going to help him capture the train. He was captured by the police.\n\nAt 10.00am the police were forced to stop shooting to allow some of the hostages to escape. Several, including the hotel owner's son had been shot dead. Dan Kelly's sister, Maggie Skillion, and a Catholic priest Father Gibney tried to go to the hotel to tell Steve and Dan to give themselves up, but were stopped by the police. The police wanted a cannon to be sent from Nelbourne so they could blast the two men out. At 2.30pm the police set the hotel on fire, and Father Gibney rushed inside. Gibney saw the bodies of Hart and Dan Kelly lying side by side in a room at the back of the hotel, with their heads resting on blankets. They had removed the armour which was placed beside them. It is most likely they had killed themselves.\n\nThe bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart. Hart's body, little more than a blackened stump, was taken by his brother, Dick Hart, and buried at Greta Cemetery the following day, 29 June 1880, in the same grave as Dan Kelly. He was 21 years old. After the grave was filled in, the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the grave hidden. The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies. Hart's armour is now on display at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne.\n\nOver the years there have been claims that Hart and Dan Kelly did not die at the hotel, but escaped and went to live in Queensland. A man named Billy Meade, as he was dying in 1938, told a nurse he was really Hart. Another story says Hart and Dan Kelly went to South Africa. After serving in the Second Boer War; also called the South African War, they went to India, where Hart is said to have drowned himself in Calcutta in 1917. There is no evidence to prove these stories.\n\n", "id": "171103", "title": "Steve Hart"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171216", "text": "Psalm 151\n\nPsalm 151 is a short psalm that is controversial because it is in some versions of the Bible but not others. In particular, it is in several very old Greek translations of the Bible but is not in the Hebrew Bible. There has been a lot of debate over whether or not the psalm should be considered part of the Bible.\n\nThe psalm has been known about for a long time and the Greek version was used for study for hundreds of years. When the Dead Sea Scrolls (which are in Hebrew) were found and translated, part of Psalm 151 was in them. This surprised the researchers very much, but not as much as what they would find later on.\n\nAfter studying the scrolls, they noticed that the Greek translator had actually made a mistake. Two different pieces of two different psalms were treated like they were one big psalm when they were not. There is a big change in the Greek version after the fifth line (where the second psalm fragment would begin) and is a lot more like a story than most of the other psalms, which are more like poems.\n\nThe Greek version of the psalm says that it was written by King David after his battle with Goliath. It talks about how, even though David was the least of all his brothers, God chose him to be king. It then talks about how David cut off Goliath's head with Goliath's own sword after killing him with his slingshot.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church accepts Psalm 151 as part of the Bible, but Roman Catholics, most Protestants, and most Jews do not. However, it can be found in some Catholic Bibles and in certain other Bible translations like the New Revised Standard Version. \n", "id": "171216", "title": "Psalm 151"}

Kate was their seventh child. The family moved to Avenel soon after her birth, where another child, Grace, was born. John Kelly died of dropsy when Kate was four years old. Ellen Kelly then moved the family to her sister's house at Greta. One year later, the family moved again, to a two-room hut on their own land at Eleven Mile Creek. Kate helped her mother bring up the family, which included three more children by Ellen's second husband, George King.\n\nThe Kellys had already had a long history of trouble with the police. Alexander Fitzpatrick, a young policeman, went to the house on 15 April 1878. He was drunk, and said he wanted to arrest Dan Kelly for horse stealing. He sexually assaulted Kate, and her family tried to help her. Historians can not agree on what really happened next.\n\nFitzpatrick went back to Benalla Police Station and said that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with shovel. He also said that Dan Kelly had hit him, and Ned Kelly had tried to shoot him. William Skillion, Kate's brother-in-law, and William Williamson a neighbour of the Kellys, were also said to have hurt him. Ned Kelly said that he was not at the house, but working on a farm 400 miles away, though most historians believe he was at the house with Joe Byrne.\n\nEllen Kelly was sent to prison for three years for trying to kill Fitzpatrick; Williamson and Skillion were sent for six year. Ned and Dan Kelly hid at Bullock Creek, in the Wombat Ranges, so the police could not find them. On the 25 October 1878, at Stringybark Creek, they met four policemen who had been sent to arrest them. Three of the policemen were killed. Ned, Dan, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws, and turned to bank robbery.\n\nWith their mother in prison, and their brothers being hunted by the police, Kate Kelly and her sister Margaret looked after the younger children. Kate also helped trick the police, leading the police away when they got close to her brothers. She supplied the Kelly Gang with food, ammunition, and news about the police hunt. The folk song, \"Ye Sons of Australia\" has a part about Kate helping the Kelly Gang; \n\nThe song places Kate Kelly at the siege at Glenrowan;\n\nHistorians now think that many of the actions thought to have been carried out by Kate, was really gang member Steve Hart in a dress.\n\nFollowing Ned's arrest, Kate would often visit him in prison, as well as raising money for legal costs. She got people to sign petitions asking for mercy for Ned. Kate begged on her knees in front of the Governor, His Excellency the Marquis of Normanby, to save her brother's life. Ned was hanged on 11 November 1880.\n\nOn the night of the hanging, Kate and her brother Jim Kelly, went on stage at the Appollo Hall in Melbourne. People paid one shilling to see them sitting on the stage. Kate and Jim went to Sydney and continued to appear on stage, with Jim riding Ned Kelly's horse. The police stopped the shows. She was seen performing as \"Ada\" in a Sydney \"Wild West Show\", and then in Adelaide under the names Ada Hennessey and Kate Ambrose. She stopped performing due to ill health. She worked for a short time at \"Hill Scott's Hotel\" in Adelaide, before her poor health forced her to return home to Greta. She worked as a servant in Wangaratta, and a maid in Lanceby. \n\nOn 25 November 1888, she married William Henry Foster, a blacksmith, and lived in the town of Forbes. They had six children, though three died when they were still babies.\n\nOn 6 October 1898, Kate was reported missing. She was found drowned eight days later, in a swamp near Forbes. Some historians think that she may have taken her own life because she had depression, brought on by the death of her sister, Maggie, two years earlier. She was buried in the Forbes Cemetery, aged 36.\n\nAfter her death, her three children, Frederick Arthur, Gertrude Eileen Ada, and Ethel Maude, went to live with Ellen Kelly at Eleven Mile Creek. Frederick Arthur became a beekeeper in the town of Myrrhee and died in World War I. Gertrude married Arthur Cavanagh, a builder. They lived in Wangaratta and looked after Ellen Kelly in her old age. Ethel married Albert Hibbert, and also looked after Ellen Kelly.\n\n", "id": "171224", "title": "Kate Kelly"}

Scientists are confident that almost all galaxies, including the Milky Way, have supermassive black holes at their centers.\n\nHow supermassive black holes get started is not yet known. Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is in place in the center of a galaxy, it can grow by attracting matter and by merging with other black holes. Formation of ordinary (star-sized) black holes from the deaths of the first stars has been extensively studied and supported by observations. \n\nHowever, there appears to be a gap between stellar-mass black holes, and supermassive black holes.\n\nStellar-mass black holes, formed from collapsing stars, range up to perhaps 33 solar masses. The minimal supermassive black hole is in the range of a hundred thousand solar masses. Between these extremes there appears to be few intermediate-mass black holes. Such a gap would suggest that the two types were formed by different processes. \n\nObservations show that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger. Supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.\n\nAstronomers are confident that our own Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is 26,000 light-years from the Solar System, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. The region is called Sagittarius A*, and the evidence for its being a black hole is:\nThe Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and the UCLA Galactic Center Group, have provided strong evidence that Sagittarius A* is the site of a supermassive black hole. This is based on data from the ESO, and the Keck telescope. Our galactic central black hole is calculated to have a mass of approximately 4.1 million solar masses, or about 8.2 × 10 kg.\n", "id": "171231", "title": "Supermassive black hole"}

Imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness. The event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball. The space between the ball and the larger bubble would be the event horizon. If an object goes past the event horizon, it can never get away from it. Light that is emitted from the side of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side. If an observer saw an object fall into a black hole, it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever. The reason this happens is because of the gravity of the black hole slows down time around it, making it look like the object will take an infinite amount of time to reach it.\n\n", "id": "171232", "title": "Event horizon"}

Convicts who were well-behaved were given a ticket of leave. This gave them some rights, and they did not have to stay in gaol. With a ticket of leave, a convict was able to look for work in a particular area but could not leave the area without permission from a court. Every change of employer or district was written on the ticket.\n\nGovernor Philip Gidley King started the tickets of leave in 1801. It gave prisoners a reason to behave themselves. Also, it helped to provide cheap workers for farmers who were settling in Australia. The government saved money as it did not have to feed and clothe the prisoners.\n\nThose with a ticket of leave were able to marry or to bring their families from Britain. They could buy land but not carry guns or get onto a ship. They were often made to pay back the cost of their travel in the prison ship to Australia. The ticket of leave had to be renewed every year, and those with one had to attend (where it could be checked they were still living in the area), and church services. Prisoners could lose their ticket and be sent back to prison if they were lazy, if they tried to get paid too much, or if they were rude to the police or soldiers. Sometimes, prisoners who helped the government, by capturing escaped convicts for example, might be given a ticket of leave as a reward.\n\nA convict who kept to the conditions of his ticket of leave was given a conditional pardon after half of the time he was supposed to be in gaol. Then, they were no longer a convict and could do everything except leave the colony. Convicts who did not keep to the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warning, go to court without being able to appeal, and lose all their property.\n\nThe ticket itself was a highly detailed document. It listed the convicts' number, the name, the ship in which sent to Australia, the year that they arrived, the captain of the ship, where they came from, their job, the crimes,the place and date of trial, the sentence, the birth date, what they looked like, the area the prisoner was allowed to live in, the court that gave out the ticket, the date the ticket was given, any other conditions of the ticket, and any changes of where they lived. A lot of this information has been kept, which makes them a very important source of information for people looking at family history.\n\n", "id": "171483", "title": "Ticket of leave"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171567", "text": "Anal fissure\n\nAn anal fissure, or fissura ani, is a fissure (a small wound) in the skin around the anus. The symptoms are a sharp pain around the anus during defecation (for example, using a toilet) or by touching it, for example, while taking a shower. The small wound can sometimes bleed a little bit during or after defecation.\n\nIt's not completely clear what causes an anal fissure. It is possibly caused by constipation, too much strain on the anal sphincter (the circular muscle of the anus), reduced blood circulation, the skin is not made dry enough after taking a shower or swimming, the skin has been stretched too much, pregnancy, giving birth, and not changing a baby's diper in time. \n\nAfter the anal fissure closes, it takes 6 weeks to 3 months before the wound is healed completely. In this period the fissure easily opens again. Therefore, the wound can return repeatedly. \n\nA doctor can prescribe several products to treat the anal fissure. For example, a pain relieving ointment or suppository (an anal pill); a laxative (making it easier to go to the toilet); zinc-ointment (this will protect the skin and contract it, so it will heal faster). Further more a doctor can give advice about taking care of the wound and improve digestion and defecation.\n\nIf an anal fissure has become chronic and will not go away, medical surgery can be a solution. The circular muscle of the anus can be cut or stretched. Also an injection with botox can have a positive result.\n\nThe anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing, for example during defecation. The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return. The advice includes the following tips.\n\nAs long as the fissure is open (a painful, small wound next to the anus which can bleed a little) the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide (protects and contracts) and pramocaïne (relieves pain and itching) on and around the fissure (in Europe available without prescription as Nestosyl). Use toilet paper or tissue paper to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap. This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again.\n\nBesides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation. The longer the faeces is in the intestine, the more liquid will be withdrawal. Because of this, the faeces will become harder and get more volume, and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again. Patients are advized to eat fibres every day (for example: unpolished rice, muesli, whole grain bread, dried apricots, figs, dates, prunes, saltless nuts, beans, peas, etc.); to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day; to use a little bit of butter or oil every day; to drink enough during the day; and to exercise every day. The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation (possible: white bread, white pasta/pizza/noodles, eggs, cheese, sugar, coffee, chocolate, etc.). If necessary, one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread.\n\nPatients should not postpone going to the toilet. While waiting, the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus, which causes a pressure. Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while. When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet, the best thing is to go immediately. While sitting on the toilet, the patient has to press as little as possible, but instead relax the circular muscle.\n\nAs long as the wound is not healed, taking a daily bath with soda (sodium carbonate) can give relief. Further more that will keep the wound clean.\n\nIt's very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed. The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily.\n\nSome patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus. For example, olive oil or sunflower oil. The skin softens and will not tear or crack as easily. Always remind hygiene.\n\nIf the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open, the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation. The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again. An easy solution to solve this problem is the use of baby ointment (zinc oxide ointment) that is used for a baby's red bottom. Put this, using toilet paper or tissue paper, before defecation around the anus. The skin will be more protected by wiping the anus and the fissure will not open again so easily. If necessary, the baby ointment can be applied again afterward. Furthermore, one can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper.\n\nBy following all mentioned tips and advice, always follow the normal principles of hygiene. Use toilet paper or tissue paper and wash the hands afterward.\n\nThese recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure. If there is any doubt, especially when there is blood in the faeces, please consult a doctor.\n", "id": "171567", "title": "Anal fissure"}

Seeds spread by water or birds and other animals. They can live for up to 50 years lying dormant in droughts.\n\nRushes is a basic food of many animal diets. They are also used as bedding and nesting material for many different types of birds and mammals. Rushes have been used throughout history by humans for various purposes such as weaving matts, medicine and animal feed.

It shows how light has both a wave nature or characteristic and a particle nature or characteristic, and that these natures are inseparable. So light is said to have a dual wave-particle nature. The same is true of electrons and other quantum particles.\n\nThis experiment is very simple. It requires only a double slit device like the one in the picture, something to hold the double slit device still, and a good laser such as the kind that is used by workmen to \"draw\" straight lines when they are building. The laser is supported so it can only be moved on purpose. It is aimed at the center point between the two slits from a point about one half meter away. Something like a movie screen or a smooth white wall is put up on the other side of the double slit device several meters away. When everything is fixed, a pattern of light and dark bands will show up.\nLasers are devices that will produce one or more photons when given a certain amount of electricity. The photon or photons come out of a very small hole within a well known period of time. The speed of light is known, so the time the photons appear on the screen can be predicted. When photons are produced one at a time, what shows up on the screen are individual spots of light. If photons were waves then we would expect them to spread out as they travel and wash across a wide area of the screen, but that never happens. If photons were particles then we would expect them to appear at two points on the screen connected to the laser through the two slits in the middle. But that is not what happens either. When Thomas Young first did this experiment, he could only understand it by imagining light to be like waves of water. He thought that light waves moved out from the light source like waves spreading out from a pebble dropped into a pond, and that when the wave fronts hit the double slits, then the original wave gets through at the two slits and there are two different waves from then on. It was easy to figure out how two waves would interact to produce the bright bands and dark bands (often called \"fringes\") on the screen.\n\nBut there were big problems. Light did not show up at the screen as waves that washed across it. Light came to be understood as swarms of photons that individually hit the detection screen. And, very surprisingly, a single photon could interfere with itself as though it were a single wave that fit the old wave description. It split into two waves at the double-slit device, and they then combined at the screen.\n\nThe double-slit experiment became a classic thought experiment for its clear explanation of the central puzzles of quantum mechanics.\n\nThe double-slit experiment has been of great interest to philosophers, because the quantum mechanical behavior it shows has forced them to rethink their ideas about classical concepts such as:\n\nExperience in the micro world of sub-atomic particles forces us to re-conceptualize some of our most ordinary ideas.\n\nMoving picture showing how one series of waves hits a double slit and produces two series of waves that interfere with each other.\n\n", "id": "171748", "title": "Young's double-slit experiment"}

His father was an organist and organ builder, and gave young Alexandre lessons. Otherwise Alexandre was largely self-taught. He did study with Belgian teacher Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, but by that time he was already a very good organist. From the 1860s he travelled widely in Europe, playing organs and becoming famous. Later he also visited the United States. In 1871 he became organist of the Trinité church in Paris. He kept this job until 1901.\n\nGuilmant became well known in France as a teacher. Together with two other musicians, Charles Bordes and Vincent d’Indy, he started the Schola Cantorum, a private college where students could study music. He taught the organ there.

His Conservatoire pupils included Joseph Bonnet, Nadia Boulanger and Marcel Dupré.\n\nGuilmant did not just play the organ for church services. He became very famous for giving organ recitals. Often he played on organs which had been constructed by the brilliant organ builder Aristide Cavaillé-Coll. He helped to make these organs popular in France, and they were a very important influence on the way that organists composed music for their instrument. \n\nBoth Guilmant and Widor produced large works for the organ which they called “symphonies”. These usually had at least four movements each, and gave the player opportunities to use many different sound effects. \n\nGuilmant wrote eight organ symphonies, as well as a symphony for organ and orchestra, and several shorter works for the same combination. He composed a great many miniatures, not just for organ but also for harmonium. This was useful for musicians in smaller churches which had a harmonium instead of a big organ.

The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War. Gettysburg is often called the war's turning point. Union Major General George G. Meade's Army of the Potomac stopped attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This ended Lee's second invasion of the North. Lee began to move his men back to Virginia on July 4. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle. That November, a cemetery for those who died there was opened at the Gettysburg National Cemetery. President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech called the Gettysburg Address at the ceremony to open the cemetery and honor the dead soldiers on both sides.\n\nLee's army won an important battle at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863. Afterwards, he led his army north through the Shenandoah Valley. His plan was to start his second invasion of the North (called the Gettysburg Campaign). Lee had several objectives in mind. Lee hoped to force Northern politicians to give up the war by going as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital. This, he hoped, would embarrass the Lincoln administration. At this point, Lee was playing politics. He knew that if he was successful in Pennsylvania it would encourage the Northern peace movement. He hoped it would get foreign recognition for the Confederacy. It could also force the Union to negotiate for peace, allowing the Confederate states to become an independent country. Lee badly needed supplies and intended to get them in Pennsylvania. In addition to being the state capital, Harrisburg was also the site of Camp Curtin, the largest training camp for Union soldiers. It was a major railroad center. More importantly it was a major supply depot and also a prisoner of war camp. \n\nHarrisburg, not Gettysburg, was Lee's intended target. \n\nIn the North, Lincoln told Major General Joseph Hooker to have the Union army follow Lee's army. But Hooker was very reluctant to go after the Confederates. Finally, Lincoln lost all confidence in him. On June 28, three days before the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln appointed General Meade to replace Hooker.\n\nNeither Lee nor Meade intended a battle take place at Gettysburg and neither were there when the battle started. On June 30, 1863, Confederate General Henry Heth had a division at Cashtown, Pennsylvania, Lee's gathering place before moving on to Harrisburg. Heth sent his division to nearby Gettysburg to look for, as he later wrote in his report, \"army supplies (shoes especially), and return the same day.\" This started the myth that the Battle of Gettysburg started over shoes. Heth did this without scouting ahead to see what was at Gettysburg. The job of scouting belonged to the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stuart. But they had been gone for over a week. So, blind to what was ahead of them, his soldiers ran directly into a Union cavalry division commanded by General John Buford. This started the fighting even though Heth and other commanders were under orders from Lee not to start a battle. But, as each side brought in more troops, it became a full-scale battle. Lee started moving much of his army there. One of his goals was to fight the Union army and destroy it. Now, he would have to do it at Gettysburg.\n\nAbout 5.30 a.m. on the morning of July 1, the battle started. Heth probed ahead cautiously to a point about two miles west of Gettysburg. Buford's cavalry was deliberately slowing his progress. At about 10 a.m. the Union I Corps arrived commanded by General John F. Reynolds. They set themselves up along McPherson's Ridge to oppose Heth's Confederates. During the fighting Reynolds were killed but the Confederates were driven back. Meanwhile both sides brought up reinforcements. The Union set up defenses of the town with I Corps defending the western approaches with XI Corps to the north. The flanks were covered by Buford's cavalry. One Union division was held in reserve on Cemetery Ridge. In the afternoon, when Lee arrived, the Confederates still did not know the strength of the Union forces they were facing. They also had not scouted the terrain. One division of Ewell's Corps had attacked the Union I Corps just after noon. At about 2 p.m. Heth's division joined Ewell's troops in the attack on I Corps. At about 3 p.m., another of Ewell's Confederate divisions, commanded by General Jubal Early, attacked the flank of the Union XI Corps. By 4 p.m., both of the Union corps retreated through Gettysburg and took up positions on Cemetery Ridge. So far, the Union had lost about 9,000 men including about 3,000 who had been captured. The Confederates had lost about 6,500 men by this point. So the first day of battle was technically a Confederate victory numbers-wise. But Federal troops held the high ground as more reinforcements were still arriving. Based on the first day's fighting, Lee was convinced he could defeat Meade at Gettysburg.\n\nLate in the day, Lee sent the famous order to Confederate General Richard S. Ewell to take cemetery ridge “if practicable.” While he had been awaiting orders from Lee, Ewell had ridden out to take a closer look at Cemetery Ridge. Based on what he saw and the confusing order, he decided it was not practicable to take the hill and set up camp. Instead, he decided to leave the assault for the next day. This was the first major mistake of the battle for South. The Army of the Potomac would end the day with around 21,900 men strongly positioned on Culp’s Hill and Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia would have around 27,000 men from Benner’s Hill to Seminary Ridge.\n\nOn the second day of battle, most of both armies had arrived. The Union line held the high ground in a defensive formation that looked like a fishhook. On July 2, Lee ordered General James Longstreet, commander of the Confederate I Corps, to attack the Union left flank as early in the day as possible. At the same time General A. P. Hill’s corps was to attack the Union center. General Ewell was to make diversionary attacks and \"if practicable\" attack the Union Army's right flank. Lee felt that if everything went according to his plan and the Union line was destroyed, the battle, and possibly the war, would be won on the second day. Lee's coordinated attack required getting all the infantry into position and moving up artillery to support them. Longstreet had the furthest to go and midway in their march realized the Union lines could see them. They went back and had to take a different route. Longstreet could not get his corps into position until about 4 p.m. when he began his attack. His attack on the Union line lasted for over three hours but could not break the Union line. Hill's Corps failed to be effective in the center. Ewell did not attack Cemetery Ridge as instructed in Lee's confusing order, but made some progress in taking Culp's Hill. \n\nUnion Major General Daniel Sickles, a political general commanding III Corps, disobeyed Meade's orders and moved his troops forward to the Peach Orchard. He had been ordered to take up a position on Little Round Top connecting with Union forces on both his right and left. By doing this he left a large hole in the Union line. He marched to a position nearly in front of the Union line with no support on either side. Within an hour, his entire III Corps was nearly wiped out by Longstreet. Sickles was badly wounded by a cannonball and lost a leg. Being wounded was all that saved him from a court-martial. Sickles' blunder nearly lost the entire battle for the Union.\n\nOn the night of July 2, Longstreet’s largest division commanded by General George Pickett arrived and was placed in the center of the Confederate line. Lee’s plan for the next day was to attack on both the Union right and left, just as he had done the day before. Lee was still certain he could break the Union line and win the battle. That day Stuart's cavalry had caught up with Lee's army and Lee ordered Stuart to ride around the East side of Gettysburg and attack the Union rear. Ewell had also been reinforced and was ordered to take Culp's Hill the next morning.\n\nMeade ordered the Union XII Corps to drive Ewell's forces off the captured trenches on Culp's Hill. They were to move at daylight the next morning. He was determined the remainder of the Union Army would hold its position and wait for Lee to attack.\n\nEwell began fighting on Culp's Hill at first light. Lee rode to Longstreet's headquarters only to find Longstreet had misunderstood his orders. He was planning a turning movement against the Union left. Now, with no hope of a coordinated attack, Lee changed the plan. Longstreet was to attack the Union center on Cemetery Ridge. Ewell's forces failed in their counterattacks and were forced to withdraw from Culp's Hill by about 11:00 a.m. Lee pinned all his hopes on Longstreet's attack on the center. Longstreet had the last fresh division in Lee's army. It was made up of three brigades, commanded by generals James L. Kemper, Richard B. Garnett, and Lewis A. Armistead, led by Pickett. \n\nFirst, a bombardment by about 140 Confederate cannons on the Union lines was ordered. The bombardment started about 1 p.m. About 80 Union cannons returned fire. The cannons duel lasted for between one and two hours, depending on the source (most say about an hour). The Confederate artillery chief, General Edward Porter Alexander, had only intended it to last for about 25 minutes. But he then realized it had done little damage to the Union line so he continued. But he also had to worry about running out of ammunition and not have enough to support the charge that was Pickett was about to make. When the Union guns fell silent, Porter thought he had knocked them out. But it was a trick by the Union artillery chief. His guns were waiting for the charge the Union forces knew was coming. Alexander sent word to Pickett he could start his attack.\n\nThe cannonade could be heard as far away as Philadelphia. The noise was so loud the gunner's ears bled. It was probably the loudest noise that had ever been heard on the North American continent up to that time. In the end the Confederate cannons may have killed as many as 200 Union soldiers in the area that would later become known as the \"bloody angle\". But the Union guns may have killed more Confederate troops.\n\nCalling the Confederate attack on the Union center \"Pickett's Charge\" is misleading for two reasons. First, Pickett commanded only one of the three units in the assault. The other two were commanded by Major General Isaac R. Trimble and Brigadier General J. Johnston Pettigrew. Secondly, it was not a charge, which is a rapid advance towards the enemy, it was an attack which moved forward more slowly and over a longer distance. These Virginia units were joined by several smaller units of Confederates (some from North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama) whose numbers had been reduced by the fighting over the first two days. When the cannons stopped, Pickett went to Longstreet to ask permission to begin the attack. Longstreet, sure the attack would fail, silently nodded his head and gave a wave of his hand. Longstreet had tried to get Lee to call off the attack, but Lee would not listen.\n\nOver 12,000 Confederates stepped from the tree line and formed up for the long march forward. Waiting for them behind a low stone fence on Cemetery Ridge were about 5,000 Union troops, most of whom belonged to General Winfield Scott Hancock's II Corps. Depending on the source, this was between 2:00 and 3:0) p.m. As they marched forward across the distance, Union artillery killed large numbers of troops. Rifle fire from the Union line was intense. The Union troops used four lines of soldiers. As the line in front fired, they moved back to reload while the next line moved up to fire. Only a few hundred of the Virginians reached the Union line. Within minutes they were dead or dying. Some were captured. The attack lasted about an hour with over 7,000 Confederate soldiers killed. As the remaining Confederate troops retreated, Lee was seen riding his horse saying \"this was all my fault\". He then told Pickett to rally his division. Pickett famously replied, \"General, I have no division.\"\n\nAt about the same time as the main attack, Stuart’s cavalry attacked the Union rear but the attack also failed.\n\nLee brought an army into Pennsylvania that numbered 75,054 men and lost 22,638 casualties or about 30% of his army. Meade lost so many field grade officers that the Army of the Potomac would not recover for the rest of the war. Both the Union I Corps and III Corps lost so many men they had to be combined with II Corps. The battle took more American lives than any other battle in United States history. Gettysburg is still the largest battle to ever be fought on American soil. The Union victory over the Confederacy ended Lee’s invasion of the north. Lee would never try to invade the Union again. The Army of Northern Virginia would never get their strength back. However the supplies taken during their time in Pennsylvania would keep the Confederate army going. The wagon train of supply wagons and ambulances for the wounded was over long. Lee never had more than 51,000 men the rest of the war. Numbers from the Union forces wore down Lee and his army. This is why Gettysburg is said to be the turning point of the American Civil War.\n\nMeade was severely criticized for not counterattacking Lee after the third day of battle. The next day Meade sent out skirmishers, but did not attack. Lee had his army hold its position on Seminary Ridge all day on July 4th. The more than 10,000 wounded men would be moved by wagon train to Williamsport and cross the Potomac to Virginia. The rest of Lee's army followed on the night of July 4-5, screened by Jeb Stuart's cavalry. The next day, on discovering the Confederates had left the battlefield, the Union army cautiously followed. At the Battle of Falling Waters, Lee's army was waiting for the flooded Potomac River to go down so his army could cross. Meade's forces caught up with them there but the battle had no clear victor. The Battle of Falling Waters was the last battle in the Gettysburg Campaign.\n\n", "id": "171864", "title": "Battle of Gettysburg"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171905", "text": "Planetary nebula\n\nA planetary nebula is a nebula that is made up of gas and plasma. They are made by certain types of stars when they die. They are named this because they look like planets through small optical telescopes. They do not last for very long compared to a star, only tens of thousands of years.\n\nAt the end of a normal-sized star's life, in the red giant phase, the outside layers of a star are disposed of. Because the outside is gone, the star shines brightly and is very hot. The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star. This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does.\n\nPlanetary nebulae are very special objects because they can help make more stars. When a star dies, the metals that were in the core of the star are sent to other places in the universe. The only place that these metals form are in stars. This is called nucleosynthesis.\n\nThe pictures of these nebulae show that they have very weird shapes. Scientists are not sure why they are not all spheres. There are many theories about why they are not. They think that binary stars, stellar winds and magnetic fields might be part of the reason they look so special.\n\nPlanetary nebula are not very bright. None of them are bright enough to see without a telescope. The first one discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula. To early astronomers they looked like gas giants. This is why people called them 'planetary nebula'. We still call them this even though we know they are not planets.\nAstronomers did not know what these objects were until the first spectroscopic experiments were done in the 1800's. William Huggins used a prism to look at galaxies. He noticed that they looked a lot like stars.\n\nWhen he looked at the Cat's Eye Nebula, it did not look the same. He saw an emission line at a place that no one had seen before. This meant that it looked like an element that no one had ever seen before. Scientists thought it might be a new element. They decided to call it \"nebulium\".\nLater, physicists showed that it is possible for gasses with a very low density to look like something else. It turned out that the gas they were looking at was oxygen, and not nebulium.\n\nThe stars in planetary nebulae are very hot. They are not very bright, though. This means that they must be very small. The only time that stars get that small is when they are dying. That means that they are one of the last steps in a star's death. Astronomers saw that all planetary nebula are expanding. This meant that they were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.\n\nStars weighing more than 8 solar masses will supernova. Stars that weigh as much as the Sun will become planetary nebulae.\nAfter billions of years, a star will run out of hydrogen. This makes the star colder, and makes the core smaller. The sun's core is about 15 million degrees Kelvin. When it runs out of hydrogen, the smaller core will cause it to rise to about 100 million degrees Kelvin.\n\nThe outer layers of the star grow a lot because of the heat of the core, and become much cooler. The star becomes a red giant. The core gets even smaller and hotter. When its reaches 100 million K, helium begins to fuse into carbon and oxygen. When this happens, the core stops shrinking. Helium burning soon forms a core of carbon and oxygen, with both a helium and a hydrogen shell surrounding it.\n\nBecause helium in fusion reactions is not very stable, the core starts to grow and shrink very quickly. This causes the gas and plasma in the outer layer of the star to move outwards. These gases form a cloud around the core of the star. As more and more of the gas moves away from the star, deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are sent out. When the gas heats up to around 30,000 degrees kelvin, the gas starts to glow. The cloud has then become a planetary nebula.\n\nWe now know of about 3,000 of these nebulae in our galaxy, compared to 200 billion stars. Their very short lifetime compared to a star is why there are not that many compared to stars. They are found mostly in the plane of the Milky Way, and there are more and more the closer you get to the center of the Milky Way.\n\nOnly about twenty percent of planetary nebulae are spheres (like Abell 39). The rest of them have very weird shapes. The reason for all of these shapes is not understood, but it may be because of gravity with secondary stars if it is a binary star system. A second theory is that planets near the star might change how the nebula forms. A third theory is that magnetic fields cause the shapes. .\n\nA big problem in studying planetary nebulae is that astronomers can not always figure out how far away they are. When they are close, astronomers use something called \"expansion parallax\" to figure out how far away they are, but this takes a long time. If they are not close, there is not a good way to figure out how far away they are yet.\n\n\n", "id": "171905", "title": "Planetary nebula"}

The glowing is caused by a star being near the nebula. There are many types of emission nebula. H II regions are caused when stars are forming and are very hot, causing the plasma to heat up. Planetary nebulae are made when where a dying star has thrown off its outer layers. This causes the core of the star to heat up the plasma.\n\nA nebula's color depends on what chemicals are in it, and how ionized it is. Because most of the universe is made of hydrogen, many emission nebulae appear red. Hydrogen glows red when it is hot. If the nebula is very hot, other types of gas will be heated and the it might also glow blue and green. By looking at which colors are glowing in a nebula, one can figure out what it is made of.\n\nEmission nebulae sometimes look like they have dark areas in them.

A Feynman diagram has \"lines\" in different shapes—straight, dotted, and squiggly—which meet up at points called \"vertices\". The vertices are where the lines begin and end. The points in Feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time. The \"lines\" in a Feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another.\n\nIn Feynman diagrams, the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time. When a particle is going backward in time, it is called an antiparticle. The meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time, so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point, that means that the particle was either created or destroyed, depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from.\n\nAll the lines and vertices have an amplitude. When you multiply the probability amplitude for the lines, the amplitude for the particles to go from wherever they start to wherever they meet, and to the next meeting point, and so on, and also multiply by the amplitude for each meeting point, you get a number that tells you the total amplitude for the particles to do what the diagram says they do. If you add up all these probability amplitudes over all the possible meeting points, and over all the starting and ending points with an appropriate weight, you get the total probability amplitude for a collision in a particle accelerator, which tells you the total probability of these particles to bounce off one another in any particular direction.\n\nFeynman diagrams are named after Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His diagrams are very simple in the case of quantum electrodynamics (QED), where there are only two kinds of particles, electrons (little particles inside atoms) and photons (particles of light). In QED, the only thing that can happen is that an electron (or its antiparticle) can emit (or absorb) a photon, so there is only one building block for any collision.

He was the lead singer of hard rock band AC/DC from 1974 until he died of alcohol poisoning in 1980. \n\nScott was born Kirriemuir, Scotland. He and his family moved to Fremantle, Australia in 1952. He left school when he was 15 and spent a short time in a juvenile institution. In 1964, he formed a band called The Spektors. They later became a different band called The Valentines. When the Valentines broke up in 1970, Scott joined a band called Fraternity. Fraternity left Australia and went to Europe, but came back soon after. Scott then joined a band called the Mount Lofty Rangers. In 1974 he had a motorcycle accident and was in hospital for a few months. After he left hospital he joined AC/DC. \n\nAC/DC's first two albums were \"High Voltage\" and \"T.N.T.\". They were only released in Australia. Their first worldwide album was released in 1976. It had songs from both \"High Voltage\" and \"T.N.T.\", and was also called \"High Voltage\". They released another album that year called \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\". Their next albums were \"Let There Be Rock\", \"Powerage\", and a live album called \"If You Want Blood You've Got It\". AC/DC's last album with Scott as their singer was \"Highway to Hell\".\n\nScott died of alcohol poisoning in London on 19 February 1980. He was 33 years old at the time. Brian Johnson became AC/DC's new lead singer. There is a bronze statue of Bon Scott in Fremantle. Shortly after his death, AC/DC released a tribute album to Scott, Back in Black.\n\n", "id": "172049", "title": "Bon Scott"}

Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time, and how it changed to become what it is now. Add to this, the cosmological principle, which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look, and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomers studying how the Universe has changed.\n\nFor these reasons the HDF is sometimes called 'the most important image ever taken'\n\n", "id": "172057", "title": "Hubble Deep Field"}

It also has applications in other areas such as physics, probability theory, and applied statistics.\n\nWhen using mathematical symbols to describe the Riemann zeta function, instead of explaining it using English, it is explained like this:\n\"s\" must be a complex number, meaning that it can involve the square root of -1, or \"i\".\n\nHowever, because this doesn't work for numbers where R(s) < 1, Riemann used some very clever mathematics known as analytic continuation, so that it would work for every number except 1 (where the function just gives you infinity).\n\nLeonhard Euler discovered the first results about this function in the eighteenth century. It is named after Bernhard Riemann, who wrote about it in the memoir \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Quantity\", published in 1859.\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture about the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

The plant can survive in many indoor conditions, but indirect lighting is best. Direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn yellow and burn.\n\nAlthough it grows better in soil, it often is sold with the roots in water. The water should be completely changed every two weeks. The water should be bottled water, soft tap water with very little fluoride, or even water from a filtered, established aquarium. It does best in bright, indirect lighting and temperatures between 15 °C and 25 °C.\n\nPet stores often sell this plant in black plastic pots with slots in them.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172471", "text": "Orbitron\n\nThe Orbitron is a custom car built by Ed Roth. It was lost for many years until it was found again in Mexico in 2007. \n\nBuilt in 1964, the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and a Powerglide automatic transmission. The body was made by hand out of fiberglass. The driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car. This was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car. It was lined with a funny-looking material called \"fake fur\" and it even had an 11\" General Electric portable television in the console. On top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy, clear plastic. A top like this is called a \"bubble top\" since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver. It raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood. The hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed.\n\nRoth built the frame himself out of box-shaped steel tubing. The engine came from one of his 1955 Chevrolets. He removed it so that he could put in a newer, larger V8 engine given to him by General Motors. The Orbitron was one of the very few cars which MRoth thought was a \"mistake\" after he built it. He was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars; the Orbitron's engine and frame were covered by the body. The Orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood. It was said that the automatic hood did not fit well.\n\nThe Orbitron's most fun feature was its front end. It had three red, green and blue tinted headlamps. It was thought that combining the lights would make a white light; the idea came from color television.\n\nAnother car builder, Darryl Starbird, bought the Orbitron from Mr. Roth in 1967 for US$750.00. Mr. Starbird traded it to a man in Texas, but Mr. Starbird does not remember the man's name. From Texas the Orbitron was traded to a carnival owner in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico in 1991. By that time the special nose had been cut off and thrown away, possibly to help keep the engine cool as it was driven around the carnivals.\n\nMichael Lightbourn, a man who restores old cars, heard that the Orbitron was in Ciudad Juárez. He discovered it parked in front of an adult bookstore where it was in very poor shape and was being used as a trash can. \nThe car, which used to be painted blue, had been spray painted in black and was almost complete except for the hood, the television, the fur lining, the cut-off nose and the bubble top. The top had to be destroyed in the early 1970s when it became stuck and trapped someone inside. \n\nThe family who owned the bookstore had also owned the carnival in which the car was used. After Mr. Lightbourn made a deal with the family, he was able to bring the Orbitron to the United States. It was then sold to Beau Boeckmann, the host of the TV show \"Pimp My Ride.\" He fully restored the Orbitron in 100 days. He made it exactly like it was when it was new. All the original parts which could not be used and which Mr. Boeckmann removed from the car, including the frame which was too rusted to reuse, were stored away. Mr. Roth died in 2001, but Mr. Boeckmann was able to get help from men who helped design and build the car in 1964, including designer Ed \"Newt\" Newton and painter Larry Watson. The inside was redone by Joe Perez who did the original job.\n\nThe restoration even includes the same type of television. A small tape recorder and tape were found hidden in the cockpit. This was played when the car was new. It told people who were looking at the car what made it special and it still works today. Planet Plastics of Chino, California, the original company which made the bubble top, was asked to create a replacement. Little bits of the car's original \"candy blue\" color (similar to a very fancy color called \"candy apple red\") were found inside the car. They were used to match the color of the new paint. The original Chevrolet engine with its very special carburetors and Chevrolet Corvette aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and put back in the Orbitron.\n\nIt is on the cover of the March 2009 edition of \"Hot Rod Deluxe\", a \"retro\" version of \"Hot Rod Magazine\".\n", "id": "172471", "title": "Orbitron"}

Bonham Carter made her first appearance on screen in the K.M. Peyton movie, \"A Pattern of Roses\", before appearing in her first starring role in \"Lady Jane\". She is known for playing Marla Singer in the movie \"Fight Club\", Bellatrix Lestrange in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", and as Mrs. Lovett in \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\".\n\nShe has done many movies with her former boyfriend Tim Burton, including her roles as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeny Todd, and as the Corpse Bride in the movie \"Corpse Bride\" along with many others. She also played the evil Red Queen in Tim Burton's movie, \"Alice in Wonderland\" alongside Johnny Depp.\n\nShe was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to drama.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter was born in Golders Green, London, England. \n\nHer mother, Elena, is a psychotherapist. Her father, Raymond Bonham Carter, was a banker and his maternal grandfather was H. H. Asquith, a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Helena Bonham Carter's maternal grandfather, Eduardo Propper de Callejón, was half Spanish and half Jewish. Carter has two brothers: Edward and Thomas. She is a distant cousin of fellow actor, Crispin Bonham-Carter, who played Mr. Bingley in the BBC's production of Pride and Prejudice in 1995. Carter is related to Jane Bonham Carter, the Baroness of Yarnbury.\n\nCarter attended the South Hampstead High School, a girls' school, in Hampstead, London. She later went to Westminster School near the Palace of Westminster. She was rejected from King's College, Cambridge University because they feared she would leave mid-year to follow her acting career. After the rejection, Carter decided to fully concentrate on acting instead of going to school. Carter speaks French fluently.\n\nWhen Carter was five years old, her mother had a serious nervous breakdown, which took her three years to recover from. After recovery, Carter's mother decided to become a psychotherapist. Carter now pays her mother to read scripts and provide her opinion of the characters' psychological motivations. A few years after her mother's recovery, Carter's father became deaf in one ear while on holiday in Greece. He was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma, and underwent an operation to remove a benign tumor. However, the surgery went very wrong; after 9 hours in surgery, Raymond, at 50 years of age, had a stroke that left him half-paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. With Carter's two older brothers away at college, she alone was left to help her mother deal with the new problems.\n\nBonham Carter has not received any formal training in acting. In 1979 she won a national writing contest and used the prize money to pay for her entry into the actors directory 'Spotlight'. She made her first appearance at the age of 16 in a television commercial. She also had a minor part in a TV movie, \"A Pattern of Roses\" in 1983. Her first starring role was in \"Lady Jane\" in 1984, which received mix reviews. She played the Queen of England when she was cast as Anne Boleyn in the ITV1 mini-series, \"Henry VIII\". She was restricted in acting since she was pregnant with her first child at the time of filming.\n\nHer breakthrough performance was in \"A Room with a View\" in 1985, when she played Lucy Honeychurch. Carter also appeared in episodes of \"Miami Vice\" as Don Johnson's love interest during the 1986-87 season. She auditioned for the role of Nancy Spungen in \"Sid and Nancy\" in 1986, but lost the role to Chloe Webb. These early roles led her to be typecast as a \"corset queen\", and \"English rose.\" She expanded her acting range in more recent movies like \"Fight Club\", \"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\", and in Tim Burton's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Corpse Bride\", \"Big Fish\", and \"Sweeney Todd\".\n\nBonham Carter played Bellatrix Lestrange in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" parts 1 and 2. She received good reviews as Lestrange, as she was described as a \"shining but underused talent.\" She then played Mrs. Lovett in \"Sweeney Todd\", which was also released in 2007.\n\nIn May of 2006, Bonham Carter launched her own fashion line called, \"The Pantaloonies,\" with swimwear designer Samantha Sage. The first collection is called \"Bloomin' Bloomers\" and is a Victorian style selection of camisoles, mop caps and bloomers. The two are now working on Pantaloonies customized jeans which Carter describes as \"a kind of scrapbook on the bum.\"\n\nCarter plans to return to the West End with an appearance in \"Rubenstein's Kiss.\" However, the play was delayed because of her busy schedule. The production was set to open in November of 2004 but was postponed. In September 2008, \"Wild Target\" director, Johnathan Lynn, confirmed that Carter had dropped out of his movie due to filming difficulties. He then went on to say that she had joined the cast of Tim Burton's 2010 movie, \"Alice in Wonderland\", where she portrayed the Red Queen. In that movie, she starred with actors Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Christopher Lee, and Alan Rickman. Bonham Carter and Hathaway played two dueling sisters, the Red and White Queens.\n\nIn early 2009, Bonham Carter was named on of The Times newspaper's top 10 British Actresses of all-time. She appeared on the list with fellow British actresses Julie Andrews, Helen Mirren, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn.\n\nBonham Carter played well-known author Enid Blyton in the BBC4 TV biography movie, \"Enid\", showing the author's life. This movie aired on 16 November 2009. Carter starred with Matthew Macfadyen and Denis Lawson.\n\nIn October of 2001, Bonham Carter began her current relationship with director Tim Burton. She met Burton while he was engaged to and living with actress Lisa Marie. Bonham Carter and Burton met while filming \"Planet of the Apes\". Burton tends to cast Bonham Carter in many of his movies. The couple lives in Belsize Park, London, England, in next-door houses with a hallway connecting the two homes. Each house is decorated to fit their own tastes and personality, because they felt the could not live 'together' but did not want to live apart.\n\nThey purchased the house when Bonham Carter became pregnant with the couple's first child, a son named Billy Ray Burton, who was born on October 4, 2003. The couple maintain a close relationship with actor Johnny Depp, who also regularly appears in Burton's movies. Depp is Billy Ray's godfather. At the age of 41, Bonham Carter gave birth to the couple's second child, a daughter named Nell Burton, who was born on December 15, 2007 in Central London. Bonham Carter says she named her daughter Nell after all the \"Helens\" in her family's past. \n\nIn 2008, four of her relatives were killed in a safari bus crash in South Africa. She was given indefinite leave from filming \"Terminator Salvation\", and returned later to complete the rest of the filming. Also in 2008, Carter and Burton both put up their American apartments for sale. The apartments are located in the Greenwich Village in New York City. The apartments were sold for $8.75 million. \n\nIn October of 2008, it was released that Bonham Carter had become a patron of the charity, \"Action Duchenne\" the national charity established to support parents and sufferers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. She released the statement:\n\nIn December of 2008, Bonham Carter used her voice in a MTV domestic violence public service announcement (PSA), reciting a passage about love from the book of Corinthians in the Bible. The 60-second commercial features a troubled couple in a domestic environment. The commercial is silent except for Carter's voice and accompanying music. She recorded her voice in a single take for the ad, which aired on December 2, 2008 on MTV in the UK and Europe as a part of MTV's Staying Alive campaign. MTV will also make the ad available online, and is considering playing it in movie theaters. \n\nIn early 2009, Bonham Carter joined fellow actors Ewan McGregor, Kate Winslet, Liam Neeson, Helen Mirren and others, in leaving an imprint of her lips on a card and signing it. The kiss prints, which were featured in the window of Newcastle's Fenwick store, will be auctioned off for a charity.\n", "id": "172631", "title": "Helena Bonham Carter"}

Here, the term \"parallax\" is the angle between two sight-lines to the star.\n\nAstronomical measurement of position are taken at different times of the year. Since the Earth's orbit is known exactly, the distance from position 1 to position 2 can be worked out. Then, the angle from the horizon to the object can be measured precisely. This gives a triangle whose baseline and angles are known accurately. From the triangle, the distance is calculated by trigonometry.\n\nThe method only fails with objects which are so distant that the long axis of the earth's orbit is too short to get a sufficient difference in the measured angle. Astronomers have worked out various ways to get over this problem, though none are so accurate as the parallax method is for relatively nearby objects. This provides a basis for the cosmic distance ladder. This is the name for the techniques astronomers use to calculate distances further than the parallax method allows.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1993 the Hipparcos satellite took measurements for over 100,000 nearby stars. \n\nMany animals, including humans, have two eyes which provide depth perception; this is called stereopsis. Because the two eyes are at different places on the head, this gives the basis for an automatic sense of distance. We perceive this as a normal 3-D scene. \n\n", "id": "172650", "title": "Parallax"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172829", "text": "Glow fuel\n\nGlow fuel is a term used to tell about fuel used for model airplanes, helicopters, cars and boats. Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two stroke engines or by four stroke engines. Engines like this provide lots of power in a small size.\n\nSometimes, glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel. Some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro, but some fuel has none at all. It is called \"FAI fuel.\" \"FAI\" stands for Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. They say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix.\n\nGlow fuel is mostly made of methanol, nitromethane and oil.\n\nMethanol is the main ingredient. It provides most of the fuel's ability to burn. In order to burn the glow fuel, a glow engine must have a glow plug. The glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol. Since the engines turn very fast, a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs. A small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started. Once the engine is running, the electricity is disconnected. \n\nNitromethane is added to the fuel for more power and to make the engine easier to tune. Nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, but it requires less oxygen. This means that more of it can be put into an engine during each turn of the engine. This leads to more power.\n\nFuel for most model planes, boats and helicopters has 5% to 15% nitromethane. For use in race cars, the nitromethane can be from 30% to as much as 65%.\n\nNitromethane is hard to get in some countries since it is known as an explosive. In these countries, glow fuel sometimes has no nitromethane at all. \n\nSince the engine doesn't have its own supply of oil, it's instead added to the fuel to help lubricate the moving parts and to keep them from burning up. The oil can be castor oil or synthetic oils. Some fuels include a mixture of the two. The oils included in glow fuel are not burned by the engine. Instead, the oil comes out of the exhaust. Not only does the oil lubricate the moving parts, but the oil which comes out the engine helps carry away extra heat.\n\nGlow engines should be run slightly \"rich.\" This means that the mix of fuel and air going into the engine has to have a bit more fuel in it than it can burn at once. This unburned fuel and oil help keep the engine cool. After a model has been run, it is coated with a film of oil and must be cleaned. Ordinary window cleaner and a paper towel do a nice job of removing the oil. \n\nGlow fuel is not difficult to make, but some of the ingredients are dangerous in large amounts. Instead, most modelers buy their glow fuel already made. Some very small engines require more oil than larger engines. More oil may be needed in the fuel. The proper oil can be found at a hobby shop. Companies which make glow fuel mix their fuels with the help of computers. This helps each batch of fuel be of the highest quality it can be. \n\n", "id": "172829", "title": "Glow fuel"}

Ashigaru also carried a water bottle, tissue paper, and rice. \n\nIn the Ōnin War (1467-1477), the ashigaru robbed and looted Kyoto. This gave ashigaru a reputation as bad troops.\n", "id": "172908", "title": "Ashigaru"}

It had, for instance, been discussed by Francis Galton as \"nature\" vs. \"nurture\".\n\nThe extent to which the genotype influences the phenotype varies hugely. \"Some\" aspects of the phenotype are almost entirely determined by heredity, such as eye colour and blood types.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=172940", "text": "Austria national football team\n\nAustria national football team is the national football team of Austria. It is controlled by the Austrian Football Association (German: Österreichischer Fußballbund - ÖFB).\nThe first official match took place on 12th October 1902 in Vienna when a team from Cisleithanien (Austrian part of the Austrian-Hungary Empire) played versus Hungary. (5:0) The team reached in the 1930s the best time. It was the time of the so-called \"Wunderteam\" (miracle team) when Austria was one of the leading teams in Europe. The Wunderteam was the first from the continent to defeat Scotland. In 1934 the team was took part in the FIFA world cup for the first time and reached the 4th place. 1936 Austria won the silver medal at the Olympic games in Berlin. Due to the occupation through Germany in 1938 there was no team between 1938 and 1945. The national team was dissolved and the players like Matthias Sindelar became part of the German team.\nSoon after the end of the war the Austrian team played their first matches versus Hungary in Budapest. On December 6th, 1945 the first homematch took place in the renovated Praterstadion (now Ernst-Happel-Stadion). France was beaten by 4:1. Soon Austria was as successful as before the war. In 1951 Scotland was beaten in his own stadium by 1:0. Austria was the first team from the continent to do so. The FIFA World cup 1954 was the most successful ever. A legendary match was the quarterfinal against Switzerland which won Austria 7:5. It is still till today the Worldcup match with the most goals scored. Austria reached the semifinals and was beaten by the later world champion Germany by 1:6. The match for the 3rd place was won by 3:1 versus Uruguay. Players like Gerhard Hanappi, Walter Zeman and Ernst Ocwirk were playing in the FIFA world team. A 0:6 versus the Czech team marked the end of Austrias golden periode.\nThe next years Austria was an average team but surprised through notable wins. On was on 20 October 1965 when Austria won in England 3:2. Austria was the third team to do so. In the same year however Austria failed to qualify for the 1966 World Cup. Also the qualification for 1970 was a failure. The qualification for 1974 was missed after a 1:2 versus Sweden in a decider.\n\nAfter 20 years Austria could qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The last match versus Turkey was won 1:0 through a goal by the later team coach Herbert Prohaska. In the tournament Austria won the groupstage. But after two lost matches versus Netherlands and Italy they failed to reach the final round. The last match was versus Germany in Cordoba. Austria won 3:2 through two goals by Hans Krankl and an own goal by Bertie Vogts. In Austria this is a legendary match. In the 1982 World Cup Austria also played. After two matches with wins versus Algeria and Chile a narrow loss against Germany was enough. Germany had to win to promote to the final round. The match ended 1:0 for Germany and especially in Algeria there were manipulation reproaches. After the 1982 Cup a lot of players ended their career, so Austria failed to reach the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\nUnder coach Josef Hickersberger Austria could qualify for the 1990 World Cup. He called back old players like Herbert Prohaska and mixed them with new players like Andreas Herzog who had only three league matches played before the Championship. After losses versus Italy and Czechoslovakia and a win versus USA they failed in the first round.\n\nShortly after the World Cup Hickersberger resigned after a 0:1 versus the Faroe Islands in Landskrona, Sweden. On the islands there was no stadium with grass and all the players were pure amateurs. This match was a great disgrace for Austrians team.\n\nThe last appearance of an Austrian team in a World Cup tournament was 1998 in France. Austria failed in the qualifing round versus Italy, Chile and Cameroon. As host Austria was qualified for the UEFA Euro 2008 and played versus Poland, Croatia and Germany. After losses versus Germany and Croatia and a draw versus Poland Austria could not qualify for the quarter finals.\n\nAustria failed to qualify for the World Cup 2006 and 2010 and also for the UEFA Euro 2012.\n\n\n", "id": "172940", "title": "Austria national football team"}

It is also described as the first mechanical computer. It was discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of Antikythera, Greece. A number of gears worked together, much like they do in a mechanical clock. Using a model, it was found that the device could be use to show the motions of the sun, the moon and probably some of the planets. This makes it possible to use the device as a calendar. There were three big dials, and three small ones. Used as a calendar the main functions were:\n\nThe device was found on a shipwreck, near the island Antikythera, between the Peloponnese and Crete. Different coins were also found on the wreck. There are coins from Pergamon, dating between 86BC and 67 BC, and coins from Ephesus, dating between 70 BC and 60 BC. This means that the ship sunk between 70 and 60 BC. This device is the most complex device known in Antiquity. Only in the 14th century did people have the knowledge to build similar devices. \n\nThe device is now on display in the Bronze Collection of the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.\n\nWhen the mechanism was found, it consisted of corroded metal plates. Before x-rays could be used to show what was \"inside\", it was very difficult to judge what the mechanism did. Many of the parts that make up the mechanism were lost either during the roughly 2000 years it had laid on the sea floor, or shortly after discovery. Many gears have not \"survived\" in one piece. None of the scales is complete, and only one indicator survived as a fragment. The Antikythera Research project has produced a reconstruction; it added seven gears that were probably part of the device. There are 35 gears, and seven displays. There are many hints that the device was also used to calculate and show the movement of stars, even though none of the necessary gears or displays have been found.\n\nThere were 82 parts in total. With the parts found it is not possible to get the mechanism with all displays and dials fully operational. It is also not possible to know how many parts have been lost. In total, 30 gears were found. One gear is probably part of a planetary display, that has been lost. To make the reconstructed displays work, another eight gears would be necessary, but they have been lost. There are two crown gears, all the other gears found are normal gears (that require a special alignment of the axes). The gear was a primitive one, and the transmission was not uniform. The mechanism was repaired at least once, which shows that it must have been used often.\n\n", "id": "173042", "title": "Antikythera mechanism"}

It also celebrates a miracle that happened during this time, where just a day's supply of oil allowed the menorah in the rededicated Temple in Jerusalem to remain lit for eight days. Therefore, Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah for eight days. Hanukkah begins on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins in late November or December. In 2013 it starts on November 27. The Hebrew word \"\" means re\"dedication\".\n\nThe \"hanukiah\" (or \"hanukkah menorah\") is an important Hanukkah candle holder. It has nine candles. Traditionally, one candle is separated from the rest, usually by being higher than the other eight. On the first night, only one candle is lit, on the right side of the hanukiah. On the second night, a second candle is added, and they are lit from right to left. This continues for all eight nights. The candles are never lit directly - instead, the higher candle, (called a \"shamash\", meaning \"attendant\") is lit first, and then used to light the rest of the candles. Before the candles are lit, blessings are said over them.\n\nJewish children often play a game called dreidel. The dreidel is a four-sided spinning top, each side having a Hebrew letter. The fire letters (nun, gimel, hey, shin) stand for the Hebrew phrase, \"Nes gadol Haiya shaam,\" meaning, \"A great miracle happened there.\" In Israel, by contrast, the dreidel reads \"Po\" instead of \"shaam,\" meaning \"here.\" So in Israel the phrase is, \"a great miracle happened here.\"\n\nApproximately 2,200 years ago, there was a war between the Greeks and the Jews. The Greeks won and forced their culture on the Jews. A group of Jewish people called the Maccabees revolted and liberated Jerusalem. The Maccabees found their Temple defiled. They sought to rededicate it to God, as the Greeks had been worshipping Zeus there. As part of the rededication, they needed to relight the menorah, whose source of fuel was olive oil.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the Jewish people only found a single jar of undefiled oil, and that oil was only enough to last a single day. The Jewish people took a leap of faith and relit the menorah. To their surprise, the menorah stayed lit for eight days, which was seven more days than they expected. The Jewish people attributed the surprising amount of time that the oil lasted to God (a miracle).\n\nHanukkah is an eight-day celebration, and each day commemorates each day that the oil lasted. On each day, a branch of the nine-branch Hanukkah menorah is lit with the \"shamash\" (\"helper\" candle), which sits on the middle branch.\n", "id": "173205", "title": "Hanukkah"}

The next year Enrique Fernández Arbós became conductor of the orchestra, and he stayed with them for more than 30 years. The orchestra played a lot of Spanish music as well as music by composers from other European countries. Some very famous people such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra. The orchestra gave the first performances of famous pieces such as: Falla's \"Nights in the Gardens of Spain\" (1916) and Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto (1935). \n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War it was difficult to keep the concerts going. After the war, in June 1939, Arbós died and many of the musicians had gone into exile because of the rise of the dictator General Francisco Franco. The conductor Enrique Jordá kept the orchestra going until 1945 when the World War II ended.\n\nFrom 1958 the orchestra often played for comic Spanish operas called zarzuelas. They often travelled through Spain and to Portugal and Latin America giving concerts..\n\nIn 1965 a new orchestra, the Orquesta Sinfónica de RTVE, was started. This made things difficult for the Madrid Symphony Orchestra. They had to spend a lot of time playing for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. In the 1970s they made a lot of recordings of zarzuelas and Spanish operas. The recordings were very good, but they did not have much time for orchestral concerts.\n\nAfter Franco’s death the orchestra became the official orchestra for the Teatro de la Zarzuela. Later, when a new concert hall, the Auditorio Nacional de Música was opened, the orchestra had more opportunity to give orchestra concerts. In 1997, the Orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and moved to the Teatro Real where they will stay at least until 2009.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173353", "text": "HammerFall\n\nHammerFall is a heavy metal/power metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. The band was started in 1993 by the former guitarist of Ceremonial Oath, Oscar Dronjak.\n\nHammerFall began when guitarist Oscar Dronjak quit Ceremonial Oath and invited Jesper Strömblad from In Flames to join him as a drummer on a new band he had been thinking about for a long time. Dronjak had already made the song \"Steel Meets Steel\", which was included on HammerFall's first album. They were later joined by guitarist Niklas Sundin, bassist Johann Larsson and vocalist Mikael Stanne. When Niklas Sundin and Johann Larsson left HammerFall the next year, Glenn Ljungström and Fredrik Larsson replaced them.\n\nBoth Dronjak and Strömblad were in other bands: Dronjak was in \"Crystal Age\", Strömblad was in In Flames. Because of this, HammerFall was not very active during this time. The only concert they played was a local music contest called \"Rockslaget\". The band hadn't written many songs yet, and usually only played covers of bands like Pretty Maids, Judas Priest and Alice Cooper.\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall was playing in \"Rockslaget\". They found out Mikael Stanne was not going to be able to perform with the band. Because of this, they started looking for a new singer. They got in contact with Joacim Cans, who agreed to play with them for the night. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\nTo try to get a record deal, HammerFall recorded a live concert and sent it to the Dutch label, Vic Records. The band got an offer, and spent the rest of the year recording \"Glory to the Brave\". The album was released in the Netherlands first and did pretty well.\n\nAs HammerFall became more famous, some of the band members needed to leave because they were already in other bands. To fill the empty musical spots, Stefan Elmgren assumed the lead guitar and Patrik Räfling assumed the drums and Fredrik decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. In May of 1997, bassist Magnus Rosén joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the \"Glory to the Brave\" album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik Räfling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper, but only as a guest performers, not members of the band.\n\nIn early 1997, German label Nuclear Blast approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release of four albums. The deal was accepted and the band recorded two music videos \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, \"Glory to the Brave\" was released in Europe. \n\nThey did their first tours in Europe with Gamma Ray, Jag Panzer, Lake of Tears and Raven.\n\nNear the end of 2007, \"Glory to the Brave\" was released in Japan and the United States. They sold over 100,000 copies of the album.\n\nIn February 1998, they began recording \"Legacy of Kings\". This album was made by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper. Jesper had already quit the band, but wanted to help with the album. The album was produced by Fredrik Nordström (from Dream Evil) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. It took the band one and a half months to record the album.\n\nBefore releasing the album, they toured with Alice Cooper, Rammstein, Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Saxon and Stratovarius. On the tour, they played the Beach Boys album \"Wild Honey\" in its entirety.\n\nTheir first world tour was in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection, and he could not sing. Magnus Rosén also caught the infection, and after him, all of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The band played for as long as possible and then were had to cancel some of their concerts. \n\nAfter the tour, Anders Johansson, a friend of Magnus Rosén, joined as the new drummer.\n\nAfter many concerts, the band went back to Sweden and began writing songs for their next album. It took eight weeks to record, and they named it \"Renegade\". A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the Renegade, and it reached the top of the Swedish charts; then the album also reached the top of the charts.\n\nThe band's second world tour started in January 2001. \n\nAfter the tour, HammerFall recorded their fourth album \"Crimson Thunder\".\n\nWhile Joacim was at a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and ran away. Joacim had to be taken to a hospital, where he had plastic surgery and rested for a couple of days. \n\nHammerFall toured after the release of the album. The tour was stopped when Oscar Dronjak had a motorcycle accident, breaking his left arm. HammerFall took a break because of this. Stefan decided to start flying airplanes, Magnus and Anders worked with other bands, and Joacim started on his own project. Joacim also had his first child.\n\nOscar worked with a team of doctors to get healthy again. After recovering, he toured with HammerFall again.\nTheir live album and DVD, \"One Crimson Night\", was released in February 2003. After this, they decided to take a break. Two years later, the band released \"\". A video for the song \"Blood Bound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\nOn October 20, 2006, HammerFall released \"Threshold\".\n\nOn March 6, 2007, Magnus Rosén left the band. He said he didn't like being in HammerFall because the bass parts of the song were too easy to play, and wanted more of a challenge.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 Stefan Elmgren decided to leave HammerFall so he could become and airplane pilot. Pontus Norgren from The Poodles took over guitar in the band. \n\nHammerFall's latest album, No Sacrifice, No Victory, was released February 23, 2009.\n\n\n\nStudio albums\n", "id": "173353", "title": "HammerFall"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173399", "text": "Paper clip\n\nA paper clip (or sometimes paperclip) is a piece of plastic or metal that is used to hold pieces of paper together.\n\nA paper clip is usually a thin wire in a shape that is wrapped in on itself. It is used to hold two or more pieces of paper together by pressure. Some other kinds of paper clips use two pieces.\n\nThe type of wire paper clip that is usually used was never patented. It was first made by The Gem Manufacturing Company sometime during the 1890s. The first time Gem was mentioned was in 1883, but historians do not think this is when they began making paper clips. The first advertisement for paper clips was in August 1894. The \"Gem\" name was trademarked in the United States in 1904. The trademark paperwork said that the paper clip had been sold since March 1892.\n\nIt has been said that Herbert Spencer invented the paper clip.\n\nIt is proven that the paper clip was well known by 1899. A patent was given that year for a \"machine to make wire paper clips\" to William Middlebrook on April 27. The drawing in the patent shows a Gem paper clip. There are many different kinds of paper clips. Some have ends instead of round ones. Some have a bent end. This was done so that it is easier to put paper in. Some of them have wires with bumps that allow them to hold the paper better. Some paper clips are made to look good. They are sometimes in a triangle or a circle.\n\nA Norwegian, Johan Vaaler (1866–1910), has sometimes been called the inventor of the paper clip. He was given patents in Germany and in the United States for a paper clip of a different design \n\nAfter Vaaler died, some Norwegians made a myth that the paper clip was invented by a Norwegian genius. Dictionaries since the 1950s have said that Vaaler is the inventor of the paper clip. Dictionaries in other countries sometimes say this now too.\n\nVaaler was probably given a patent in other countries because patent laws in the 1800s were not as tough as they are today. Vaaler worked in a patent office, or place that deals with patents, and could have given himself a patent very easily.\n\nThe patents that Vaaler held have since expired. The Gem paper clip was used around the world, including in Norway. His device did not work as well as the Gem version. This was because it was hard to put pieces of paper in it, and it did not look as good when there was paper in it. \n\nThe person who started the Norwegian paper clip myth was a person who worked for Norway's patent office. He visited Germany in the 1920s to get patents for some Norwegian inventions. He came across Vaaler's patent, and did not realize that it was not the same as the Gem paper clip. In a pamphlet put out by the patent office in celebration of its first 50 years, he wrote about how Vaaler was the inventor of the paper clip. This was put into many Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II.\n\nThe war helped make the paper clip into a national symbol. Some Norwegian patriots wore them on the outside of their clothing as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi rulers when they were not allowed to protest. Soon, the Nazi's made wearing them illegal. \n\nThe first Norwegian encyclopedia did mention it as a symbol of resistance, but did not call it a Norwegian invention. According to the encyclopedia, the idea started in France.\n\nAfter the war, Norway believed the paper clip was a national symbol. Authors of books on the history of Norwegian technology used its status to make their stories bigger. The did not mention that Vaaler's clip was not the same as the Gem clip. In 1989, a big paper clip, almost 7 meters tall was put up in a college near Oslo in honor of Vaaler. The monument is a Gem paper clip, and not the one that was patented by Vaaler. In 1999, 100 years after the German patent was accepted, Norway celebrated by making a postage stamp that had a paper clip on it. However, it was once again the Gem paper clip in the stamp. In 2005, there was a Norwegian biography written about Johan Vaaler, 'The inventor of the paper clip.'\n\nPaper clips are usually made out of wire. A paper clip can be useful when working with many things, like computers. The metal wire can be made straight with a little bit of work. Some things have buttons that cannot be reached by fingers if the people who make the device do not want users pressing them accidentally. Most CD-ROM drives have small buttons like this to eject the CD-ROM if there is not any power. A paper clip bent into a 'U' shape can be used to create a short circuit to start a computer if there is no power button.\n\nKyle MacDonald took one red paperclip and traded it for a house. He began with a red paper clip and posted it on craigslist, trading it for a pen. MacDonald kept trading things until he finally traded a movie role for a two-story house in Kipling, Saskatchewan.\n\nPaper clips can be used to pick a lock. Usually, professional lock picking tools are used, because most paper clips are not strong enough for this use.\n\n\n\n\"Patents\"\n", "id": "173399", "title": "Paper clip"}

When they are warmed again there might still be a cure for them because of better medicine that can be invented in the future.\n\nCold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity. The law also says they are dead. Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more. To do this, their blood is replaced with chemicals called \"cryoprotectants\", which act like anti-freeze.\n\nMaking them cold can stop cells from dying but can kill many of them. Cryonics is not allowed unless you are already declared dead by law because this damage would make you dead by law. To be dead in that way means you cannot live with help from medicine we have today. The idea of people who do cryonics is that better medicine from tomorrow may be used for a cryonics patient, so the person may be alive in a different sense than the law uses today.\n\nCryonics is justified by three facts that are not well known:\nCryonics should work, even though it cannot be demonstrated to work today.

Nuclear explosions produce radiation and radioactive debris.\n\nThe nuclear weapon was first detonated in combat on 6 August 1945, when the United States dropped a uranium gun-type device on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. The second and last use of a nuclear weapon in combat occurred three days later when United States dropped a plutonium implosion-type device on the Japanese city of Nagasaki.

The British finally won after carrying out long and difficult protracted jungle campaigns against the Polygar armies and finally defeated them. Many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over Polygars made large part of territories of Tamil Nadu coming under British control enabling them to get a strong hold in India.\n\nThe war between the British and Kattabomman Nayak of Panchalankurichi Palayam in the then Tirunelveli region is often classified as the First Polygar war. In 1799, a brief meeting (over pending taxes) between Kattabomman and the British ended in a bloody encounter in which the British commander of the forces was slain by the former. A price was put on Kattabomman head prompting many Polygars to an open rebellion. \n\nAfter a series of battles in the Panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from Thiruchirapalli, Kattabomman was defeated but he escaped to the jungles in Pudukottai country. Here he was captured by Pudukottai Rajah (after an agreement with the British) and after a summary trial Kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them, near Kayattar Fort, close to the town of Kovilpatti and in front of fellow Polygars too who had been summoned to witness the execution.\n\nSubramania Pillai, a close associate of Kattabomman Nayak, was also publicly hanged and his head was fixed on a pike at Panchalankurichi for public view. Soundra Pandian Nayak, another rebel leader, was brutally done to death by having his head dashed against a village wall. Kattabomman’s brother Oomaidurai was imprisoned in Palayankottai prison while the fort was razed to ground and his wealth looted by the troops.\n\nDespite the suppression of the First Polygar War in 1799, rebellion broke out again in 1800. The Second war was more stealthy and covert in nature. The leaders operated more cohesive and united with people from Kerala and Mysore taking part. Also it marked the joining of entire west Tamil Nadu, Malabar and south Mysore regions (which was under British domain after the death of Tipu Sultan).Dheeran Chinnamalai commanded a vast army,He settled down at Odanilai and constructed a fort there to continue his struggle against the British, whom he defeated in battles at Cauvery in 1801, Odanilai in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804. Later, Dheeran Chinnamalai left his fort to avoid cannon attack and engaged in guerrilla warfare while he was stationed at Karumalai in the Palani region.\n\nHe was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31, 1805.\n\nThe British finally won after a long expensive campaign that took more than a year. However, the superior British military who had recently defeated the powerful Tipu Sultan of Mysore quickly asserted itself. The British had better artillery compared to the Polygar troops who had country-made gunfire artillery, barring a few proper ones received from erstwhile Tipu Sultan's army. The war being regional in nature, the British forces could easily mobilize additional forces from other regions.\nSo savage and extensive was the death and destruction wrought by the English that the entire region was left in a state of terror.\nDheeran Chinnamalai was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British, who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31 or August 2, 1805. At last entire region of Tamil Nadu came under the control of Britishers after the end of Chinnamalai.\n\nTamil Nadu government constructed a \"mani mandapam\" (memorial) for Chinnamalai in Arachalur, Erode district at a cost of about 30 lakhs. Tamil Nadu government placed a statue of Chinnamalai in Chennai.[1]\n\n", "id": "173552", "title": "Polygar Wars"}

He broke with the positivist orientation of the science and philosophy of his time, believing that experience is the source of all knowledge.\n\nHusserl studied mathematics under Karl Weierstraß, completing a Ph.D. under Leo Königsberger, and studied philosophy under Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf.\n\nThen Husserl taught philosophy, as a \"Privatdozent\" at Halle from 1887, and as a professor:\n\n\nHusserl was born into a Jewish family in a town that was then in the Austrian Empire, after 1918 a part of Czechoslovakia, and since 1993 a part of the Czech Republic.\n\nHe initially studied mathematics but then started attending lectures on psychology and philosophy. Husserl was so impressed by Brentano that he decided to dedicate his life to philosophy.\n\nHis major written work is \"Philosophie der Arithmetik\" (1891). In these first works he tries to combine mathematics, psychology and philosophy with a main goal to provide a sound foundation for mathematics. He analyzes the psychological process needed to obtain the concept of number and then tries to build up a systematical theory on this analysis. To achieve this he uses several methods and concepts taken from his teachers. From Weierstrass he derives the idea that we generate the concept of number by counting a certain collection of objects. From Brentano and Stumpf he takes over the distinction between \"proper\" and \"improper\" presenting.\n\nIn an example Husserl explains this in the following way: if you are standing in front of a house, you have a proper, direct presentation of that house, but if you are looking for it and ask for directions, then these directions (e.g. the house on the corner of this and that street) are an indirect, improper presentation. In other words, you can have a proper presentation of an object if it is actually present, and an improper (or symbolic as he also calls it) if you only can indicate that object through signs, symbols, etc. \n\nAnother important element that Husserl took over from Brentano is intentionality, the notion that the main characteristic of consciousness is that it is always intentional. While often simplistically summarised as \"aboutness\" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of \"mental phenomena\", by which they could be distinguished from \"physical phenomena\". \n\nSome years after the publication of his main work, the \"Logische Untersuchungen\" (\"Logical Investigations\"; 1900-1901) Husserl made some key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed (the object-in-itself, transcendent to consciousness). \n\nKnowledge of essences would only be possible by \"bracketing\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world. He called this procedure \"epoché\".\n\nHusserl then started to concentrate on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness.\n\nThe metaphysical problem of establishing what kind of reality we perceive was of little interest to Husserl in spite of his being a transcendental idealist.\n\nHusserl proposed that the world of objects and ways in which we direct ourselves toward and perceive those objects is normally conceived of in what he called the \"natural standpoint\", which is characterized by a belief that objects materially exist and exhibit properties that we see as emanating from them.\n\nHusserl proposed a radical new phenomenological way of looking at objects by examining how we in our many ways of being intentionally directed toward them, actually \" \"constitute\" \" them (to be distinguished from materially \" \"creating objects or objects\" \".\n\nIn a later period, Husserl began to wrestle with the complicated issues of intersubjectivity, specifically, how communication about an object can be assumed to refer to the same ideal entity (\"Cartesian Meditations\", Meditation V).\n\nHusserl tries new methods of bringing his readers to understand the importance of phenomenology to scientific observation: specifically he refers to psychology) and what he means for \"bracketing natural attitude\".\n\n\"The Crisis of the European Sciences\" is Husserl's unfinished work that deals most directly with these issues. In it, Husserl for the first time attempts a historical overview of the development of Western philosophy and science, emphasizing the challenges presented by their increasingly (one-sidedly) empirical and naturalistic orientation.\n\nHusserl declares that mental and spiritual reality possess their own reality independent of any physical basis.\n\n\nAnthologies:\n\n", "id": "173705", "title": "Edmund Husserl"}

There are wild grasses, and less trees.\nSeveral parts of the world have grasslands. Grasslands are found in Africa, North America, Central Asia, South America, and near the coasts of Australia. The largest grasslands are in East Africa. Grasslands with a few scattered trees are called savannas. Others are called prairies or steppes. \n\nLittle rain falls in a grassland biome. Between 25 and 75 cm of rain falls each year, which makes the weather in these savannas hot and sunny in the summer and cool in the winter months.\n\nGrassland vegetation can vary greatly in height. The chalk grassland of southern England is quite short, often with small, delicate chalkland flowers. \n\nGrass is quite tall in North American \"tallgrass prairie\", South American grasslands and African savannas. This provides a degree of cover for the smaller animals, and so it increases the number of species which can live there.\n\nWoody plants, shrubs or trees, may occur on some grasslands.\n\nAs flowering plants and trees, grasses grow in great concentrations in climates where annual rainfall ranges between . The root systems of perennial grasses and forbs form complex mats that hold the soil in place.\n\nThe tallgrass prairie is the native ecosystem of North America before it was replaced by modern farming. \nRetreating glaciers dropped material about 10,000 years ago. Wind-dropped loess and organic matter accumulated. This made the soil. The prairie had the deepest level of topsoil recorded anywhere. Animals such as buffalo, elk, deer, and rabbits added nitrogen to the soil with their urine and feces. Prairie dogs dug tunnels that \"aerated the soil and channeled water several feet below the surface\".\nFor 5,000 to 8,000 years, more than of prairie grasslands were a major feature of the landscape. \nBetween 1800 and 1930, most of it was destroyed. Settlers transformed what they called \"the Great American Desert\" or \"The Inland Sea\" into farmland. They replaced the old grasses with new ones, mostly wheat and maize. They replaced the bison with cattle, another kind of bovine. About 40% of the world's maize for example grows in the United States, mostly on land that formerly grew grass. The grazing pattern of European cattle, the near-extermination of prairie dogs, and the plowing and cultivation of the land, did the damage. Plowing cut tallgrass root systems and interrupted reproduction. Drainage changed the soil's water content, and soil erosion lost soil.\n\nEstimates differ of how much original tallgrass prairie survives. Perhaps less than 1% mostly in \"scattered remnants found in pioneer cemeteries, restoration projects, along highways and railroad rights-of-way, and on steep bluffs high above rivers\", to 4%.\n\nThere are few trees in the grassland because of the low rainfall. Thorny trees called acacias are one of a handful of trees that are able to grow here. Wildfires are common and destroy trees. The animals also prevent trees from growing as they eat the tender sprouts before they can develop into grown trees. Elephants are known to tear down grown-up trees and feed on their leaves, making trees even more scarce.\n\nGrass can still grow because it survives the aridity and the trampling of the animals. This is why grasslands can feed vast numbers of animals. Animals include mice, rats that eat mostly seeds. Snakes, hawks and eagles eat mostly small animals. Big animals, mostly grazers, include zebras, ostriches, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, horses, and antelopes.\n", "id": "173807", "title": "Grassland"}

The vehicles in a set are called \"cars\" (in the United States) or \"wagons\" (in the United Kingdom). Often, people refer to the ones that carry passengers as Coaches or Carriages. A place where a train stops to let people get on and off is called a railway station. Early trains used horse power and ran on wooden or iron tracks. These were used in the Middle Ages. The first steam trains were built in England in the early 19th century. \n\nTrains contain the prime mover (either locomotive or motor unit) and one or more cars. The locomotive or railway engine (the first car of the train) pulls the cars along the track. Some trains look like a special bus that can only drive on rails. Trains are used to carry people, as well as cargo, such as fuel, imported/exported goods, and so on.\n\nFreight trains have freight cars (US) or goods wagons (UK) to carry goods from one place to another. Some are boxcars (closed and roofed cars for cargo); others are special so they can carry special cargo. There are hopper cars for sand, coal, ore and other granulous (sand-like) materials, flatbed cars for vehicles and machinery, tank cars for liquids, container cars for containers and even bottle cars for molten iron. Almost anything which is not too large to fit under tunnels and bridges can be transported on special freight cars.\n\nPassenger trains have passenger cars (US) or coaches (UK) made so people can ride them from one train station to another. There are few long-distance passenger trains in the United States, but more in Europe and Asia. Most passenger cars are single-deckers: there are also double-decker passenger cars, such as the Finnish Inter-City cars.\n\nPassenger trains are usually a very comfortable way of traveling. Many trains have electrical outlets and Wi-Fi hotspots for computers, and a special restaurant car for dining and refreshments. There are also sleeping cars (passenger cars with beds) for long overnight voyages.\n\nSome unusually fast passenger trains on special tracks are called \"bullet trains\". A few even faster ones are maglev trains using magnets to hover slightly off the tracks to have less friction.\n\n\nMost trains are pulled by locomotives. Before 1900, almost all were steam locomotives. As this kind of steam engine uses very much fuel for the work it does, steam began to give way to diesel locomotives and electric locomotives during the 1930s. Today, most locomotives are diesel-electric locomotives.\n\nSometimes a train has no separate locomotive, but the prime mover (diesel engine or electric motor) is located on the first car of the train itself, and the car has engineer's cabin. The car is called a \"motor unit\". Some trains have motors in many or all of the cars. This is called a diesel multiple unit or electric multiple unit. Usually, both ends of the train have engineer's cabins. These trains are especially popular in commuter traffic in large towns and cities.\n", "id": "173894", "title": "Train"}

It is a very small bay near Sorrento, Victoria. It is close to the entrance of Port Phillip Bay, south of the city of Melbourne.\nIn 1802, Governor Philip Gidley King in Sydney had written to Lord Hobart, Minister in charge of the colonies, in London, saying that Britain should start a settlement at Port Phillip Bay. King thought it would be good area for fishing and sealing. He was also worried that the French might settle in the area and then would control Bass Strait. Lieutenant John Murray had explored Port Phillip Bay in 1802 and thought that the Sorrento area would be a good spot to start a settlement.\n\nLieutenant Governor David Collins was put in charge of starting the new settlement. He took 307 convicts, some with wives and children, 51 soldiers, 17 free settlers, some with wives and children, and a government staff of 12, and a clergyman, the Reverend Knopwood. The group of more than 400 people left England in April 1803, in the store ship “Ocean” and the convict ship “Calcutta.”\n\nThe two ships sailed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Capetown in South Africa, and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 6 October and 8 October 1803. Only 14 people died on the trip. Collins was unable to find a good place to land that had drinking water and good soil. On 13 October 1803, he landed at Sullivan’s Bay, which he named after the Under Secretary of the Colonial War Department.\n\nThe new settlers were able to get water by putting wooden barrels into the sand, and letting the water in the ground soak into them. It was salty and not nice to drink. The soil was very sandy and not suitable for farming. There were very few trees suitable for cutting up into building timber. The sandy ground meant that heavy items could not be carried in a wagon, which would be stuck in the sand, but had to be dragged instead. The small entrance to the bay made it difficult for sailing ships to get in or out safely. The tools brought from England, such a spades, hoes and axes, were very badly made and broke easily. Coscape. He had hoped to increase the food supply with fresh fish and kangaroos, but they were not able to catch any.\n\nMale convicts were given a set of clothes in October 1803 which included:\n\nThe food ration each week was:\n\nWomen were to be given 2/3 of that amount, children half the amount, and small children under 5 years, ¼ of the .\n\nA convict printer, Robert Walsh printed the orders and instructions for the settlement on a small printing press. During the time of the settlement 43 such orders were printed.\n\nCollins told the convicts not to go into the water to wash because of the danger from hungry sharks and stingrays. Some tried to escape by walking overland to Sydney. They soon gave up and went back to the settlement. Settler, John Skilton, died on 17 October 1803. On 25 November 1803, the first child, William James Hobart Thorne, was born to a soldier, Sergeant Thorne and his wife. One child of convict parents was John Pascoe Fawkner, who returned to start the settlement of Melbourne in 1835.\n\nIn November, Collins sent the “Ocean” to Sydney with a letter asking King to let him abandon the settlement, and move it to either Port Dalrymple or the Derwent River in Van Diemen's Land. The “Ocean” came back in December and Collins wasted no time in getting most of the convicts and settlers packed up. He gave an order that convicts had to work on Sundays to make sure the group was ready to leave as soon as possible. On 30 January 1804, the “Ocean” set sail for the Derwent River. Lieutenant William Sladden was left behind in charge of a small group. The “Ocean” returned and on 20 May 1804, the settlement was abandoned.\n\nThree people were left behind after the settlement was abandoned, two were escaped convicts and one was a runaway soldier, William Buckley. When John Batman came to settle in Victoria 30 years later, he found Buckley living with an aboriginal tribe. The only sign of the settlement now is four graves at Sullivan Bay, and the remains of a water barrel in the Latrobe Library collection.\n\n", "id": "173951", "title": "Sullivan Bay, Victoria"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173971", "text": "Romanization of Bulgarian\n\nThe Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian is a system of transliteration of the Bulgarian alphabet created by Lyubomir Ivanov in the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1995, which is defined by the following table:\n\nThe system was originally developed to serve for the Romanization of Bulgarian geographical names in Antarctica. It was adopted by the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria on 2 March 2005. An early explanation of the Streamlined System was made in 1997 to the US and UK Antartcic place-naming authorities. They had noticed the difference from their 1952 BGN/PCGN romanization of Bulgarian. The new system became subject to comparative study at the Department of English and American Studies at Sofia University.\n\nSubsequently, the system was chosen by the Bulgarian Government. It is the official transliteration system to be used in all identity documents, road signs, street names, official information systems, databases, local authorities’ websites etc. Eventually, the Streamlined System became part of Bulgarian law by way of the passed in 2009.\n\nThe Streamlined system was adopted also by UN in 2012, and for official US and UK use, by BGN and PCGN in 2013. Ivanov proposes using his Romanization approach in the case of Cyrillic alphabets of other Slavic languages, notably Russian.\n\nThe Streamlined System was designed with the aim of striking an optimal balance between the following partly overlapping and partly conflicting priorities:\n\n\nExceptions: \n\nIt had been proposed to modify the Streamlined System so that Bulgarian letters Ъ and Ц were transliterated as \"Ă\" and \"TZ\" respectively. However, those proposals failed to gain wider acceptance, and were not adopted for official usage.\n\nThe system is not invertible, for А, Ж, Й, Ц, Ш, Щ, Ю, Я are transliterated in the same way as are Ъ, ЗХ, Ь, ТС, СХ, ШТ, ЙУ, ЙА respectively. An auxiliary, invertible variant of the system without the ИЯ-exception rule is proposed by L. Ivanov, D. Skordev and D. Dobrev to be used in those special cases when the exact retrieval of Bulgarian words from their Romanized forms is a priority, with Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters \nЪ, Ь, ЗХ, ЙА, ЙУ, СХ, ТС, ТШ, ТЩ, ШТ, ШЦ transliterated as \"`A\", \"`Y\", \"Z|H\", \"Y|A\", \"Y|U\", \"S|H\", \"T|S\", \"T|SH\", \"T|SHT\", \"SH|T\", \"SH|TS\" respectively. In order to ensure full invertibility of the system, including the case of the ИЯ-exception rule, one may transliterate word-final -ИА as \"I|A\" rather than \"IA\". The plain streamlined transliteration word form could be retrieved from its invertible variant by simply removing the additional symbols ` and |.\n\nThe Streamlined System is based on an English-oriented transliteration, taking advantage of the global \"lingua franca\" role of English. A similar shift towards English-oriented transliteration is observed in the case of other Cyrillic alphabets such as Russian and Ukrainian, and to some extent Macedonian. \n\nThe Streamlined System is similar to the old 1952 BGN/PCGN System for the Romanization of Bulgarian, which had been official in the USA and the United Kingdom until 2013. The latter however transliterates the Cyrillic letters Х, Ь and Ъ as \"KH\", \"’\" (apostrophe) and \"Ŭ\", while the former uses \"H\", \"Y\" and \"A\" instead.\n\nAnother similar system not adopted for official use in Bulgaria is that of A. Danchev, M. Holman, E. Dimova and M. Savova, which transliterates the Cyrillic letters У and Ъ by \"OU\" and \"U\" respectively, while the Streamlined System uses \"U\" and \"A\" for this purpose. Furthermore, the latter system transliterates the digraphs АЙ•ай, ЕЙ•ей, ОЙ•ой and УЙ•уй by AI•ai, EI•ei, OI•oi and OUI•oui instead of AY•ay, EY•ey, OY•oy and UY•uy respectively.\n\n", "id": "173971", "title": "Romanization of Bulgarian"}

Unsafe abortions can be very dangerous to the mother. Many women die or get a disease because they had an unsafe abortion. About 95 percent of unsafe abortions happen in developing countries.\nTwo very common ways that unsafe abortions are done are:\n\nA back-alley abortion (Back-Yard Abortion in Australia) is the common slang term for an illegal abortion in the English-speaking world. \n\nThe method using the coat hanger, as described above, was known by many people. This method was not what was done normally, though. In fact, Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned Parenthood, said, in a 1960 printing of the \"American Journal of Public Health\":\n\nHerbal abortions (when done illegally) can also be described as back-alley abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility.\n\nThe argument of back-alley abortions was used to help make abortion legal in the United States. In 1973, the US Supreme Court decided that abortion should be legalized. It was treating a case called Roe v. Wade. Since then, it has become a central argument on the part of some prominent legal abortion advocates. Gerri Santoro died of blood loss after a back-alley abortion. Her photo was used extensively to illustrate the dangers of illegal abortions.\n\nBernard Nathanson performed many abortions but later was against them. He has said that many of the statistics that show that many women died from back-alley abortions in the US are false. He said that he and his colleagues made many such statistics to lead people to believe that legalizing abortion was a good thing to do. \n\nSource: Unsafe Abortion: Mortality and Risk Estimates of Death data from WHO press, Geneva, 1997\n\n10,000 women a year die from unsafe abortions in Nigeria.\n", "id": "174130", "title": "Unsafe abortion"}

Other than that, the bridge is as it was when it was originally constructed. \n\nThe bridge was built by the Indianapolis Southern Railway and successor Indianapolis Southern Railroad. That company became a part of the Illinois Central Railroad in 1911.

This term became common during the financial crisis that began in August 2007. Toxic assets played a major role in that crisis. When the market for such assets ceases to function, it is described as \"frozen\". \n\nMarkets for some toxic assets froze in 2007, and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008. Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic-asset markets. The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions, and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets. Banks and other, major financial-institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices, since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets, making them appear insolvent.\n", "id": "174289", "title": "Toxic assets"}

It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli in the mid-19th century. \n\nConway calls it an orthoplex for \"orthant complex\", as well as the entire class of cross-polytopes.\n\nThe hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross-polytopes, which exist in all dimensions. As such, its dual polychoron is the tesseract (the 4-dimensional hypercube).\n\nIt is bounded by 16 cells, all of which are regular tetrahedra. It has 32 triangular faces, 24 edges, and 8 vertices. The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes.\n\nThe eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are (±1, 0, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0, 0), (0, 0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, 0, ±1). All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs.\n\nThe Schläfli symbol of the hexadecachoron is {3,3,4}. Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron. There are 8 tetrahedra, 12 triangles, and 6 edges meeting at every vertex. Its edge figure is a square. There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge.\n\nThere is a lower symmetry form of the \"16-cell\", called a demitesseract or 4-demicube, a member of the demihypercube family, and represented by h{4,3,3}, and can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells.\n\nOne can tessellate 4-dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16-cells. This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schläfli symbol {3,3,4,3}. The dual tessellation, icositetrachoric honeycomb, {3,4,3,3}, is made of by regular 24-cells. Together with the tesseractic honeycomb {4,3,3,4}, these are the only three regular tessellations of R. Each 16-cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares an octahedron, 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge, and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point. Twenty-four 16-cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation.\n\nThe cell-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a cubical envelope. The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube, corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube. Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other (non-regular) tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells, filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube. The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube. In this projection of the 16-cell, all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope.\n\nThe cell-first perspective projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope. The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell-first parallel projection.\n\nThe vertex-first parallel projection of the 16-cell into 3-space has an octahedral envelope. This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes, by cutting along the coordinate planes. Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16-cell. The closest vertex of the 16-cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron.\n\nFinally the edge-first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope, and the face-first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope.\n\n\n\n", "id": "174603", "title": "16-cell"}

The policy, with the slogan \"Just The Ticket\", meant that only one ticket was needed for London Transport bus and Underground services. They also reduced the price of transport.

It was owned by a ship line called the Italian Line. It was said to be the biggest, fastest, safest, and most beautiful ship in Italy after World War II. It could carry 1,221 passengers and 563 crew.\n\nThe ship was built by the Ansaldo Shipyards in Genoa, Italy. It was launched on June 16, 1951. Its maiden voyage, or first voyage, was on January 14, 1953. Three years later in 1956, it crashed with another ship, MS \"Stockholm\", in the Atlantic Ocean. At that time, 1,134 passengers and 572 crew were on board. \"Andrea Doria\" sank in 11 hours, but \"Stockholm\" survived.\n\nThe \"Andrea Doria\" was the last large ocean liner to sink before airplane travel became popular.\n\n\"Andrea Doria\" was built at the Ansaldo Shipyards, which was a shipbuilding company in Genoa, Italy. At the time of building, she was:\nIt was designed for comfort. Its designer was an Italian architect called Minoletti. There was also another ship, \"Cristoforo Colombo\", that looked exactly like \"Andrea Doria\".\n\n\"Andrea Doria\" was a transatlantic ocean liner, which is a ship that crosses the Atlantic Ocean. The ship had three swimming pools, and was the first ship to have that many. Over 1 million dollars were spent on art to decorate the ship.\n\nThe ship was also built for safety. It had 11 watertight compartments. These are special dividers in a ship to keep water in one place. If two of them were filled, the ship would not sink. \"Andrea Doria\" also had very advanced radar. Radar could warn the captain of the Andrea Doria if there was something in the path of the ship. However one big problem was that the ship often tilted too much to one side.\n\n\"Andrea Doria\" had two rows of lifeboats, which are small boats that can evacuate passengers if the ship sinks. However, if the ship tilted too much, half of the lifeboats could not be used. \"Andrea Doria\"'s maiden voyage (first voyage) was on January 14, 1953.\n\n\"Andrea Doria\" sank in the night between July 25, 1956, and July 26, 1956. When she sank, she had 1,134 passengers and 572 crew members, and her captain was Piero Calamai. She was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. Her path was from Genoa, Italy, to New York, in the United States. \"Andrea Doria\" entered very thick fog when it passed by Nantucket, which is a small island near Massachusetts. Soon, another ship entered the fog. This was SS \"Stockholm\". SS \"Stockholm\" was another passenger ship. Because of the fog, the two ships could not see each other. When they finally noticed each other, they tried to turn away. \"Andrea Doria\" turned left to pass \"Stockholm\". But \"Stockholm\" turned right to try to pass \"Andrea Doria\". Because of the fog, they could not see what each other was trying to do. At 11:10 PM of July 25, 1956, \"Andrea Doria\" and \"Stockholm\" crashed together.\n\n\"Stockholm\" crashed into the right side of \"Andrea Doria\" near the middle. It made a large hole that was almost deep. It broke open several of the watertight compartments on \"Andrea Doria\". It also broke five fuel tanks. The fuel tanks were filled by 500 tons of water. \"Stockholm\" and \"Andrea Doria\" separated in 30 seconds. \"Andrea Doria\" began to tilt to its right side. Soon, half of the lifeboats could not be used, because it was tilting too much. The weight of the fuel tanks that were filled by water also pulled it down. \"Stockholm\"'s whole front end was destroyed, but it did not sink. 46 passengers on the \"Andrea Doria\" were killed by the crash. Five crew members of the \"Stockholm\" were also killed. However, one incredible survivor was Linda Morgan, an \"Andrea Doria\" passenger who landed on the \"Stockholm\" when they crashed.\n\nThirty minutes after the crash, the people on \"Andrea Doria\" decided to abandon the ship. However, some crew had already left. This made it harder because no crew was there to help. However, there were still enough lifeboats to get everyone out safely. The \"SS \"Ile de France\"\", a French ship, arrived at the \"Andrea Doria\" to help rescue passengers. It launched lifeboats to rescue passengers of the \"Andrea Doria\". The \"Ile de France\" had sailed only one day, so it had lots of supplies left to help the passengers of \"Andrea Doria\". \"Andrea Doria\" continued to tilt right, and eventually began to sink on 9:45 AM of July 26, 1956. Before that, at 9:00 AM, all the survivors were off the ship. At 10:00 AM, \"Andrea Doria\" was tilted so far to the right that its windows touched the ocean. At 10:09 AM, the ship sank. This was 10 hours and 59 minutes after it had crashed with the \"Stockholm\". The back of \"Andrea Doria\" rose, and its left propeller lifted out of the water. Some lifeboats that were still on the ship broke off and floated away upside down. The ship had drifted 1.6 nautical miles (a measuring distance used at sea) from where it had crashed with the \"Stockholm\".\n\nA total of six different ships rescued passengers of the \"Andrea Doria\", including the \"Stockholm\" and \"Ile de France\". \"Stockholm\" was the last to arrive, because it was damaged. Many families had their hopes of seeing loved ones again destroyed. The most affected were those who were meeting members of several families immigrating to the United States in hope of new lives. The Chrysler Norseman, a prototype car headed to New York, was also lost with the other cars aboard \"Andrea Doria\". A \"Rolls-Royce\" luxury car was also on Andrea Doria.\n\nA series of lawsuits were filed by both ship lines in response to the disaster. The reasons argued included:\n\n\"Andrea Doria\" landed on the ocean bottom sideways, with her left side facing up, in good condition. At first, the top of the shipwreck was in water about deep. It was a popular destination for divers. However, the \"Andrea Doria\" has become a difficult ship to explore. The wreck is at .\n\nMore recently, the top part of the ship has collapsed. Inside the ship, many supports have broken. The ship is slowly getting shorter as its weight presses downwards. The top of the wreck is now below the water. Fifteen people have died exploring the \"Andrea Doria\".\n\nThe front of \"Stockholm\" was eventually fixed. About $1 million was spent. Now, \"Stockholm\" is named \"Athena\", and still sails.\n\nSeveral books have been published about \"Andrea Doria\". This is a list of some of them:\n\nA memorial wreath was put at the place where \"Andrea Doria\" sank in July 2002.\n", "id": "174868", "title": "SS Andrea Doria"}

He was one of the biggest box office draws in the world from the 1970s to the 1990s, Sylvester Stallone is an action hero icon. He has played two famous movie characters: Rocky Balboa, the boxer who overcame challenges to fight for love and glory, and John Rambo, a brave soldier who did violent missions.\n\nStallone was born in New York City, and he is the son of Frank Stallone, Sr. (born as Francesco Staglione), a hairdresser, and Jackie Stallone (born as Jacqueline Labofish), an astrologer, former dancer, and supporter of wrestling for women. During his birth, doctors used , an instrument that looks like a pair of pincers or tongs, that damaged a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallone's face. The paralysis caused his well known speech and drooping lower lip.\n\nStallone's grandfather, Silvestro Staglione, was an immigrant from Gioia del Colle, in the province of Bari (Apulia, Italy). Stallone's mother was born in Washington, D.C., and she was the daughter of a Parisian socialite. When Stallone was between the ages of two and five he boarded in Queens, and he only saw his parents on the weekends. In 1951 he went back to live with his parents in Maryland where they owned beauty salons. In 1960s he attended Abraham Lincoln High School (living in the Tacony section of Philadelphia which inspired the Rocky stories) after being rejected for the Catholic High School Father Judge and after that he went to beauty school.\n\nIn the 1960s, Stallone stopped going to beauty school after he won a scholarship for the American College of Switzerland in Leysin. There, he studied drama and was well received in school productions. When he went back to America he went to the Theater Arts Department at University of Miami for three years. He came within a few credit hours of graduation before he decided to drop out and try a career at writing screenplays under the pen names Q. Moonblood and J.J. Deadlock. At the same time he started acting in small parts in movies.\n\nLater, Stallone asked that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining credits, and the President of the University of Miami gave him a Bachelors of Fine Arts (BFA) degree in 1999.\n\nStallone had his first role in the softcore pornography movie \"Party at Kitty and Stud's\" (1970), which was later re-released as \"Italian Stallion\". He was paid US$200 for two days work. An \"uncut\" version of the movie was released in 2007, and it claimed to show actual hardcore footage of Stallone. However, trade journal \"AVN\", said that Stallone was not in the hardcore scenes. In 2008, a DVD was released of \"White Fire\" (1976), a dubbed, German edit of 'Party at Kitty and Stud's', which was alleged to include hardcore footage of Stallone.\n\nStallone also starred in the play called \"Score\" which had 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 - November 15, 1971. It was later made into a movie by Radley Metzger.\n\nStallone's other first few movie roles were small, and he did brief appearances that he did not get credit for in Woody Allen's \"Bananas\" (1971) as a subway thug, in the thriller \"Klute\" (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and with Jack Lemmon in\"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (1975), as a young person. In the Lemmon movie, Jack Lemmon chases, tackles and Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a thief. He also starred in the hit \"The Lords of Flatbush\" (1974). In 1975, he played supporting roles in \"Farewell, My Lovely\", \"Capone\" and, another hit, \"Death Race 2000\". He also made guest appearances on the TV series \"Police Story\" and \"Kojak\".\n\nStallone was not very well known by a lot of people until his role in \"Rocky\" (1976). On March 24, 1975, he saw the Muhammed Ali–Chuck Wepner fight which gave him the idea for \"Rocky\". That night Stallone went home, and in three days he had written the script for \"Rocky\". After that, he tried to sell the script with the intent of playing the lead role. Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler both liked the script (which Stallone submitted to them after a casting), and planned on having a star like Burt Reynolds or James Caan to play the lead character. \"Rocky\" was nominated for ten Academy Awards, this included Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone.\n\nThe second movie \"Rocky II\" which Stallone had also written and directed was released in 1979 and also became a huge success. The money it made was over US$200 million.\n\nApart from the \"Rocky\" movies, Stallone did many other movies in the late 1970s and early 1980s which were critically acclaimed but were not successful at the box office. He received critical praise for movies such as \"F.I.S.T.\" (1978), a social, narrative styled drama where he plays a warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In \"Paradise Alley\" (1978), he plays one of three brothers who is a con artist and who helps his other brother who is involved in wrestling.\n\nIn the early 1980s, he starred in a movie with the British veteran Michael Caine in \"Escape to Victory\" (1981), a sports drama where he plays a prisoner of war involved in a Nazi propaganda fußball (soccer) tournament. Stallone then created the action thriller movie \"Nighthawks\" (1981), in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat and mouse game with a foreign terrorist.\nStallone had another major success when he played as a Vietnam veteran named John Rambo in the action adventure movie \"First Blood\" (1982). The first chapter of Rambo was both a critical and box office success. The critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human despite the way he is described in the book of the same name, \"First Blood\" and in the other movies. Two other Rambo movies \"\" (1985) and \"Rambo III\" (1988) followed (and another, Rambo, in 2008). Although box office hits, the movies were given much less critical praise than the original. He also continued his box office success with the \"Rocky\" franchise and wrote, directed and starred in two more movies to the series: \"Rocky III\" (1982) and \"Rocky IV\" (1985). \n\nStallone also unsuccessfully attempted roles in different genres. He wrote and starred in the comedy movie \"Rhinestone\" (1984) where he played a wannabe country music singer and the drama movie \"Over the Top\" (1987) where he played a truck driver who enters an arm wrestling competition to impress his estranged son. For the Rhinestone soundtrack, he performed a song. These movies did not do well at the box office and were not well received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 James Cagney classic Angels With Dirty Faces. The movie would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Pictures and he was to co-star with Christopher Reeve. It was going to be directed by Menahem Golan. The re-making of such a very much liked classic was given disapproval by Variety Magazine and horror by top critic Roger Ebert. So, Cannon decided to make Cobra instead. \"Cobra\" (1986) and \"Tango and Cash\" (1989) did solid business domestically but overseas they did blockbuster business making over $100 million in foreign markets and over $160 million worldwide. The Rocky and Rambo franchises at the end of the decade were billion dollar franchises internationally.\n\nWith the recent success of \"Lock Up\" and \"Tango & Cash\", at the start of the 1990s Stallone starred in the fifth installment of the Rocky series \"Rocky V\" which was considered a box office disappointment and was also disliked by fans because it seemed like an unnecessary movie to the series. It was supposed to have been the last installment in the franchise at the time.\n\nAfter starring in poorly received \"Oscar\" (1991) and \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\" (1992) during the early 90s, he made a big comeback in 1993 with the movie \"Cliffhanger\" which became an really successful movie making over US$255 million worldwide. Later that year he enjoyed another hit with the futuristic action movie \"Demolition Man\" which made over $158 million worldwide. His come back success continued with 1994's \"The Specialist\" (over $170 million worldwide). \n\nIn 1995, he played the comic book based character Judge Dredd who was taken from the well known British comic book 2000 AD in the movie of the same name. The money he made from foregin countries saved the domestic box office disappointment of \"Judge Dredd\" with a worldwide tally of $113 million. He also appeared in the thriller \"Assassins\" (1995) with the other stars Julianne Moore and Antonio Banderas. In 1996, he starred in the disaster movie \"Daylight\" which made only $33 million in the U.S but was a major hit overseas making $126 million, totaling $159,212,469 worldwide.\n\nThat same year Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the Trey Parker and Matt Stone short comedy movie \"Your Studio and You\" commissioned by the Seagram Company for a party celebrating their earning of Universal Studios and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he was saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a wine cooler and calls him a \"brainiac\". In response, Stallone says, \"Thank you very much.\" He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, \"Fucking cheap studio!\"\n\nFollowing his amazing performance in \"Rocky\", critic Roger Ebert had once said Stallone could become the next Marlon Brando, although he never received the same critical praise achieved with \"Rocky\". Stallone did, however, go on to receive much approval for his role in the crime drama \"Cop Land\" (1997) in which he starred alongside Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. The movie was only a small success at the box office. His performance led him to win the Stockholm International movie Festival Best Actor Award. In 1998 he did voice-over work for the computer-animated movie \"Antz,\" which made over $90 million domestically.\n\nStallone starred in the thriller \"Get Carter\" — a remake of the 1971 British Michael Caine movie of the same name—but the movie was not very well received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined a lot after the movies \"Driven\" (2001), \"Avenging Angelo\" (2002) and \"D-Tox\" (2002). \n\nIn 2000, Stallone received a \"Worst Actor of the Century\" Razzie award, citing \"95% of Everything He's Ever Done\" rather than one movie. By 2000, Stallone had been awarded four Worst Actor Razzie awards for individual movies. These include a \"Worst Screen Couple\" Razzie, and a \"Worst Actor of the Decade\" Razzie for the 1980s. He had been nominated for the Worst Actor award for nine different years from 1984 to 1992.\n\nIn 2003, he played as a villain in the third movie of the Spy Kids trilogy \"\" which was a huge box office success (almost $200 million worldwide). Stallone also had a small appearance in the 2003 French movie \"Taxi 3\" as a passenger.\n\nFollowing several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain fame for his role in the crime drama \"Shade\" (2003) which was a box office failure but was praised by critics. He was also supposed to star and direct a movie about the murder of rappers Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls, entitled \"Notorious\", but the movie was not made due to legal issues presented by the 2009 movie of the same name.\n\nIn 2005, he was the co-presenter alongside Sugar Ray Leonard of the NBC Reality television boxing series \"The Contender\". That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series \"Las Vegas\". In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon Hulk Hogan, who appeared in \"Rocky III\" as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the small part in Rocky \"III\".\n\nAfter taking a break from making movies, Stallone made a comeback in 2006 with the sixth and final installment of his successful Rocky series; \"Rocky Balboa\", which was both a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous and presumed last movie \"Rocky V\", Stallone had decided to end the series with a sixth movie which would be a more appropriate ending to the series. The total domestic box office came to $70.3 million (and $155.3 million worldwide). The budget of the movie was only $24 million. His performance in \"Rocky Balboa\" has been praised by mostly positive reviews.\n\nWhen he was asked in February 2008 about which of the icons he would want to be remembered for, Stallone said \"it's a tough one, but \"Rocky\" is my first baby, so \"Rocky\".\"\n\nStallone worked on \"The Expendables\", starring, writing, and directing. \n\nHe has said that he wants to adapt the Nelson DeMille novel, \"The Lion's Game\". He wants to direct a movie on Edgar Allan Poe's life, a script that he has been preparing for years. It has also been been confirmed that he will be making a fifth \"Rambo\" movie after the success of the fourth one in 2008.\n\nStallone's first work as a director came in 1978 with \"Paradise Alley\", which he wrote and starred in. He also directed \"Staying Alive\" (the sequel to \"Saturday Night Fever\"), along with \"Rocky II\", \"Rocky III\", \"Rocky IV\", \"Rocky Balboa\", and \"Rambo\". Stallone wrote all six \"Rocky\" films, He also wrote \"Cobra\", \"Driven\" and \"Rambo.\" He has co-written several other movies, such as \"F.I.S.T.\", \"Rhinestone\", \"Over the Top\" and the first three Rambo movies. His last major success as a co-writer was with 1993's \"Cliffhanger\".\n\nStallone has always been considered a opponent to Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero actor. Hints to this have been made in both of their movies. In Schwarzenegger's \"Last Action Hero\", Stallone is seen as playing the Terminator in a video advertisement in the film's real life. In Stallone's \"Demolition Man\", there is a futuristic reference to the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Also in the movie \"Twins\", Arnold Schwarzenegger walks by a giant movie poster for \"Rambo III\". He glances at the size of Stallone's biceps on the poster, and then he feels his own and laughs at how much smaller Stallone's are. According to both Stallone and Schwarzenegger, despite their on camera \"rivalry\", they are both very close friends. While promoting the movies \"Rocky Balboa\" and \"Rambo\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", Stallone revealed that in the 1980s he and Schwarzenegger looked at each other as \"Cain and Abel.\" Stallone then said that, in the 1990s, he and Arnold became the friends they are today. They became one time business partners in Planet Hollywood.\n\nStallone has been married three times. At age 28, on December 28, 1974, he married Sasha Czack.

It is mainly intended to be an exercise show. It is also meant to be silly, and to get children thinking. The show is similar to \"Teletubbies\" in that both have a science fiction theme. The Boohbahs are five furry round creatures. They are meant to be atoms of energy.\n\nThere are 104 episodes in total. Each episode runs for 25 minutes. In the United Kingdom, the programme started on 14 April 2003 on ITV. It was divided into two series of 52 episodes each. The second series began on 16 March 2004.\n\nIn the United States, the programme started on 5 January 2004 on PBS.

They are played by actors in full body costumes. Their on sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights that have big eyes. Their eyebrows are rows of lights.

That accident killed 30 people directly, as well as damaging approximately $7 billion of property. A study published in 2005 estimates that there will eventually be up to 4,000 additional cancer deaths related to the accident among those exposed to significant radiation levels. Radioactive fallout from the accident was concentrated in areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Approximately 350,000 people were forcibly resettled away from these areas soon after the accident.\n\nSome of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To-date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union.\nNormal Accidents is a 1984 book by Yale sociologist Charles Perrow, which provides a detailed analysis of complex systems from a social sciences perspective. It was the first to characterize complex technological systems such as nuclear power plants according to their riskiness. Perrow says that multiple and unexpected failures are built into society's complex and tightly-coupled systems. Such accidents cannot be designed around.\nThe inspiration for Perrow's books was the 1979 Three Mile Island accident, where a nuclear accident resulted from an unanticipated interaction of multiple failures in a complex system. The event was an example of a normal accident because it was \"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable\".\n\nPerrow's argument rests on three principles. Firstly, people make mistakes, even at nuclear plants. Secondly, big accidents almost always escalate from very small beginnings. Thirdly, many failures are those of organizations more than technology. Each of these principles is still relevant today.\n\nSome of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps.

It is also called the great grey kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. An eastern grey male weighs about 66 kg (145 lb.) and is almost 2 m (6 ft.) tall. Its scientific name, \"Macropus giganteus\" means gigantic (huge) large-foot, and the eastern grey is the second biggest marsupial on earth. The red kangaroo is the largest. \n\nIndigenous Australian names for the eastern grey include \"iyirrbir\" and \"kucha\". The eastern grey kangaroo was first seen by Europeans when Captain James Cook was fixing his ship near Cooktown, Queensland. He took a sample of this unknown aminal back to England to be examined. The eastern grey is also the kangaroo on the Australian Coat of Arms. Captain John Hunter, later Governor of New South Wales painted a watercolour in 1788, of the eastern grey which was published in his book, \"Birds and Flowers of New South Wales, painted on the spot in 1788, 1789 and 1790\". This painting can be seen online here.\n\nThe eastern grey has a soft grey, or sometimes brown fur. The fur on the chest and stomach is more pale, sometimes white. They have a small head and large ears. Their tails are about long. The male is much larger than the female. They have long eye lashes which protect their eyes from the sun. They live for around 15–20 years. Because they are marsupials, the female carries its young in special pouch. Babies are born about five weeks after mating. The tiny baby which is only about 15 millimetres long, and weighs less than one gram, crawls up into the pouch. Inside the pouch there are four nipples. The baby kangaroo, called a joey, will only use one of the nipples. It lives in the pouch for about eight months. It still drinks milk from its mother until about 18 months of age. The mother is able to have another joey in the pouch, which feeds from a different nipple. The mother provides a different mix of milk to each nipple. A joey can remain with its mother until it becomes an adult, at about four years old.\n\nThe eastern grey is the species most commonly seen in Australia. It lives near the big cities of the south and east coast. It likes open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter. Like all kangaroos, it is mainly a nocturnal animal, and it is crepuscular, which means it is active early in the morning, and early in the evening. They live in large groups of up to 100 kangaroos, called \"mobs'.\n\nThe eastern grey is a herbivore, which means it grass and small shrubs. It mainly eats during early morning and evening. They do not need to drink water as they can get enough moisture from the plants that they eat.\n\nThe eastern grey kangaroo can travel very fast over land. They can jump up to in a single leap. The fastest recorded speed of any kangaroo was set by a large female eastern grey kangaroo. Kangaroos use less energy if they travel faster. When they go slowly they walk on all four legs, and use their tail as well.\n\nIt is often said that kangaroo numbers have increased since the Europen settlement of Australia. There are more areas of grassland and less forest, less dingos, and more man made watering holes. The current population of the species is about two million. Because of this the eastern grey has been killed in some parts of Australia to stop them from eating all the grass and then dying from starvation.\n", "id": "175064", "title": "Eastern grey kangaroo"}

Her usual musical instrument is a guitar. Her songs include \"Big Yellow Taxi\", \"Woodstock\" (about the 1969 Woodstock Festival), \"Free Man In Paris\", \"Help Me\" and \"Both Sides Now\". Her name Mitchell comes from her first marriage (to Chuck Mitchell).\n\nShe first began singing folk music while she attended art school, to earn spending money. In time, her songs and style got her noticed, and she became a professional musician. She signed a recording contract, and her first album appeared in 1968. \"Both Sides Now\" also boosted the musical career of Judy Collins, another folksinger, whose cover version became a popular hit. She also performs in the contralto range.\n\nMitchell had romantic relationships with Stephen Stills and David Crosby, both of the band Crosby, Stills & Nash. She also did artwork for one of their album covers. She was scheduled to appear at the Woodstock Festival, as CSN was (joined by Neil Young), but she had to cancel. Her song \"Woodstock\" still became a hit for CSN, and summed up for many people the meaning of the festival.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Mitchell changed from folk music to jazz, and she lost some of her fans. Many other people enjoyed her later music, though, including an album she made with Charles Mingus, a legendary jazz musician. The album was Mingus's last project before his death.\n\nNot all of Mitchell's records have been hits, and she resisted compiling a \"best-ofs\" or \"greatest hits\" album for many years, feeling that if she did so, her career would be \"over\". She did finally release a pair of recordings, \"Hits\" (which contained her biggest hit records) and \"Misses\" (which included some of her favorite songs, that were not hits). She continues to perform, and to paint pictures. Her paintings are displayed in galleries around the world.\n\nBefore she became famous, Mitchell gave up a newborn daughter for adoption in Canada. During the 1990s, the two got back in contact, and now have a good relationship.\n\nThough she first became famous during the 1960s, Mitchell does not that era. She reminds listeners of the negative parts of it, and encourages them to make the present better.\n\nIn March 2015, Mitchell was found unconscious in her Los Angeles home. She regained consciousness in an ambulance on her way to hospital, but was taken to intensive care for tests.She had a brain aneurysm.

He was one of the greatest conductors of his time. He grew up in Germany, but later became an Austrian and, when the Nazis came to power, he moved to several other countries, finally settling in the United States where he became an American citizen. His name was originally Bruno Schlesinger but from 1896 he was usually known as Bruno Walter. Walter became his official surname in 1911 when he became an Austrian citizen.\n\nBruno was born into a Jewish family in Berlin. He had his early musical education at the Stern Conservatory when he was eight, and played the piano in public when he was nine. He went to concerts which were conducted by the great Hans von Bülow. Two years later, in 1891, he heard Wagner operas in Bayreuth. These experiences made him want to be a conductor.\n\nBruno started his conducting career at the Cologne Opera in 1894. Later that year he went to the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director. There he met and worked with Gustav Mahler, from whom he learned a lot. Mahler found him a job conducting at the opera house in Breslau. This is when he changed his name from Schlesinger (meaning: “someone from Silesia”) to “Walter”. He then went to Riga, returning to Berlin in 1900 where he conducted at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden where he worked with famous people such as Richard Strauss and Karl Muck.\n\nIn 1901 Mahler invited Walter to be his assistant at the Court Opera in Vienna. At his first performance he conducted Verdi's \"Aida\". He was becoming very famous all over Europe. He performed in Prague and in London where in 1910 he conducted \"Tristan und Isolde\" and Ethel Smyth's \"The Wreckers\" at Covent Garden. A few months after Mahler's death in 1911, Walter led the first performance of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" in Munich, as well as Mahler's Symphony No. 9 in Vienna the next year.\n\nWalter became an Austrian citizen in 1911, but two years later he went to Germany to become the Royal Bavarian Music Director in Munich. The next year Walter conducted his first concert in Moscow. He continued to conduct during First World War, conducting operas by composers including Erich Korngold and Hans Pfitzner. Among his friends in Munich was Eugenio Pacelli who later became Pope Pius XII.\n\nWalter left Munich in 1922 and went to New York the next year. He conducted the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall. He later conducted in Detroit, Minnesota and Boston. \n\nWhen he returned to Europe, Walter was invited to play in many places, including Berlin Leipzig, Milan (La Scala) and London, where he was chief conductor of the German seasons at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1931. \n\nIn the late 1920s, the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler often complained that conductors at the Berlin opera were Jews. He often talked about Walter, adding that his real name was “Schlesinger”. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Walter left Austria. He often conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra and was invited to conduct concerts in New York with the New York Philharmonic. When the Nazi’s took power in Austria (the Anschluss) Walter was conducting in Paris. France offered Walter French citizenship. His daughter was in Vienna. She was arrested by the Nazis, but Walter managed to persuade them to free her.\n\nOn 1 November, 1939, he sailed to the United States where he lived for the rest of his life. His home was in Beverly Hills, California. Many people who lived there had fled from Europe because of the Nazis. They became his friends. They included the German writer Thomas Mann. He worked with many famous American orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. After the war he often came back to Europe. He performed at the Edinburgh Festival and in Salzburg, Vienna and Munich. In his later life he made many stereo recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. He made his last live concert appearance on 4 December, 1960 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and pianist Van Cliburn. His last recording was a series of Mozart overtures with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at the end of March in 1961. Bruno Walter died of a heart attack in his Beverly Hills home in 1962.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1961 Walter made hundreds of recordings. The earlier recordings, made at a time when his conducting was at its best, are often rather poor recordings. When he made his last recordings, after stereo records had been invented, he was already quite ill. In his early years he gave some of the first performances of Mahler’s music. He conducted the first performance of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" with the Vienna Philharmonic. In 1936 he made the first recording of the same work with the same orchestra which still had the same leader: Arnold Rosé who was Mahler’s brother-in-law. This recording was made just before the Nazi Anschluss which forced Walter and Rosé into exile. Many years later, in 1952, Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic once again made a famous recording of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" with the singers Kathleen Ferrier and Julius Patzak. He also recorded Mahler’s Ninth Symphony. Since Walter had worked closely with Mahler, and Mahler had never conducted either of these two great works of his, we can imagine that Walter’s recordings show us how Mahler might have wanted the music to be played.\nWalter made many recordings of other great Germanic composers, such as Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Johannes Brahms, Johann Strauss II., and Anton Bruckner.\n\nWalter was known as a kind, modest man, quite unlike some other conductors of the time who behaved like dictators. He was an excellent pianist and sometimes accompanied singers such as Kathleen Ferrier at recitals. He also composed several works. He wrote an autobiography called “Theme and Variations”.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Fiat money differs from commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is based on a \"good\", often a precious metal such as gold or silver, which is desired or has other uses. Representative money is a claim on the commodity rather than the actual good. In that case, the gold stays in a bank, and its ownership changes from time to time as the money is used. Why might a good be used at all? One reason is that governments cannot just make it. It is said that this stops inflation because, with fiat money, governments can just print more.\n\nSome economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit. This means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries.\n\nAlan Greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that \"Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth\".

At long, it is the second longest river in California, after the Sacramento River. It begins on the west Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows west and north to its end at San Francisco Bay, at the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. \nIts basin, which is about 32,000 square miles (82,879 square kilometers) in size, contains mostly farmland. The river provides drinking water to over 22 million California citizens. Its three largest tributaries are the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers.\n\nThe river was once one of the richest river ecosystems in California. However, now over of the river is dry except during floods, because lots of water has been taken away for irrigation. In fact, below Friant Dam, a dam built in the 1940s on the San Joaquin River, 95 percent of the river's flow is dry. Much of the river is polluted, destroying the historic population of chinook salmon, once the southernmost in the United States. Pesticides, selenium, and many more toxic materials are carried by the San Joaquin into San Francisco Bay.\n\nNow, one of the largest projects in the American West has been begun to restore the San Joaquin River. On September 13, 2006, the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with Friant Dam users and the United States Department of the Interior. This agreement would restore the San Joaquin River below the dam, reducing pollution.\n\nThree forks of the San Joaquin River join to form the San Joaquin River at two places, called \"Balloon Dome\" and \"Junction Butte\". \n\nThe river continues west into the Central Valley of California, and is joined by many other rivers flowing off the Sierra Nevada mountains.

The Tuolumne and Merced river both flow out of Yosemite National Park. \n\nAs the river flows north and west, it is joined by the following tributaries:\n\n\nThe San Joaquin River and its tributaries pass through/feed the following lakes and reservoirs:\n\n\nSeveral man-made channels are also part of the river system:\n\nThe San Joaquin River eventually meets the Sacramento River, forming the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is one of the biggest estuaries in the United States. It is near the city of Antioch. At this place, the San Joaquin River splits into two rivers: the \"Old River\" and the \"Middle River\". The Old River sometimes confuses fish to go down its channel. As a result, a wall is built between the San Joaquin River and the Old River.\n\nBefore humans began to develop the Central Valley in the 1850s, the San Joaquin River and its surrounding lands were one of the richest biological habitats in California. In winter, the river would flood the valley, leaving behind wetlands. These wetlands became rich habitat for birds and other animals. The habitat of the endangered \"San Joaquin Kit Fox\" and the \"riparian brush rabbit\" also was near the San Joaquin River. \n\nIn 1942, a big dam, Friant Dam, was built on the San Joaquin River. This dam took away a lot of water from the river, to irrigate crops, provide drinking water, and provide electricity. The dam destroyed the salmon habitat in the river, and also destroyed the creation of these wetlands. \n\nThe Friant Dam is:\n\nThe San Joaquin River has been used a lot for shipping of products via boats and ships, otherwise known as navigation. The river was first used for navigation during the California Gold Rush of 1849. Boats carried people over up the river to look for gold in the mountains.

Both rivers merge eventually and empty into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay. \nThe capital of California, Sacramento, is located in the north part of the Central Valley. In total, the Central Valley is around long.\n\nThe Central Valley has 18 California counties. 15 of these counties are among the 25 most productive farmland in California. Overall, the Central Valley economy depends on farming. However, this has led to serious environmental damages, such as pesticides and selenium and other bad materials being washed into the rivers and polluting the San Francisco Bay.\n\nThe valley floor is a flat, smooth land area covering about 42,000 square miles (108,779 square kilometers) in size, long, and wide. It covers 18 California counties. These counties are:\n\n-from north to south.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada mountains are on the east side of the valley. These mountains are very tall and steep. Lots of rivers and streams flow off the Sierra Nevada. The highest mountain in the Sierra Nevada is Mount Whitney (14,495') which is also the tallest mountain in California and the rest of the United States (except for Alaska and Hawaii). On the west side, there is the California Coast Ranges, an extension of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its highest point is approximately 8,848'.\n\nThe Sacramento River begins in the north part of the Central Valley, near Mount Shasta. It actually begins in the Cascade Range, which are mountains north of the Central Valley, though most of its length is in the Central Valley. The Sacramento River flows south about to San Francisco Bay. Some of its tributaries include the Pit River, Feather River, and American River.

The Sacramento Valley has a \"Mediterranean climate\". This means that it has warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The San Joaquin Valley is much hotter and drier. Most of it is \"Mediterranean steppe\", which is similar to Mediterranean except that it is warmer and drier. Some of it, however, can be close to desert climate. This section of the Central Valley is said to have the worst air quality in California.\n\nThe Central Valley is home to about 6.5 million people.

In contrast, the population density of Los Angeles, the biggest city in California, is 25,904 people per square mile.\n\nFarming (agriculture) has always been the main economy of the Central Valley. Except for the city of Sacramento, where the focus is on the government, the rest is mostly agricultural. Immigrants provide a large amount of the work done in farms in the Central Valley. Overall, 12.3% of jobs in the Central Valley are directly agriculture related. Not including Sacramento County, the percentage is 16%.\n\nThe main road transport routes through the Central Valley are Interstate 5 and California State Route 99. These two highways run from north to south. Interstate 5 is the larger of the two, and carries more traffic. Highway 99 is older than Interstate 5. The Highway 99 separates from Route 5 at the south end of the Central Valley, and joins again at the north end of the valley.\n\nThe Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) go through the Central Valley as well. Some of their branch lines include:\nAmtrak is one of the main rail service providers in the Central Valley, and is also popular in much of the rest of California.\n\nThe 715-mile (1,150 km) California Aqueduct, the longest aqueduct in California, runs through the Central Valley.

SMAs are offered by financial consultants and brokerage firms, and managed by independent \"money managers.\" A money manager is simply a business that manages stock and other securities portfolios or baskets of investments for an investor. SMAs have varying fee structures. Common characteristics of SMA programs are: they provide open investment choices; have multiple managers; and, offer a customized investment portfolio created for a client's specific needs. By customizing the portfolio, investors can limit the investment risk with various strategies, such as using stock options, according to the Wall Street Journal. \n\nSMAs were first introduced in the US in the 1970s by the former investment firm EF Hutton Since that time, SMAs have grown in popularity, are offered in the US, UK, Australia and other countries. For some investors, Separately Managed Accounts are rivals to mutual funds and other types of investments. \n\nWhile there is no long-term research that compares SMAs’ performance to that of mutual funds or other investment categories, the available research does show them as a strong competitor.\n\nMorningstar Inc., a fund research firm, released research that showed that SMAs beat mutual funds in 2008. Morningstar said that SMAs outperformed mutual funds in 25 of 36 stock and bond market categories that year. In addition, Morningstar said that from 2006 to 2008, SMAs surpassed mutual funds in 22 of 26 categories. \n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Separately Managed Accounts may beat popular mutual funds because SMAs “…tend to have smaller amounts of assets than popular mutual funds, allowing them to trade more nimbly.\" \n\nUnlike mutual funds, SMAs permit the investor to tailor their basket of stocks and bonds which can limit the investment risk. \"Registered Rep\", an investment trade magazine, said that SMAs also can provide \ntax advantages that may not be available with mutual funds and other investments. \n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" recognized top SMA performers including PTI Securities & Futures LP’s “Protected Index Program” and Robinson Value Management Ltd’s “Market Opportunity Composite Strategy.” \n\n\"Pensions & Investments\", a US investment trade magazine, reported on several of the highest performing SMAs for 2008.\n\nFinancial experts point out that past performance of any investment is not a predictor of future performance.

Taifas developed during the history of Iberia. They were usually emirates or little kingdoms, but there was one oligarchy as well. A number of taifas formed in the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) after the end of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordóba in 1031.\n\nThe reason that taifas developed was that there was an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and also an ethnic division of the elite of this state. It was divided among Arabs (they werde a powerful but tiny minority), Berbers, Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims (known as \"Muladíes\" (those were the great majority). \n\nThere was a second period when taifas developed. That was about the middle of the 12th century, when the Almoravid rulers were in decline.\n\nIn the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century, the \"emirs\" (rulers) of thr taifas competed very much among themselves, not only militarily but also for cultural . They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans.\n\nAfter the end of the Caliphate the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones, and had to submit to them and to pay tribute. \n\nThe \"taifa\" princes appealed for North African warriors to help them fighting Christian kings on two occasions. The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo (1085), and the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon (1147). These warriors did not in fact help the \"taifa\" emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires.\n\nTaifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms (both Christian and Muslim). The most dynamic taifa, which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion, was Seville. Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive, but by the neighbour Christian states of the Pyrenees.

For example, the most common base used today is the decimal system. Because \"dec\" means 10, it uses the 10 digits from 0 to 9. Most people think that we most often use base 10 because we have 10 fingers.\n\nA base can be any whole number bigger than 0 (if it was 0, then there would be no digits). The base of a number may be written next to the number: for instance, formula_1means 23 in base 8 (which is equal to 19 in base 10). \n\nDifferent bases are often used in computers. Binary (base 2) is used because at the most simple level, computers can only deal with 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal (base 16) is used because of how computers group binary digits together. Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them. Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal, the six digits after 9 are shown as A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\nThe oldest systems of counting used base one. Making marks on a wall, using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting. Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix (base twelve). This is shown in English, as there are words such as dozen (12) and gross (144 = 12x12), and lengths such as feet (12 inches).\n\nWhen typing a base, the small number indicating the base is usually in base 10. This is because if the radix was written in the base it is, it would always be 10, so there would be no way of knowing what base it was. \n\nHere are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases.\n", "id": "175779", "title": "Base (mathematics)"}

It is sometimes called the \"blue bubble\", or \"man-of-war\". Its common name comes from a Portuguese war ship of the 15th and 16th century. The ship had triangular sails, similar in shape to the bladder of the man o' war.\n\nThe Portuguese Man o' War has a reputation for swarming in groups of thousands. It is also known for its powerful sting.\n\n\"Physalia\" is not a single animal: it is a siphonophore. This is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids. Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid does not have some structure and functions. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.\n\nA similar group of animals are the chondrophores. They are specialized hydroids, which also float at the surface of the open ocean.\n\nThe loggerhead turtle feeds on the Portuguese man o' war. It is a common part of the turtle's diet. The skin of the turtle is too thick for the man o' war's sting to enter and launch its venom. The sea slug \"Glaucus atlanticus\" and the violet snail \"Janthina janthina\" also feed on the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus \"Tremoctopus\" is immune to the venom of the Portuguese man o' war. The blanket octopus has been known to rip off the man o' war's tentacles and use them for defensive purposes.\n\nThe Portuguese man o' war is often found with many different kinds of marine fish. Some of them are shepherd fish, clown fish and yellow jack. These species are rarely found anywhere else. The clown fish can swim among the tentacles without being stung. This is possibly due to its mucus that does not trigger the nematocysts. The shepherd fish seems to avoid the larger, stinging tentacles. It feeds on the smaller tentacles under the gas bladder. These fish benefit from the shelter by the stinging tentacles.

Media studies students may see themselves as observers of media, not creators or practitioners. These distinctions are different depending on the country where students live.\n\nThe development of media studies was sparked by the growth of new media in the post-Second World War period.

Hurricane Mitch was one of the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. Mitch was the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane because it killed 11,000-18,000 in Central America and Mexico, it is second only to the Great Hurricane of 1780. Mitch also caused over $5 billion in damage. Because the damage and deaths were very high, the name \"Mitch\" was retired and will never be used for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean again. It was in 1998 and hit Florida, Central America, Nicaragua and the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nOn October 10 a tropical wave moved off of Africa. It stayed as a tropical wave because the conditions in Atlantic wasn't good enough for it to become a tropical depression or tropical storm. The tropical wave became Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 22, because conditions became better. On October 23 Tropical Depression Thirteen strengthened and became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch made a small loop after becoming a tropical storm and then turned north. \n\nTropical Storm Mitch strengthened and became Hurricane Mitch on October 24. Hurricane Mitch then turned west. Mitch strengthened very fast and on October 26 Mitch reached its top winds. Its top winds were are 180 mph making it a category 5. Mitch stayed as a category 5 turned south. \n\nMitch started weakening on October 27 and by October 29 Mitch was only a category 1. On October 29 Hurricane Mitch made landfall in Honduras, with the winds at 80 mph. Mitch quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Mitch moved very slowly and almost froze over Honduras. Tropical Storm Mitch weakened into a tropical depression as it entered Guatemala. \n\nAs Tropical Depression Mitch entered Mexico it became a remnant low and was not a tropical depression anymore. The remains entered the Bay of Campeche and became Tropical Storm Mitch again on November 3. Mitch moved northeast and made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula. Mitch weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucatán Peninsula. Once Tropical Depression Mitch reached the Gulf of Mexico it became Tropical Storm Mitch. Tropical Storm Mitch continued northeast and made landfall in Naples, Florida on November 5 as a tropical storm with the winds at 65 mph. \n\nAfter Tropical Storm Mitch crossed Florida it became extratropical and was no longer a tropical storm. The remains were last seen on November 9 north of Great Britain. \n\nMany countries of the in Central American Region had record amounts of rainfall.\n\nThe worst affects from the hurricane were seen in Honduras, where Mitch caused 7,000 deaths and $3.8 billion in damage. In Honduras rainfall could have been up to 75 inches. Crops in Honduras were impacted very badly, Mitch destroyed, 58% of the corn output, 24% of sorghum, 14% of rice, and 6% of the bean crop. Mitch also destroyed 85% of banana, 60% of sugar cane, 29% of melons, 28% of African palms, and 18% of coffee. Just the crop damage from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras was at $900 million. \n\nAlso in Nicaragua rainfall may have been up to 50 inches. The rains stopped a volcano in Nicaragua, instead the volcano caused a mudslide. The mudslide covered an area 10 miles long and 5 miles wide. Hurricane Mitch left between 500,000 and 800,000 people homeless. Damaged in Nicaragua totaled to $1 billion and at least 3,800 were killed in Nicaragua. \n\nIn the U.S. only Florida was affected. In Florida, Mitch destroyed buildings in the Keys that were damaged by Hurricane Georges. Mitch killed 2 people and left $40 million in damage. \n\nHurricane Mitch caused rain all the way down to Panama, where the hurricane killed 3 people. Offshore in the Caribbean Sea the hurricane sunk a boat causing 31 people to drowned. In Costa Rica Hurricane Mitch caused about 4,000 people to become homeless. Hurricane Mitch caused mudslides that affected nearly 800 miles of road. Hurricane Mitch left $92 million in damage and killed 7 people. In El Salvador the flooding from Mitch destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. Hurricane Mitch also killed 10,000 cattle. In El Salvador the damage from Mitch was at $400 million and 240 people were killed. In Guatemala Hurricane Mitch caused 6,000 houses to be destroyed and damaged 20,000 others. Damage just the banana and coffee exports were at $325 million. Mitch caused a plane to crash leaving 11 people to get killed indirectly, Mitch also caused 268 people to get killed directly. Damages left from Mitch in Guatemala was at $748 million. In Belize Mitch caused some crop damage and damage many roads. Damage in Belize was not as bad as it could have been. Mitch killed 11 in Belize, but no one knows the damage it caused. \nHurricane Mitch caused waves about 7 feet in Jamaica. Mitch killed about 3 people, but no one knows the damage. Also, a house in Spanish Town was destroyed. \n\nBecause of the deaths and damage the name Mitch was removed and retired. Meaning, the name will not be used again to name a storm in the Atlantic Ocean. In 2004 the name Matthew was used instead. The name Matthew will be used again in 2010 because it was not retired.\n", "id": "175887", "title": "Hurricane Mitch"}

It forms when the particles that make it up have very low energy. Only bosons can make a Bose–Einstein condensate, when they are close to 0 °K (or −273 °C, or −459.67 °F). The gas has extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air.\n\nA Bose–Einstein condensate is a change of state. When matter is in the BEC state it has zero viscosity. Superfluidity and superconductivity are both closely connected with the BEC state of matter.\n\nParticles can only have a set amount of energy. They either have the energy to bounce around in gases or just the energy to flow like a liquid or be fixed like a solid. If you take enough of the particle's energy away you get to the tiniest or the smallest amount of energy possible. This is a Bose–Einstein condensate. This makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions, they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way, forming something called a 'giant matter wave'.fifth state of matter on the basic of chemical properties\n\nThe Bose-Einstein Condensate was first suggested by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–25. Seventy years later its existence was proved. Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman made the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995 at the University of Colorado. Cornell, Wieman, and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT were then given the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nUsually to get anything cold enough to make a Bose–Einstein condensate you have to first trap the stuff using magnets and then, by bouncing lasers off them, take all of their energy away through red shift. This still does not get things quite cold enough. Some of the particles will still be bouncing around a lot and only some will be lying down nicely. The magnetic field is then slowly lowered bit by bit to let the faster bouncing particles out. This just leaves us with the coldest and slowest atoms inside.\n", "id": "175981", "title": "Bose–Einstein condensate"}

She was the English author of \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\", and is one of the most famous cookbook writers.\n\nIsabella was born at 24 Milk Street, Cheapside, London, England. Her father, Benjamin Mayson, died when she was young and her mother, Elizabeth Jerram later married Henry Dorling, who was a widower and he had four children of his own. They lived in Epsom, Surrey where Henry was Clerk of Epsom Racecourse. Isabella was sent to school in Heidelberg, Germany, where she became a very good pianist. When she finished school, she went back to Epsom.\n\nIsabella's husband, Samuel Orchart Beeton, was also born in Milk Street. Even after the move to Epsom the two mothers of Samuel and Isabella kept talking to one another. On a visit to London, Isabella was introduced to Samuel Beeton who had become a publisher of books and popular magazines. They married on 10 July 1856 at Epsom Parish Church. In August of that year they moved into their first home, a large Italianate property at 2 Chandos Villas on the Woodridings Estate in Hatch End.\n\nTheir first child, Samuel Orchart, was born in May 1857 but he died of croup in August of that year. In September 1859, another son was born, and his name was also Samuel Orchart.\n\nDuring Isabella's time in Hatch End she began to write articles on cooking and how to manage a house for her husband's publications. In 1859–1861, she wrote something every month for \"The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine\". In October 1861, the writings were published as a single book, \"The Book of Household Management\".\n\nThe Beetons left Hatch End in the autumn of 1861. In December of that year their son became sick with scarlet fever while on holiday in Brighton. He died on New Year's Eve. Mrs. Beeton gave birth to two other sons, Orchart (on New Year's Eve in 1863) and Mayson Moss (in January 1865).\n\nThe book was very well known as \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\", it was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and . \n\nThe book had 1,112 pages, and over 900 of the pages were recipes. Because many of the pages were recipes, it became known as \"Mrs Beeton's Cookbook\". Most of the recipes were illustrated with colored pictures, and it was the first book to show recipes in a way that is still used today. It is said that many of the recipes were actually taken from earlier writers (including Eliza Acton), but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was supposed to be a guide of reliable information for the middle class people. Mrs Beeton is described better as the books and editor than as its author, because many of the passages were not in her own words.\n\nThe day after the birth of her fourth child, in January 1865, Isabella became sick with puerperal fever. She died a week later at the age of 28. Her widower lived for another twelve years.

It borders Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay as well as the Center-West Region, the Southeast Region and the Atlantic Ocean. The region received many immigrants of Europe during the 19th century, who largely influenced the demography and cultural aspects of it. The main ethnic groups of Southern Brazil are Brazilians of Portuguese, German and Italian descent.\n\nThe capital of Paraná state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area.\n\nIt is the only region of Brazil located outside the tropical zone, with clear variations about the seasons. In winter there are frosts and rarely snow. The relief is just a bit hilly, with a predominance of a large plateau, in general low.\n\nWhat most characterizes the South is the way it was colonized and kind of colonizers received. Received short black slaves, but many Caucasian immigrants. The Europeans gave the population the predominance of white skin color, gave to the landscape marks of their original countries and introduced the system of medium and small farms.\n\nThe southern region has good social indicators : it has the highest HDI in Brazil (0.831), and the third highest GDP per capita of the country. The region is also, 94.8% of the population.\n\nThe region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maringá. It has a relatively high standard of living in many aspects, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13.396. The region is also the most literate, 94% literacy rate.\n\nSome places in the region must be emphasized, such as the Iguaçu Falls, (Natural Heritage and one of the New7Wonders of Nature) and the Ruins of St. Michael of the Missions (Cultural Heritage); the Itaipu Dam (the largest dam of the world, elected the as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World); the winter cities on mountains of the SC and RS; and the Botanical Garden of Curitiba, Southern Brazil greatest icon.\n\nThe first inhabitants of southern Brazil are the indigenous people. Then came the Spanish Jesuit priests to evangelize the Indians and dominate the land. The pioneers of São Paulo attacked the missions to arrest the Indians. So, the Jesuits and the Indians abandoned the place and the cattle got loose in the fields. The São Paulo pioneers became interested in the trade of cattle. On the way through which the troops passed villages have emerged. For many years, the Portuguese and Spaniards fought over land in the region.\n\nThe population of the South has grown with the arrival of the first European immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Germans, Italians, Poles, Ukrainians immigrated to the region, which also received Japanese, Arabs and Jews.\n\nThe capital of Paraná state, Curitiba, has the largest population and also the largest economy, and the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, has the largest metropolitan area.\n\nThe region received large numbers of European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture. The main ethnic origins of Southern Brazil are Portuguese, Italian, and German.\n\nPortuguese, the official language of Brazil, is spoken by the entire population. But in some places dialects of German or Italian origins are also spoken; some villages even use the language of immigrants. In Porto Alegre and Curitiba there are some Yiddish speakers.\n\nThe hydrography of Southern Brazil can be classified in three great regions of Watersheds: the Paraná River, the Uruguay River and the Southeast Brazil Rivers.\n\nThe rivers of the southern region are availed for navigation, irrigation agriculture, urban water supply and power generation. The most important rivers are voluminous and have great hydroelectric potential. The Itaipu Dam, on the Parana River, is exploring the potential for power generation in the region. This operation allows the South and the Southeast an increasing use of electricity for domestic and industrial use.\n\nOnly Brazilian region located almost entirely in a subtropical climate, the South is the coldest area of Brazil, with frost and even, in some places, the snowfall. The seasons are well defined and the rains are evenly distributed over the year.\n\nSouthern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12 °C (53.6 °F) and 22 °C (71.6 °F). Frost is very common and can snow in some mountain ranges.\n\nThe relief of the region is characterized by many plateaus that rises at altitudes up to more than 1,000 meters above sea level, decreasing altitude in the west, where the Paraná River at altitudes from 100 to 300 meters. Covering about 3/4 parts of the regional relief, this set is called \"Southern Plateau of Brazil\" and breaks down into plateaus that go from east to west.\n\nThe region has as main tourist attractions their natural beauty, beaches, historical cities and their European colonies, and the well-defined seasons, characterized by the severe winter.\n\nIn Paraná, the Iguassu Falls receive thousands of tourists every year, being the main destination for foreigners in the region. The state also has a geological site of approximately 340 million years, with huge rock formations. The capital, Curitiba, was considered the best southern city for tourism\n\nIn Santa Catarina the beaches receive many visitors, and the winter colonies in the state.\n\nThe Rio Grande do Sul state - like Santa Catarina - attracts tourists in winter to the cities in mountain, where the cold is intense.\n", "id": "176029", "title": "South Region of Brazil"}

He used to be the Minister-President of the state of Bavaria and the leader of the Christian Social Union party (CSU). On 18 January 2007, he said he no longer wanted to be minister-president and party leader by 30 September, after having been by his own party for weeks.\n\nEdmund Stoiber was born in Oberaudorf in the district of Rosenheim, Bavaria. Before he became a member of the Bavarian parliament in 1974, he was a lawyer and worked at the University of Regensburg. \n\nStoiber is married to Karin Stoiber. They have three children: Konstanze (1971), Veronika (1977), Dominik (1980) and three grandchildren: Johannes (1999), Benedikt (2001) and Theresa Marie (2005).\n\nStoiber was a student at Ignaz-Günther-Gymnasium in Rosenheim, where he received his Abitur (high school diploma) in 1961. He served the military with the mountain infantry division but had to leave because he hurt his knee. After his military service, Stoiber studied political science and later law in Munich. In 1967 he passed the state law exam and then worked at the University of Regensburg in criminal law and Eastern European law. He became a doctor of jurisprudence, and then in 1971 passed the second state examination.\n\nIn 1978 Stoiber was elected secretary general of the CSU, which he stayed until 1982/83. From 1982 to 1986 he was a representative to the Bavarian secretary of the state and then a minister of state from 1982 to 1988. From 1988 to 1993 he was the Bavarian Minister of the Interior and in May 1993, the Bavarian \"Landtag\" (parliament) elected him as minister-president. As such he served as President of the \"Bundesrat\" in 1995/96. In 1998, he was made leader of the CSU.\n\nIn 2002, Stoiber removed the leader of the CDU, Angela Merkel, and was made the joint CDU/CSU's candidate for the office of chancellor, with Gerhard Schröder (SPD) as opponent.\n\nBefore the 2002 election, the CSU/CDU was on top of the opinion polls and Stoiber said that \"...this election is like a football match where it's the second half and my team is ahead by 2-0\", a quote that has become famous. However, on election day things had changed. The SPD had a huge comeback and the CDU/CSU got less votes. Both the SPD and CDU/CSU had 38.5% of the vote, but the SPD was ahead by 6,000 votes. Gerhard Schröder was elected again as chancellor by the parliament. He joined together with the Green party. Many people think it was Stoiber's reaction to the floods in eastern Germany, shortly before the election, that made his party lose the vote. Also, Schröder made clear that he was against the Iraq war led by the United States.

About long, it flows from Canoga Park south and west to its end at the Long Beach Harbor, in San Pedro Bay, part of the Pacific Ocean. The basin is rimmed by the San Gabriel Mountains, Santa Monica Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains, as well as several smaller mountain ranges. Much of the water that flows in the Los Angeles River flows in from tributaries that come from the mountains.\n\nThe river was once free-flowing, winding across a floodplain that occupied much of the Los Angeles Basin. With its frequent floods, it often changed course, causing erosion and depositing silt in other places. When the city of Los Angeles had its first settlers around the 1850s, the river was its main water source. With the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, the Los Angeles River was no longer needed as a water source. Today, the Los Angeles River runs in a fixed course through a concrete channel for nearly its whole length. It is heavily polluted. The primary source of water during summer and fall is the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in Van Nuys. Plans for restoration of the river are being discussed.\n\nThe watershed of the Los Angeles River covers 834 square miles (2,135 square kilometers). The Santa Monica Mountains and smaller Simi Hills border it on the east side. On the west side lies the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains. Seven major tributaries flow into the Los Angeles River: Burbank Western Channel, Aliso Wash, Tujunga Wash, Verdugo Wash, Arroyo Seco, Compton Creek, and Rio Hondo. 360 square miles (920 square kilometers) of the watershed are open space, while the remaining 474 square miles (1,215 square kilometers) are highly developed with all kinds of land uses.\nThe river officially begins in a place called Canoga Park, in the San Fernando Valley. Bell Creek and Calabasas Wash (Arroyo Calabasas or Calabasas Creek; \"Calabasa\" is Spanish for \"pumpkin\") flow from opposite sides of the valley to a point () where the Los Angeles River officially begins. At this point, the river already flows in a concrete channel. In times of flood, the channel can move between per hour to up to \n\nTujunga Wash, Aliso Wash, and Brown's Canyon Wash join the river from the left. The river flows on to a basin called the \"Sepulveda basin\", controlled by a dam at its southeastern end. This basin is incredibly rich in wildlife and plants. Normally, there wouldn not be a year-round flow of water here. But because of 75 million gallons of water flowing into the river every day from the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, there is an year-round flow of water. This water is not suitable to be drinking water, but is safe to touch.\nAn important tributary, Verdugo Wash, flows in from the left. The Verdugo Wash begins in the Verdugo Hills and flows west to the Los Angeles River. Uniquely, the intersection of Interstate 5 and Route 134 is located right above this point. The Los Angeles River makes a great bend west around Griffith Park, a big park in the middle of Los Angeles. Here, the river has an earthen bottom, which is unique because most of the river is covered with concrete. Further downstream, there is a place uniquely named \"Frogtown\" because of the many frogs once found in the river there. Downstream from this place, the river picks up another important tributary, Arroyo Seco, on the left. (The name \"Arroyo Seco\" means \"dry creek\" in Spanish.) The Arroyo Seco begins in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows south to the Los Angeles River. One important feature of the Arroyo Seco is the giant Devil's Gate Dam. The Arroyo Seco is free-flowing in many places. \nAfter flowing a few more miles, the Los Angeles River becomes very wide. The final large tributary, Rio Hondo (Spanish for \"deep river\") flows in from the left, in the city of South Gate. Notably, the sediment here is over deep. Here, the threat of floods is always present. In fact, in a flood in 1992, the water was only a few inches below the top of the riverbank. As the river approaches San Pedro Bay and eventually the Pacific Ocean, it passes by the RMS Queen Mary, a retired ocean liner now a museum and hotel.\n\nThe Los Angeles River was originally a free-flowing river, running across a wide basin that would periodically flood. The river would have heavy flows in the winter and spring (rainy season) and little to no flow in the summer and fall (dry season). However, water being forced out of an aquifer below the Los Angeles Basin gave parts of the river an year-round flow. This phenomenon can still be seen today, most notably in a place called Griffith Park where water rises out of the ground and feeds the river.\n\nThe river was used for hundreds of years by Native Americans as a source of drinking water and food. When Spanish explorers came to the area in the 1760s, they named the river the Porciuncula, seeing that it was a good site for a settlement. The full name they gave the river was actually \"El Río de Nuestra Señora La Reina de Los Ángeles de Porciúncula\", which translated to English means: The River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciúncula. (Porciuncula is a small church in Italy.) But they were to soon find out, the Los Angeles River had, and still has, a long history of floods. Many times when the river flooded, it would change course from Ballona Creek, a stream flowing into Santa Monica Bay on the northeast; to its original channel flowing into San Pedro Bay. One big flood in 1825, it left Ballona Creek and flowed into its old channel, and Ballona Creek became a separate, long waterway. It still is that way today.\n\nThe city of Los Angeles rose beside the Los Angeles River, inland at the site of the old Spanish settlement. In 1889, San Pedro Bay, the place where the river flows into, was chosen as the city harbor. A series of railroads were needed to connect the city with the port. The most logical route was beside the river, since that was the smoothest land. With the railroads came industry, which rose up all along the lower Los Angeles River. With its disastrous flood history, and the fact that it was too shallow for boats, the river was finally forced into a concrete channel beginning in 1938. \n\n1938 was the same year that a terrible flood struck the region. From February 27 to March 1, 1938, a storm approached the California coast. Over 4.4 inches (11cm) of rain fell. That was the equivalent of one-fourth the average yearly rainfall in the area. Finally, on 5:45 AM on March 4, the rain ended, and the flood slowly dropped in level. it seemed similar to the earlier flood in 1934. Everyone thought that it was already over, but it was not. 15 hours later, another storm hit Southern California, dumping another 6-10 inches (15-25 cm) of rain. The soils of the region could not take in any more water from the rains of the past few days. The three major rivers in the region, the Los Angeles, San Gabriel, and the Santa Ana, burst their levees and flooded three California counties.\n\nIt was the 5th largest flood in the recorded history of the area. 5,601 houses were destroyed, 1,500 houses were damaged, and 800 cars were trapped in the mud. But Los Angeles County was not as affected as neighboring Riverside County and Orange County, for it was those two counties that suffered the worst floods.\n\nHowever, the flood was not as bad as it could have been. Fourteen flood control dams in the mountains and around the Los Angeles area held back huge amounts of water, which would otherwise add to the flood. These dams included the Hansen Dam, Big Tujunga Dam, and San Gabriel No. 1 and No. 2. At its peak, the Los Angeles River's flow was about 38,000 cubic feet (1,076 cubic meters) per second. The nearby San Gabriel River's flow, though, approached 100,000 cubic feet (2,832 cubic meters) per second. Most flooded of all was the \"crazy-mad\" Santa Ana River, which looked like a \"slightly smaller version of the Mississippi.\"\n\nMany restoration efforts to convert the river from a concrete-lined channel back to its natural state have been proposed recently. Also, some river conservation groups, most notably Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) have been created. \n\nThe Los Angeles River Master Plan was created in 1991 as a plan to restore a large stretch of the river and one of its large tributaries, the Tujunga Wash. Part of the incentive for the project is because the \"Great Wall of Los Angeles\", one of the largest murals in the world, is painted on the wall of the Tujunga Wash. Other than that, the plan seeks to improve recreation, health, property value, environment, and education in the communities surrounding the river; by building a series of parks. This helps to increase the open space available in Los Angeles; its open space percentage is uncharacteristically low. For example, the city of Boston has 9% open space, over twice as much as Los Angeles' 4% open space.\n\nNotably, the City of Los Angeles agreed in 2007, by a 12-0 vote, to spend some $2 billion USD over the next 50 years. The money will be used to fund over 200 separate projects, including parks, walkways, and pedestrian bridges; along a stretch of the river. Some factories and other buildings near the river will be removed so houses can be built closer to the river.\n\nThe biggest city beside the Los Angeles River is Los Angeles. There are many other cities and towns that lie beside the river.\n\n\nBridges that cross the Los Angeles River.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176362", "text": "Positivism\n\nPositivism is the belief that human knowledge is produced by the scientific interpretation of observational data.\n\nThe approach has been an ongoing \"theme in the history of western thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day\". The thought was created in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, Auguste Comte.\n\nComte, a sociologist, believed in a three part model of human knowledge. He claimed that it had gone through the phases of a religious and metaphysical worldview before the scientific interpretation was considered. The positivistic method should, said Comte, no longer aim at a revelation of ultimate causes. It should rather focus on how data are linked together. Scientists would simply interpret these correlations. All human knowledge could only be relatively true, so Comte with a look at these interpretations. Late 19th-century philosophers of the sciences from Heinrich Hertz to Ernst Mach eventually discussed specific requirements of operable scientific theories and physical laws such as the predictability of results in experiments and the functionality of laws in computations.\n\nIn its strongest original formulation, positivism could be thought of as a set of five principles:\n\nUnlike materialists positivists do not make any claims about a primary substance such as matter. They assume that we have data and that we interpret the data. The idea of a material world with three dimensions is, for positivists, just a good model to handle the experiences of everyday life. If astronomy has to deal with more complex data that cannot be handled consistently in such a model, they will have to think of a different model. Early 20th-century positivists like Ernst Mach said that the best model is the most \"economical\" model, that is the model we can use best in calculations and predictions.\n\nThe idea that all physical laws could be useful dates back to Auguste Comte. Comte said that all theories were merely \"relatively\" true, and that even Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation was strictly speaking nothing but a social convention true until new data force us to find a better theory.\n\nThis was an important development in early 20th century Vienna, led by Moritz Schlick and widened by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nIt held not only that propositions were true or false, but that statements which could not be verified (shown to be either true or false) were meaningless. Thus statements like \"There is a God\" or \"There is no God\" are not true or false, but meaningless.\nThe whole idea was explained in English by a famous little book by A.J. Ayer, \"Language, truth and logic\" in 1936.\n\nThis was the idea of P.W. Bridgman, Nobel Prize in Physics for 1946. It was that a concept in science was defined by the way one measured it. If one thinks of electron spin, or the curvature of space, these are not everyday ideas. In everyday life, electrons are not seen, and neither is space seen to be curved. They rest on the results of experiments which measured fundamental properties like time, light, mass, electrical charge, and so on. What Bridgman meant is that their meaning is in the way the measurements were done.\n\n\n19th-century positivism – or \"Comtean positivism\" – included the outline of a proposed development. This would lead from primitive explanations, through religious thought and monotheism, to positivism as the universal theory and scientific practice. The theory was very influential among cultural historians. It led Comte to the creation a \"religion of humanity\" as a secular substitute for all religions. This caused an outcry among scientists, who were ready to adopt the scientific premises but not interested in creating a substitute religion.\n\nOne can today still visit temples in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and Curitiba in Brazil, and Paris built by 19th-century Comtean positivists. London had a society of positivists. The Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was strongly interested in positivism as the basis of a secularisation of the nation, he was trying to build.\n\nThe term positivism is today no longer connected to the construct of a secular religion, but more to describe a scientific method.\n\n\n", "id": "176362", "title": "Positivism"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176365", "text": "Norton Internet Security\n\nNorton Internet Security is a security program made by Symantec Corporation that protects computers from malware. It includes antivirus, firewall, e-mail filter, and phishing protection software. It also includes features like parental controls which can be downloaded as a add-on. \n\nYou can get it from a download, a box copy in a store, or from a company that is an OEM. Norton Internet Security and its sister product, Norton AntiVirus, combined, held a 61% antivirus market share as of 2007. Major competitors in terms of market share include antivirus products from vendors CA, Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab. \n\nNorton Internet Security runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Version 16.5.0.135 is the latest update available for Norton Internet Security 2009, made available for users encountering issues when updating to build 16.5.0.134. The latest Mac version is 4.0. \n\nIn August of 1990 Symantec acquired Peter Norton Computing from Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various utilities, or applications for DOS. Symantec continued the development of acquired technologies. The technologies are marketed under the name of \"Norton\", with the tagline \"from Symantec\". Norton's crossed-arm pose, a registered U.S. trademark, was featured on Norton product packaging. However, his pose was later moved to the spine of the packaging, and later dropped altogether.\n\nProduct activation was introduced to Norton Internet Security 2004, addressing the estimated 3.6 million counterfeit Norton products sold. A alphanumeric code is generated to identify a computer's configuration, which ties in with the product key. Users are allowed to activate their product five times with the same product key. Spyware detection and removal was introduced to the 2005 version for Windows, with the tagline \"Antispyware Edition\". The tagline was dropped in later releases. \n\nExisting users of the 2006, 2007, or 2008 versions can upgrade to the latest 2009 version without buying a new subscription. Upgrading will preserve the number of days left on a user's subscription.\nNorton Internet Security 2006 debuted on September 26, 2005. The main graphical user interface, dubbed the Norton Protection Center aggregates all information in a central location. CNET reports the Norton Protection Center, while useful, attempts to advertise additional products and services from Symantec. \n\nTo help identify zero-day malware, Bloodhound technology disassembles and scans application code for possibly malicious instructions. Norton can revert Internet Explorer homepage hijacking attempts and block advertisements. Users are warned of unauthorized changes to Internet Explorer's homepage, and given an option to revert such changes. Advertisement blocking rewrites a website's HTML to prevent advertisements from being displayed. E-mail filtering scans POP3 mail for spam. It can be configured using either a blacklist or a whitelist. Users can also correct Norton's classification of e-mail on a individual basis. Parental controls, bundled with this release, allow users to block specific sites, block certain programs from accessing the Internet, and restrict newsgroup access. Norton can block the transmission of confidential information. Users can enter information which are not to be communicated via instant messenger, e-mail, or webforms. \n\nCNET noted this version's noticeable toll on system performance, especially when opening files across a network or on a removable disk. Oli Warner also noted Norton's significant drag when opening or creating files, compared to similar offerings from different vendors. PC Magazine noted the program's lengthy installation time and weak spam filtering feature; valid e-mail messages were marked as spam and actual spam e-mail were not. \n\nWindows 98 compatibility was dropped from this release. System requirements were Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 or Windows XP, 325 Megabytes of free hard drive space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM.\n\nThe 2007 version was released on September 12, 2006. 80 percent of the code was rewritten, with the goal of reducing high system resource utilization. A tabbed interface allows users to access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate windows open. Symantec also extended its Veritas VxMS technology, enhancing rootkit detection. VxMS allows Norton to detect inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. Phishing detection was introduced in this release for Internet Explorer. Norton checks sites visited in Internet Explorer against a blacklist and analyzes sites' code. Other features include a exploit scanner which looks at system components commonly hosting vulnerabilities, such as Internet Explorer settings. Supplementing the scanner, real-time exploit protection blocks attackers from leveraging common browser and application vulnerabilities. When possible, Norton will fix issues found; otherwise the user is warned of the vulnerability. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. \n\nE-mail spam filtering, parental controls, advertisement blocking, and the information filtering features were not bundled with this release to reduce performance impact and disk space requirements. Instead, the features are available separately in 2007 add-on package. \n\nCNET reports mixed results in performance testing; however gains were made over the 2006 version. Warner also noted the 2007 version's reduced impact on system performance, compared to the 2006 version. Similar to the prior version, spam filtering module misidentified valid e-mail and missed actual spam, according to PC Magazine. \n\nWindows 2000 compatibility was dropped from this release. Compatibility with 32-bit editions of Windows Vista was introduced later in this release with a patch from Symantec. When installed in Vista, 350 MB of free space, an 800 MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is needed. When installed in Windows XP, 350 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required.\n\nThe 2008 version was released on August 28, 2007. New features include SONAR and the Norton Identity Safe. SONAR was designed using technologies Symantec acquired from WholeSecurity. The Identity Safe supersedes the information filtering function, storing webform information and can fill such forms. The information filtering feature is still available in the 2008 add-on package, and can be used in conjunction with the Identity Safe. \n\nWhen installed in 32-bit editions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, 350 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required. Support for 64-bit editions of Windows Vista was added in this release. 350 MB of free space, a 800 MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is required.\n\nThe 2009 version was released on September 8, 2008. Benchmarking conducted by PassMark Software highlights this release's 52 second install time, 32 second scan time, and 7 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software.\n\nA single main interface replaces the tabs found in prior releases. New features include Norton Insight which whitelists files based on reputation, cutting scanning time. Virus signature updates are now delivered 5 to 15 minutes, supplementing the reliability tested updates issued by Symantec every several hours. However, such updates may incorrectly identify files as malicious, and users can elect not to receive those updates. Spam filtering was reintegrated in this release. The add-on package now includes information filtering and parental controls. The exploit scanner found in the 2007 and 2008 versions was dropped from this release. \n\nSystem requirements call for a 32-bit edition of Windows XP, a 300 MHz processor, 256 MB of RAM and 200 MB of free space. When installed in a 32 or 64-bit edition of Windows Vista, an 800 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 200 MB of free space is required.\n\nNotable new features include the integration of Norton Safe Web, a web rating service. Safe Web blocks access to malicious sites. Additionally, search results from major search engine, such as Google, are color coded for safety (green for safe site, yellow for possibly unsafe site, red for dangerous sites, and gray with a white question mark for untested sites). The toolbar redirects queries to the Ask.com search engine, however does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar.\n\nNorton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was released November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the browser, parental controls, and the ability to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the browser cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.\n\nVersion 2.0 also ties in with the WHOIS database, allowing users to trace attacking computers. Users can inform network administrators of the attacking computers for corrective actions. When running under Mac OS 8.1 or 9, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under Mac OS X 10.1, a PowerPC G3 processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required.\n\nThe subsequent release, version 3.0, maintained the feature set found in version 2.0. The firewall now allocates internet access as needed rather than relying on user input using predefined rules. Compatibility with OS 8 was dropped. When running under OS 9.2, a PowerPC processor, 24 MB of RAM, and 25 MB of free space is required. Under OS X 10.1.5 through 10.3, a PowerPC G3, 128 MB of RAM, and 150 MB of free space is required. However, version 3.0 is not compatible with OS X 10.4, or \"Tiger\".\n\nVersion 4.0 was released on December 18, 2008. Symantec also markets a bundle of Version 4.0 and the 2009 version for Windows, intended for users with both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installed. iClean was dropped from this release. The firewall now blocks access to malicious sites using a blacklist updated by Symantec. To prevent attackers from leveraging insecurities in the Mac or installed software, exploit protection was introduced in this release. Phishing protection was introduced in this release as well. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. Either a PowerPC or Intel Core processor, 256 MB of RAM and 150 MB of free space are required.\n\nThe FBI confirmed the active development of Magic Lantern, a keylogger intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, it installs a trojan horse on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.\n\nGraham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said \"We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn’t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party\". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, \"Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools.\"\n\nFBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, \"Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process.\" Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike Carnivore, a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order.\n\nIn 2006, Oli Warner published two articles comparing the system performance impact of various Windows applications, including Norton Internet Security 2006. He later reran the experiments, revising his methodology and included 2007 version at Symantec's request. \nWarner benchmarked the processor and the disk performance with and without each application, compiling two scripts in C++, a programming language. One calculated all prime numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 and the other tested file read/write time. BootVis was used to measure boot time. All testing was conducted inside a virtualized environment created by VMware. Despite the 2007 version's improvements, Warner noted its significant boot delay and impact on file operations.\n\nRecent testing conducted by PassMark Software found the 2009 version had the least impact on system performance. As noted earlier, Symantec funded the testing and provided some of the scripts used. Warner's scripts were also used to test file read/write time. The second and third ranked suites were ESET Smart Security 2008 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2009, respectively. Systems were benchmarked with a clean installation of Windows Vista, then again with a security suite installed. The 2009 version had the least impact on boot time, the fastest scan speed, lowest memory utilization, and the program itself installed the fastest out of its competitors. However, the 2009 version had the second most impact on file read/write time, as highlighted by Warner earlier.\n\nNorton Internet Security (Windows versions) have been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely, leaving unnecessary files behind. Versions prior to 2009 installed a separate LiveUpdate program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. In response, Symantec developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove leftover registry keys and values along with files and folders. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.\n\nWhen Norton Internet Security 2008 is installed, users encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.\n\nDave Cole, Symantec's senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done \"extensive testing\" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue had not surfaced. Cole essentially blamed Microsoft, \"This is related to XP SP3,\" he stated. Microsoft recommended users to contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec.\n\nSarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of a operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits often hide in a operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, \"The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous\", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions.\n\n", "id": "176365", "title": "Norton Internet Security"}

It was produced by Walt Disney. It was released on September 27, 1947 by RKO Radio Pictures. It is the 9th Disney animated movie and the fourth of the package movies the studio produced in the 1940s in order to save money during World War II. The Disney package movies of the late 1940s helped finance \"Cinderella\", and subsequent others, such as \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Peter Pan\".\n\nThe movie features two stories. The first story, \"Bongo\", is hosted by Jiminy Cricket and narrated by Dinah Shore. Based on the tale \"Little Bear Bongo\" by Sinclair Lewis, \"Bongo\" tells the story of a circus bear cub named Bongo who longs for freedom from captivity. Bongo escapes the circus and eventually forms a romantic relationship with a female bear cub named Lulubelle in the wild, realizing that he must prove himself in order to earn Lulubelle as his mate. The second story, \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\", is hosted by Edgar Bergen and is a retelling of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" featuring Mickey, Donald, and Goofy as three pheasants who discover the temperamental Willie the Giant's castle in the sky through the use of some magic beans. They must battle the greedy but lovable giant in order to restore peace to their valley. \"Mickey and the Beanstalk\" was the last time Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse, because he was too busy on other projects to continue voicing the famous character.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176458", "text": "Hyperbolic geometry\n\nIn mathematics, hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry, meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced. The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space, for any given line \"l\" and point \"P\" not on \"l\", there is exactly one line through \"P\" that does not intersect \"l\". This line is called \"parallel\" to \"l\". In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through \"P\". As they do not intersect \"l\", the parallel postulate is false. Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry. These models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid.\n\nBecause there is no hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines, the hyperbolic use of \"parallel\" and related terms varies among writers. In this article, the two limiting lines are called \"asymptotic\" and lines that have a common perpendicular are called \"ultraparallel\"; the simple word \"parallel\" may apply to both.\n\nAn interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point \"P\": there are two classes of non-intersecting lines. Let \"B\" be the point on \"l\" such that the line \"PB\" is perpendicular to \"l\". Consider the line \"x\" through \"P\" such that \"x\" does not intersect \"l\", and the angle θ between \"PB\" and \"x\" counterclockwise from \"PB\" is as small as possible; i.e., any smaller angle will force the line to intersect \"l\". This is called an asymptotic line in hyperbolic geometry. Symmetrically, the line \"y\" that forms the same angle θ between \"PB\" and itself but clockwise from \"PB\" will also be asymptotic. \"x\" and \"y\" are the only two lines asymptotic to \"l\" through \"P\". All other lines through \"P\" not intersecting \"l\", with angles greater than θ with \"PB\", are called ultraparallel (or disjointly parallel) to \"l\". Notice that since there are an infinite number of possible angles between θ and 90 degrees, and each one will determine two lines through \"P\" and disjointly parallel to \"l\", there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines.\n\nThus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate: In hyperbolic geometry, given any line \"l\", and point \"P\" not on \"l\", there are exactly two lines through \"P\" which are asymptotic to \"l\", and infinitely many lines through \"P\" ultraparallel to \"l\".\n\nThe differences between these types of lines can also be looked at in the following way: the distance between asymptotic lines run to zero in one direction and grows without bound in the other; the distance between ultraparallel lines increases in both directions. The ultraparallel theorem states that there is a \"unique\" line in the hyperbolic plane that is perpendicular to each of a given pair of ultraparallel lines.\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, the \"angle of parallelism\" is a constant; that is, any distance formula_1 between parallel lines yields an angle of parallelism equal to 90°. In hyperbolic geometry, the angle of parallelism varies with the formula_2 function. This function, described by Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, produces a unique angle of parallelism for each distance formula_3. As the distance gets shorter, formula_2 approaches 90°, whereas with increasing distance formula_2 approaches 0°. Thus, as distances get smaller, the hyperbolic plane behaves more and more like Euclidean geometry. Indeed, on small scales compared to formula_6, where formula_7 is the (constant) Gaussian curvature of the plane, an observer would have a hard time determining whether he is in the Euclidean or the hyperbolic plane.\n\nA number of geometers made attempts to prove the parallel postulate, including Omar Khayyám, and later Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri, John Wallis, Lambert, and Legendre. Their attempts failed, but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry. The theorems of Alhacen, Khayyam on quadrilaterals, were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry. Their works on hyperbolic geometry had an influence on its development among later European geometers, including Witelo, Alfonso and John Wallis.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, hyperbolic geometry was explored by János Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, after whom it sometimes is named. Lobachevsky published in 1830, while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832. Karl Friedrich Gauss also studied hyperbolic geometry, describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it, but did not publish his work. In 1868, Eugenio Beltrami provided models of it, and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was.\n\nThe term \"hyperbolic geometry\" was introduced by Felix Klein in 1871. For more history, see article on non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nThere are three models commonly used for hyperbolic geometry: the Klein model, the Poincaré disc model, and the Lorentz model, or hyperboloid model. These models define a real hyperbolic space which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry.\nDespite the naming, the two disc models and the half-plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami, not by Poincaré or Klein.\n\nM. C. Escher's famous prints \"Circle Limit III\" and \"Circle Limit IV\"\nillustrate the conformal disc model quite well. In both one can see the geodesics. (In \"III\" the white lines are not geodesics, but hypercycles, which run alongside them.) It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane, through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares.\n\nIn the Euclidean plane, their angles would sum to 450°; i.e., a circle and a quarter. From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180°. Another visible property is exponential growth. In \"Circle Limit IV\", for example, one can see that the number of angels and demons within a distance of \"n\" from the center rises exponentially. The demons have equal hyperbolic area, so the area of a ball of radius \"n\" must rise exponentially in \"n\".\n\nThere are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane (or approximation thereof). A particularly well-known paper model based on the pseudosphere is due to William Thurston. The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes with the first being made by Daina Taimina. In 2000, Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick-to-make paper model dubbed the \"hyperbolic soccerball\".\n\n\n", "id": "176458", "title": "Hyperbolic geometry"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176468", "text": "Parallel postulate\n\nIn geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Sometimes it is also called Euclid's fifth postulate, because it is the fifth postulate in Euclid's Elements.\n\nThe postulate says that: \n\n\"if you cut a line segment with two lines, and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than two right angles, then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough.\"\n\nThe field of geometry which follows all of Euclid's axioms is called Euclidean geometry. Geometries which do not follow all of Euclid's axioms are called non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nSome mathematicians thought that Euclid's fifth postulate was much longer and more complicated than the other four postulates. Many of them thought that it could be proven from the other simpler axioms. Some mathematicians announced they had proven the proposition from the simpler propositions, but they all turned out to be mistaken. Euclid is also known as Euclid of Alexandria.\n\nAnother more recent proposition known as \"Playfair's axiom\" is similar to Euclid's fifth postulate. It says that:\n\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can only draw one straight line through this point that will not meet the other straight line.\"\n\nIn fact, mathematicians found out that this axiom is not only similar to Euclid's fifth postulate, but has exactly the same implications. Mathematically, the two propositions are called 'equivalent' propositions. Today Playfair's axiom is used more often by mathematicians than Euclid's original parallel postulate.\n\nEventually some mathematicians tried to build new geometries without using the axiom. One kind of Non-Euclidean geometry is called elliptic geometry. In elliptic geometry the parallel postulate is replaced by an axiom that states that:\n\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you cannot draw a straight line through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line.\"\n\nMathematicians found that when they replaced Euclid's fifth postulate with this axiom, they were still able to prove many of Euclid's other theorems. One way to imagine elliptic geometry is by thinking of the surface of a globe. On a globe, lines of longitude appear to be parallel at the equator, but they all meet at the poles. Late in the 19th century, elliptic geometry was shown to be consistent. This proved that Euclid's fifth postulate was independent of the other postulates. After this, mathematicians mostly stopped trying to prove the fifth postulate from the other four postulates. Instead, many mathematicians began studying other geometries that do not follow Euclid's fifth postulate.\n\nAnother axiom mathematicians sometimes replace Euclid's fifth axiom with says that:\n\n\"Given a straight line and a point not on this line, you can draw at least two straight lines through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line.\"\n\nThis is called \"hyperbolic geometry\".\n\nAnother geometry simply removes Euclid's fifth postulate and does not replace it with anything. This is called \"neutral geometry\" or \"absolute geometry\".\n", "id": "176468", "title": "Parallel postulate"}

Meanwhile, Viola was shipwrecked in Illyria but she has been rescued by a captain. She has lost her twin brother, Sebastian. She dresses herself as a boy and uses the name Cesario, so she can get work as a page for Orsino. As Orsino's page, Viola is sent to Olivia with love letters. Viola finds out, to her dismay, that Olivia has fallen for her (as a boy) rather than Duke Orsino. Also, Viola has already fallen in love with the Duke.\n\nSebastian (Viola's twin, thought to be dead) comes ashore in Illyria. He thinks Viola has drowned in the shipwreck. A man named Antonio has rescued him from the surf; at some risk to himself, because Antonio fought against the Duke at one time. Meanwhile, in Olivia's house, Sir Toby Belch (her uncle) has tricked Sir Andrew Aguecheek into supporting him, by convincing him that he could be a suitor for Olivia. So with the help of Maria, Olivia's maid, and Feste, a clown, Belch plots to make a fool of the steward. Maria writes a love letter to Malvolio that will make him think Olivia has fallen for him. Malvolio falls for the joke and dresses crazily as the letter says to. Not knowing it is a joke, the Countess is horrified and has Malvolio locked away as a madman. \n\nBelch tries to get Sir Andrew to fight a duel with Viola's \"Cesario\" character as she leaves but Olivia has a crush on Cesario. Viola and Sir Andrew prepare for a duel that neither one wants. Antonio intervenes to defend Cesario, because he thinks he is his friend Sebastian, and is arrested for piracy against Orsino. Olivia has become engaged to Sebastian. Viola still does not recognize Antonio. Later, Belch and Sir Andrew talk to Sebastian, who does not back down from Aguecheek when challenged and beats him in the duel. Meanwhile, Olivia has met and become engaged to Sebastian.\n\nAntonio is brought before the Duke for questioning, and Viola tells all about the duel. Antonio tells everyone how he dragged \"this man\" from the surf, saving his life. Then Olivia comes in, searching for her new husband, which she thinks is Viola. Adding to this confusion, Belch and Aguecheek enter claiming that Viola/Cesario has violently assaulted them. In the midst of Viola's denials, Sebastian shows up. The brother and sister recognize one another and are reunited. Sebastian helps to explain the confusion over who fought and married who. \n\nIn the end, Orsino and Viola are in love.

Like other animals in the macropod family, such as kangaroos and wallabies, the quokka eats grass and small plants, and is mainly nocturnal. It lives on some small islands off the coast of Western Australia, mainly on Rottnest Island near Perth, and Bald Island near Albany. A small number live on the main land in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay, which they share with Gilbert's Potoroo. The quokka is the only member of the genus \"Setonix\".\n\nThe quokka weighs between and . It is around long with a tail. This is short for a macropod. It has a solid build, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. It looks like a very small, fat kangaroo, but it can climb small trees and shrubs. It has rough fur which is a brown colour, fading to pale brown underneath. The quokka eats a small amount of its waste products.\nIt is about the size of a domestic cat.\n\nThe quokka is a social animal and lives in large groups. They eat grass, sedges, succulents and leaves. They can become very sick if fed with things like bread, given to them by visitors to Rottnest Island. Visitors are now told not to feed them. Quokkas breed at any time on the mainland, but in late summer on Rottnest. The female quokka has two babies (called \"joeys\") in a year. \n\nThe quokka moves in the same way as a kangaroo, using both small and large hops.\n\nQuokkas are not scared of people, so you are able to get quite close to them, particularly on Rottnest Island. It is against the law on Rottnest Island to handle or touch the animals in any way. A A$100 fine can be given by the Rottnest Island Authority for picking up a quokka. People can even be taken to court and get a fine of up to $1000. These fines have been used in some unusual cases where quokka have been hurt or killed by visitors to Rottnest.\n\nThere are a lot of quokkas living on the small offshore islands, because this is only a small area they are listed as vulnerable. On the mainland, they are attacked by dingoes, as well as introduced animals like foxes, dogs and cats. They also need thick ground cover for shelter. Farming has cleared much of the land which is another reason the species is threatened.\n\nThe quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europens. The Dutch sailor, Samuel Volckertzoon wrote about seeing a \"a wild cat\" on Rottnest Island in 1658. In 1696, Willem de Vlamingh thought they were rats and named the island \"Rottenest\", Dutch for \"rat nest\".\n\nThe word \"quokka\" is comes from a Nyungar word, which was probably \"gwaga\".\n", "id": "176589", "title": "Quokka"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176888", "text": "Three Gorges Dam\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam () is a dam in the Three Gorges region on the Yangtze River in Sandouping, in the country of China. One of the largest dams in the world, it also generates the biggest amount of hydroelectric power (22,250 megawatts), pushing the massive Itaipu Dam in Brazil from first place to second place. The Three Gorges Dam project was completed on July 4, 2012. The dam was built for flood control, irrigation, and electricity. However, this has not come without problems. The dam covers a lot of historic sites and has caused 1.24 million people to lose their homes under the rising water. The dam forms the Three Gorges Reservoir, which extends nearly upstream to the city of Chongqing.\n\nThe dam was proposed by Sun Yat-sen, a Chinese political leader, in 1919. The site was surveyed in 1932 and 1939, by the Chinese and Japanese respectively. The Japanese drew up a plan (the Otani plan) for the dam, only to realize later that China would remain under Chinese control. Later, in 1944, the United States helped make plans for the dam, but all work on the dam stopped in 1947, because of the Chinese Civil War. In 1949, work resumed, but the work was slow because of problems in the economy. Later in 1958, some engineers who were against the dam were put in jail.\n\nIn 1980, work on the dam continued faster. But many people voted in 1992 against the dam. However, the dam was accepted by the government, and on December 14, 1994, construction began. In 2009, the dam began to make hydroelectricity. Some new plans, such as a set of 6 new power generators under construction, became operational in the year 2011. The reservoir filled to capacity at the end of 2008.\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam consists of a main dam wall, and a section on the right with a set of five locks, which are devices used to raise boats and ships. \n\nThe dam cost $180 billion Chinese Yuan Renminbi (about $30 billion USD). While this cost seems huge, it actually was $20 million yuan (about $3.3 billion USD) less than the original budget of $203.9 billion yuan (about $34 billion USD). However, this cost will be recovered when the dam makes money by making electricity. In about 10 years, the complete cost of the dam will be recovered.\n\nOne of the big reasons the dam was built to control floods. It protects large cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, which are very close to the river. Lots of farms, small villages and towns, and factories are also located near the river. In the event of a flood, there are 22 cubic kilometers (18 million acre feet) of space behind the dam to hold back the flood waters. The flood waters are stored behind the dam for future use. In the dry season, the water is released down the river, and the reservoir level drops to prepare for the next flood. However, the dam does not protect the lower river tributaries from flooding.\n\nAnother reason the dam was built was for water navigation, or the transport of people and goods by ship. There are two sets of canal locks, each of which has five stages. Each lock is long, wide, and deep, which is comparable in size to the locks of the Panama Canal, one of the biggest canals in the world. The reservoir behind the dam floods a lot of dangerous sections of the river, which makes it easier for boats and ships to sail. There is also a \"ship lift\" (an elevator for ships) that can lift ships that weigh up to 3,000 tons.\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam generates 22,250 megawatts, which makes it the biggest single hydroelectric power source in the world. It has 34 electricity generators, and 32 are main generators. Each generator is powered by water that comes from the reservoir. Each of these 32 generators makes about 700 megawatts of electricity. (This is more electricity than the entire electricity generation of Glen Canyon Dam, one of the biggest dams in the United States.) The other two generators will make power for the dam itself. These two generators each make 50 megawatts.\n\nOf the 32 main generators, 14 generators are on the north side of the dam. 12 are on the south side of the dam. 6 are in a separate powerhouse under a mountain just south of the dam. The generating capacity of the dam is 10,000 MWh (megawatt-hours), or the amount of megawatts generated per hour. Each main generator weighs a massive 6000 tons (about the same weight as three thousand cars). The water drops from the reservoir to the generator, which uses a type of turbine called a \"Francis turbine\". Each turbine is wide and tall. The amount of water that goes into the turbine can be from 1,968 cubic feet (600 m) to 3,116 cubic feet (950 m) per second. The turbines turn at a speed of 75 RPM (rotations per minute). The efficiency of the generators is from 94 to 96.5 percent.\n\nThe 14 main generators on the north side were installed from 2003 to 2005. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.2) started on July 10, 2003. The last one (Generator No.9) started on September 7, 2005. The full power (9,800 megawatts) of the north side generators was first tested on October 18, 2006, when the reservoir had risen to above sea level. The 12 main generators on the south side were installed from 2007 to 2008. The first one to begin making electricity (Generator No.22) started on June 11, 2007. The last one (Generator No.23) started on August 19, 2008.\n\nFrom its completion to March 2009, the Three Gorges Dam has generated about 296,550,000 MWh (Megawatt-hours) of electricity. \n\nThree power lines send electricity away from the dam, to three electricity grids called the East, Central, and South China grids.\nThe dam provides about 3% of China's electricity. However, the dam was originally planned to supply 10% of China's electricity. The reason for the decrease is, China's energy use grew much faster than the designers expected.\n\nBecause of reducing electricity needs on fossil fuels like coal and oil, the Three Gorges Dam has saved 31 million tons of coal per year, and prevented:\n\nThe dam has also benefited transportation on the river. Because of the locks (devices used to lift ships) installed on the dam, the benefits are:\n\nIn response to the dam, many sewage pipes that once dumped sewage straight into the Yangtze River now have to be treated. Over 65 percent of this waste water is now treated before flowing into the reservoir. There are now about 50 water treatment facilities in the area. Also, solid waste is now collected in 32 landfills. They can handle 7,664.5 tons of waste every day.\n\nThe dam also persuaded the government of China to think seriously about the pollution in the Yangtze River and the rest of China.\n\nA total of 1.24 million people had to move to different places because their homes were flooded by the dam. This number is about 1.5% of the total population of Hubei Province (60.3 million) and Chongqing City (31.44 million) where the reservoir is located. 140,000 from Hubei Province alone. \nOn July 22, 2008, most of the people were safely relocated. 4 million more people will ultimately have to move to Chongqing from their homes near the Three Gorges Dam. \nA large amount of animal habitat has also been destroyed. Many animals with critically low populations have lost their vital habitat. These include the endangered Siberian Crane, the Yangtze river dolphin (baiji), and Yangtze sturgeon. About one billion tons of dirty water flow into the Yangtze River each year. The dam has stopped this dirty water from being washed away, and led to serious pollution problems.\nAbout 1,300 historic sites have been flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir. The Three Gorges will be turned into much less spectacular gorges because the water level will rise up to in places, reducing the depth of the canyons. \nMany of these historic sites have been moved to safer places. But some historic sites cannot be moved because of their location, size, or design.\n\nA lot of silt (sediment) that is carried by the river has been trapped in the reservoir. Eventually, if the dam is not removed, the reservoir will fill with silt, making it useless. Also, because the river's silt doesn't go downstream anymore, the city of Shanghai will suffer because there has been no silt to replace land that is washed away at the river's mouth. In a high-silt content river like the Yangtze, sediment can clog the dam's outlets, and it cannot release water. The water would back up behind the dam and have nowhere to go, and would eventually go over the dam, making it collapse.\n\nThe dam is also a possible target in war, weakening China's national security. It is also possible that the dam sits on a seismic fault.\n\nThe Gezhouba Dam (Gezhouba Water Control Project, Chinese: 长江葛洲坝水利枢纽工程) is an afterbay (smaller dam in front) of the Three Gorges Dam. It forms a pool that extends upstream to the base of the Three Gorges Dam, improving navigation. The dam was built from December 30, 1970 to December 10, 1988. The dam is long and up to tall. It generates 2,710 megawatts of electricity. There are three ship locks at the dam. Lock No.2, which is long, wide, and deep, is among the 100 largest in the world.\n\nA series of other dams are also planned upstream, on the Yangtze and Jinsha rivers. About four dams are planned on the stretch of the Yangtze River, and they will produce 38,500 megawatts in total. Eight dams are planned on the Jinsha River, and eight more upstream of it, and one original plan called for a dam in the Tiger Leaping Gorge, one of the deepest river canyons in the world. This plan was, however, scrapped in December 21, 2007, because of the gorge's status as a World Heritage site.\n", "id": "176888", "title": "Three Gorges Dam"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176909", "text": "Alternation of generations\n\nThe term alternation of generations is used to describe a process in the life cycle of some eukaryotes. It describes an alternation in forms which occurs in plants and some protists. One form is diploid, with 2\"n\" chromosomes: the sporophyte. The other form is haploid with only one set of chromosomes: the gametophyte. Both forms are multicellular.\n\nIn sexual reproduction, organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosomes and a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes. In animals the body (soma) is usually diploid, while the haploid stage is only the gametes. In other eukaryotes alternation of generations may occur. It means that both the diploid and the haploid phases are multi-cellular organisms. The classic example is the mosses, where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte, and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophyte. The two forms often occur together, as shown in the illustration on the right\nThe term \"alternation of generations\" refers only to the sexual cycle; organisms often have asexual reproduction as well. The term should not be confused with life cycle stages in animals, which may look very different, but where all cells have two sets of chromosomes.\n\nThe alternation of generations is an important concept in the evolution of plants. All land plants have alternation of generations.\n\nIn mosses and their relatives (Bryophytes), the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, and the diploid sporophytes are sporangium-bearing stalks growing from the gametophytes. In ferns, the diploid sporophyte is much larger, but the haploid gametophyte is also a little plant that can grow for a long time.\n\nFor flowering plants (\"Angiosperms\"), the sporophyte generation is almost the whole life cycle (the green plant, roots etc.) except the small reproductive structures (pollen and ovule).\n\nThe sporophyte produces spores (hence the name), by meiosis. These develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they have half as many chromosomes. Later, the mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both) by mitosis. The fusion of male and female gametes (fertilization) produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This is the cycle which is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases.\n\nIn the landmark work \"Variation and evolution in plants\", Stebbins discussed how alternation of generations related to the overall evolution of plants. He began:\n\nLater Stebbins comments:\nThe point is that, in diploids, new alleles are sheltered and (collectively) they are a reservoir of potential variation in the population.\n\nMost algae have dominant gametophyte generations, but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are morphologically similar (isomorphic). \n\nBryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte stage on which the adult sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition. The sporophyte develops from the zygote inside the female sex organ, so its early development is nurtured by the gametophyte.\n\nAn independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms (flowering plants) that have survived to the present day. \n\nEarly land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores: they looked the same whichever sex they developed into. The ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles: the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes. The female \"megaspores\" tending to be larger, and fewer in number, than the male \"microspores\". \n\nDuring the Devonian, several plant groups independently evolved \"heterospory\" and later \"endospory\", in which single megaspores were kept inside the sporangia of the parent sporophyte. These endosporic megaspores had a miniature multicellular female gametophyte with female sex organs and egg cells. The ova were fertilised by free-swimming sperm produced by windborne miniatuarised male gametophytes in the form of pre-pollen. \n\nThe resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still inside the single large female megaspore in the sporangium of the parent sporophyte. The evolution of heterospory and endospory were among the earliest steps in the evolution of seeds of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms.\n\nSome Chromalveolata, some fungi and some slime moulds have what seems to be genuine alternation of generations. These groups include such a wide range of different types that lt is difficult to say how common the phenomenon is. Certainly slime moulds are not a monophyletic group, and that may be true of the other two groups, \n\nAlternation of generations between a multicellular diploid and a multicellular haploid generation does not exist in animals. \n\nIn some animals, there is a life cycle with different diploid stages. This has sometimes mistakenly been called \"alternation of generations\", but is quite different from what happens in plants and some protists. The most common case is that there are two distinct generations, where only one has sexual reproduction. Animals where it has been found include the Cnidaria and the Tunicates. The images on the right show the case of jellyfish: The medusa looks different from the polyp; they are different phenotypes. Only the medusa reproduces sexually. \n\nOther animals with life cycle forms include parasites such as certain flukes, which live in different snails for one part of their life, and in vertebrates for another part. \n\nIn some cases, the cycle includes more than two generations. If this is the case, only one stage uses sexual reproduction. In aphids, for example, there is one generation that reproduces sexually, and up to forty that use parthenogenesis, a type of asexual reproduction.\n", "id": "176909", "title": "Alternation of generations"}

Their half-brother Henry IV added a later proviso that they were barred from inheriting the throne.\n\nDescendants of this marriage included Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester and eventually Cardinal; Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland, grandmother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III; John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, the great-grandfather of King Henry VII; and Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots, from whom are descended, beginning in 1437, all subsequent sovereigns of Scotland, and successively, from 1603 on, the sovereigns of England, of Great Britain and Ireland, and of the United Kingdom to the present day. The three succeeding houses of English sovereigns from 1399 — the Houses of Lancaster, York and Tudor — were descended from John through Henry Bolingbroke, Joan Beaufort and John Beaufort, respectively.\n\nLancaster's eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, was exiled for ten years by King Richard II in 1398 as resolution to a dispute between Hereford and Thomas de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.\n\nWhen John of Gaunt died in 1399, his estates and titles were declared forfeit to the crown as King Richard II named Hereford a traitor and commuted his sentence to exile for life. Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile to reclaim his inheritance and depose Richard. Bolingbroke then reigned as King Henry IV of England (1399–1413), the first of the descendants of John of Gaunt to hold the throne of England.\n\nDue to some generous land grants, John was not only one of the richest men in his era, but also one of the wealthiest men to have ever lived. Taking into account inflation rates, John was worth a modern equivalent of $110 billion, making him the sixteenth richest man in history.\n", "id": "176912", "title": "John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster"}

Chorales developed during the late Renaissance and early Baroque period. Most of them were written at that time.\n\nMartin Luther thought that the congregation (people worshipping in church) should have music to sing that was not too difficult. He thought that the words should be in German instead of Latin so that everybody would understand what they were singing about. Luther wrote the words of many chorales himself. He even composed some of melodies himself, such as \"Ein' feste Burg\" (\"A Mighty Fortress\"). Sometimes he used the traditional Gregorian Chant melodies from the Catholic worship and added new German words to it, for example \"Christ lag in Todesbanden\" (\"Christ lay in Death's Dark Bonds\").\n\nThe words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern. Most of the melodies have an AAB shape (the melody of the first part sung twice, then the second part). This shape is called \"Bar form\" in German. \n\nJohann Sebastian Bach used many chorale tunes, usually adding harmony of his own. He used these in his cantatas. Many of these chorales in four-part harmonies are sung as hymns today in German Protestant churches, and some of the tunes are used in English-speaking countries as well.\n\nChorale tunes also appear in chorale preludes, pieces for the organ. These would usually have been played during the church services before the chorale was sung.\nChorales were used by many later composers in their compositions, e.g. Felix Mendelssohn, Anton Bruckner and Max Reger.\n\n", "id": "176937", "title": "Chorale"}

She was the mother of King Edward V of England. She was also the mother of Elizabeth of York, the queen consort of King Henry VII of England.\n\nElizabeth was born some time around the year 1437, at Grafton Regis, Northamptonshire. Her parents were Sir Richard Woodville and his wife, Jacquetta of Luxembourg, a foreign noblewoman who had first been married to the Duke of Bedford. After her first husband died, Jacquetta fell in love with Sir Richard, who was not very rich or important even though he was a knight. Jacquetta's friends and family felt that it was an unsuitable marriage and that he was not good enough for her. They had fourteen children altogether.\n\nWhen Elizabeth first met Edward, she was a widow. Elizabeth and her first husband, Lord Grey, had two sons, Thomas and Richard. Then Lord Grey was killed in battle, fighting on the opposite side to King Edward. Because she was a widow who already had children, and because her family had supported King Edward's enemies, she was thought to be an unsuitable wife for the king. Elizabeth and Edward were married in secret, because the king did not want to quarrel with his great friend the Earl of Warwick, who wanted Edward to marry a princess. At the time of their marriage, Edward was 22 and Elizabeth a few years older.\n\nWhen the Earl of Warwick discovered that the young king had married Elizabeth without his permission, he was furious. Although he was forced to accept the marriage, he became angry at the way Elizabeth's family grew powerful as a result of her becoming queen. A few years later, he turned against Edward and tried to put his rival, King Henry VI of England, back on the throne. While Edward was fighting to get his throne back, Elizabeth went to Westminster Abbey to find sanctuary; this meant that, because the abbey was a holy place, she could not be captured by her enemies as long as she remained there. While there, she gave birth to her first son, who was named Edward after his father. After a while, her husband returned and rescued her and her children, defeating the Earl of Warwick in battle and killing him.\n\nElizabeth and Edward had ten children altogether. Their eldest son, Edward, should have become king when his father died. However, King Edward died suddenly, and his own younger brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, snatched the throne. Richard hated the Woodville family, and killed Elizabeth's brother Anthony, who had been the guardian of her son Edward. Both Edward and Elizabeth's younger son, Richard, were placed in the Tower of London (which was then a royal palace). After a few months, they disappeared, and it was thought that King Richard had killed them. This rumour made the new king unpopular with many of his people, and two years later, Henry Tudor took the throne from him in battle and became King Henry VII of England. Henry VII married Elizabeth's eldest daughter, who was also called Elizabeth.

The high prices meant that there were many empty seats when the stadium first opened, especially behind the batter where tickets can cost up to 2,500 dollars. People have also disliked the stadium for its fan unfriendly practices. For example, fans cannot get autographs from players before the game. The stadium was seen as too expensive for being only a little better than the original. The new stadium also allowed many home runs during its first month, because of the way the wind moves the ball.

Citi Field is sponsored by Citi Bank. It broke ground in 2006 when the Mets home was still Shea stadium. The stadium was built as a replacement for Shea Stadium, which was where the parking lot is today. It was torn down after the 2008 baseball season. The 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played at Citi Field.\n\nIdeas to build a new ball park in Queens were first discussed in the 1990s. This happened because the Met's then current stadium, Shea Stadium, was growing older and did not have many features found in newer stadiums. The Mets, along with the City of New York made plans to build a new stadium, next to Shea. The project to build the stadium was approved in March 2006, and construction started soon after. The building of the stadium could be seen from Shea, during the 2007 and 2008 baseball season. The new stadium, named Citi Field opened on April 13, 2009.\nCiti Field has many interesting and unique attractions. The park has seats for up to 41,000 fans to watch a game. The seats are painted green to look similar to the Polo Grounds- another New York stadium torn down in 1965. Citi Field has a home run Apple in center field. The Apple is not a real apple, rather it is a large plastic apple with the Mets sign on it that rises when a Mets player hits a home run. This is similar to Shea stadium, which also had a home run apple. The foul poles at the stadium are painted orange. \n\nAnother part of the stadium is the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. This is the place where most fans enter the stadium, and teaches fans about Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball. Citi Field also has an area called the Pepsi Porch. It is a place where fans can watch the game in the outfield. The first two rows of the porch are over the playing field.\nThere is also a smaller field behind the centerfield wall where kids can play baseball and other games. The stadium also has a museum to show Mets history and many restaurants, bars, stores, and food stands which surround the field. \n\nCiti Field has many big parking lots which surround the stadium, allowing fans to bring their car to the game. The Stadium also has a train station with the New York City Subway and Long Island railroad that goes to downtown New York City.\n\nIn the years after it opened, the stadium had a few changes. After the 2011 baseball season, the outfield fences were moved closer to the batter, because people thought it was too hard to hit home runs.

Radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay, known as alpha decay.\n\nDuring alpha decay, the atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle. The nucleus will lose two protons and two neutrons when this happens. After the decay, the atom will change to another element, because the atom loses two protons. For example, if Americium were to go through alpha decay it would change into Neptunium because Neptunium is defined to have two protons less than Americium. Alpha decay usually happens in heavy elements, those containing more neutrons and protons, such as uranium, thorium, plutonium, and radium.\n\nAlpha particles cannot even go through a few centimetres of air. Alpha irradiation cannot hurt humans when the alpha source is outside the human body, because human skin does not let the alpha particles go through. Alpha radiation can be very harmful if the source is inside the body, such as when people breathe dust or gas containing materials which decay by emitting alpha particles.\n\nFor example, there is an element called americium-241 which gives off alpha radiation. This radiation can be very harmful if it is inside someone's body because it can change the DNA in the cells. But it is not harmful when it is outside of the body because alpha radiation does not travel through the outside layers of the skin very well.\n\nWhen scientists write equations about nuclear reactions they use the Greek letter Alpha. \n", "id": "177079", "title": "Alpha particle"}

It can also mean the device (e.g. a metal stamp or ring) which is used to make the official mark.\nThe word comes from the Latin “sigillum”.\n\nThe study of seals is called Sigillography.\n\nSeals are used on documents to prove that they really did come from the person who signed it (they “authenticate” the document). A seal could be put on the letter itself, or on the envelope where it is stuck down. The writer would pour some wax over the joint of the letter, then press a ring or metal stamp (called a matrix) which has his official mark on. This meant that no one would be able to open the letter and then close it again, because the seal will break when the letter is opened. Most governments still put seals on important documents. Letters do not normally have seals any more, even important letters.\n\nSometimes lead, pewter or ivory were used instead of wax.\n\nEach seal is different from any other. This means that an important person (e.g. a king) has his own personalized stamp. \n\nSeals were used in very early civilizations. In ancient Mesopotamia seals were engraved on cylinders, which could be rolled to create an impression on clay. Signet-rings of kings from Ancient Egypt have been found. From Ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings of kings have been found. Other ancient seals come from Saudi Arabia or the Ancient Greek and Roman times. \n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 seals were not used so much. The Popes used lead seals, and Charlemagne (who died in 814) had a special seal engraved with Jupiter Sarpis. In England all the kings from Edward the Confessor onwards had their own “seal of majesty”.\n\nSeals from East Asian later developed into block printing. Seals from China have been found from the 5th century B.C.\n\nThe wearing of signet rings (from Latin \"signum\" meaning sign) is an old tradition among nobles in European and some other cultures. In Latin America, it is also traditional for the descendants of the old \"criollo\" aristocratic families to wear signet rings in the Spanish tradition.\n\nSignet rings were often worn on the little finger of either the right or left hand (depending on the country), although some countries have different customs (French and German noblemen, and some Spanish nobles wear it on the ring finger of their left hand; Swiss wear it on the ring finger of their right hand). In the United Kingdom, signet rings are typically worn on the little finger of the left hand of the bearer and are often cast of gold. The ring is worn with the seal facing outwards so that the wearer can make a seal without taking the ring off.\n\nA similar tradition is found with blacksmiths who use their “touchmark” (a stamp used on the hot metal to show who made it) on whatever they made. When they died their touchmark was destroyed.\n\nThe study of seals (sigillography) is very useful in many areas: genealogy, political history, art history etc. This is because modern science can work out very closely how old a seal is. This makes it possible to date documents or works of art.\n\nThe word “seal” is often used as a metaphor: \n\nBecause seals are used to close something officially, the word “seal” can also be used in other situations with a similar meaning:\n\nEncyclopædia Britannica 1973 edition\n", "id": "177114", "title": "Seal (device)"}

He conducted in Germany as well as internationally and was thought of as the greatest conductor of his time.\n\nArthur Nikisch was born in Hungary (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire). His father was from Moravia, his mother was Hungarian. As a child he showed exceptional musical talent. He learned the piano and the violin and studied at the Vienna Conservatory, where he won prizes for composition and for playing the violin and piano. He was playing the violin in the orchestra when Richard Wagner conducted a concert in Bayreuth to celebrate the beginning of the building of his new theatre: the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. He joined the Vienna Court Orchestra where he played in concerts that were conducted by famous composers such as Brahms, Liszt, Verdi and Wagner. Soon he started his career as conductor in Leipzig. He quickly became internationally famous. In 1889 he was invited to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He conducted many concerts in the USA. In 1893 he became conductor of the Budapest Opera. Two years later he also became conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, taking the place of Carl Reinecke. In the same year he also became the main conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. He remained conductor of these two world famous orchestras until his death.\n\nNikisch gave concerts all over the world, appearing as guest conductor with great orchestras such as the Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1912 he took the London Symphony Orchestra to the USA, the first European Orchestra to tour there (fortunately they cancelled their booking on the RMS Titanic at the last moment). He conducted at the Leipzig Opera and taught conducting at the Leipzig Conservatory.\n\nNikisch was famous for his conducting of the great Romantic composers such as Schumann, Brahms, Bruckner, Tchaikovsky and Wagner as well as Beethoven. He had a great influence on the next generation of conductors including Wilhelm Furtwängler and Sir Adrian Boult. He helped composers such as Mahler, Max Reger and Richard Strauss to become famous by performing their music.\n\nNikisch married the singer Amélie Heusner. Their son Mitja became a successful pianist.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie, 1980. ISBN 1-56159-174-2\n", "id": "177328", "title": "Arthur Nikisch"}

It was placed at a dangerous Illinois Central railroad crossing on Mississippi State Route 7 in Grenada, Mississippi.\n\nIt was put up in the mid-1930s by inventor Alonzo Billups. Mr. Billups and the railroad were worried; the crossing had many accidents between trains and motor vehicles. He wanted drivers who were going to cross the tracks to know that a train was coming and he wanted to do it in a very big way. The Billups signal was built like a giant steel gantry which went up and over the entire highway. This is similar to crossing signals used today in North America; Mr. Billups' signal may have been the very first time such a signal was built. A pair of flashing red lights similar to those used today topped giant neon signs on either side of the big gantry. The signs lit up with the words \"Stop-DEATH-Stop\" along with a neon skull and crossbones. Flashing neon arrows pointed toward the train to tell drivers which way the train was coming. The Billups Neon Crossing Signal even had a special way of warning drivers with sound. Instead of the electric or electronic bells used now, this signal used a very loud air raid siren.\n\nAfter World War II started, neon became hard to get. The signal had electrical problems as well. Often, the air raid siren would go off even if no train was coming and it wouldn't shut off until the railroad sent a repair crew. No more of these special signals were ever built and the only one ever built was taken down after less than twenty years.\n\n", "id": "177400", "title": "Billups Neon Crossing Signal"}

He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century.\n\nKlemperer was born in Breslau, Silesia, which was then in Germany, but is now called Wrocław in Poland. He was born into a Jewish family. He studied music at the Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main, and then went to Berlin where he studied conducting and composition with Hans Pfitzner. In 1905 he met Gustav Mahler who was very impressed with him. He recommended him for the job of conductor at the German Opera in Prague. He soon got jobs in other places: Hamburg, Barmen, Strasbourg, Cologne and Wiesbaden. He was offered a job at the Berlin Staatsoper, but he did not want it because he thought he would not be able to do things there the way he wanted. However, four years later, in 1927, he took a job with a special branch of the Staatsoper which had been started in order to perform new music in modern (non-traditional) performances. They played in the Kroll Theatre. Klemperer became very famous for the performances that he conducted there.\n\nThe Kroll Theatre had been started by politicians who supported the Weimar Republic. They wanted opera to be different from the traditional operas that were performed in the Theatre Unter den Linden supported by the monarchy. \nThe operas that Klemperer conducted there included Leoš Janáček's \"From the House of the Dead\", Arnold Schönberg's \"Erwartung\", Igor Stravinsky's \"Oedipus Rex\", and Paul Hindemith's \"Cardillac\".\n\nBy 1931 the political situation had changed and the Kroll Opera was shut down. By 1933 the Nazis had gained power and Klemperer left Germany and went to the United States where he took U.S. nationality. He became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (1933-39) and also conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Pittsburg Orchestra. However he was not happy in the United States where the musical culture and music critics were largely out of sympathy with his Weimar modernism and he felt he was not properly valued. He hoped for a permanent position as lead conductor in New York or Philadelphia. But in 1936 he was passed over in both - first in Philadelphia, where Eugene Ormandy succeeded Stokowski at the Philadelphia Orchestra, and then in New York, where Toscanini's departure left a vacancy at the New York Philharmonic but John Barbirolli and Artur Rodzinski were engaged in preference to Klemperer. The New York decision was particularly galling, as Klemperer had been engaged to conduct the first fourteen weeks of the New York Philharmonic's 1935-6 season. Klemperer's bitterness at this decision was voiced in a letter he wrote to Arthur Judson, who ran the orchestra: \"that the society did not reengage me is the strongest offense, the sharpest insult to me as artist, which I can imagine. You see, I am no youngster. I have a name and a good name. One could not use me in a most difficult season and then expell me. This non-reengagement will have very bad results not only for me in New York but in the whole world... This non-reengagement is an absolutely unjustified wrong done to me by the Philharmonic Society.\"\n\nIn 1939 he had a series illness and was operated on for a brain tumour. For some time he was not well enough to work. Then from 1947 to 1950 he returned to Europe to conduct the Budapest Opera. In the early 1950s Klemperer experienced difficulties arising from his U.S. citizenship. American union policies made it difficult for him to record in Europe, while his left wing views made him increasingly unpopular with the State Department and FBI. In 1952 the United States refused to renew his passport. \n\nIn 1954 Klemperer again returned to Europe, becoming conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. He took German nationality. By this time Furtwängler was dead and Toscanini had retired, so Klemperer was thought of as the greatest conductor of German music. He was given a recording contract by EMI. His concerts and many recordings with the Philharmonia brought him world-wide recognition. He lived in Switzerland but spent much time in London conducting.\n\nKlemperer became an Israeli citizen in 1970. He retired from conducting in 1971 and died in Zürich in 1973, aged 88. \n\nKlemperer’s performances that we have on record show us that he was a musician who understood the shape of a musical work perfectly. He often chose slow speeds, but the music could sound very heroic. His health problems included manic depression which made him sometimes very difficult to work with. He also had a bad fall in Montreal. From then onwards he always had to sit down to conduct. He also burnt himself badly because he was smoking in bed, and he tried to put out the flames with a glass of whisky which made the fire worse. \n\nKlemperer is less well known as a composer, but he wrote a number of works, although he hardly ever performed them and most of them are now forgotten.\n\n", "id": "177546", "title": "Otto Klemperer"}

It is known as the Dairy Capital of Canada and promotes itself as \"The Friendly City.\" In 2006, 35,480 people lived in Woodstock.\n\nThe community was first settled in 1800 after it was determined by Sir John Graves Simcoe, governor of what was then known as Upper Canada, that the area would make a good townsite. The early settlers were American immigrants from New York state. Increased immigration from Great Britain followed in the 1820s and 1830s. Woodstock was incorporated as a town in 1851 and a city in 1901.\n\nVansittart Avenue (named after Admiral Henry Vansittart, an early settler) in Woodstock's west end has one of the finest residential Victorian streetscapes in the province. Woodstock has a community center that hosts hockey games in addition to many social gatherings.\n\nThe city government, Woodstock City Council, consists of four city councillors and two city and county councillors. Trevor Birtch is the current mayor, following a hard fought and demanding campaign. Oxford Centre is the district in which Woodstock is included when voting in federal elections. Currently, the MP of Oxford is Dave MacKenzie (of the Conservative party).\n\nOn August 7, 1979, the Woodstock area was hit by three tornadoes, two of which registered at least F4 on the Fujita Scale. On the west side of town along Ingersoll Road, a Dominion Food Store was heavily damaged while the tornadoes skipped over every other home and business. Dickson's Florist was wiped out and the Fry home was moved on its foundation. Father Grondziel of the new Polish Roman Catholic Church, next to the Dominion Food Store, had just stepped into the washroom when one of the tornadoes passed by and took off the roof of the church and everything in the room he had just been in. No one on the street was injured and the cleanup took many weeks. On the south side, the buildings of the Maranatha Christian Reformed Church and the John Knox Christian School were destroyed, and the only fatality occurred when a vehicle on Highway 401 was blown off the road and the lone occupant killed.\n\nOne of Woodstock's most notable historic sites is Old St. Paul's Church, the mother church of the Anglican Communion in Oxford County. The church was built in 1834. It is near the intersection of Huron and Dundas Streets. It used as a temporary jail during the rebellion of 1837. The church is a beautiful, brick cruciform structure surrounded by Woodstock's oldest cemetery. It has original box pews and dozens of memorial tablets commemorating prominent Woodstock citizens.\n\nThe \"Springbank Snow Countess\" was commemorated by a life-size statue (designed by acclaimed Oxford County agricultural artist Ross Butler) which is on the corner of Dundas and Springbank.\n\nThis bell iron and lead statue was made to honour a record-setting milk production by a Holstein (Friesian) cow named Snow Countess.\n\nThe statue was first unveiled on August 4, 1937 by the Holstein Frisian Association of Canada. Snow Countess was born on November 18, 1919 and died at age 16 on August 9, 1936. During her lifetime, she produced 9,062 pounds of butterfat, impressive at the time. The statue and granite base cost $4,000 to design and erect.\n\nThe cow has become an important symbol to Woodstock and is used in many cultural events, such as the annual Cowapalooza Festival.\n\nConstruction was started on the dam in 1964 and officially completed in 1967. The cost of the dam and land base at that time was close to $6 million. Present annual maintenance costs are about $40,000.\n\nThe Pittock Dam is designed for both flood control and flow augmentation purposes. It is designed to benefit water quality downstream during dry summer conditions and provide year round flood control capability to protect downstream communities.\n\nThe Woodstock Airport is 2.5 nautical miles (4.6 km) west of Woodstock.\n\nIn June 2005, Toyota, the world's second largest automaker, announced plans to build a new, $800 million automobile assembly plant in Woodstock on a 1,000-acre (4 km²) undeveloped site in the city's northeast end. The plant was expected to employ 2000 people and begin full production of the Toyota RAV4 SUV in November 2008, at the rate of 150,000 a year. However, due to the recent economic problems and the slowing car sales, Toyota announced that production would be cut by 50% to 75,000 a year and the work force shrunk 40% to 1200 people. Fortunately the other 800 workers are expected to be recalled when car sales increase. It was the first new auto assembly plant to be built in Canada in two decades.\n\nLate in 2008, the plant began producing vehicles, and on December 4, a ceremony attended by Ontario and federal government representatives as well as top Toyota executives, took place to celebrate its official opening.\n\nEarly in March 2006, Hino Motors, a Toyota Motor Co. subsidiary, announced that it will be the first Japanese truck manufacturer to build its vehicles in Canada with a new Woodstock plant slated to begin production in April 2006, in the former General Seating plant in the Pattullo Ridge Business Park near Highway 401 and Highway 59.\n\nThe $3 million, 120,000 square foot (11,000 m²) plant will employ 45 and assemble 2,000 trucks a year when it begins production.\n\nIn late November 2008 the Hino Motors automotive plant was completed.\n\nOther Major Industries in Woodstock include:\nVuteq Canada Inc (automotive parts supplier)\nFirestone Textiles\nCBM (Concrete)\nToyota Boshuko\nGeneral Motors (national parts distribution center)\nRWF Braun (Heavy Equipment)\nStandard Tube\n\nA major Canadian piano and organ and reed organ company operated under the name of Woodstock Organ Company for many years of the early twentieth century. It was owned by D W Karn, who was at one time mayor of Woodstock. Karn had previously operated an organ and piano manufacturing company under his own name.\n\nWoodstock has one daily newspaper owned by Sun Media Corporation, the \"Woodstock Sentinel-Review\".\n\nThere are three licensed FM radio stations: \n\nThe city also has a rebroadcaster of Toronto television station Citytv, operating on channel 31 and primarily targeting London and surrounding towns.\n\nIntercity transportation includes a VIA Rail train station and a Greyhound Lines of Canada intercity bus depot.\n\nLocal public transit service is available daily except Sunday on six routes. No service is provided after 18:30.\n\nProvincial Highway 401 is at the south and east edges of the city, with the junction of Highway 403 east of the urban area. Many Oxford County highways and other roads radiate from Woodstock.\n\nArt Williams. \"Bits & Pieces: A Montage of Woodstock, Ontario in Text and Pictures.\" Erin, Ontario: Boston Mills, 1967, 1990.\n\n", "id": "177591", "title": "Woodstock, Ontario"}

The Chief of the Defence Staff (or CDS), the senior professional member of the service, is General Thomas J. Lawson. The CDS answers to a politician, the Minister of National Defence, who is currently Robert Nicholson of the Conservative Party. \n\nThe Canadian Forces is composed of 67,000 personnel (soldiers, sailors, and airmen/airwomen). Every unit accepts male and female soldiers, if they qualify for the position. The CF is divided in seven main branches, which are called \"commands\". \nThe Environmental branches (called Commands) are mainly administrative structures. They manage the personnel, the equipment and the facilities, but not the operations. There are three commands in the Canadian Forces, because there are no Marines. All the commands work very closely with each other, for example, the Air Force provides helicopters to both the Navy and the Army. These commands also each have a reserve element, made of part-time employees.\nThis is the army of Canada and the largest branch of the CF. It uses tanks and other armoured vehicles, such as the LAV III, as well as artillery, engineering vehicles, and a variety of weapons, such as the Colt Canada C7 rifle.\nThis is the navy of Canada. It has 33 active warships including submarines, frigates and destroyers. \nAIRCOM is the air force of Canada. It operates a variety of helicopters and airplanes to support the army and the navy, and also has CF-18 fighters.\nThe Operational commands are responsible for specific types of operations or for conducting exercises or deployments. There are four operational commands.\nThe CANSOFCOM is responsible for providing special forces and asymmetric warfare capabilities to Canada. It is the smallest command of the Canadian Forces, and is composed of four joint units that do not answer to either the Army, Navy or Air Force. These units are the Joint Task Force 2, the Canadian Special Operations Regiment, the 427th Special Aviation Squadron and the Canadian Joint Incident Response Unit (CBRN).\nThis is the command responsible for managing foreign operations and deployments outside of Canada, such as Canada's contribution to the War in Afghanistan. \nCanada Command works with the United States Northern Command to ensure national security and the defence of the North American continent. CANCOM also is responsible for emergency management, such as when the Army is needed to respond to disasters in Canada.\nThis command is responsible for supporting all the other commands with things such as logistics, engineering, health services, and the military police.\n\nFrom the second half of the 20th century, the defence policy of Canada is made of these objectives : \n\nDuring the Cold War, a major focus of the Canadian Forces was helping with the defence of Europe against the threat posed by the Soviet Union. Some Canadian soldiers lived in Europe during that time.\n\nToday, the Canadian Forces goals are based on the Canada First Defence Strategy, introduced by the conservative government of Stephen Harper.

In its broadest sense, the word \"runes\" can mean any cryptic letters, but it usually means the alphabets used by Scandinavian people from about the year 150 CE to the Middle Ages. The oldest of these is called the \"Elder Fuþark\", used from about 150 to 800 CE. Around the year 800 the runes changed into the \"Younger Fuþark\", and these were used until about 1100, when the Latin alphabet replaced them. The Anglo-Saxon runes were used about the same time (400-1100) in Britain. The Scandinavian runes are called \"Fuþark\" because the first six letters in the runic alphabet are ᚠ ᚢ ᚦ ᚨ ᚱ ᚲ (F U Þ A R K). The Anglo-Saxon runes are called \"Fuþorc\" because they are a little different.\n\nRunes are found carved into stones (called runestones) in many places in Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), and in the British Isles, Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Frisia. Runes have been used for writing poems and eulogies, and they are still sometimes used to write ciphers. Runes were also used by J. R. R. Tolkien in his fantasy works, which were based on Germanic mythology. Because of their association with Germanic mythology, runes were also used by the Nazis to support a new mysticism and a romantic sense of Germanic heritage. The rune ᚦ survived into the Middle Ages in the English language and to modern times in Icelandic as the letter þ (pronounced \"th\" as in \"thing\"). After the Norman conquest, this letter was replaced by the letters \"th\" because it was unknown to the French-speaking Normans. Similarly, the letter ð (pronounced \"th\" as in \"this\") was used in Old English and is still used in Icelandic, but it is from Irish, not from the runes.\n\nWhen the runes were first used, the Germanic languages were not yet split into their modern branches; there was only one unified language (called \"Proto-Germanic\") with many regional dialects. Each rune had a name, like our modern letters have names, but these very old names are no longer known. By their association with later letters, the old names of the runes have been reconstructed. The [*] before a rune's Proto-Germanic name means this is a reconstructed name. Not all runes were drawn the same way, however, and some of the runes and their names were different in some places.\n", "id": "177675", "title": "Runes"}

It is relatively thin – between 1.5mm and 2mm in humans. In monkeys and apes the visual cortex take up much of their brain. Physically, the visual cortex is at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe.\n\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel did research on the visual cortex for many years. They won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system.\n\nResearch on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats, ferrets, rats, mice, or monkeys. Alternatively, signals can be recorded outside the animal by EEG, MEG, or fMRI. These techniques gather information without invading the brain.\n\nThe primary visual cortex (V1) is the best studied visual area in the brain. This is where the messages arrive from the lateral geniculate nuclei, which are relay stations for information from the retina. Each lateral geniculate nucleus gets signals from the \"opposite\" visual field.\n\nEach V1 sends information to two primary pathways, called the ventral stream and the dorsal stream.\n\n\n", "id": "177708", "title": "Visual cortex"}

Especially esters of acrylic acid are used to help make certain dyes and paints or as adhesives.\n\nIn organic chemistry, the acryloyl group is the functional group with structure HC=CH–C(=O)–; it is the acyl group derived from acrylic acid. The preferred IUPAC name for the group is prop-2-enoyl. It is also (less correctly) known as acrylyl or simply acryl. Compounds containing an acryloyl group can be referred to as \"acrylic compounds\".\n\nAn acrylic compound is typically an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound: it contains a carbon–carbon double bond and a carbon–oxygen double bond, separated by a carbon–carbon single bond. It has therefore the properties characteristic for both functional groups : \n\nIn addition, since both double bonds are separated by a single C–C bond, the double bonds are conjugated.\n", "id": "177758", "title": "Acryl"}
