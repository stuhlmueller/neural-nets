{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298185", "text": "Michael Todd\n\nMichael Todd (June 22, 1909 – March 22, 1958), byname Mike Todd, was an American theatre and movie producer. He is known for making movies, starting the movie formats of Cinerama and Todd-AO, and his 1957 marriage to actress Elizabeth Taylor (1930-2011). Todd's 1956 production of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Todd is also well known as the third of Elizabeth Taylor's seven husbands.\n\nTodd was born Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chaim Goldbogen (an Orthodox rabbi) and Sophia Hellerman, both Polish Jewish immigrants. He was one of nine children in a poor family, the youngest son, and his siblings nicknamed him \"Toat\" to mimic his difficulty saying the word \"coat\". It was from this nickname that his name \"Todd\" was derived (said in Germanic/Yiddish as \"Tote\").\n\nThe family later moved to Chicago, arriving on the day World War I ended. Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school. In high school, he produced the school play, \"The Mikado\", which was considered a hit. He eventually dropped out of high school and worked at a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman and store window decorator. One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk at a drugstore. When that drugstore went out of business, Todd had learned enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital, as a type of \"security guard\" to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on each patient's diet.\n\nAt age 17, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been serious about Bertha since age 14, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out. In 1929, she bore him a son, Michael Todd, Jr. A turning point came for Todd when his father died in 1931; Avrom Goldbogen made the decision to change his name to \"Michael Todd\" on the same day. Bertha Todd died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) in 1946 in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital, for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before, he had filed for divorce. The following year, Todd married actress Joan Blondell on July 5, 1947. They were divorced on June 8, 1950, after she alleged that he had abused and extorted her. Todd's third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had a tempestuous relationship. The couple exchanged vows on February 2, 1957. Todd was 47 and Taylor was 24; he was her third husband. Todd and Taylor had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances (Liza) Todd, who was born on August 7, 1957.\n\nOn 22 March 1958, Todd's private plane \"Lucky Liz\" crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered an engine failure while being flown overloaded in icing conditions. The plane was flying at an altitude which was too high to sustain flight with only one working engine under those conditions. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all 4 people on board. In addition to Todd, those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn, who was writing Todd's biography \"The Nine Lives of Mike Todd\"; pilot Bill Verner; and co-pilot Tom Barclay. Taylor wanted to fly to New York with her husband, but stayed home with a cold after her pleas to come along were overruled by Todd. Just hours before the crash, Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends, including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas, in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight: \"Ah, c'mon,\" he said. \"It's a good, safe plane. I wouldn't let it crash. I'm taking along a picture of Elizabeth, and I wouldn't let anything happen to her.\"\n\nHis son, Mike Jr., wanted his father's body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but Taylor refused, saying he would not want cremation. Todd was buried in Forest Park, Illinois, at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66, which is part of Jewish Waldheim there. In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher, who considered himself to be Todd's best friend, stated:\nThe remains were desecrated by thieves, who broke into Todd's coffin looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, according to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's remains was found under a tree near his burial plot; the bag and coffin had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's remains were identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.\n\nTodd began his career in the construction business, where he made a fortune but later lost it. He opened the so-called College of Bricklaying of America, buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit. The school was forced to shut its doors when the Bricklayers' Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study. Todd and his brother, Frank, next opened their own construction company. Their company was worth over a million dollars but came to an abrupt halt when its financial backing failed in the wake of the Great Depression. Not yet twenty-one, Todd had lost over a million dollars with the loss of his backer. He was now the father of an infant son and had no home for his family. \n\nHe later served as a contractor to Hollywood studios, and during the 1933-1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, he produced an attraction called the \"Flame Dance.\" In this number, gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancer's costume off, leaving her naked in appearance. The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paris club in New York City. Todd got his first taste of Broadway life with that engagement and was determined to find a way to work there. He came up with the idea of producing the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta \"The Mikado\" with an all-African-American cast. \"The Hot Mikado\", starring Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, opened on Broadway March 23, 1939. His Broadway success gave him the nerve to try taking on showman Billy Rose. Todd visited Grover Whalen, president of the 1939 New York World's Fair, with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the World's Fair. Whelan, eager to have the show at the fair, covered Todd's Broadway early closing costs. Rose, who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract, met Todd at Lindy's, where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only. Todd's \"Mikado\" dated back to 1885. To avoid any head-to head competition, Rose quickly agreed to promote Todd's production along with his own. Todd went on to produce 30 Broadway shows during his career.\n\nTodd's business career was volatile, and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times.\n\nIn 1945, Todd suggested the idea of holding the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in newly-liberated Berlin (Germany). Although baseball's new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly \"intrigued\" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.\n\nIn 1952, Todd made a production of the Johann Strauss II operetta, \"A Night In Venice\", complete with floating gondolas at the then-newly constructed Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. It ran for two seasons.\n\nIn 1950, Mike Todd formed The Cinerama Company with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas (who founded Capital Cities Communications) and the inventor Fred Waller. The company was created to exploit Cinerama, a movie process created by Waller that used three movie projectors to create a giant composite image on a curved screen. The first Cinerama feature, \"This is Cinerama\", was released in September 1952. \n\nBefore its release, Todd left the Cinerama Company to develop a widescreen process which would eliminate some of Cinerama's flaws. The result was the Todd-AO process, designed by the American Optical Company. The process was first used commercially for the successful 1955 movie adaptation of \"Oklahoma!\" (starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones). Todd later produced the movie for which he is best remembered, \"Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days\", which debuted in cinemas on October 17, 1956. Costing $6 million to produce, the movie earned $16 million at the box office. In 1957, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" won the Best Picture Academy Award.\n\nA William Woolfolk novel from the early 1960s, entitled \"My Name Is Morgan\", was considered to be loosely based on Todd's life and career.\n\n\n\n!colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#C1D8FF;\"| Husband of Elizabeth Taylor\n", "id": "298185", "title": "Michael Todd"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298200", "text": "Whitehurst &amp; Son sundial (1812)\n\nThe Whitehurst & Son Sundial was produced in Derby in 1812 by the nephew of John Whitehurst. It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery. This is a precise sundial which tells not only local apparent time but also local mean time using a scale on it. It is accurate to the nearest minute.\n\nThe Whitehurst family was known in Derby as skillful mechanics. John Whitehurst (1713–1788) was born in Congleton, but came to Derby where he became a watch and clock maker. He moved to London to assume the post of Inspector of Weights. His nephew continued the business under the name of Whitehurst & Son. The family business was known for their turret clocks.\n\nTo construct a sundial, one must understand the geometry of the solar system, and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface, in this case a horizontal surface. Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before, and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial, particularly its latitude. The dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not important. In this case, noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south, and standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Derby is at 1° 28′ 46.2″ West of Greenwich, so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 52.05 s later in reaching noon. And also when telling the time, we must consider the equation of time. That is to say, as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse, day length slightly varies everyday. For example, the difference from the average becomes up to 16 minutes in November and February. This equation of time had been really unknown for a long time until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks. If a clock ignores this difference, it measures average time. If a clock is re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle, it measures local mean time. A fixed noon and fixed day are essential for railways timetabling, so Greenwich Mean Time was adopted. In the case of Midland Railway, it was by January 1848.\n\nThis particular bronze sundial is marked \"Whitehurst and Son/Derby/1812\" and is thought to have been made for George Benson Strutt (who was the younger brother of the cotton spinner William Strutt), for his home Bridge Hill House, in Belper. This has the precise location of 53° 1′ 49.08″ north, and 1° 29′ 26.88″ West of Greenwich, which is slightly different from those of Derby, at 52° 55′ 00″ north, a difference of 6′ 49″. The Longitude is almost same, and gives only a 2 second time difference.\n\nThe dial is stoutly made and has one thick style (gnomon, a stick which casts shadow on the plate). The dial plate is not one complete circle but two semicircles separated by the thickness of the style. In this design of sundial, the angle of the style to the dial plate is exactly the same as latitude, which is 53° 1′ 49″ (the latitude of the Bridge Hill House). \nThe dial plate will be perfectly horizontal there. In case it is placed at different location, slight adjustment for latitude is required by slanting the dial plate. As the dial is now 0° 6′ 49″, or about 1/10th of a degree south- the nose of the gnomon needs to be raised by that amount.\n\nIn the \"horizontal sundial\" (also called a \"garden sundial\"), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally. (In the equatorial dial, the style stands vertically against the plate.) Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face. Consequently, the hour lines are spaced according to a calculation.\nThe dial plate is strictly engraved with hour lines which were calculated using the formula:\n\nwhere λ is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the style makes with horizontal), θ is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true North) on the plane, and \"t\" is the number of hours before or after noon.\n\nFor each of the hours 1 to 6, the formula is calculated. For instance at 3 hours after noon, we substitute the numbers 53.03 and 3 into the formula\n\nThis generates these results\nThe hours before noon are exactly the same, because the dial is symmetrical, so the other lines are mirror images of those above.\nIn the same manner, the half hours and the minute lines would be calculated. As noon is set exactly on the north-south line, and not 5' and 54\" (time difference between Belper and Greenwich) to one side, we can tell that this dial is telling Belper time and not Greenwich time.\n\nSignificantly, on the plate we can see a pair of scales that help the observer make the equation of time correction. One scale gives the date in months and days. Along side of it, another scale is engraved with the minutes on that day that the watch would be running faster or slower. Here it is labeled \"Watch Slower, Watch Faster. The 15th April is one day when no conversion needs to be made. This dial can be used both to read solar time shown by sundials and also the mean time that is favoured by clocks, with the practical purpose that observers can use the dial to calibrate their pocket watches, which in 1812 would not always run true. By 1820 watches manufacture had improved and the Lever escapement had become popular, so frequent calibration was no longer needed.\n\nAnother Whitehurst sundial dated around 1800 sold for £1850 in 2005 in Derby.\n\n\n\n", "id": "298200", "title": "Whitehurst &amp; Son sundial (1812)"}

The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against the idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.\n\nMost of Gould's empirical research was based on the snail genera \"Poecilozonites\" and \"Cerion\". He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology, and has received wide praise for his book \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\".

The Tamar's source is less than 6 km (4 miles) from the north Cornish coast, but it flows southward. At its mouth, the Tamar flows into the Hamoaze (a wide estuary) before entering Plymouth Sound. Tributaries of the river include the rivers Inny, Ottery, Kensey and Lynher (or \"St Germans River\") on the Cornish side, and the Deer and Tavy on the Devon side.\n\nKing Athelstan of England made the east bank of the River Tamar the boundary between England and Cornwall in the year 936. There are no road bridges over the lower Tamar apart from the modern Tamar Bridge at Saltash which was built to replace the ferry. In 1859 the Royal Albert Bridge was built across the Tamar at Saltash to carry the main railway line into Cornwall. Both bridges connect Saltash with Plymouth.\n\nThe Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers around 195 km² (75 square miles) around the lower Tamar (below Launceston) and its tributaries the Tavy and the Lynher.

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) stole a lot of weapons and ammunitions (\"bullets\") from the Irish Army. Although the theft from the Magazine Fort building in Phoenix Park was successful, most of what was stolen was recovered by the Irish Army a few days later. Several IRA volunteers were arrested.\n\nThe reason for the raid was that the IRA had many Thompson submachine guns. They found it hard to get the .45 ACP bullets used in these guns in Europe. Because the Irish Army also used the Thompson and had large supplies of bullets, the IRA decided to steal some.\n\nAround 2030 the gate bell rang, and the Military Police officer on guard opened the gate a little for a civilian who said he had a parcel to deliver to the officer-in-charge. The unidentified man told the MP to open the gate fully and put his hands up. At this point the IRA team appeared from both inside and outside the fort, confiscating the weapons of the sentry and MP.\n\nThe two hostages were then forced to act as human shields for the two intruders to the guardroom where the remaining soldiers were caught by surprise and gave up without a fight. The captives heard 'many' heavy lorries coming and going from the depot. At 2210 hrs the IRA locked the prisoners in the so-called 'C' Magazine area which the raiders had completely emptied.\n\nIt was 2250 by the time a party of soldiers was sent from Portobello Barracks to find out what was happening at the fort. They managed to catch two of the raiders.\n\nA total of 1,084,000 rounds of ammunition had been taken and removed in thirteen lorries with no casualties.\n\nOver the next three to four days a large, nationwide hunt was organised to find the stolen items.\n\nOn 1 January 1940 it was reported that almost three-quarters of the ammunition had been found, a total of 850,000 rounds; \n\nIn addition, some IRA volunteers who were caught storing the ammunition were arrested.\n\nThe raid was not good for the IRA. The massive hunt to find what was stolen turned up all and more. It caused IRA Volunteers to be arrested.\n\nThe day after the raid the Irish Minister for Justice, Gerald Boland, at an emergency meeting of the Dáil (\"government\") introduced the Emergency Powers bill to allow internment (\"taking prisoner\"), Military Tribunal, and executions for IRA members. It became the Emergency Powers Act.\n\n\n", "id": "298431", "title": "Christmas Raid"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298433", "text": "Vestigial organ\n\nVestigial organs are organs of the body which are smaller and simpler than those in related species. They have lost, or almost lost their original function.\n\nVestigiality is evidence for evolution, since they only make sense if evolution has occurred. They were one of the puzzles of pre-Darwinian natural history. The puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations, in the ancestors of present-day animals.\n\nThey occur in animals (and plants) which have changed their style of life from their ancestors. Thus shakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed. But one type of snake – the boas – have vestigial rear legs and pelvis presley. The human vermiform appendix is another example. That was much larger, and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls. Leaves are the main diet of apes, but they are not a main part of man's diet. Cellulose cannot be digested by our species.\n\nAn unused organ usually degenerates, and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether. Thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colooor. Mutations pile up. All structures need energy for their development, maintenance, and weight. This, and the risk of disease in the part (e.g., infection, cancer), provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organism's fitness. \n\nThe human appendix had selection against it because of deaths from appendicitis. Appendicitis was untreatable until modern times. The selection pressure was probably weak, because most cases occur after the age of peak fertility.\n\nObservations on the cave-dwelling amphipod \"Gammarus minus\" showed active selection against their vestigial eyes. When mating, the males remain on their females for a week or so after fertilisation, guarding them against other males. The eye sizes of paired males were compared with those of unpaired males. The eye sizes of paired males were smaller than the unpaired ones. Obviously, on average, the paired males would have higher fertility than the unpaired males. The selection gradient was estimated as –0.30, which means the selection for small eyes was quite strong. The researchers supposed that the loss of sight freed more of the nervous system to process other sensory inputs.\n\nOccasionally, selection turns vestigial organs to a new function. Thus the mammalian ear ossicles were once bones in the jaw of early proto-mammals, the Therapsida. The halteres of flies is a perfect example. The word exaptation was coined for this phenomenon.\n\nAll functions and structures develop and change because they affect the biological fitness of the organism. They make it more or less likely that individuals reproduce and contribute genes to the next generation. So, for example, an ability of a frog to survive the bite of its local venomous snake increases its fitness. But if it lives in an area where the snake does not, then it reduces its fitness. This is because it bears the \"cost\" of a complicated mechanism without getting any advantage in survival and reproduction. It works the other way round, too. Snakes which eat toxic prey have to use ways to survive the prey's toxins. The snake's digestion and metabolism is slower, and they move around more slowly. See rough-skinned newt and garter snake.\n\nEverything has a cost: either it uses up energy or its structure occupies space that might be used differently.\n", "id": "298433", "title": "Vestigial organ"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298681", "text": "Converter (metallurgy)\n\nA converter is a chemical reactor which turns raw iron into steel. \n\nRaw iron called \"pig iron\" which is the product of blast furnace, contains up to 4% of carbon. It is too hard and brittle for meaningful use. The carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel. This process is called \"conversion\" and the reactor \"converter\".\n\nThe first converter was invented by Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856. He built a pear-shaped large vessel with nozzles (tuyeres) for air in the bottom. Hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter, and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure. The result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter. After ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel. The Bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel, and the era of steel began. Steel was now plentiful and cheap.\n\nHowever, steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in. Air contains nitrogen, which is harmful for some steel grades. A modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air. It was invented 1949 in Austria.\n\nThe modern basic oxygen converter is a large pumpkin-shape vessel which is made from steel and lined with refractories such as calcium oxide and magnesium oxide line so the vessel can withstand the high temperature of molten metal. \n\nMolten pig iron and scrap are loaded in the converter. The scrap usually is rusty and contains oxygen, so some of the rust reacts with the pig iron, burning the carbon away and creating heat which melts the scrap. Once all scrap has melted, a special pipe called \"oxygen lance\" is lowered in the pig iron, and a very fast and sharp blow of oxygen is blasted in. The oxygen burns all the carbon away and mixes the liquid steel thoroughly. Once all carbon has been burned away, some extra carbon is inserted to raise the contents to desired level. The result is liquid steel, which is then tapped away and taken to rolling mill to produce steel products.\n", "id": "298681", "title": "Converter (metallurgy)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298688", "text": "Tuning fork\n\nA tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork. The prongs, called tines, are made from a U-shaped bar of metal (usually steel). This bar of metal can move freely. It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object. It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out. The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs. Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments, and in some tests of hearing.\n\nThe tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore. He was the Sergeant Trumpeter to the court, who had musical parts written for him by the composers George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell.\n\nThe fork shape produces a very pure tone. Most of the vibrational energy is at the fundamental frequency, with very few overtones (harmonics). This is not the case with other resonators. The reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about 5/2 = 25/4 = 6¼ times the fundamental (about 2½ octaves above it). By comparison, the first overtone of a vibrating string is only one octave above the fundamental. So when the fork is struck, little of the energy goes into the overtone modes; they also die out correspondingly faster, leaving the fundamental. It is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone, when listening to compare with the tone of each other instrument.\n\nAnother reason for using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its principal mode, the handle vibrates up and down as the prongs move apart and together. There is a node (point of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator (like the hollow rectangular box often used), which amplifies the sound of the fork. Without the resonator (which may be as simple as a table top to which the handle is pressed), the sound is very faint. The reason for this is that the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180° out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork, reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.\n\nCommercial tuning forks are normally tuned to the correct pitch at the factory, but they can be retuned by filing material off the prongs. Filing the ends of the prongs raises the pitch, while filing the inside of the base of the prongs lowers it.\n\nThe most common tuning fork sounds the note of A = 440 Hz. This is the standard concert pitch, used as tuning note by some orchestras. It is the pitch of the violin's second string, the first string of the viola, and an octave above the first string of the cello, all played open. Tuning forks used by orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly had a frequency of A = 423.5 Hz, although there were many forks and many slightly different pitches. Standard tuning forks are available for all the musical pitches within the central octave of the piano, and other pitches. Well-known manufacturers of tuning forks include Ragg and John Walker, both of Sheffield, England.\n\nThe frequency of a tuning fork depends on its dimensions and the material from which is made:\n\nWhere:\n\nForks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments, although electronic tuners are replacing them in many applications. Tuning forks can be driven electrically, by placing electromagnets close to the prongs that are attached to an electronic oscillator circuit, so that their sound does not die out.\n\nA number of keyboard musical instruments using constructions similar to tuning forks have been made, the most popular of them being the Rhodes piano, which has hammers hitting constructions working on the same principle as tuning forks.\n\nThe Accutron, an electromechanical watch developed by Max Hetzel and manufactured by Bulova beginning in 1960, used a 360-hertz steel tuning fork powered by a battery as its timekeeping element. The fork allowed it to achieve greater accuracy than conventional balance-wheel watches. The humming sound of the tuning fork could be heard when the watch was held to the ear.\n\nTuning forks, usually C-512, are used by doctors to check a patient's hearing. Lower-pitched ones (usually C-128) are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nTuning forks are also used in alternative medicine, such as sonopuncture and polarity therapy.\n\nMedical Tuning Fork 128 Hz\n\nA radar gun, used to measure the speed of cars or balls in sports, is usually calibrated with tuning forks.\nInstead of the frequency, these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and radar band (e.g. X-Band or K-Band) for which they are calibrated.\n\nDoubled and H-type of tuning forks are used for tactical-grade Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes, like QuapasonTM and different types of MEMS.\n\n\n", "id": "298688", "title": "Tuning fork"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298695", "text": "Lombe's Mill\n\nLombe's Mill was the first successful silk throwing mill in England. It was built in an island on the River Derwent in Derby. John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and studied details of the Italian silk throwing machines- the \"filatoio\", and the \"torcitoio\". Then, he returned to England with some Italian craftsmen, and built the mill. George Sorocold designed the building.\n\nLombe's Mill was built next to Thomas Cotchett's 1704 mill on the west bank of the River Derwent in Derby. At this point a weir had been constructed across the river and the mill was built on an island downstream, which separated the river from the tail race of three corn mills. Derby was an important place, because the river had a fast flow and A6 road (from London to Carlisle) crossed the river here.\n\nThis mill is significant as it was the first successful silk throwing mill in England, and probably the first fully mechanized factory in the world. \n\nThomas Cotchett built the first mill in Derby in 1704, but it was unsuccessful. So John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1716 to see the successful silk throwing mill there. This was an early example of industrial spying. He returned to Derby with the knowledge and a group of Italians. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe (born 1685) instructed George Sorocold to build a mill to his design and fitted it with the new machines. It was built to the south of Cotchetts Mill. Thomas Lombe was given a 14 year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used. This displeased the King of Sardinia, and he stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombes mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe took over the business. When the patents lost effect in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. To the north of the powered Italian Works an unpowered Doubling Shop was built- this happened before 1739. The mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson, and an inventory of this time is still exists.\n\nMost of the building was rebuilt in after years, and little of the original mill remain. It is known from written sources that it was five storeys high rectangular in plan. It was 17m high, 33.5m long, and 12m wide. The roof was slightly sloped. It was built of brick in Flemish bond, on a series of stone arches that allowed the waters of the River Derwent to flow through. The throwing machines were two storeys high, and fastened on the first floor. The winding machines were placed on the top three floors. All the machines were powered by Sorocolds external undershot water wheel. It was 7m in diameter and 2m in width. Its stem entered the mill through a hole at first floor level. It drove a vertical shaft which was 0.45m square. This drove a line shaft (horizontal shaft or lay shaft) that ran the length of the mill. The \"torcitoios\" and \"filatoios\" took their power from this shaft. The vertical shaft was extended to a further vertical shaft that reached the top 3 floors to drive the winding machines. The mill needed to be heated in order to process the silk and this was explained in the 1718 patent. It was reported in 1732 that Lombe used a fire engine (steam engine) to pump hot air round the mill. The stair column was 19.5m high, but its layout is unknown. There is no information on how materials were carried up and down between the floors.\n\nThe main range was three storeys high, 42.4m by 5.5m. Each floor was used for doubling- and there were 306 doubling machines.\n\nIn 1700, the Italians were the most technologically advanced in silk throwing in Europe, and they had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the throwing machine, a \"filatoio\", and the doubler, a \"torcitoio\". There is an illustration (drawn in 1487) of a circular handpowered throwing machine with 32 spindles. The first evidence of a externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high, in Italy the temperature was elevated by sunlight but in Derby the mill had to be heated, and the heat evenly distributed.\n\nThe mill then passed through several hands and has been rebuilt several times, but the modified structure still exists and has been restored to house the Derby Industrial Museum. A Bas relief sculpture of John Lombe may be found at the nearby Exeter Bridge.\n\n\n\n", "id": "298695", "title": "Lombe's Mill"}

They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum. In its most basic form, it uses two XOR gates, two AND gates, and an OR gate. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. \n\nWhen solving this example 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fifth digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21).\n", "id": "298829", "title": "Binary adder"}

In a scientific setting, this would be the \"total\" number of digits (sometimes called the \"significant figures\" or \"significant digits\") or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or decimal places (the number of digits following the decimal point). This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.\n\nIn both cases, the term \"precision\" can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded. For example, in floating point arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand. In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies).\n\nAs an example, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298861", "text": "Rounding\n\nThe word \"rounding\" for a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit form. For example, US$23.74 could be rounded to US$24, or the fraction 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3, or the expression formula_1 as 1.41.\n\nRounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as \"about 123,500\".\n\nOn the other hand, rounding can introduce some \"round-off error\" in the result. Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations, especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain \"ill-conditioned\" cases, then they may make the result meaningless.\n\nAccurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as \"the table-maker's dilemma\" (\"below\").\n\nRounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.\n\nTypical rounding problems are:\n\nThe most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment — such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc..\n\nIn general, rounding a number \"x\" to a multiple of some specified increment \"m\" entails the following steps:\n\n\nFor example, rounding \"x\" = 2.1784 dollars to whole cents (i.e., to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing \"y\" = \"x\"/\"m\" = 2.1784/0.01 = 217.84, then rounding \"y\" to the integer \"q\" = 218, and finally computing \"z\" = \"q\"×\"m\" = 218×0.01 = 2.18.\n\nWhen rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits, the increment \"m\" depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).\n\nThe increment \"m\" is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system that is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the decimal numeral system (that is, \"m\" is an integer times a power of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the binary numeral system (\"m\" is an integer times a power of 2).\n\nThe abstract single-argument \"round()\" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section. The abstract two-argument \"round()\" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value \"m\" = 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.\n\nThe most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single-argument \"round()\" function presented and used in the previous sections.\n\nThere are many ways of rounding a number \"y\" to an integer \"q\". The most common ones are\n\nThe first four methods are called directed rounding, as the displacements from the original number \"y\" to the rounded value \"q\" are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, +∞, or −∞).\n\nIf \"y\" is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If \"y\" is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if \"y\" is integer, \"q\" is just \"y\". The following table illustrates these rounding methods:\n\nWhere many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000, and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.\n\nRounding a number \"y\" to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when \"y\" is exactly half-way between two integers — that is, when the fraction part of \"y\" is exactly 0.5.\n\nThe following tie-breaking rule, called round half up (or round half towards plus infinity), is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values \"y\" are always rounded up. \n\n\nFor example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but −23.5 gets rounded to −23.\n\nThis is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classes.\n\nIf it were not for the 0.5 fractions, the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down, by the same amount. When rounding a large set of numbers with random fractional parts, these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other, and the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers.\n\nHowever, the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded up. This asymmetry introduces a positive bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of \"y\" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of \"q\" will be 0.0005 higher than the expected value of \"y\". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the \"round half up\" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.\n\nOne reason for rounding up at 0.5 is that only one digit need be examined. When seeing 17.50000..., for example, the first three figures, 17.5, determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18. If the opposite rule were used (round half down), then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 17.5.\n\nOne may also use round half down (or round half towards minus infinity) as opposed to the more common \"round half up\" (the \"round half up\" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).\n\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.\n\nThe \"round half down\" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded down. This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of \"y\" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of \"q\" will be 0.0005 lower than the expected value of \"y\". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the \"round half down\" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.\n\nThe other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the round half away from zero (or round half towards infinity), namely:\n\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and −23.5 gets rounded to −24.\n\nThis method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers, and a negative bias for the negative ones.\n\nIt is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).\n\nOne may also round half towards zero (or round half away from infinity) as opposed to the more common \"round half away from zero\" (the \"round half away from zero\" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).\n\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and −23.5 gets rounded to −23.\n\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers, and a positive bias for the negative ones.\n\nA tie-breaking rule that is even less biased is round half to even, namely\n\n\nThus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, +22.5 becomes +22, −22.5 becomes −22, and −23.5 becomes −24.\n\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of \"y\" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.\n\nThis variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called unbiased rounding (ambiguously, and a bit abusively), convergent rounding, statistician's rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, or bankers' rounding. This is widely used in bookkeeping.\n\nThis is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.\n\nAnother tie-breaking rule that is very similar to round half to even, namely\n\n\nThus, for example, +22.5 becomes +23, +21.5 becomes +21, −21.5 becomes −21, and −22.5 becomes −23.\n\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of \"y\" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers (including zero), and a positive bias for the odd ones.\n\nThis variant is almost never used in most computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or −0.5 to zero, or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point (with limited ranges for the scaling exponent), so that a non \"infinite\" number would round to infinite, or that a small \"denormal\" value would round to a normal non-zero value (these could occur with the \"round half to even\" mode). Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out of range results when possible.\n\nAnother unbiased tie-breaking method is stochastic rounding:\n\n\nLike round-half-to-even, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd \"q\" values. On the other hand, it introduces a random component into the result; performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results. Also, it is open to unconscious bias if humans (rather than computers or devices of chance) are \"randomly\" deciding in which direction to round.\n\nOne method, more obscure than most, is round half alternatingly.\n\n\nThis suppresses the random component of the result, if occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts can be effectively numbered. But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence, if the total number of occurrences is odd.\n\nIn some contexts, all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory. For example, suppose that \"y\" is an accurate measurement of an audio signal, which is being rounded to an integer \"q\" in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs. If \"y\" changes slowly with time, any of the rounding method above will result in \"q\" being completely constant for long intervals, separated by sudden jumps of ±1. When the \"q\" signal is played back, these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise, and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost. \n\nOne way to avoid this problem is to round each value \"y\" upwards with probability equal to its fraction, and round it downwards with the complement of that probability. For example, the number 23.17 would be rounded up to 24 with probability 0.17, and down to 23 with probability 1 - 0.17 = 0.83. (This is equivalent to rounding down \"y\" + \"s\", where \"s\" is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.) With this special rounding, known as dithering, the sudden steps get replaced by a less objectionable noise, and even small variations in the original signal will be preserved to some extent. Like the stochastic approach to tie-breaking, dithering has no bias: if all fraction values are equally likely, rounding up by a certain amount is as likely as rounding down by that same amount; and the same is true for the sum of several rounded numbers. On the other hand, dithering introduces a random component in the result, much greater than that of stochastic tie-breaking.\n\nMore precisely, the roundoff error for each dithered number will be a uniformly distributed random variable with mean value of zero, but with a standard deviation formula_11, which is better than the 1/2 standard deviation with the simple predictive methods, but slightly higher than with the simpler stochastic method. However, the sum of \"n\" rounded numbers will be a random variable with expected error zero, but with standard deviation formula_12 (the total remaining noise) which diverges semi-quadratically and may become easily perceptible, even if the standard deviation of the roundoff error per sample will be formula_13 which slowly converges semi-quadratically to zero. So, this random distribution may still be too high for some applications that are rounding a lot of data.\n\nThis variant of the simple dithering method still rounds values with probability equal to its fraction. However, instead of using a random distribution for rounding isolated samples, the roundoff error occurring at each rounded sample is totalled for the next surrounding elements to sample or compute; this accumulated value is then added to the value of these next sampled or computed values to round, so that the modified values will take into account this difference using a predictive model (such as Floyd–Steinberg dithering).\n\nThe modified values are then rounded with any one of the above rounding methods, the best ones being with stochastic or dithering methods: in this last case, the sum of \"n\" rounded numbers will still be a random variable with expected error zero but with an excellent constant standard deviation of formula_14, instead of diverging semi-quadratically when dithering isolated samples; and the overall average roundoff error deviation per rounded sample will be formula_15 that will converge hyperbolically to zero, faster than with the semi-hyperbolic convergence when dithering isolated samples.\n\nIn practice, when rounding large sets of sampled data (such as audio, image and video rendering), the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values (such as rounding towards zero), because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error bias and of its standard deviation. This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing (notably for accurate rescaling and antialiasing operations, where the simple probabilistic dithering of isolated values may still produce perceptible noise, sometimes even worse than the moiré effects occurring with simple non-probabilistic rounding methods applied to isolated samples).\n\nThe effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round: when sampling bidimensional images, including colored images (that add the discrete dimension of color planes), or tridimensional videos (that add a discrete time dimension), or on polyphonic audio data (using time and channel discrete dimensions), it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction, or equally into several orthogonal dimensions, such as vertically vs. horizontally for bidimensional images, or into parallel color channels at the same position and/or timestamp, and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions (according to a perception model). In those cases, several roundoff error accumulators may be used (at least one for each discrete dimension), or a (\"n\"-1)-dimension vector (or matrix) of accumulators.\n\nIn some of these cases, the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally: for example, when working with colored images, the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension (height, width and optionally time) could be remapped using a perceptive color model, so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation, instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently; and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels (left and right) may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors, in a balanced way around zero.\n\nIn some contexts it is desirable to round a given number \"x\" to a \"neat\" fraction — that is, the nearest fraction \"z\" = \"m\"/\"n\"\nwhose numerator \"m\" and denominator \"n\" do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit \"m\". This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern-Brocot tree, and continued fractions.\n\nThis type of rounding, which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale, is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result. Concretely, the intent is to limit the number of significant digits, rounding the value so that non-significant digits will be dropped. This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating-point values with limited precision (such as IEEE-754 \"float\" and \"double\" types), but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base.\n\nFor example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps (for example wave lengths, whose base is not necessarily an integer measure), or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widths (but the most common use is with integer bases such as 10 or 2).\n\nThis type of rounding is based on a logarithmic scale defined by a fixed non-zero real scaling factor \"s\" (in most frequent cases this factor is \"s\"=1) and a fixed positive base \"b\">1 (not necessarily an integer and most often different from the scaling factor), and a fixed integer number \"n\">0 of significant digits in that base (which will determine the value of the increment to use for rounding, along with the computed effective scale of the rounded number).\n\nThe primary argument number (as well as the resulting rounded number) is first represented in exponential notation \"x\" = \"s\"·\"a\"·\"m\"·\"b\", such that the sign \"s\" is either +1 or −1, the absolute mantissa \"a\" is restricted to the half-open positive interval [1/\"b\",1), and the exponent \"c\" is any (positive or negative) integer. In that representation, all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero.\n\nIf the source number (or rounded number) is 0, the absolute mantisssa \"a\" is defined as 0, the exponent \"c\" is fixed to an arbitrary value (0 in most conventions, but some floating-point representations cannot use a null absolute mantissa but reserve a specific maximum negative value for the exponent \"c\" to represent the number 0 itself), and the sign \"s\" may be arbitrarily chosen between −1 or +1 (it is generally set to +1 for simple zero, or it is set to the same sign as the argument in the rounded value if the number representation allows to differentiate positive and negative zeroes, even if they finally represent the same numeric value 0).\n\nA scaled exponential representation as \"x\" = \"a\"·\"s\"·\"b\" may also be used equivalently, with a signed mantissa \"a\" either equal to zero or within one of the two half-open intervals (−1,−1/\"b\"] and [+1/\"b\",+1), and this will be the case in the algorithm below.\n\nThe steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following:\n\nFor the abstract \"round()\" function, this type of rounding can use any one of the \"rounding to integer\" modes described more completely in the next section, but it is most frequently the \"round to nearest\" mode (with tie-breaking rules also described more completely below).\n\nFor example:\n\nFinished lumber, writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.\n\nMany design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then \"round\" to some standard size using phrases such as \"round down to nearest standard value\", \"round up to nearest standard value\", or \"round to nearest standard value\".\n\nWhen a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale,\nChoosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding.\nSuch \"rounded\" values can be directly calculated.\n\nIn floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value \"x\" into a value \"z\" with a specified number of \"significant\" digits. In other words, \"z\" should be a multiple of a number \"m\" that depends on the magnitude of \"z\". The number \"m\" is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point form.\n\nApart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the Scaled rounding section above, but with a constant scaling factor \"s\"=1, and an integer base \"b\">1.\n\nFor results where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if \"x\" is negative), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an overflow for the usual case of \"round to even\" is always the appropriate infinity.\n\nIn addition, if the rounded result would underflow, i.e. if the exponent would exceed the lowest representable integer value, the effective result may be either zero (possibly signed if the representation can maintain a distinction of signs for zeroes), or the smallest representable positive finite number (or the highest representable negative finite number if \"x\" is negative), possibly a \"denormal\" positive or negative number (if the mantissa is storing all its significant digits, in which case the most significant digit may still be stored in a lower position by setting the highest stored digits to zero, and this stored mantissa does not drop the most significant digit, something that is possible when base \"b\"=2 because the most significant digit is always 1 in that base), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an underflow for the usual case of \"round to even\" is always the appropriate zero.\n\nRounding a number twice in succession to different precisions, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.\n\nSome computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations, the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point.\nThe Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a \"strictfp\" qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.\n\nIt is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range. For example, if we know that an integer \"n\" is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting \"n\" to a floating-point value \"x\", computing the approximate square root \"y\" of \"x\" with floating point, and then rounding \"y\" to the nearest integer \"q\". If \"n\" is not too big, the floating-point roundoff error in \"y\" will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value \"q\" will be the exact square root of \"n\". In most modern computers, this method may be much faster than computing the square root of \"n\" by an all-integer algorithm.\n\nWilliam Kahan coined the term \"The Table-Maker's Dilemma\" for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions:\n\nThe IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. However, no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best.\n\nUsing the Gelfond–Schneider theorem and Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time.\n\nThere are some packages around now that offer full accuracy. The MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision.\n\nIt is possible to devise well-defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated. For instance, if Goldbach's conjecture is true but unprovable, then it is impossible to correctly round down 0.5 + 10 where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0.5 if there is no such number. This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.\n\nThe concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60.\nRounded approximations to π, the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient.\n\nThe \"Round-to-even\" method has served as the ASTM (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms \"unbiased rounding\" and \"statistician's rounding\" are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 4th edition of \"Probability and Theory of Errors\" Robert Simpson Woodward called this \"the computer's rule\" indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. Churchill Eisenhart's 1947 paper \"Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data\" (in \"Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis\", McGrawHill, 1947, Eisenhart, Hastay, and Wallis, editors) indicated that the practice was already \"well established\" in data analysis.\n\nThe origin of the term \"bankers' rounding\" remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report \"The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts\" suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that \"half-way\" amounts should be rounded up.\n\nUntil the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case, specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.\n\nMost programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as FORTRAN and C, would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable, or using a fractional number as an index of an array. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.\n\nIn the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up/ceiling, down/floor, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE-754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a double precision float argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits, this approach may avoid spurious overflows in languages have 32-bit integers. Some languages, such as PHP, provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a \"printf\" or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the \"precision\"). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.\n\nOn the opposite, CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface-description-language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE-754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard Javascript or ECMAScript interface bindings).\n\nSome disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.\n\nIn a guideline issued in mid-1966, the U.S. Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and −1.5 should become −1. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was \"round half away from zero\".\n\nSome meteorologists may write \"-0\" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and -0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer. This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the Celsius scale, where below zero indicates freezing.\n\n\nAn introduction to different rounding algorithms that is accessible to a general audience but especially useful to those studying computer science and electronics.\n", "id": "298861", "title": "Rounding"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298891", "text": "Cornish Rebellion of 1497\n\nThe Cornish Rebellion of 1497 was a popular uprising by the people of Cornwall in the far southwest of Britain. Its primary cause was the people's response to the raising of war taxes by King Henry VII to pay for a campaign against Scotland. Tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by Edward I of England to the Cornish Stannary Parliament which exempted Cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income.\n\nIn reaction to King Henry's tax levy, Michael Joseph (An Gof), a blacksmith from St Keverne and Thomas Flamank a lawyer from Bodmin, persuaded many of the people of Cornwall to revolt against the King. An army of 15,000 marched into Devon, attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went. Apart from one isolated incident at Taunton their march was not accompanied by any violence or looting. From Taunton, they moved on to Wells, where they were joined by the seventh Baron Audley, an able soldier. \n\nAfter issuing a declaration of grievances, the army left Wells and marched to Winchester via Bristol and Salisbury, remarkably unopposed as they progressed across the south of England. At this point, having come so far, there seems to have been some questioning of what exactly should be done. Flamank proposed that they should head for Kent, 'the classic soil of protests', the home of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and Jack Cade's rebellion, to rally the volatile men of Kent to their banner. Having failed to attract support in Kent part of the army abandoned the march and returned home while the rest turned towards Surrey.\n\nMoving back west, by Tuesday 13 June 1497 the Cornish army arrived at Guildford. Although shocked by the scale of the revolt, Henry VII had not been idle. The army of 8000 men assembled for Scotland was recalled. The same day that the Cornish arrived at Guildford, Lord Daubeney and his army took up position upon Hounslow Heath and were cheered by the arrival of food and wine dispatched by the Lord Mayor of London.\n\nThe Crown decided to take the offensive and test the strength and resolve of the Cornish forces. Lord Daubeney sent out a force of 500 mounted spearmen and they clashed with the Cornish at 'Gill Down' outside Guildford on Wednesday 14 June 1497.\n\nThe Cornish army left Guildford and moved via Banstead and Chussex Plain to Blackheath where they pitched their final camp, looking down from the hill onto the Thames and City of London. Somehow An Gof held his army together, but faced with overwhelming odds, some Cornish deserted and by morning there remained only some 9-10,000 Cornish stalwarts left in arms.\n\nThe Battle of Deptford Bridge (also known as Battle of Blackheath) took place on 17 June 1497 on a site in present-day Deptford south-east London, near the River Ravensbourne and was the climax of the Cornish Rebellion. Henry VII had an army of some 25,000 men and the Cornish lacked the supporting cavalry and artillery arms essential to the professional forces of the time. After carefully spreading rumours that he would attack on the following Monday, Henry moved against the Cornish at dawn on Saturday (17 June 1497). The Royal forces were divided into three 'battles', two under Lords Oxford, Essex and Suffolk, to wheel round the right flank and rear of enemy whilst the third waited in reserve. When the Cornish were duly surrounded, Lord Daubeney and the third 'battle' were ordered into frontal attack.\n\nAt the bridge at Deptford Strand, the Cornish had placed a body of archers to block the passage of the river. Here Daubeney had a hot time of it before his spearmen eventually captured the crossing with some losses (a mere 8 men or as many as 300 depending on one's source). Through ill-advice or inexperience, the Cornish had neglected to provide support for the men at Deptford Strand bridge and the main array stood well back into the heath, near to the top of the hill. Lord Daubeney and his troops poured across in strength and engaged the enemy with great vigour. Daubeney himself was so carried away that he became isolated from his men and was captured. Astoundingly enough, the Cornish simply released him and he soon returned to the fray.\n\nThe two other Royal divisions attacked the Cornish precisely as planned and, as Bacon succinctly put it: being ill-armed and ill-led, and without horse or artillery, they were with no great difficulty cut in pieces and put to flight. Estimates of the Cornish dead range from 200 to 2000 and a general slaughter of the broken army was well under way when An Gof gave the order for surrender. He fled but only got as far as Greenwich before being captured. The less enterprising Lord Audley and Thomas Flamank were taken on the field of battle.\n\nBy 2pm, Henry VII had returned to the City in triumph, knighting deserving parties on the way, to accept the acclamation of the Mayor and attend a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's.\n\nIn due course, severe monetary penalties, extracted by Crown agents, pauperised sections of Cornwall for years to come. Prisoners were sold into slavery and estates were seized and handed to more loyal subjects. The remaining rebels that escaped went home ending the rebellion.\n\nAn Gof and Flamank were both executed at Tyburn, London on 27 June 1497. An Gof is recorded to have said before his execution that he should have \"\"a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal\"\". Thomas Flamank was quoted as saying \"\"Speak the truth and only then can you be free of your chains\"\". Audley, as a peer of the realm, was beheaded on the 28th June at Tower Hill, London.\n\nIn 1997 a statue depicting the Cornish leaders, \"Michael An Gof\" and Thomas Flamank was unveiled at An Gof's home village of St Keverne and a commemorative plaque was also unveiled on Blackheath Common.\n", "id": "298891", "title": "Cornish Rebellion of 1497"}

Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.\n\nThe simplest shuttles, known as \"stick shuttles\", are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.\n\nShuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood, because it is so hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish.\n\nOriginally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand. However, \"John Kay\" invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a \"flying shuttle\". This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler and easier to use.\n\n", "id": "298901", "title": "Shuttle"}

The population was 171 in the 2001 census. \n\nThe parish is in the Diocese of Truro. The parish church is dedicated to St Hydrock and stands in the grounds of Lanhydrock House. Parts date back to the late 15th century and the church has a chancel, nave, north and south aisles and three-stage battlemented tower with one bell.\n\nThe great house stands in extensive grounds above the River Fowey and is has been owned and managed by the National Trust since 1953. Much of the present house dates back to Victorian times but some sections date from the 1620s. It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees.\n\nIn 1620 the rich merchant Sir Richard Robartes acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. During the 18th century the east wing of the house was demolished leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused much damage to the central section. Of the main house only the north wing, with its 29 metre Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, though the original gatehouse also dates back to the mid 17th century.\n", "id": "299054", "title": "Lanhydrock"}

Like the other \"Falco\" species, they have long wings and a long tail.\n\nTheir feathers are mainly light brown with black spots on the top and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside.\n\nWhen hunting, the common kestrel hovers about 10–20 m (c.30–70 ft) above the ground. common kestrels have very good eyesight. They can see small prey from a distance. Once they see the prey, the bird makes a short, steep dive. common kestrels eat nearly only mouse-sized mammals like voles.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299188", "text": "Diet soft drink\n\nDiet sodas (or diet pop, diet, sugar-free, or light soft drinks, refreshments, or carbonated beverages) are usually sugar-free, artificially sweetened, non-alcoholic carbonated beverages targeted towards health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or reduce how much sugar they eat.\n\nDifferent artificial sweeteners are used instead of sugar to give diet soda a sweet taste and some are often used combined with one another.\nAspartame, commonly known by the brand name NutraSweet, is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners. When aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke was released in 1982 it make aspartame more popular. Today, at least in the United States, when the word \"diet\" is seen or heard it is assumed to be aspartame.\n\nThe first artificial sweeteners used in diet soda were cyclamates (often synergistically with saccharin). While many say these cyclamate-sweetened soda had a better taste than the diet soda that came after them, in 1970 the Food and Drug Administration banned cyclamates in the United States because there was proof that they caused cancer in lab rats. Cyclamates are still used in many countries around the world, including for diet soda.\n\nOnce cyclamates were banned, American producers turned to saccharin. Saccharin alone was often criticized for having a bitter taste and \"chemical\" aftertaste. Some manufacturers, such as Coca-Cola with Tab, attempted to rectify this by adding a small amount of sugar. In 1977, the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin, too, as a carcinogen, but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted. The ban was lifted in 1991, but by that time, virtually all diet soda production had shifted to using aspartame. Perhaps the most notable holdout is Tab, which nevertheless also uses some aspartame in its formula.\n\nRecently two other sweeteners, sucralose (marketed as Splenda) and acesulfame potassium (\"Sunett\" or \"Ace K\" (the K is the chemical symbol for potassium) which is usually used in conjunction with aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin rather than alone) have come into growing use, particularly by smaller beverage producers (e.g. Big Red). Diet Rite is the non-aspartame diet soda brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.\n\nAdvocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar-like taste than those made just with aspartame, and do not have a strong aftertaste. The newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics, because they do not contain phenylalanine. Critics say the taste is not better, merely different, or note that the long-term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear.\n\nThe widespread, though not universal, agreement that the newest formulations taste much more \"normal\" (sugar-like) than the older diet sodas have prompted some producers, such as Jones Soda, to abandon the \"diet\" label entirely in favor of \"sugar-free soda,\" implying that the taste is good enough to drink the soda even when not trying to lose weight. (This idea was first floated by Diet Coke in 1984, with the tagline, \"Just For the Taste of It.\")\n\nIn 2005, the Coca-Cola Company announced it would produce a new formulation of Diet Coke sweetened with sucralose, to be called Diet Coke with Splenda, but it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well. There were also rumors that a sugar-free version of Coca-Cola Classic, also sweetened with sucralose, was being formulated as well. This formulation was eventually called Coca-Cola Zero, though it is sweetened with aspartame in conjunction with acesulfame potassium.\n\nThe beginning of the diet soda or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar free ginger ale called No-Cal. It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local. Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet soda product, Diet Rite. In 1962, Dr Pepper released a diet(etic) version of its soda, although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption. In 1963, the Coca-Cola Company joined the diet soda market with Tab, which proved to be a huge success. Tab was originally sweetened with cyclamates and saccharin.\n\nTab, Diet Rite, and Fresca (a grapefruit-flavored soda introduced by Coca-Cola) were the only brand-name diet refreshments on the market until Pepsi released Diet Pepsi in the 1960s (initially as Patio Diet Cola). Diet 7 Up was also released in 1963 under the name Like. It was discontinued in 1969 due to the US government ban of cyclamate sweetener. After reformulation, it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970. It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979. Coca-Cola countered by releasing Diet Coke in 1982. After the release of Diet Coke, Tab took a backseat on the Coca-Cola production lines; Diet Coke could be more easily identified by consumers as associated with Coca-Cola than Tab. Additionally, a study was released claiming that saccharin was a possible carcinogen, leading to Coca-Cola's decision to decrease production of Tab. Prompted by the rising popularity of soft drinks, in the mid-1980s some of those in the alcohol industry began to follow their lead with some beer companies putting sugar-free beer on the market.\n\nBy the early 1990s, a wide array of different companies had their own diet refreshments on supermarket shelves. Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s, after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer. Nevertheless, the Coca-Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation, replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet.\n\nBy 2002, some soda companies had diversified to include such flavors as vanilla and lemon among their products, and diet sodas were soon being produced with those flavors as well (see Diet Vanilla Coke, Diet Pepsi Vanilla). By 2004, several alcohol companies had released sugar-free or \"diet\" alcoholic products too.\n\nThere are possible health concerns of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse. Also, the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered.\n\nChanging the food energy intake from one food will not necessarily change a person's overall food energy intake, or cause a person to lose weight. One study, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, reported by Sharon Fowler at the ADA annual meeting, actually suggested the opposite, where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain. While Fowler did suggest that the undelivered expected calories from diet soda may stimulate the appetite, the correlation does not prove that consumption of diet soda caused the weight gain. The ADA has yet to issue an updated policy concerning diet soda.\n\nAn independent study by researchers with the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts, has turned up results which indicate that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased metabolic syndrome. Of the 9,000 males and females studied, findings stated that 48% of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated blood sugar. The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods, and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets.\n\nA preliminary abstract presented by the University of Miami's Hannah Gardener linked daily consumption of diet soda to a 61% higher incidence of \"vascular events\" such as strokes and heart attacks, although Gardener acknowledged that these results could not be conclusively linked to harmful effects of diet soda itself, and may be the result of other behaviors. The author stated confirmation was required prior to drawing conclusions. These studies were published as abstracts and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal\n\nAmong individuals who drink several regular sodas per day, diet soda may be a better choice, according to a website on dieting. Studies have also indicated that body mass gain is an unlikely consequence of artificial sweetener consumption.\n\nAnimal studies suggest that artificial sweeteners cause body weight gain, theoretically because of a faulty insulin response, at least in cattle and rats. Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased caloric intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness). Adding saccharin to the food of calves increases their body weight as well.\n\nIn some countries outside the United States and Canada, the term \"light\" is often used instead of \"diet\".\n\nIn an effort to cash in on the surging popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, in 2004 both Coca-Cola and Pepsico released reduced-calorie versions of their flagship sodas that contain approximately half the sugar of the regular version. The Pepsi variant, Pepsi Edge, is sweetened with sucralose and corn syrup. The sweetening of the Coca-Cola variant, Coca-Cola C2, is a combination of corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Pepsi discontinued Edge in 2005, citing lackluster sales. Coca-Cola soon followed suit.\n\nHalf the sugar of a can of regular cola is still more sugar than many people on popular low-carbohydrate diets are permitted to have in a day. It is possible that these sodas are targeted, instead, at so-called \"carb-conscious consumers\" who are paying attention to, but not trying to drastically reduce, their carbohydrate intake.\n", "id": "299188", "title": "Diet soft drink"}

It is the most common home language in South Africa, where 24% of people speak it at home. Over 50% of the population also speak and understand the language.\n\nIn 1994, it became one of South Africa's 11 official languages. Like other Bantu languages, Zulu is written using the Latin alphabet.\n\nZulu belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages. Zulu migrants (people who move from place to place) have taken the language to other regions. There are now Zulu speakers in Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, and Swaziland. \n\nZulu speakers in Zimbabwe speak a dialect called \"Northern Ndebele language.\"\n\nPeople who speak Xhosa can understand most Zulu. The opposite is also true: Zulu speakers can understand Xhosa. Xhosa language is the most common language spoken in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\n\nThe Zulu, Xhosa, and other Nguni people have lived in South Africa for a long time. The Zulu language has a lot of click sounds common in Southern African languages. These click sounds are not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have lived together with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi. \n\nZulu and all other native Southern African languages was at first an oral language. It was not written down until missionaries came from Europe. These missionaries used the Latin alphabet to write the Zulu language. The first Zulu grammar book was published in Norway in 1850 by Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder.\n\nThe oldest document written in Zulu is a Bible from 1883. John Dube, a Zulu from Natal, wrote the first Zulu novel, \"Insila kaShaka\", in 1933. Another important Zulu author was Reginald Dhlomo. Dhlomo wrote \"U-Dingane\" (1936), \"U-Shaka\" (1937), \"U-Mpande\" (1938), \"U-Cetshwayo\" (1952) and \"U-Dinizulu\" (1968). Other important Zulu writers are Benedict Wallet Vilakazi and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali.\n\nBefore 1994, the Zulu language was controlled by the Zulu Language Board in KwaZulu-Natal. Today the Pan South African Language Board supports the use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.\n\nBefore 1994, the official languages of South Africa were English, Dutch, and Afrikaans. During Apartheid, Zulu was spoken commonly in the Kwazulu bantustan. All education, however, at the high school level was in English or Afrikaans.\n\nAfter Apartheid ended in 1994, Zulu became one of the official languages in South Africa. The SABC first started showing Zulu-language television and news programs in the 1980s. There are many Zulu radio stations and newspapers available, mostly in the Kwazulu-Natal province and Johannesburg. The first full-length feature film in Zulu was \"Yesterday\". It was made in 2004 and nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).\n\nIn \"The Lion King\" movie, the \"Circle of Life\" song has many Zulu phrases in it. Some of these phrases are:\nOther \"Lion King\" songs also had Zulu phrases in them.\n\nThere are two main types of Zulu. One type is called standard Zulu, and it is taught in schools. Standard Zulu is also called \"deep Zulu\" (). Standard Zulu is a purist language. This means that new ideas are described using words that are derived from other Zulu words.\n\nThe other type of Zulu is called urban Zulu (). Urban Zulu is the kind of Zulu spoken by people who live in cities. Urban Zulu uses loan words borrowed from other languages to describe new ideas. Most of these loan words come from English.\n\nSome of these different words for new ideas in Standard and Urban Zulu are listed here:\n\nThese two different types of Zulu language make problems in learning and education. Young people speak urban Zulu and do not often understand standard Zulu.\n\nThis is a list of phrases in Zulu.\n\nZulu place names occur in the \"locative\" form most of the time. A place name is both a preposition and a name. Changing the prefix of the place name changes the preposition.\n\nFor example, the Zulu name for Johannesburg is \"iGoli.\" The word \"eGoli\" means to/at/in/from Johannesburg. The root word \"Goli\" means \"Johannesburg,\" but doesn't mean anything by itself in Zulu.\n\nMost of the time, changing the \"i-\" or \"u-\" prefix to the \"e-\" prefix changes the meaning like this. In some cases, like with Durban, the name changes too.\n\nThe Zulu name for the language is \"isiZulu\". The \"isi-\" prefix means \"language.\" (It also means other things, but here it means language.) For example, \"isiNgisi\" means English, \"isiXhosa\" means Xhosa, \"isiBhunu\" means Afrikaans, and \"isiJalimane\" means German.\n\nWhen the word Zulu has a prefix that is \"not\" \"isi-\", it means a lot of different things. This is a table that shows how the meanings of the word changes:\n\nSome people like to call Zulu \"isiZulu\" in English. This is like calling Spanish \"Español\" or Polish \"Polski\" when talking in English.\n\nMany Zulu words are used in South African English. Some words, like the names of local animals, are used in standard English. \"Impala\" and \"mamba\", for example, are zulu words.

He was a nephew of Charles III of Spain and cousin of Maria I of Portugal as well as son in law of Maria Carolina of Austria. He was King of Sardinia from 1821 to 1831.\n\n\"Carlo Felice\" was born in Turin as the eleventh child and fifth son born to Victor Amadeus III and Maria Antonia of Spain. From birth he was titled as the Duke of Genoa and the Marquis of Susa from 1796. He was a younger brother of Charles Emmanuel IV and Victor Emmanuel I. He spent his childhood with his sister Maria Carolina, the Count of Moriana, living at the Castle of Moncalieri. He had a very closed character. \n\nHe was married by proxy to Princess Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily on 7 March 1807. She was a daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria, sister of \"Marie Antoinette\". \n\nHe was not expected to ever succeed to the throne. However Charles Emmanuel never had any children and abdicated the throne on June 4, 1802. Victor Emmanuel I had four living daughters when he abdicated the throne in 1821. As the succession was regulated by the Salic Law, Charles Felix succeeded his brother on the throne. He and his wife died without issue after a reign of ten years. He was succeeded by the senior male of his House as Charles Albert of Savoy after he died in Turin at the Palazzo Chablais which had been given to him by his sister Princess Maria Anna.\n\nThe Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa was named after him as well as the main road of the island of Sardinia, the Strada statale 131 Charles Felix, that connects the towns of Cagliari and Sassari-Porto Torres, realised in 19th century, is entitled to him.\n\n", "id": "299273", "title": "Charles Felix of Sardinia"}

It runs from Madison Square (at 23rd Street) to the Madison Avenue Bridge across the Harlem River (at 138th Street). In doing so, it passes through Midtown Manhattan, the Upper East Side (including Carnegie Hill), Spanish Harlem, and Harlem. It is named after Madison Square, which is itself named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States. Since the 1920s, the street's name has been synonymous with the American advertising industry.\n\nMadison Avenue was not part of the original New York City street grid established in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and was carved between Park Avenue (formerly Fourth) and Fifth Avenue in 1836, due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B. Ruggles. Ruggles was a graduate of Yale University who had previously purchased and developed New York's Gramercy Park in 1831, who was in part responsible for the development of Union Square and who also named Lexington Avenue.\n\nMadison Avenue carries one-way traffic uptown (northbound) from 23rd Street to 135th Street, with the change from two-way traffic having taken place on January 14, 1966, at which time Fifth Avenue was changed to one way downtown (southbound).\n\nOne lane of Madison Avenue in Midtown is limited to turns made by city buses or taxicabs, at some hours of the day. Based on Section 4-12(m) of the New York City Traffic Rules, driving a vehicle, other than a bus, is prohibited in the bus lane on Madison Avenue to turn right during the restricted hours specified by sign between 42nd Street and 59th Street. All vehicles are allowed at 60th Street, but a taxicab carrying a passenger may use the bus lane to turn right at 46th Street.\n\nThe term \"Madison Avenue\" is often used to mean \"advertising\". Madison Avenue became identified with the advertising industry after the quick growth along the avenue during the 1920s.\n\nAccording to \"The Emergence of Advertising in America\", by the year 1861 there were twenty advertising agencies in New York City. In 1911, the New York City Association of Advertising Agencies was founded, as years ahead of the establishment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.\n\nAmong various depictions in popular culture, the portion of the advertising industry which centers on Madison Avenue serves as a backdrop for the AMC television drama \"Mad Men\", which focuses on industry activities during the 1960s.\n\nLate in the 20th century, many agencies left Madison Avenue. Some moved further downtown and others moved west. Today, only a few agencies are still located in the old business cluster on Madison Avenue, including Young & Rubicam, StrawberryFrog, TBWA Worldwide and Doyle Dane Bernbach. However, the term is still used to describe the agency business as a whole and the large, New York–based agencies in particular.\n", "id": "299275", "title": "Madison Avenue"}

She was the youngest daughter of Duke Philip of Parma and his wife, Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV. \n\nChristened Luisa Maria Teresa Anna, but known as María Luisa was born at the Ducal Palace of Colorno in the Duchy of Parma. She was the favourite child of her mother, who tried to engage her to the heir to the French throne, however the prince died in 1761. In 1762 Maria Luisa became engaged to the Prince of Asturias (heir to the throne), Charles, later King Charles IV of Spain. She married the future Charles IV on 4 September 1765. From her marriage she was the most senior female at the Spanish court, Queen Maria Amalia having died in 1761. \n\nMaria Luisa was regularly painted by the famous Spanish artist Goya. She was often described by contemporaries as an ugly, vicious, and coarse woman who greatly dominated the king. Maria Luisa dominated her husband and was believed to have had many love affairs, but there is no evidence that Maria Luisa had any lovers. Gossip pointed out Manuel de Godoy, her husband's Prime Minister, was her long-time lover. She was unpopular during her reign and has also long had a bad reputation in history, mainly because of her alleged love affairs and her support of pro-French policies that eventually weren't good for Spain. In 1792, the \"Order of Queen Maria Luisa\" was founded on her suggestion, an order which was given only to women.\n\nHer husband abdicated the throne of Spain in 1808, and together with Maria Luisa and Godoy spent the rest of his life in exile. When Napoleon's army invaded the country, several pamphlets blamed her for that. Maria Luisa spent some years in France and then in Rome, Italy. Both Maria Luisa and her husband died in Italy in early 1819.\n\n\n", "id": "299276", "title": "Maria Luisa of Parma"}

It passes through Alcester, Birmingham, Lichfield and Derby.\n\nFour Roman roads are named in the Laws of Edward the Confessor; Watling Street, Ermine Street, the Fosse Way and Hikenild (or Icknield) Street. Hikenild Street, is generally supposed to be connected with the Iceni. Various forms of the name, the earliest, in Anglo-Saxon, are Icenhilde Weg or Icenilde We. These roads are from the borders of Norfolk through Cambridgeshire, Bucks, Berks, Hants, and Wilts into Dorset. These locations however would identify the path as Icknield Way, an Iron Age trackway running from Norfolk to Dorset. \n\nThis road got the name Ryknild Street during the 12th century when it was named by Ranulf Higdon, a monk writing in 1344 in his \"Polychronicon\". Higdon, gives the name of the fourth road as Rikenild Strete, which, he says, tends from the south-west to the north, and begins at St. David's and continues to the mouth of the Tyne, passing Worcester, Droitwich, Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, and Chesterfield. It has borne that name, or Rigning, Reenald, or Rignall, from early times. In three of the four MSS. of Higdon, the name is given Rikenilde, Rikenyldes, and in the fourth, which is said to be one of the earliest, Hikenil Street. Trevisa's English translation (1387) calls it Rykeneldes Street. Harverfield writing in the Victoria County History of Warwickshire doubted if the road had any real and original right to either name, preferring Ryknild as no less correct, (or no more wrong) and being able to separate it from Icknield Street in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. It is now called Icknield or Ryknild Street to separate it from the older Icknield Way. A kept part of the Roman road can be seen at Sutton Park in Birmingham.\n\n", "id": "299280", "title": "Icknield Street"}

He received the Victoria Cross. The cross is the highest award for bravery against the enemy, and can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.\n\nGrenfell was born on 4 September 1880. His parents were Sophia and Pascoe Du Pré Grenfell. He was one of fifteen children. He had a twin brother, Riversdale Grenfell. He was also in the 9th Lancers and killed in action in September 1914. Admiral John Pascoe Grenfell was their grandfather. Field Marshal Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell was their uncle. An older brother, Lieutenant Robert Septimus Grenfell, 21st Lancers, was killed in a cavalry charge during the Battle of Omdurman in 1898. Three other brothers, Cecil Grenfell, Howard Maxwell Grenfell and Arthur Morton Grenfell all reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army. A cousin, Lieutenant Claude George Grenfell was killed at Spion Kop during the Boer War. Two other cousins Julian Grenfell (the poet) and his brother Gerald William Grenfell were killed in the First World War.\n\nGrenfell was a representative cricket player at Eton collage. He joined the army in 1900 and first served in the Second Boer War in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.\n\nLater, he served in First World War in the 9th Lancers, British Army. He was 33 years old and a Captain, when he was awarded the VC for the following brave deed.\n\nOn 24 August 1914 at Audregnies, Belgium, Captain Grenfell rode with the regiment in a charge against a large body of unbroken German infantry. Damages of friendly army were so heavy, and Grenfell was left as the senior officer. When he was reorganizing the regiment behind a railway bank, he was twice hit and severely wounded. But once he was asked to save the guns by Major Ernest Wright Alexander of the 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, Grenfell and some volunteers helped to push the guns out of range of enemy fire, under a shower of bullets.\nLondon Gazette on 16 September 1914 wrote as follows:\nHe was killed in action on 24 May 1915 and is buried in the Vlamertinghe Military Cemetery.\n\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers housed in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, England.\n\nAll nine of the Grenfell brothers were expert polo players. Francis and his brother Riversdale Grenfell were regarded as the best in the family. Francis was rated at an 8 goal handicap. The twin brothers were on the Ranelagh team that won the American Open. And they were on the team Freebooters, alongside Leopold Christian Duncan Jenner and the Duke of Roxburghe, that won the Hurlingham Champion Cup.\n\n\n", "id": "299282", "title": "Francis Octavius Grenfell"}

Before 1994, KwaZulu-Natal was made up of the province of Natal and the KwaZulu homeland.\n\nIn the 1830s, the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal was part of the Zulu Kingdom. The southern part of KwaZulu-Natal was a Boer republic called Natalia (1839-1843). In 1843, Natalia became a British colony. Zululand () remained independent until 1879. \n\nToday KwaZulu Natal is the home of the Zulu nation. It is called the \"garden province.\" Two natural areas, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal is located in the southeast of South Africa. It borders three other provinces, the Indian Ocean, and the countries of Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho. Its capital is Pietermaritzburg and its largest city is Durban.\n\nKwaZulu-Natal is about in area, making it about the same size as Portugal. The province has three different geographic areas. The lowland region lies along the Indian Ocean coast. It is very narrow in the south and widens in the northern part of the province. The central region is called the Natal Midlands. The midlands are hilly plateaus that rise toward the west. \n\nThe third region is mountainous. The two mountain ranges are the Drakensberg Mountains in the west and the Lebombo Mountains in the north. The Drakensberg mountains are basalt cliffs that rise near Lesotho. The Lebombo Mountains are ancient granite mountains that run south from Swaziland. The Tugela River flows west to east across the center of the province and is the region's largest river.\n\nThe coastal areas have dense stands of subtropical trees and shrubs and deep ravines. Afromontane Forest grows on the steep sides of the ravines. The midlands have moist (wet) grasslands and small pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north is mostly wet savanna. The Drakensberg region is alpine grassland.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in the province is HIV infection. The country of South Africa has more HIV-positive citizens than any other country in the world. KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection of all of the provinces. According to UNAIDS in 2009, the infection rate is 39%.\n\nMany people die from complications from AIDS. Infected people in KwaZulu-Natal do not have the health care, medicine, and proper food they need to stay healthy. HIV/AIDS has slowed economic growth by destroying human capital, the ability of people to make money in society.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "299377", "title": "KwaZulu-Natal"}

It began in South Korea. As well as music, K-pop has grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults throughout Asia. There is a lot of interest in the fashions and styles of Korean idol groups and singers.\n\nK-pop can now reach a much larger audience through use of the Internet. With Facebook fan pages, iTunes, Twitter, and music videos on YouTube, K-pop is becoming popular in many other countries around the world.\n\nToday, young people like K-Pop star fashion. The World Fashion Company spoke to G-Dragon from Big Bang, because his fashion is unique. Jeremy Scott, a well-known American fashion designer, worked together with CL from the K-Pop band 2NE1, to design clothes. \n\nGroup dancing is one of the most important parts of K-Pop. Group members dance in sync. They want fans to copy their dance moves, so they perform easy dance routines. \n\nThe setting up of Seo Tai-ji & Boys in 1992 was a turning point for popular music in South Korea. Using rap rock and techno styles, Hip hop duos such as Deux also were popular in the early 1990s.\nIn 1995, Korean businessman Lee Soo Man opened South Korea's largest talent agency, S.M. Entertainment and set up the first K-Pop girl groups and boy bands. By the late 1990s, new agencies like YG Entertainment, DSP Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment were producing talent as quickly as possible.\n\nGroups such as, H.O.T, Sechs Kies, god and Shinhwa, and artists like Drunken Tiger had huge success in the 1990s. \n\nThe talent agencies train new artists and bands for the K-pop industry. To make sure it is successful they take over every part of the young person's career. They can spend more than $400,000 to train and launch a new artist. Through this practice of apprenticeship, which often lasts two years or more, trainees are taught to sing, learn professional choreography, sculpt and shape their bodies through exercise, and study multiple languages, all the while attending school. In order to get this money back, the artists are signed up to long contracts, and with little money being paid. These have been described as slave contracts. The band Dong Bang Shin Ki were given a 13 year contract which the Korean courts have said was too long and had too many restrictions. With CD sales being low, and Internet sales making only a few cents from a song, most money is made through tours and selling merchandise. \n\nK-Pop is becoming popular outside of Asia, most notably in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In 2009, the Wonder Girls became the first Korean singers on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single, \"Nobody\". The following year, solo artist Taeyang and 2ne1 also reached the top of various music charts throughout the United States and Canada with albums and hit songs. In 2011, Big Bang's album \"Tonight\" became the first K-pop album to reach the top 10 on US iTunes chart. It was also only non-English language album in the top 100. \nTo make the genre popular around the world, K-pop artists are starting to work with talent outside of Korea. In the United States, Korean artists are touring with groups such as the Jonas Brothers. They are also working with well-known producers including Kanye West, Teddy Riley, Diplo, Rodney Jerkins, and will.i.am.\n\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK decided to ban K pop from the New Year's Eve show in 2012 for political reasons, due to ongoing disputes between Japan and Korea over Liancourt Rocks.\n\nKorean rock includes bands like Guckkasten, YB and Nell.

It is between 34th Street and 59th Street, from 8th Avenue to the Hudson River.\n\nThe neighborhood has transportation, hospital and warehouse infrastructure for the Midtown Manhattan business district.

The 1969 edition of the \"Plan for New York City\" book, authored by the City Planning Commission, stated that people of modest means were being driven from the area by development pressures due to the Midtown location. Today, many actors live in the neighborhood due to its closeness to the Broadway theaters and Actors Studio training school.\n\n\"Hell's Kitchen\" generally refers to the area from 34th to 59th streets, southwest of Central Park. Starting west of 8th Avenue, city zoning regulations limit buildings to 6 stories high (although exceptions are often made). As a result, most of the buildings are older, often walk-ups.

The post office for 10019 is known as Radio City Station, the original name for Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue.\n\nSeveral different explanations exist for the original name.

Natural, unpasteurized honey has been known to transmit infection and intoxication with the pathogen and the neurotoxin. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease causing a flaccid paralysis; the neurotoxin blocks neurotransmitters. This results in an inability to contract muscles.

Dietary habits are the usual decisions someone or a culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. With the word diet, it is often expressed the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos, due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthful. A proper nutrition requires a proper ingestion and, also important, the absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality, and can also define cultures and play a role in religion.\n\nDiets are about eating the right quantity and type of food at the right time. When people talk about a diet, they are usually referring to a special kind of diet. When someone says they are \"dieting\", it means that they are trying to lose weight. People who study diet and eating habits are called dietitians.\n\nWhen the diet is not right, people can gain or lose weight. They may become overweight or underweight. To get back to their normal weight, they need to change their diet. This may be very hard to do. Often help from specialist is required.\n\nSome people will also do fasting - they will not eat anything for some time to lose weight, balance their diet and clean their bodies.\n\nSome people have diseases where they cannot eat certain foods without becoming very sick. They need to change their diet to avoid these foods. A food allergy is a condition in which a specific food makes someone sick.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299531", "text": "Second Party System\n\nThe Second Party System is a name for the political party system in the United States during the 1800s. It is a phrase used by historians and political scientists used to describe the time period between 1828 and 1854. People quickly became more interested in voting starting in 1828. More people came to political rallies and showed up to vote on election day. There were also more partisan newspapers, which supported a certain political party. People became very loyal to their party. \n\nThere were two main political parties during this time period. One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson.\n\nThere were also a number of important minor parties. The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. The Liberty Party in the 1840s was an important abolitionist party (against slavery). The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party.\n\nThe Second Party System was an important part of the politics, society, economics, and culture of the Jacksonian Era. It was followed by the Third Party System after 1854. \n\nThe phrase \"second party system\" was defined by the historian Richard P. McCormick. He said that the system was:\n\nA number of important historical people were political leaders in this system. Some famous democrats were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. Some famous Whigs were: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. \n\nThe United States presidential election in 1824 did not have any political parties. There were four main candidates for president: Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams. At the end of the race, none of the candidates had enough votes in the electoral college to win, and the United States House of Representatives had to choose the winner. The three final candidates were Adams, Crawford, and Jackson. Even though Clay was not one of these finalists, he was the Speaker of the House, and it was his job to negotiate who would become president. Jackson had the most popular votes (votes cast by citizens) and the most electoral votes (votes cast by the electoral college), but was not elected. Instead, John Quincy Adams was elected president. He immediately chose Clay to be his Secretary of State.\n\nJackson loudly declared this to be a \"corrupt bargain.\" Jackson was a very popular politician, the most famous fighter of the American Indian Wars, and a hero of the War of 1812. He gathered his supporters in politics and the local militias and created the Democratic Party. Martin Van Buren, a brilliant leader in New York politics, was Jackson's most important supporter. Van Buren was popular in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and he had the support of their electoral college votes. The new Democratic Party beat Adams in the U.S. presidential election of 1828 and Jackson was elected president. Van Buren became the Secretary of State, and later Vice President. Adams, Clay, and their supporters in the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans.\n\nAndrew Jackson opposed (was against) the idea of giving special favors to special interest groups. He strongly opposed the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank was a federal institution that worked somewhat like a central bank. (It was very similar to the Federal Reserve System that would be developed later.) The bank was controlled by the banker Nicholas Biddle and supported by Henry Clay. Jackson did not like any banks, and he did not believe in paper money. (He believed that money should only be gold and silver.) As president, he was able to close the Second Bank.\n\nJackson continued to attack the banking system. He issued his \"Specie Circular\" in July 1836. (\"Specie\" is a word that means gold and silver used as money.) The Circular said that only gold and siver coins, and not paper money, could be used to buy federal land. This made most businessmen and bankers join the Whig party. Also, cities that depended on commerce (trade) and industry became supporters of the Whig party. Jackson became more popular with subsistence farmers (farmers who grow crops to eat, but not to sell) and day laborers.\n\nIn US politics, the \"Spoils System\" was the practice of a political party giving its supporters positions in government. These government jobs were given as rewards and incentives (something that makes a person try harder) to keep working for the political party. \n\nJackson used the spoils system a lot when he was president. He rewarded his supporters and promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. He believed in the theory of rotation in office, where people would only remain in a position for a short time. He believed that this would keep the civil service from becoming corrupt. Other leaders of the Democratic Party wanted to give civil service jobs to friends and loyal party members. In total, Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent (20%) of the original civil service. \n\nAs president, Jackson encouraged the use of the spoils system. It became an important part of the Second Party System and the Third Party System. The spoils system was ended in the 1890s.\n\n\n\n", "id": "299531", "title": "Second Party System"}

She died unmarried. She was known at court simple as \"Madame Victoire\".\n\nVictoire, Daughter of France was born at the Palace of Versailles in 1733. As a daughter of the king of France she had the title of \"daughter of France\" which was highly prized within the royal family. She was the seventh child of ten. From birth she was known as \"Madame Quatrième\", as she was not baptised. She was however eventually named Victoire Louise Marie Thérèse, being known simply by her first name. Unlike the older children in the royal family, Victoire was raised at the Palace of Versailles but only till the age of five when she left Versailles to live at \"Abbey of Fontevraud\" in northern France. Leaving in 1738 with her sisters Sophie and Thérèse. The princesses left Versailles on 6 June 1738 accompanied by furniture and a military escort. \n\nAt the age of 15, 1748, she was allowed to return to the royal court. Her religious education stayed with her all her life and she would always remain close to her siblings and mother. Victoire arrived to a court which was dominated by the powerful Madame de Pompadour who had become Louis XV's mistress in 1745. Victoire was often described as the most beautiful of the kings daughters. The only project for marriage arose in 1753 when it was suggested that she marry King Ferdinand VI of Spain as his wife was seriously ill at the time. However she recovered and there were never any other projects. \n\nIn 1765, her older brother died of consumption at Fontainebleau at the age of 36. Victoire, like all of her sisters, mourned their brother greatly. As a result of his death, the future Louis XVI became the heir to the throne and the family was pushed closer together. Three years later, 1768, Versailles was again mourning, this time for the death of Queen Marie. The sadness within the royal family was worsened by the kings new passion for \"Madame du Barry\". The princesses redused to acknowledge the Barry and this caused friction within the court. However, at the death of Louis XV in 1774, Madame du Barry was exiled and Louis XVI came to the throne. Victoire and her sister Marie Adélaïde were close to the young king but did not like his wife \"Marie Antoinette\" purely because she was Austrian. \nLouis XV having died, Victoire and her sisters had to move out of their apartments and soon took up residence at the \"Château de Bellevue\" outside the capital. Victoire lived their with Marie Adélaïde and their younger sister Sophie and they redecorated the building to suit their tastes. Having no power at Versailles, the sisters began touring France at great expense which caused havoc for France's already bad finances. When Versailles was stormed, the sisters were at Bellevue and thus were not placed under house arrest. They quickly fled France and went to stay with their niece Marie Clotilde of France, (Turin) who was the wife of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. They then traveled to Rome in 1791 and soon ended up in Naples in 1796, home of Marie Antoinette's sister, the Queen of Naples. Moving to Corfu in 1799 followed by Trieste where Victoire eventually died of breast cancer. Marie Adélaïde died the following year in Rome. The two sisters were bought back to France during the reign of their nephew Louis XVIII and buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis. \n\n\n", "id": "299603", "title": "Victoire of France"}

Assisting Robin in coaching are Jonty Rodhes (Fielding Coach) and Shaun Pollock (Bowling Coach).\n\nReliance Industries purchased the rights of MI (\"Abbreviation of Mumbai Indians\") for a total of \"Rupees 441 Cr ($ 112.9 m)\" during the auction on 24 January 2008. As the name suggests, the franchise represents the city of Mumbai.\n\nMI lost their Team Captain & Icon Player, Sachin Tendulkar due to a Hamstring Injury. Harbhajan Singh replaced him as the captain of the side. Due to some issues, Shaun Pollock had to takeover which bought some stability into the side for the first time in the season. The Mumbai Indians finished with a total of 7 wins and 7 losses and thus missed out on a playoff spot by a few points.\n\nDue to issues in India, the second edition of IPL ha to be held in South Africa. The second season also proved to be a setback for the team as they finished with a total of 5 Wins, 8 Loses and 1 No Result (Match got cancelled due to rain); and thus not making it to the playoffs again.\n\nDuring the auction held for the 2010 IPL Season, Mumbai Indians purchased Kieron Pollard for $750,000. This proved to be a great boost for the team. After the group stages, Mumbai Indians won 10 out of their 14 matches thus qualifying them for the playoffs. In the semifinals against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians emerged victorious by 35 runs. \n\nThe Indians then faced Chennai Super Kings in the final of the 2010 Season; the match was held in \"Navi Mumbai\". MI lost the match by 22 runs thus finishing as the runner-ups. \n\nThey completed the season with a total of 11 Wins and 5 loses and also got a spot in the Airtel Champions League T20. Captain Sachin Tendulkar scored 681 runs in the 2010 season.\n\nMumbai Indians introduce two new players to their squad, Aiden Blizzard and James Franklin. Both these players perform well for the team in their debut season. Team Captain Sachin Tendulkar put up an impressive performance by scoring 613 runs in 10 matches and at the same time, team's senior bowler, Lasith Malinga took 28 wickets out of the 15 games. Impressive performance by MI in the group stages got them a place in the playoffs. Due to the addition of 2 more teams from this edition of Indian Premier League, the playoffs were a bit different. \n\nMumbai Indians beat Kolkata Knight Riders in their eliminator by 4 wickets. MI went on to face Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifier 2. \"Mumbai Indians\" lost to \"Royal Challengers Bangalore\" by 43 runs which ended the journey of Mumbai Indians in the 2011 Season. Defending Champions Chennai beat Bangalore in the finals thus getting the first spot. Royal Challengers Bangalore finished second while MI finished third.\n\nTendulkar scored an unbeaten ton against Kochi Tuskers Kerala of just 59 balls and was the only centurion from Mumbai Indians that season.\n", "id": "299697", "title": "Mumbai Indians"}

Only reindeer (caribou) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males.\n\nWhile an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. \n\nAntlers are one of the most striking cases of male secondary sex characteristics in the animal kingdom. They grow faster than any other mammal bones. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is mineralized to become bone. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. The antlers fall off at some point. \n\nTo re-grow antlers each year uses up nutrition, so they are honest signals of food gathering capability.\n\nThe principle means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection, which operates by two mechanisms: Male–male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. \n\nMale–male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates; second, they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility. Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve fertilization success.\n\n", "id": "299698", "title": "Antlers"}

Their \"Traction Avant\" (pictured) had the first mass production of three revolutionary features that are still in use today. They are: a unitary body with no separate frame, four-wheel independent suspension, and front-wheel drive.\n\nLater on, in the 1950s, Citroën developed a remarkable type of suspension. A high-pressure hydraulic system was used in over 9 million Citroën cars. They included the DS, SM, GS, CX, BX, XM, Xantia, C5, and C6. Self-levelling is the principal benefit – the car kept a constant ride height above the road. It adjusted to the passenger and cargo load, and gave a very soft suspension. This type of suspension smooths out road irregularities without disturbing the occupants. It is often compared to riding on a 'magic carpet' for this reason.\n\n", "id": "299705", "title": "Citroën"}

And 2,200 pressed British plants in Derby Museum and Art Gallery are also Whittaker's.\n\nWhittaker's exact birth date is not known. He was christened at Quarndon near Derby on 8 February 1813. His father was also named Joseph, and was a labourer who married to Sarah (born Clarke). The son is sometimes reported as being born in Breadsall in 1815.\n\nIn 1838 Whittaker went on a voyage to Austratia as \"gardener\". His new employer was Lt. Col. George Gawler who had recently been appointed as the second Governor of South Australia. Whittaker, seven other employees from Derbyshire, Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838 in Adelaide. They had traveled for four months via Rio de Janeiro. When Whittaker and Gawler arrived they found poor conditions so gardening was not important.\nWhittaker collected plants around Adelaide in South Australia in 1839-40. Whittaker traveled to places within South Australia where he collected a wide range of plant samples. These included Mount Lofty range, Mount Jagged, River Torrens, River Murray and the Hindmarsh River. Whittaker was the first person to collect from the mountainous district of the Fleurieu Peninsula, Encounter Bay and Mount Barker.\n\nWhittaker stayed in South Australia for nineteen months before sailing home on the \"Katherine Stuart Forbes\" which left from Port Adelaide on 11 April 1840. On the way home his boat stopped four times at Kangaroo Island, Mauritius, St Helena and Corvo Island in the Azores. Whittaker collected further plant samples while the boat was in these harbours.\n\nWhittaker arrived back in England on 23 September 1840 and by 1844 had begun collecting plants again. His activity peaked in 1851 and 52, ceasing sometime after 1867. He collected from many parts of Derbyshire, but he occasionally traveled outside the county including Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, Rhyl and Denbigh in Wales.\n\nBy 1846 he was living at Breadsall in Derbyshire where he was a teacher at Breadsall Boys School. From here he exchanged letters with Sir William J. Hooker Director of the Kew Botanic Gardens. Because Whittaker had planed to write a number of books on British botany, and needed to exchange some of his Australian and related samples for that. Whittaker collected about 300 plants that were eventually acquired by Kew. Whittaker's collections from outside the U.K. are now in Kew Gardens. Whittaker had the species of sundew \"Drosera whittakeri\" named after him.\n\nIn February 1847 Whittaker became a member of the Botanical Society of London and he swapped plant samples between 1849 to 1853 with its members. He then joined the Botanical Exchange Club and finally the Botanical Locality Record Club. By 1847 he had enough information to publish “a list of rare plants found in the neighbourhood of Breadsall, Derbyshire”. This contained a mixture of both rare and relatively common species, and gives a good information of the botanical variety of the area at that time. In 1857 he was the schoolmaster of ninety children at Breadsall in Derbyshire, a village whose inhabitants included the naturalists Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe and Francis Darwin. The school was funded by the Harpur-Crewe family.\n\nWhittaker lived in the small village of Morley near Derby in the late 1850s.\nHe lived with his wife Mary in the house named Ferriby Brook.\nHe continued to teach there, taking up to twelve scholars into his classes, usually after they had left the local school, and were between eight and eighteen years of age. He eventually established a large collection of living plants. Local gardener groups reported that he was growing over 1,300 different species. In 1864 he was publishing works referring the local extinction of the \"Lady's Slipper Orchid\" Cypripedium calceolus with the Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe. By 1871 he quitted a schoolmaster, and became a “seedsman and florist”. By 1881 successfully became a “nurseryman and farmer”. He lived with two servants and twenty year old William Whitehead in his house. Whitehead was to eventually become a partner in their market gardening venture.\n\nWhittaker’s plant collecting activities began to decline around 1863, around the time his botanical partner, Henry Harpur Crewe, moved away to become the Rector of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire. In the following year they cooperated in the production of a manuscript list of the principal flowering plants and ferns of Derbyshire. His partnership with Crewe lasted for at least eighteen years and was very productive. The Harpur Crewe's family lived nearby Calke Abbey and they had funded the school at Breadsall.\n\nIn the late 1880s Joseph Whittaker gave valuable assistance, and supplied a range of plant samples, to Rev W.H.Painter who was preparing to publish a book on the Flora of Derbyshire. Many of Whittaker’s samples and records were also used by William Richardson Linton, vicar of Shirley in a further Flora of Derbyshire in 1903.\n\nWhittaker died on 2nd March 1894. By popular subscription, a memorial reading desk and engraved brass inscription were built for St Matthew's Church, Morley, where he was a church warden and where he was buried.\n\nWhittaker's collection at Kew Gardens is from his trip to Australia and from ports where he stayed shortly during the way home. He also left a collection of 2,200 pressed plants in 79 volumes, mostly from Derbyshire, which are now held in the herbarium at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. They provide important evidential samples for local studies on the flora of Derbyshire. Due to his participation in botanical exchanges clubs, there are now Whittaker samples in many UK museum collections, including those at Bolton, Birmingham, Gloucester and Manchester. The Wisbech and Fenland Museum also has a small collection.\n\nThe carnivorous sundew species was scientifically described by the French botanist Jules Émile Planchon in 1848. This is commonly known as the \"Scented Sundew\" or \"Whittaker's Sundew\".\n", "id": "299756", "title": "Joseph Whittaker (botanist)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299761", "text": "Cooper Creek\n\nCooper Creek (formerly Cooper's Creek) () is one of the most famous rivers in Australia. It is sometimes called the Barcoo River after one of its tributaries. It is one of three major Queensland river systems that flow into Lake Eyre. The water flow in Cooper Creek comes from monsoonal rains falling months earlier and many hundreds of kilometres away in eastern Queensland. At in length it is the second longest inland river system in Australia after the Murray-Darling system.\n\nCharles Sturt named the river in 1845 after Charles Cooper, the Chief Justice of South Australia. The explorers Burke and Wills died from starvation in 1861 on the banks of Cooper Creek. John King survived the expedition with help from the Aborigines. Only ten years after the explorers' deaths, homesteads were being built along the creek. A station (farm) at Innamincka was the first permanent settlement in the area.\n\nBy 1880 the reliable water source had attracted many settlers. The whole area was taken up and stocked with cattle. This pushed the local Aborigines from their traditional lands. By 1900 their population was just 30, only 10% of the original number, as influenza and measles took their toll.\n\nThe creek starts west of the Great Dividing Range as two rivers, the Thomson from near Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine, about inland from Rockhampton. \n\nCooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of channels, making its way south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. In most years, the water soaks into the earth, fills channels and waterholes, or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre. In very wet years, however, it can flood the entire Channel Country and reach Lake Eyre after flowing through the Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and the Tirari Desert. Although the Cooper carries much more water than the Diamantina and the Georgina, it does not flow into Lake Eyre as often as those rivers. One reason is that much more water is lost than with the Diamantina or Georgina. During a flood Cooper Creek may be as wide as .\n\nMost of the land around the Cooper is used for sheep and cattle grazing on natural grasslands. The rainfall is not reliable enough to grow crops.

He was frequent champion and leading player in the sport. He is most well known for his skill at the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous). He won six world billiards titles in this game. \n\nCrane became very interested in billiards when he was 11 years old. He started play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift. His parents soon replaced their dining room table with a 4' by 8' pool table. Soon, Crane started to play in public at a local pool room. Crane could play all day and never get bored. He could not wait to get home from school and start to play pool.\n\nThough he taught himself to play, at age 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room. He called each shot in advance. His parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table. Over the next ten years some of the best players, including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi, came to practice with Crne. Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years, Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old.\n\nIn February 1939, at age 26, Crane sank 150 balls in a row against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match. The game was played on a difficult 5' by 10' table in Layton, Utah. This was impressive. But the crowd cheered him, and he continued to play. He finally put 309 consecutive balls thus shattering the previous world record of 244 consecutive balls.\n\nHe won his first world title in 1942. Over the next thirty years, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. At the 1966 World Crown tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals. He never let his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle. No other player has ever done this. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.\n\nCrane found it hard to make a living only by playing pool, even though he was very skilled. In 1957, he began working as a Cadillac salesman at a dealership in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. At Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit had a pool table. Crane would run balls while answering questions. Working at a regular job was not Crane's first choice. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, he said \"If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table.\"\n\nHe was \"tall, lean man with the imperial bearing of the headmaster of Eton,\" Crane got the nickname \"The Deacon\" because of his gentlemanly ways, his very cautious approach to the game and his careful style of clothing. He always wore a conservative suit when he played. \n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" interviewed Crane's wife Althea. They were married 64 years. She said, \"A lot of people, if it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning, they'd take off their coat to play. But not Irving Crane.\" Minnesota Fats, once said, \"Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva\". Willie Mosconi criticized Crane for his cautious style. He wrote in his 1993 autobiography, \"Willie's Game\", that \"Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it.\" \n\nCrane became a member of the Billiard Congress of America's hall of fame in 1978. In 1999, Crane was number eight on \"Billiard Digest's\" fifty greatest players of the century. In 1980 Crane retired from professional play. He stopped playing entirely in about 1996. On 17 November 17 2001, four days after entering a nursing home, Crane died of natural causes. He was 88 years old.\n", "id": "299768", "title": "Irving Crane"}

It happened immediately after the Bruins defeated the Canucks. There were at least 140 people that were reported as being injured in the incident, one critically and at least four people were stabbed. Close to 100 people were arrested.\n\nPeople were angry over the result of the final game and threw objects at the large screens that were at the viewing area. They set fire to Boston Bruins flags, overturned and set fire to two vehicles in front of the main Canada Post headquarters. There were reports of similar car fires in a nearby parking garage that included two police cruisers. The rioters smashed windows and looted stores. The riot ended around midnight when people in the crowd either went home or were arrested. The mayor of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson, called the rioters \"a small group of troublemakers\". Several of the participants in the riot turned themselves in to the police after their faces were shown on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. According to CBC News, the destruction caused by the rioters was worse than the riot that followed the Canucks loss in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, especially the looting aspect. \n", "id": "299786", "title": "2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot"}

Most have chloroplasts (alga and plant characteristic).\n\nEuglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis.\n\nOver 1,000 species of \"Euglena\" have been described, and there are more to be discovered. Marin \"et al.\" (2003) revised the genus to include several species without chloroplasts, formerly classified as \"Astasia\" and \"Khawkinea\".\nWhen acting as a heterotroph (animal), the \"Euglena\" surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by phagocytosis. When acting as an autotroph, the \"Euglena\" uses chloroplasts to produce sugars by photosynthesis. \n\nThe number and shape of chloroplasts within \"Euglena\" varies greatly. \"Euglena\" are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large flagellum for locomotion. To detect light, the cell has an eyespot, a primitive organelle that filters sunlight into light-detecting, photo-sensitive structures at the base of the flagellum; allowing only certain wavelengths of light to hit it. \n\nThis photo-sensitive area detects the light that is able to be transmitted through the eyespot. When such light is detected, the \"Euglena\" may shift its position to get better photosynthesis. \n\nThe motility of Euglena also allows hunting. Most \"Euglena\" are considered mixotrophs: autotrophs in sunlight and heterotrophs in the dark. \"Euglena\" do not have plant cell walls, but have a pellicle instead. The pellicle is made of protein bands that spiral down the length of the \"Euglena\" and lie beneath the plasma membrane.\n\n\"Euglena\" can survive in fresh and salt water. In low moisture conditions, \"Euglena\" forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a spore until environmental conditions improve. \"Euglena\" can also survive in the dark by storing paramylon granules inside the chloroplast.\n\n\"Euglenas\" reproduce asexually, and there has been no evidence of sexual reproduction. Reproduction includes transverse division and longitudinal division, which both occur in the active and encysted forms. \n", "id": "299817", "title": "Euglena"}

The set has 13 volumes, or sections, and has been printed often as 13 physical books (numbered I-XIII), rather than one large book. It has been translated into Latin, with the title \"\"Euclidis Elementorum\"\". It is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times.\n\nEuclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time. His \"Elements\" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms.\n\nThe \"Elements\" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of \"greatest common divisors\". They were in his \"Elements\". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers.\n\nThe geometrical system described in the \"Elements\" was long known simply as \"geometry\" and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, that system is referred to as \"Euclidean geometry\", to distinguish it from other so-called \"non-Euclidean geometries\" which mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\n\nOccasionally in ancient times, writings were attributed to celebrated authors but were not written by them. It is in this way that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the Elements were sometimes included in the collection. The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius of Perga. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres. The chief result is that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes.\n\nThe spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by Isidore of Miletus. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.\n\n\n\n\"Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume\", based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press, ISBN 978-1-888009-18-7.\n\n\"The Elements: Books I-XIII-Complete and Unabridged\" (2006), translated by Sir Thomas Heath, Barnes & Noble, ISBN 978-0-7607-6312-4.\n\n", "id": "299930", "title": "Euclid's Elements"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299942", "text": "Gene duplication\n\nGene duplication (or gene amplification) is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene.\n\nGene duplication is important in supplying raw genetic material – new genes – to biological evolution. This has been recognized since the 1930s. Recent genomic sequence data show that duplicated genes are common in all organisms surveyed. \n\nIn classical genetics it may occur as an error in crossing-over during meiosis, or the duplication of an entire chromosome.\n\nIn non-classical genetics it may happen by a retrotransposition event.\n\nThe second copy of the gene is often relatively free from selective pressure. Mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations.\n\nA duplication is the opposite of a deletion. Duplications arise from unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes. The product of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion.\n\nGene duplication is believed to play a major role in evolution; this idea was first suggested 100 years ago. Susumu Ohno was one of the most famous developers of this theory in his classic book \"Evolution by gene duplication\" (1970). Ohno argued that gene duplication is the most important evolutionary force since the emergence of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).\n\nMajor genome duplication events are not uncommon. It is believed that the entire yeast genome underwent duplication about 100 million years ago. Plants are the most prolific genome duplicators. For example, wheat is hexaploid (a kind of polyploid), meaning that it has six copies of its genome.\n\nNormally, a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed, but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function. Therefore, a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness.\nThis freedom from consequences allows for more mutations to be 'carried' in the population. Some of these might increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. \n\nThe two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, orthologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species, and are created from species-splitting.\n\n", "id": "299942", "title": "Gene duplication"}

It is also the headquarters of the BBC itself and contains the offices of key figures within the organisation, such as the Director General.\n\nThe Original Construction of Broadcasting House took place in 1932, and opened on the 14 May 1932, 8 years after the corporation was created and was built as a housing for all their current operations, of offices and radio operations. Architect George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBC's civil engineer, M T Tudsbery. The original interiors were the work of the Australian-Irish architect Raymond McGrath. He set up and directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio, the associated green and dressing rooms, and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style. It was later said of his efforts that \"the designs for the BBC gave the first real fillip to industrial design in England\".\n\nThe building was designed with the radio elements, such as the studios, in a central location constructed of Portland stone. The remainder of the building was steel framed and faced with Portland stone on the outside. These areas housed the offices, so that they could be both away from the noise of the radio operations, and have access to daylight. Issues with local residents also caused the structure to be changed: The east side of the building blocked out the light to local residents, and after complaints and seeking the right of ancient lights, the building was changed so that the East side of the building had a sloped roof. The building also faced issues with the fact that both the Bakerloo and the Victoria lines of the London Underground, as well as sewers 100 years old ran under the site.\n\nThe building also incorporated other elements, the ground floor of the building was fitted with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street, as it was believed that to finance such a project (costing £25,000,000 in today's money) they would need to rent out the ground floor as a retail unit.

She is sometimes known as \"the Jackie Robinson of tennis\" for breaking the color barrier. Gibson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\n\nAlthea Gibson was born at 9:00 am EDT on August 25, 1927 in Silver, Clarendon County, South Carolina to Daniel and Annie Bell Gibson. Althea had two siblings, a brother, Daniel Jr. (known as \"Bubba\") and a sister, Mildred. \nGibson played tennis while going to school for an education. In 1946, she moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, to work on her tennis game with Dr. Hubert A. Eaton and enrolled at Williston High School.\n\nIn 1958, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Before the open era of tennis began, there was no prize money, other than an expense allowance, and no endorsement contracts. To begin earning prize money, tennis players had to give up their amateur status. As there was no professional tour for women, Gibson was limited to playing in a series of exhibition tours.\n\nAccording to Lance Tingay of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Gibson was ranked in the world top ten from 1956 through 1958, reaching a career high of No. 1 in those rankings in 1957 and 1958. Gibson was included in the year-end top ten rankings issued by the United States Tennis Association in 1952 and 1953 and from 1955 through 1958. She was the top-ranked U.S. player in 1957 and 1958. In 1957 Althea became the first African American woman to win Wimbledon. She won again in 1958. In 1958, she appeared as the celebrity challenger on the TV panel show \"What's My Line?\".\n\nIn retirement, Gibson wrote her autobiography and in 1959 recorded an album, \"Althea Gibson Sings\", as well as appearing in the motion picture, \"The Horse Soldiers.\" In 1964, she became the first African American woman to play in the Ladies Professional Golf Association. However, she was too old to be successful and only played for a few years.\n\nIn 1971, Gibson was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and in 1975, she was appointed the New Jersey state commissioner of athletics. After 10 years on the job, she went on to work in other public service positions, including serving on the governor's council on physical fitness. In later years, she suffered two cerebral aneurysms and, in 1992, a stroke. A few years later, Gibson called her former doubles partner Angela Buxton and told her she was considering suicide, as she was living on welfare and unable to pay for rent or medication. Buxton arranged for a letter to appear in a tennis magazine. Buxton told Gibson nothing about the letter, but the latter received nearly US$1 million from around the world.\n\nGibson was married twice. Her first marriage to William Darben took place on October 17, 1965, but the couple was divorced in 1976, eleven years later. Darben died in 1995. She was also married to Sydney Llewellyn on April 11, 1983 and was divorced from him in 1988.\n\nOn September 28, 2003, at the age of 76, Gibson died in East Orange, New Jersey due to infections. She was buried there in the Rosedale Cemetery, at Orange, New Jersey. \n\nOn the opening night of the 2007 US Open, the 50th anniversary of Gibson's victory at the US Championships in 1957 (now the US Open), Gibson was inducted into US Open Court of Champions. She was a 1994 inductee of the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey and 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In September 2009, the City of Wilmington, NC named its new community tennis complex the Althea Gibson Tennis Center.\n\nGibson became the first African American woman to join the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, in 1964.

In \"Essai de Cosmologie\", Maupertuis noted:\n\nCould one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced...\n\nAll known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation.\n\nGenetic information is encoded in DNA, and transcribed into RNA, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy sources, etc. \n\nThe similarities include the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed (chirality). \n\nFurthermore, the genetic code (the \"translation table\" according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria to humans. \n\nThe universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent. A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins.\n\nAnother important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed phylogenetic trees (that is, \"genealogic trees\" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data, mapping them to phylogenetic trees, gave \"firm quantitative support for the unity of life. ...there is now strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life.\n\nTraditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, embryology, etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.\nSome things are deduced about LUA. It was not the very first cell, but one whose descendents survived beyond the very early stages of microbial evolution. On the basis of their presence in eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, about 325 proteins were present in the LUA.\n\nThese amino acids were probably the first to be built into proteins: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, and valine. These amino acids were also found in spark tube simulations, and analysis of the Murchison meteorite. The other amino acids, later additions to the genetic code, include several of the most complex amino acids.\n", "id": "300013", "title": "Common descent"}

The index is widely used in Canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level.\n\nAccording to the Meteorological Service of Canada, a humidex of at least 30 causes \"some discomfort\", at least 40 causes \"great discomfort\" and above 45 is \"dangerous\". When the humidex hits 54, then heat stroke is very near.\n\nThe current formula for getting the humidex (see below: Humidex formula) was developed by J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979. The humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States, in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity.\n\nThe record highest humidex in Canada occurred on July 25, 2007, when Carman, Manitoba hit 53.0.

The result is also known as the \"felt air temperature\" or \"apparent temperature\". For example, when the temperature is with very high humidity, the heat index can be about .\n\nThe human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, which evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, then the evaporation rate is reduced, so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air. Measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity, allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination, to another, at a higher temperature in drier air.\n\nThe heat index was developed in 1978 by George Winterling as the \"humiture\" and was adopted by the National Weather Service a year later. It is derived from work carried out by Robert G. Steadman. Like the wind chill index, the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height, clothing, amount of physical activity, thickness of blood, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure, and the wind speed. Large deviations from the typical values will result in heat-index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature.\n\nIn Canada, the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index. The humidex differs from the heat index in using the dew point rather than the relative humidity.\n\nThe heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 1.6 kPa. At standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 °C (57 °F) and a mixing ratio of 0.01 (10 g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air). This corresponds to an air temperature of 25°C and relative humidity of 50% in the sea-level psychrometric chart.\n\nAt high temperatures, the level of \"relative\" humidity needed to make the heat index higher than the actual temperature is lower than at cooler temperatures. For example, at approximately 27 °C (80 °F), the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45%, but at about 43°C (110°F), any relative-humidity reading above 17% will make the Heat Index higher than 43°C (110 °F).\n\nThe heat index is calculated only if the actual temperature is above 27 °C (80 °F), dew point temperatures greater than 12 °C (54 °F), and relative humidities higher than 40%. The heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun, so extra care must be taken while in the sun.\n\nSometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single terms \"apparent temperature\" or \"relative outdoor temperature\".\n\n\n", "id": "300044", "title": "Heat index"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=300067", "text": "Manhunter (movie)\n\nManhunter is an American crime thriller movie. It is the first film with the character Hannibal Lecter, a psychotic killer. It is based on a book by Thomas Harris, called \"Red Dragon\". The movie was written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars William Petersen, Brian Cox, Dennis Farina and Tom Noonan. It tells the story of a serial killer and the detectives who are trying to find him.\n\n\"Manhunter\" shows the science that police use to find criminals. This movie was not the only movie made from a book by Thomas Harris. Earlier, \"Black Sunday\" had been made, but not with the character of Lector. Later, \"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"Hannibal\", \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal Rising\" were also made from his books.\n\n\"Manhunter\" did not get very good reviews when it came out. It did not make a lot of money in cinemas. It took $15 million to make \"Manhunter\" but the movie only made $8.6 million in the United States. Today the movie gets better reviews and is seen by more people. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'.\n\nWill Graham (William Petersen) is an agent who worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He retired after he caught a killer named Hannibal Lecter (Brian Cox). Graham is asked by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to help with a new police case. Crawford is trying to find a killer named \"The Tooth Fairy\". Graham goes to the house of the killer's victims. He finds The Tooth Fairy's fingerprints there.\n\nGraham goes to a prison to meet Hannibal Lector again. Lector is very good at understanding how other people think. Graham asks him for help. It is clear that Graham is afraid of Lecter. Later on, a prison guard finds a letter that belongs to Lecter. The letter is from The Tooth Fairy. Graham and Crawford find out that The Tooth Fairy is talking to Lecter through advertisements in a newspaper. Graham asks a journalist from the newspaper to write an article despising the Tooth Fairy. They feel sure this will result in another advertisement, and this time they will pick up the code. The journalist is caught by The Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) and killed.\n\nThe Tooth Fairy, called \"Francis Dollarhyde\", works in a photographic lab. He is attracted to a woman he works with called Reba McClane. Reba is blind. Dollarhyde drives her home one night. They start a relationship with each other. This stops Dollarhyde from killing more people. One night Dollarhyde sees Reba with another man. He thinks she is having an affair but he is mistaken. Dollarhyde kills the other man and takes Reba to his house.\n\nGraham has found out how The Tooth Fairy finds his victims. The Tooth Fairy uses the home movies brought to his job to pick a family to kill. Now that he knows this, Graham is able to find out who The Tooth Fairy is. He goes to Dollarhyde's house with several policemen. Dollarhyde uses a shotgun to kill some of the policemen. Graham kills Dollarhyde and rescues Reba.\n\n\nThe movie was going to be named \"Red Dragon\" because this was the name of the book. The name was changed because it sounded like a karate movie. It was also changed because a movie named \"Year of the Dragon\" did very badly in cinemas.\n\nWilliam Petersen worked with policemen in Chicago and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to learn more about his part. Michael Mann took three years to write the movie, and he also spoke to policemen to learn about their jobs. Because of this, books have said the movie is very true to real life.\n\nTom Noonan started getting ready for the movie by reading about other serial killers. He did not like this idea when he started. He changed his mind and acted his own way instead. He said he wanted The Tooth Fairy to seem like \"he was doing this out of love\". Joan Allen played Dollarhyde's blind girlfriend. She went to the New York Institute for the Blind to learn about blind people. She walked with a mask on to learn about being blind.\n\nActors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin and Brian Dennehy were all asked to play Hannibal Lecktor. Brian Cox played the part instead. Cox read about a Scottish serial killer named Peter Manuel to learn about his part. William Petersen played Will Graham. He was chosen because Michael Mann liked his movie \"To Live and Die in L.A.\". Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were also asked to play the part. Tom Noonan says he was asked to act his part because Michael Mann thought he was very scary in real life.\n\nDante Spinotti, who filmed the movie, made use of strong colors. Parts of the movie with Will Graham and his wife use a \"romantic blue\". Parts that show The Tooth Fairy use an ugly green or purple color.\n\nWhen the move was being made, Tom Noonan asked that nobody saw him. Those people who could saw him called him \"Francis\", because he pretended to be his character the whole time. This made the other actors afraid of him. The first time Noonan met William Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window while making the last part of the movie. At first, actor Tom Noonan wore a fake tattoo of a dragon on his chest. The parts of the movie that showed this were made again without the tattoo. This is because Michael Mann and Tom Noonan thought it did not look right.\n\n\"Manhunter\"'s soundtrack album came out in 1986. It could be bought on cassette, tape and vinyl record but not on CD. In March 2010, the soundtrack came out on CD for the first time. One more song, named \"Jogger's Stakeout\" by The Reds, was on the CD.\n\nMusic in the film's screen credits which are not listed above included:\nBooks written about the movie discuss the relationship between Graham and The Tooth Fairy. They make a comparison between the characters and how they both live. It has also been said that movie gives the idea that to catch a killer you must think like one.\n\n\"Manhunter\" came out in the United States on 15 August 1986. It earned $8,620,929 in the United States. Its budget was $15 million, so it did not make as much money as it cost. It was shown in November 1987 during the London Film Festival and came out in the United Kingdom on 24 February 1989. In France, the movie was shown on 9 April 1987 at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier. It won the Critics Prize at this festival. It was also shown at the 2009 Camerimage Film Festival in Łódź, Poland. On 19 March 2011, the movie was showne at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood for its 25th anniversary. Michael Mann answered questions at this event.\n\n\"Manhunter\" came out on laserdisc in 1986. It also came out on VHS several times. It came out on DVD first in 2000. This DVD was made by Anchor Bay Entertainment and it could be bought with one disc or two discs. A different DVD also came out in 2003. In 2004, MGM also made a DVD of the movie. In 2007, \"The Hannibal Lecter Collection\" came out. This was a collection of \"Manhunter\", \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Hannibal\". \"The Hannibal Lector Collection\" also came out on Blu-ray in September 2009.\n\nWhen \"Manhunter\" came out, its reviews were not very good.\n\nReviews thought that the music and the color effects were not very good. William Petersen's acting was also thought of negatively. The \"New York Times\" thought the movie was very bad, and so did the \"Chicago Tribune\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" said the movie was too much like Michael Mann's television program \"Miami Vice\"; and so did \"Film Threat\", who thought that was why the movie did not do very well. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" did not like the movie's acting. On the other hand, \"Time\" magazine liked the movie. It called \"Manhunter\" \"bold\" and \"intelligent.\" Leonard Maltin liked the movie, and called it \"gripping\".\n\nToday, the reviews for the movie are much better. Salon.com says it is the best Hannibal movie. \"Slate\" magazine also thought it was very good, and said it inspired television programs like \"Millennium\" and \"\". \"The Independent\", Film4, Sky Movies, BBC, \"Total Film\"' magazine and \"Empire\" magazine have all praised the movie as being very good. Television channel Bravo put the movie in a program named \"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\" in 2007. The website UGO Networks thought that Tom Noonan's acting in \"Manhunter\" was the best he has done.\n\nToday, \"Manhunter\" is more popular. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'. This new popularity might be because of the other Hannibal movies doing very well. The websites Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes compare the modern reviews of the movie and give an average review. Metacritic used ten reviews to give \"Manhunter\" a score of 78 out of 100. Rotten Tomatoes used 33 reviews to give the movie a score of 94 out of 100.\n\n\"Manhunter\" shows how police use forensic science to catch criminals. This has inspired other movies and television programs. These include \"\", \"Millennium\", \"John Doe\", \"Profiler\", and \"The X-Files\"; as well as movies such as \"Copycat\", \"Switchback\", \"The Bone Collector\", \"Seven\" and \"Fallen\".\n\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" came out in 1991. It was based on a different book by Thomas Harris. It earned many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is one of only three movies that have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. After \"The Silence of the Lambs\", three more Hannibal movies came out. These were \"Hannibal\", \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal Rising\".\n\nThe 2002 movie \"Red Dragon\" was based on the same book as \"Manhunter\". It made much more money than \"Manhunter\" did. It earned $209,196,298 and it cost $78 million to film it. Rotten Tomatoes used 183 reviews to give \"Red Dragon\" a score of 68 out of 100. Metacritic used 36 reviews to give it a score of 60 out of 100. The same man, Dante Spinotti, did the filming for both movies.\n", "id": "300067", "title": "Manhunter (movie)"}

The spots appear to be white, and the name was based on Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide. Currently, a large band of white clouds called the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance (because of an increase in radio and plasma interference) has covered Saturn since 2010, and the Cassini orbiter is tracking the storm. Cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds, an increase of phosphine, and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm. In April 2011, the storm had a second eruption. Scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planet's clouds.\n\nThe spots happen every 28.5 Earth years. This is the solstice when Saturn's northern hemisphere tilts most toward the Sun. The following is a list of recorded sightings; years with spots that are part of the cycle are 1876, 1903, 1933, 1960, and 1990.\n\n\nWhy there were no spots recorded before 1876 is a mystery. It is like the break in sightings of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The 1876 Great White Spot was very large, and could be seen even with small telescopes. Was the earlier record simply poor, or was the 1876 GWS truly a first for the telescopic era? Some believe that neither scenario is likely.\n\nMark Kidger has described three important Great White Spot patterns:\n\nKidger predicts that the next Great White Spot will happen in the NTZ in 2016, and will probably be less spectacular than the 1990 Great White Spot.\n\nA \"classic\" Great White Spot is a spectacular event. Very bright white storms light up Saturn's usually dull atmosphere. All the major ones have happened in the planet's northern hemisphere. They usually begin as separate \"spots\", but then rapidly get bigger in longitude, as the 1933 and 1990 Great White Spots did. In 1990 the Great White Spot grew to circle the whole planet.. \n\n\n", "id": "300069", "title": "Great White Spot"}

The movie was released on October 21, 2010 and received negative reviews from reviewers.\n\nIn the movie, Boog (Matthew J. Munn) is about to go on a special guys' trip with the boys, but everyone is extremely busy living with their families. This disappoints Boog and it makes him go on a trip himself and encounters the Maslova Family Circus that came from Russia and meets a doppelganger named Doug (Matthew J. Munn), his annoying friend Alistair (Dana Snyder), and a circus performer named Ursa (Melissa Sturm), whom he falls in love with. When the animals at the forest find out the circus is going back to Russia, they make a whole new plan to rescue Boog and bring him back home.\n\nBoog (Matthew J. Munn) plans an annual guys' trip to spend time with his male friends. But Elliot (Matthew W. Taylor) has distanced himself from him since he had started a family with his wife Giselle (Melissa Sturm) and his three children: Gisela (Karley Scott Collins), Giselita (Ciara Bravo), and Elvis (Harrison Fahn). Boog is disappointed since everyone else wanted to spend time with their families, which makes the grizzly go on a trip of his own, which leads him to a Russian traveling circus called the Maslova Family Circus.\n\nWhile in the circus, Boog meets Doug (Matthew J. Munn), a lazy, scruffy grizzly bear who is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines (as well, Boog also meets Doug's friend, a Argentina llama named Alistair {Dana Snyder}). Doug craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of wildlife. Doug convinces Boog to switch his life in the forest for his place at the circus, which Boog accepts. But the whole thing turns out a scam since all Doug really wanted to do all this time was escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa (Melissa Sturm), a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle and dance. When the couple begin working together, they obtain much more as a harmonious duet than it might seem at first glance. When Boog's pals find out about Boog's disappearance, they, as well as the pets put aside their differences and hatch a rescue mission to save Boog.\n\nBoog's friends arrive at the circus. They want Boog to return home, but he doesn't want to leave Ursa. All of a sudden, Doug arrives and apologizes to Boog for tricking him. While Doug performs the circus acts for the audience, Elliot tells Boog that he can stay at the circus if he wants to.Elliot is at the circus with Dug, Alistair and of course Boog and four form a band for the circus.\nBoog and Elliot move his family to the circus.\n\n\nNon-speaking characters include the rabbits, Buddy's wife, the does, some circus performers, and Carmen.\n\n\"Open Season 3\" was animated at Reel FX Creative Studios, which also did animation for \"Open Season 2\".\n\n\"Open Season 3\" got negative reviews by reviewers and critics.

He is the 55th and current Mayor of Chicago.\n\nEmanuel was born on November 29, 1959 in Chicago, Illinois to a Jewish family. He studied at Sarah Lawrence College and at Northwestern University. \n\nHe was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing , from 2003 until his resignation in 2009 to become a member of the Obama Administration. He is the first Jewish mayor of Chicago.\n\nEmanuel was chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 mid-term elections and remained a top strategist for House Democrats during the 2008 cycle. After Democrats regained control of the House in 2006, Emanuel was elected chairman of the Democratic Caucus. This made him the fourth-ranking House Democrat, behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.\n\nTwo days after Obama's election victory, Emanuel was announced as Obama's designee for White House Chief of Staff. He resigned from the House on January 2, 2009, and began his duties as Chief of Staff on January 20, 2009, the day of Obama's inauguration. \n\nEmanuel resigned as Chief of Staff effective October 1, 2010, in order to run for Mayor of Chicago pending the announced retirement of six term incumbent Richard M. Daley. \n\nOn January 27, 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed a lower court's ruling that had cast doubt on Emanuel's candidacy; the court unanimously decided that Emanuel did not abandon his Chicago residency by serving in the White House, thus affirming his ability to run for mayor. He won the Mayoral election on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote. President Obama appointed William M. Daley, the brother of Emanuel's predecessor as mayor, as Chief of Staff to replace Emanuel.\n\nEmanuel created a transition team from varied backgrounds. On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor's first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it \"honest\". At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. At a press conference with Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, who previously vetoed legislation to put a casino in Chicago, the two were \"very close\" to reaching a deal.\n\nEmanuel won his second term during the run-off re-election campaign. He defeated Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. Emanuel won 56.76% of the votes. \n\nIn November and into December 2015, Emanuel has been criticized for his handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting, mainly for covering and allowing Chicago police to get away with excessive use of force on black minorities. \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist John Kass wrote that the Emanuel administration withheld from the public the police dashboard camera video of the Laquan McDonald shooting in order to secure the re-election. Since December 2015, over half of Chicagoans believe that Emanuel should resign with such support from the \"New York Times\", Al Sharpton, Black Lives Matter, U.S senator Bernie Sanders and Illinois governor Bruce Rauner.\n\nWhile a high school student working part-time at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.\n\nEmanuel married Amy Merritt Rule in 1994. They have three children.\n\n", "id": "300140", "title": "Rahm Emanuel"}

For example, two separate people who see a traffic accident, at the spot, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be \"independent\", since one would \"depend\" on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).\n\nConsulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.\n\nFamously, the \"New York Times' \" minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.\n\nCircular reporting is a situation where multiple sources \"appear\" to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source.

At the age of 12 he left school and travelled around. He played in the streets of New Orleans, Memphis, Helena, Arkansas and St. Louis and made his living. He learned more about playing harp from Sonny Boy Williamson II, Sunnyland Slim, Honeyboy Edwards and others.\n\n1945 he went to Chicago. There he made first recordings playing guitar for Floyd Jones. Frustrated about the fact that guitars were louder than his harmonica he started using a microphon and pluging it into the guitar amplifiers. So he could compet with any guitar sound. 1947 he did his first recordings for a small label in Chicago. 1948 he became member of Muddy Waters band and recorded with him for Chess records. First he played acoustic, the first appearance on record of Little Walter's amplified harmonica sound was on Muddy's \"Country Boy\"/\"Too Young To Know\" (Chess 1452), recorded on July 11, 1951. \n\nHis first hit record was \"Juke\", an instrumental, which was intended to be the signature song of Muddy Waters band. The song was published on Checkers, a sub label of Chess. It stayed 20 weeks in the charts, eight of them on #1. Till 1957 he played with Muddy Waters but in this year he was replaced by Junior Wells. Walter took his band \"The Aces\" and renamed them into \"The Jukes\". Walter had a lot of hits, f.e. \"My Babe\" written by Willie Dixon, but with the beginning of the 1960s his success faded away.\n\n1964 and 1967 he came with the American Folk Blues Festival to Europe.

Each person knows part of the secret that is shared, but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret. The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret. Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other, in 1979.\n\nOne example where secret sharing is used is the RSA cryptosystem. It uses a \"secret key\". If this key is distributed among many people, no single person can make a signature. Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost, a number of them can still make a signature. This is often used is areas where security is very important, such as banks, or the military.\n\nThe dealer hands each player their part of the secret. In an easier setup, the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret, but with each part there is extra information. Say that a secret needs five parts, and three parts are known. In this setup, guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known. The other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory, because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret. \n\nThere are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques.\n\nIn this method, any t out of the n shares may be used to recover the secret. The idea is that a polynomial of degree t-1 is defined by t points on the polynomial: It takes two points to define a straight line, three to define a quadratic curve, four for a cubic, and so on. It takes t points ot define a polynomial of degree t-1. That way it is possible to build a polynomial, the first coefficient is the secret; there are n randomly picked coefficients. Each player receives one of the n coefficients. If there are at least t players, they can rebuild the original curve, and get the secret.\n", "id": "300421", "title": "Secret sharing"}

In such a protocol, two parties are communicating. The task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret, but without revealing the secret.\n\nThere is a well-known story showing some of the ideas of zero-knowledge proofs. Usually, the two parties in a zero-knowledge proof are called Peggy (the prover of the statement) and Victor (the verifier of the statement).\n\nIn this story, Peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave. The cave is shaped like a circle, with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side. Victor says he'll pay her for the secret, but not until he's sure that she really knows it. Peggy says she'll tell him the secret, but not until she receives the money. They devise a scheme by which Peggy can prove that she knows the word without telling it to Victor.\n\nFirst, Victor waits outside the cave as Peggy goes in. They label the left and right paths from the entrance A and B. Peggy randomly takes either path A or B. Then, Victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return, either A or B, chosen at random. Providing she really does know the magic word, this is easy: she opens the door, if necessary, and returns along the desired path. Note that Victor does not know which path she has gone down.\n\nHowever, suppose she did not know the word. Then, she would only be able to return by the named path if Victor were to give the name of the same path that she had entered by. Since Victor would choose A or B at random, he would have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. If they were to repeat this trick many times, say 20 times in a row, her chance of successfully anticipating all of Victor's requests would become very small. \n\nFor this reason, if Peggy reliably appears at the exit Victor names, he can conclude that she is very likely to know the secret word.\n", "id": "300422", "title": "Zero-knowledge proof"}

It was made in 1964 by the company RCA. The CED is similar to a record because it stores the video and sound as small groves on a black disk. Because of this, the CED is an analog disc format instead of a digital format like a CD. The CED is stored inside a plastic case so you can not touch the disk as it is very easy to damage. On the plastic case is a label that has the name of the movie on the disc as well as other information such as a summary of the movie.\n\nThe first CED was made in 1964 but were not available for purchase until 1981. About 200 movies were made available on CED. Each movie that was on CED was about $15 to $35 depending on the length of the movie. The CED did not sell well, this is because you could not record on the disc like you could with a video tape. The production of the CED stopped in 1986.\n\nCEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are 30.0 cm (11.8 in) in diameter. To avoid using the metric system to name their discs, they were called \"12 inch discs\" even though they were actually slightly smaller. Each side of the disc has grooves that are about 19 miles long and are 37 times smaller than the grooves on a regular phonograpg record. When the disc is playing, it spins at about 450 times per minute and each rotation of the disc contained several frames of audio and visual information. \n\nTo read the disc, a titanium needle was placed very lightly on the outer edge of the disc. A small electric current was then passed through the center of the needle, where it would touch the bottem of the groove and read the audio information, which was stored in small holes. The needle would read these by detecting how much air was between the needle and the pit and then the electronics of the player would convert these into audio. The visual information was stored in the grooves and were read like a regular phonograph record. As the needle passed over the grooves, it would vibrate and the player would convert the vibrations into the pictures.\n", "id": "300445", "title": "Capacitance Electronic Disc"}

This video game was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This game is a platformer developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. The playable characters in this game are Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong.\n\nThis game was later made for the Game Boy Color in 2000, the Game Boy Advance in 2003 and the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006, later taken down from it on November 2012 in North America and Europe.\n\nThe story for \"Donkey Kong Country\" involves the Kremlings stealing Donkey Kong's bananas. The storyline goes as;\n\n\"\"IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NITE...\n\n\"Storms lashed the rugged terrain of Donkey Kong Island, home of the famous video game ape and his family and friends. Near Donkey Kong's tree house, a small monkey named Diddy cowered in fear of the savage lightning which periodically illuminated the lush, dark jungle that covered most of the island. Donkey Kong had assigned Diddy to guard duty on this awful night, and he was not happy about his fate.\"\n\n\"Donkey Kong's earlier pep talk kept creeping back into Diddy's mind. \"OK, little buddy,\" Donkey had said in his patronizing voice. \"As part of your hero training, you've got to stand guard tonight over my bananas... I'll relive you at midnight, so try and stay awake until then!\"\"\n\n\"Buddy? Yeah, right. Now he was alone. Alone unless you counted the unknown threats which lurked behind every tree that he glimpsed during the lightning flashes. The Kremlings were out there, this much was certain. They coveted Donkey Kong's banana stockpile, the largest on the island, and probably in the world. A treasure in potassium and Vitamin A. The perfect food. \"Ahhh... delicious bananas...\" The thought of DK's golden horde almost made Diddy forget his uncomfortable situation. But a rustling in the under-growth and the sound of several snapping twigs brought him out of his reverie.\"\n\n\"\"W-w-who goes there?!\" Diddy challenged the sounds in the darkened, dripping foliage. There was no answer but the flashing of claws and teeth, followed by a fleeting vision of many reptilian eyes and a crack of thunder. Diddy somersaulted into the fray with his signature cartwheel attack, but he was quickly overcome by the weight of many scaly assailants. The enormous bulk of Klump the Kremling landed on top of Diddy, knocking him senseless. His last memory was of a hissing voice...\"It'ssss the sssmall one... Ssseal him inssside thisss barrel and tosss it into the bussshesss... Donkey Kong'sss bananasss are ourssss!\" The barrel lid closed on Diddy, blotting out even the fleeting light of the storm. Seconds later, the barrel flew through the air, courtesy of Klump's army boot-assisted punt, and landed roughly in the jungle foliage. Diddy Kong knew no more.\"\n\n\"The entire Donkey Kong clan was oblivious as the Kremlings then loaded the banana horde into their Kremling karts and wheeled them off through the jungle, leaving an obvious trail of dropped fruit from their overloaded conveyances.\"\n\n\"The next morning, Donkey Kong was awakened by frantic shouting of his name. \"Keep it down!!\" he growled. He suddenly realized what time it was. \"Morning already... I slept through my watch!\" Falling out of bed and through his tree house door, Donkey Kong slid down the tree house ladder without using any of the rungs, and assumed his characteristic fighting pose, with sun-blinded, squinting eyes! One swift blow was all that was needed to leave him sprawled on the floor, face down! he groggily rolled over to see the familiar wrinkled, white-bearded, grouchy face of his old granddad \"Cranky Kong\" peering down at him. In his heyday, Cranky was the original Donkey Kong who battled Mario in several of his own games.\"\n\n\"\"What 'cha do that for?!\" Donkey Kong asked, knowing full well that Cranky was prone to cuffing him at every whim.\"\n\n\"\"Take a look inside your banana cave. You're in for a big surprise!\" Cranky crackled.\"\n\n\"Donkey's mind raced as he vaulted to the cave and peered inside. Instead of the dull golden glow of thousands of bananas, there were only a few discarded peels. These had been trampled into the dirt by hundreds of reptilian feet, judging from the many three-toed footprints that covered the damp cavern floor. But what about...\"\n\n\"\"Diddy's gone, too!\" Cranky laughed. \"That's what you get for shirking your responsibility, you good-for-nothing bum! In my days we would have been happy to stand guard in the rain, 'cause that might have meant having an extra frame of animation! Of course, having rain would have been impossible, given our pitiful processing power, but...\"\"\n\n\"Donkey Kong stood there in stunned disbelief and hadn't heard most of what Cranky said. \"Diddy... gone... My little buddy...\" he murmured to himself.\"\n\n\"Donkey Kong was suddenly filled with conviction. \"The Kremlings will pay!\" he raged. \"I'll hunt them down through every corner of my island, until I have every last banana from my horde back!!\"\"\n\n\"\"Find your little buddy and retrieve a bunch of bananas?!\" Cranky snorted. \"What kind of game idea is that?! Where's the screaming damsel in distress?!\"\"\n\n\"\"Diddy's obsession with being like me has gone too far! He may be a long way from being a true video game hero, but he had the guts, the reflexes, the heart...\"\"\n\n\"\"If you ask me, neither of you are ready for prime time,\" Cranky interrupted. \"You'll never be as popular a character as I was! Why, in my heyday, kids lined up to play my games! The quarters were stacked on the machine as they waited for their turn! If you go on this ridiculous adventure, you'll be lucky to sell ten copies!\"\"\n\n\"Donkey Kong fumed. He usually let Cranky's rambling roll off his back, but this time was different. \"What do you know about adventure, you flea-bitten old ape?\" yelled Donkey Kong, edging closer and closer, braving Cranky's cane, until he was totally in his face. \"I'm sick of hearing about your boring, single screen adventures! Diddy's in trouble, my banana horde is gone, and I'm going to get them all back!\"\"\n\n\"Donkey Kong stormed off in search of his missing buddy, following the trail of bananas the Kremlings had dropped.\"\n\n\"\"Well, it's not exactly rescuing a Princess, but it'll do in a pinch,\" Cranky snorted as DK disappeared into the lush jungle. After a moment's hesitation, Cranky followed him. \"The lad may just need my help...\" he mumbled to himself. \"Kids today... they just don't have any respect for their elders...\"\"\n\nThere are six worlds and a final boss battle on Gangplank Galleon sometimes referred to as a world.

It had a population of 744,900 in 2010, 646,175 in 2002 and 620,516 in 1989.\n\nThe city was founded on January 12, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (). The original name meant \"Catherine's Gift\" simultaneously in recognition of Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (later the Kuban Cossacks) and in recognition of Saint Catherine, \"the Martyr\", who is considered to be the patron of the city. After the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (December 1920). There are two potential meanings for the new name of the city: Krasno- (Красно-), meaning either 'beautiful' (an older root) or 'red' (especially relevant considering the political atmosphere of the time); and -dar (-дар), meaning 'gift'. Thus, the city's name means either \"beautiful gift\" or \"red gift\" (i.e. 'gift of the reds')..\n\nThe origin of the city starts with a fortress built by the Cossacks in order to defend imperial borders and claim Russian ownership over Circassia, which was contested by Ottoman Turkey. In the first half of the 19th century Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks. It was granted town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city and it became a vital trade center of southern Russia. In 1897, an obelisk commemorating 200 year old history of Kuban Cossack Host was built in Yekaterinodar.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War the city changed hands several times between the Red Army and Volunteer Army, many Kuban Cossacks were committed anti-Bolsheviks who supported the White Movement.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Krasnodar was occupied by the German Army between August 12, 1942 and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and participation in war crimes. The first such trial was held at Krasnodar on July 14–17, 1943. This was the first public trial of the mass murder of Jews during the Holocaust. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily conducted in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.\n\nFamous Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, soprano Evgenia Kononova, cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, counterrevolutionary Andrei Shkuro and rhythmic gymnast Inna Zhukova were born in Krasnodar. Another notable native of Krasnodar is Greece basketball international Lazaros Papadopoulos, who emigrated to Greece with his Pontic Greek parents when he was 10 years old.\n\nKrasnodar is home to the steel lattice hyperboloid tower built by the Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov in 1928; it is near Krasnodar Circus.\n\nOther attractions include St. Catherine's Cathedral, the State Arts Museum, a park and theatre named after Maxim Gorky, the beautiful concert hall of the Krasnodar Philharmonic Society, which is considered to have some of the best acoustics in southern Russia, State Cossack Choir and the Krasnodar circus\n\nThe most interesting place of Krasnodar is Krasnaya Street (which translates as \"Red, Beautiful Street\"). There are many sights there. In the beginning of this street one can see the Central Concert Hall; at the other end one can see the Avrora cinemacenter. A \"Triumphal Arch\" is in the middle of Krasnaya Street.\n\nThe main airline is Kuban Airlines (at Krasnodar International Airport), and the largest hotels in the city include the Intourist, Hotel Moskva, and Hotel Platan. Krasnodar uses a 220 V/50 Hz power supply with two round-pin outlets, like most European countries.\n\nPublic transportation within Krasnodar consists of city buses, trolleybuses, trams, and marshrutkas. Trolleybuses and trams, both powered by overhead electric wires, are the main form of transportation in Krasnodar. Unlike Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Krasnodar does not have a metro system.\n\nThe coat of arms of Yekaterinodar was introduced in 1841 by the Cossack yesaul Ivan Chernik. The royal letter \"E\" in the middle is for Ekaterina II (Russian for Catherine II). It also depicts the date city was founded, the Imperial double headed eagle (symbolizing Tsar's patronage of Black Sea Cossacks), a bulawa of a Cossack ataman, Yekaterinodar fortress, and flags with letters \"E\", \"P\", \"A\", and \"N\" standing for Catherine II, Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I.

A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits, such as 2P/Encke and 27P/Crommelin.

That marriage, which ended in divorce in 1992, produced a daughter (Sarah) and a son (Michael, who is now a production assistant with MTV).\n\nBrisbane rock band Regurgitator wrote a tribute song to him called \"I Love Tommy Mottola\" for their 1999 album \"...Art\".\n\nIn 1987, Mottola was chosen to run CBS Records at the age of 37.\n\nSoon afterward, Sony Corporation closed on its deal to buy the CBS Records group unit from CBS, naming him President and CEO of the music division, where he succeeded his former mentor Walter Yetnikoff, who had originally brought Mottola into CBS. Mottola served as Chairman and CEO Sony Music Entertainment.\n\nDuring his tenure, he transformed Sony into one of the most successful global music companies, expanding its businesses into over 60 countries, while creating one of the strongest management teams in the industry. He revitalized Sony Music's publishing division by making such acquisitions as the Beatles catalogue and enabled Sony to become the first major music company to make available commercial digital downloads. He is widely well known for signing, developing, and nurturing the careers of Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, the Dixie Chicks, Marc Anthony, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, among others. He also worked with Michael Jackson from the time he began recording his \"Dangerous\" (1991) album. Jackson would later state that his relationship with Mottola dissolved based on corruption in his working practices, publicly referring to him as a \"racist\" and \"devil\". \"The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists.\" Jackson said.(source: Vh1)\n\nIn 1988, Brenda K. Starr, a Columbia artist, handed Mottola a demo tape from one of her backup singers. Initially he tossed it aside, but later decided to listen to it. He was impressed by the demo and tracked down the singer, a then-unknown Mariah Carey, and eventually signed her. Mottola is seen as the main architect for Mariah's success in the early years of her career.\n\nIn June 1993, Mottola and Carey married in a lavish ceremony, but the marriage was short-lived with the couple separating shortly before Christmas 1996 and divorcing in early 1998. In 2000, Carey, at the time Columbia's biggest selling artist, signed an $80 million contract with Virgin Records, but after the commercial and critical failure of her first album for the label, \"the Glitter soundtrack\", Virgin dropped her from the company and it rescinded the $80 million contract. Carey later signed with Island Records.\n\nMottola later went on to date other stars before dating Mexican singer Thalía, whom he married December 2, 2000. They have a daughter together, Sabrina Sakaë (Oct 7, 2007). Their second child, a son, Matteo Alejandro was born on June 25th 2011 . He also is credited with creating the Latin Explosion in popular music by championing such Sony artists as Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Estefan. Additionally, Mottola was the architect for some of Sony's biggest global brands such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. During his 15-year tenure, Mottola built Sony up from a company with revenues of 800 million dollars a year to one with over 6 billion dollars of annual revenue by the year 2000.\nIn June 2010, he decided to sell his Ranch in Colorado, for an amount of 27.5 million dollars, as he was not spending time in it anymore and wanted to be closer to his family\n\nTommy Mottola was the head of Sony Music Entertainment until January 2003. Since leaving his post as chief of Sony Music, Mottola has been building a new entertainment company, complete with recorded music, television production, theater, and fashion, alongside a branding and management company launching. He was instrumental in re-launching the various careers of such artists as Grammy winner and Latin pop star Marc Anthony, and teen sensation Lindsay Lohan. Later signings included Cassie Ventura in 2006 and Mika, who in 2007 had a #1 single in the UK.\n\nA collaboration with former Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein has them teamed on two current projects for live theater, namely producers of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". Mottola's TV production arm is currently producing and developing many shows for cable and network television.\n\nMottola bought out the rights to Casablanca Records (a then-diminished imprint of Polygram), and resurrected it, signing actress Lindsay Lohan, and singer Mika.\n\nKnown also for his many philanthropic activities, Mottola has served on the Board of Directors of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Police Athletic League of New York City, T.J. Martell Foundation for Cancer, Leukemia and AIDS Research, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and Museum, and the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation.\n\nThe character of Gene Balboa in the Channel 101 Internet TV Series Yacht Rock is loosely based on Mottola, in particular his time as manager of Hall and Oates.\n\nThe Australian band Regurgitator include the song \"i love tommy mottola\" on their 1999 album \"...art\".\n\n", "id": "300498", "title": "Tommy Mottola"}

The tapestry is annotated in Latin. It is exhibited in a special museum in Bayeux, Normandy called \"Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux\".\n\nThe tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England. The two combatants are the Anglo-Saxon English, led by Harold Godwinson, recently crowned as King of England, and the Normans, led by William the Conqueror.\n\nThe tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo-Saxon art, because, though ordered by a Norman, it was made by English (Anglo-Saxon) artisans. It is also extremely important as a historical document.\n\nIn common with other embroidered hangings of the early medieval period, this piece is conventionally referred to as a \"tapestry\", although it is not a true tapestry in which the design is woven into the cloth; it is in fact an embroidery.\n\nThe Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using two methods of stitching: outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures. The linen is assembled in panels and has been patched in numerous places.\n\nThe main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green.\n", "id": "300509", "title": "Bayeux Tapestry"}

The annals were initially created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across England and were independently updated. In one case, the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.\n\nNine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. \n\nAlmost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC, and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\n\nThe Chronicle is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. \n\nTaken as a whole the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language; in particular, the later Peterborough Chronicle is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence.\n\nSeven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments are now in the British Library.

Gawler's father was a captain in the 73rd Regiment of Foot, and he was killed in Mysore, India in December 1804. The Gawler family came from Devon. George Gawler was educated by a private teacher, then at a school in Cold Bath, Islington. He spent two years at the military college in Great Marlow.\n\nIn October 1810 Gawler joined 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign and in January 1812 he went to the Peninsular War. At Badajoz, Gawler was wounded during a charge, but he was saved from death by a soldier who lost his own life. He was in Spain until 1814, taking part in the advance on Madrid. The regiment returned to England and Gawler fought at the Battle of Waterloo as a lieutenant. He remained in France with the army of occupation until 1818, and in 1820 married Maria Cox of Derby who was the niece of Samuel Richardson. Gawler's new sister-in-law Mary Ann married William Leeke, a fellow officer from the 52nd. Gawler and his wife were sincerely religious. When the 52nd was sent to New Brunswick in 1823 they did much social and religious work. Gawler returned to England in 1826, and from 1830 to 1832 he was engaged in recruiting. He reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1834, and in 1837 received the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KH), third class.\n\nIn 1838 Gawler was appointed governor of South Australia. His predecessor was Captain John Hindmarsh. Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838. They had made a four month journey via Tenerife and Rio de Janeiro. Gawler found that the colony lacked public finances, and poor officials and 4000 immigrants were living in mean houses. He was allowed a maximum of £12,000 expenditure a year, with an additional £5,000 credit for emergencies. His first goal was to accelerate rural settlement and primary production. He persuaded Charles Sturt to come from New South Wales for surveying, because Colonel William Light who had performed the role resigned due to bad health. Gawler appointed more colonial officials, set up a police force, took part in exploration, and improved the facilities at Port Adelaide during his administration. The first permanent Government House was built and this is now the East Wing of the present building.\n\nIn 1840, droughts in other Australian colonies increased the cost of living rapidly because South Australia had not been self-sufficient for food yet. Gawler increased public expenditure but eventually the economy broke and the management policy of the colony was forced to change. Over £200,000 had been spent and the land fund in London had been exhausted. A £155,000 loan was approved by the British Parliament (later made a gift) and Captain George Grey was sent to replace Gawler.\n\nGovernor Gawler had managed to make South Australia self-sufficient in terms of agriculture and had restored public confidence. Gawler was a resolute and energetic officer. When he found the settlers faced with disaster, he judged at once what it was necessary to do, and saved the colony. However, Gawler's work was long misjudged, largely because his successor Grey unfairly criticised Gawler. Richard Charles Mills wrote in his \"Colonization of Australia\" that Gawler had been guilty of carelessness and wastefulness, and deserves blame. But at the same time Mills admitted that Gawler was facing extraordinary difficulties. \nCharles Sturt and other men at the time generally agreed that his administration had greatly benefited the settlement, and the select committee on South Australia reported that the critics of his expenditure were \"unable to point out any specific item by which it could have been considerably reduced without great public inconvenience\". Later investigations show that Gawler was surely one of founders of South Australia.\n\nIn 1845, Gawler wrote a book in which he suggested that Jews be allowed to establish Jewish agricultural settlements in the Land of Israel as compensation for their suffering in Europe and under Turkish rule. In 1849 he toured Israel with Moses Montefiore. In 1852, he established an association for the colonization of Palestine. Gawler died in Southsea and was buried in Portsmouth.\n\nThe town of Gawler was named after him, as it was surveyed soon after he arrived. The Gawler Ranges at the north end of Eyre Peninsula are also named after him. Derby's Town and County Museum in the 1830's included Gawler in its list of principal benefactors. Gawler had contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor.\n\n\n", "id": "300527", "title": "George Gawler"}

After the St. Nazaire Raid, on April 13, 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended. Fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas.\n\nOrganisation Todt, which had designed the Siegfried Line (\"Westwall\") along the Franco-German border, was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the wall's major fortifications. Thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch, Belgian and French coasts facing the English Channel.\n\nEarly in 1944, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was assigned to improve the Wall's defences. Rommel believed the existing coastal fortifications were entirely inadequate and he immediately began strengthening them. He knew that the beaches between were barely defended, and the Allies could land there and capture the ports from the land. Under his direction, a string of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built along the beaches, or sometimes slightly inland, to house machine guns, anti-tank guns, and light artillery. Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves, and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore. The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload.\n\nBy the time of the invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland, along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for military gliders and paratroopers, the Germans emplaced slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called \"Rommelspargel\" (\"Rommel's asparagus\"). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were permanently flooded, as well.\n\nRommel firmly believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped at the beach.\n\nAlthough the defensive wall was never completed the Wall's existence has served to explain away concerns of the Soviet Union for why the Second Front was not opened until June 6, 1944 (less than a year before the end of the war). The Wall primarily consisted of batteries, bunkers, and minefields, which during 1942–1944, stretched from the French-Spanish border to Norway (Festung Norwegen). Many bunkers still exist, for example near Scheveningen, Den Haag, Katwijk and in Normandy. In Oostende, Belgium the public may visit a well-preserved part of the defences. That section consists of emplacements of the \"Saltzwedel neu battery\" and the \"Stützpunkt Bensberg\", consisting of several men’s quarters and the necessary facilities. These constructions were used by a unit of German military engineers (\"Pionierstab\") who were in charge of bunker construction.\n\nThe Channel Islands were heavily fortified, particularly the island of Alderney which is closest to France. Hitler had decreed that 10% of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands, because of the propaganda value of controlling British territory. Despite the mooting of Operation Constellation \"et al.\", the Allies bypassed the islands and did not try to liberate them when they invaded Normandy. The islands' German garrisons did not surrender until 9 May 1945 – one day after the German armed forces on the mainland. The German garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May.\n\nWalcheren Island was considered to be the \"strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed.\"\n\nThe Atlantic Wall was not a single organisation except in the administration of its building. Militarily it was divided into eight commands:\n\nMany major ports and positions were made part of the Atlantic wall and received heavy fortifications, Hitler ordered them all to fight to the end and some of them remained in German hands until the unconditional surrender of Axis Forces on May 8, 1945. Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarine after being surrounded by Allied forces. The defenders of these positions included Slavic soldiers and SS troops. \n\nGerman Publication (PhD) in military history\n\n\n", "id": "300745", "title": "Atlantic Wall"}

The A43 now bypasses to the south-east of the village, between the village and the race circuit.\n\nThe village is listed in the Domesday Book.\n\nIn the Middle Ages the village trade was primarily in timber from the surrounding Whittlewood forest, through the use of coppicing. Coppicing is a method of managing a forest. It allows trees to regrow after they have been cut down. \n\nThe first chapel in Silverstone was built by 1200 AD. In about 1780 the mediaeval building was replaced by a Georgian building. That building was enlarged in 1841 and 1852. The entire church was demolished (torn down) in the 1880's and replaced by the present Church of England parish church of Saint Michael. The building is a Gothic Revival designed by JP St Aubyn. It was finished in 1884.\n\nThe village has a public house, the White Horse Inn.\n\nAbout south of the village is the Silverstone Circuit. It was a Royal Air Force bomber base during World War II.

He has played on every album since its debut in 1980. However, Murray joined in 1976, just two months after they formed in 1975. He was forced to leave the band that year by the vocalist Dennis Wilcock, but returned months later. His solos are characterized for being fluid and clean, making rapid progress note after note through techniques that use the right hand using especially a lot of \"Hammer and tapping\", based on the legato technique. A characteristic in live performance is the vocalization which makes while playing fast parts, as if singing at the same time than playing his Fender Stratocaster.\n\nDavid Michael Murray was born on December 23, 1956 in Edmunton, England. Dave's mother often worked part-time at a bar, because his father was at a young age retired consequence of a disease. The money for the maintenance of the house came irregularly. The frustration and poverty took their parents to a continuous fighting which caused her mother to take him together with her sisters to the nearest army refuge, where they used to spend weeks protected from the occasional attacks of fury of his father.\n\nDuring his adolescence, Dave was interested in music, so he developed an cardboard-electric guitar to mimic the Beatles records, also that he risked playing with the piano of a bar that was in the bottom of a residential complex in which they lived for some time. In 1970 his family finally rented a more comfortable house in the county of Clapton, and that's how the future partner of Steve Harris, like many other teens in that time shaved his head.\n\nThe moment that completely changed the life of Dave and took him to a career which seemed impossible in his time and those who followed the style of skinhead, occurred at the age of 15 when heard for the first time the song \"Voodoo Child\" (part 2) of Jimi Hendrix on the radio, then it started to listen to bands like Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, , Queen, Free, Judas Priest and .\n\nDave's love for rock understood everything he was referring to the \"rock culture\" so he grew his hair too much, which caused him problems with his skinhead friends. He Adopted hippie clothes and began to read the newspaper \"Melody Maker\" which spoke of the rock of that time, which also began to frequent shows and come out with a new group of friends, being the closest, Adrian Smith.\n\nIn terms of sound, he used a super distortion humbucker made ​​by Dimarzio, who was replaced for a compact hot rails humbucker of the firm Seymour Duncan, both in bridge position.\n\nTogether with Steve Harris, Dave was the only \"irremovable member\" of Iron Maiden since its founding. He has participated in all records and has been a key piece to define the sound of the group, although it has not participated much in the compositions of letters he composed the rhythm guitar to most of the compositions of Steve Harris.\n\nBetween their compositions are the songs \"Charlotte the Harlot\" from the first album, \"Still Life\" from the album \"Piece of Mind.\" \"Deja Vu\" from the album \"Somewhere in Time,\" \"Chains of Misery\" and \"Judas Be My Guide\" from the album \"Fear of the Dark,\" \"Brave New World\", \"The Nomad\" and \"The Thin Line between Love and Hate\" from the album \"Brave New World\", \"Rainmaker\" and \"Age of Innocence\" from the album \"Dance of Death\" and \"the Reincarnation of Benjamin Breege\" from the album \"A Matter of Life and Death\".\n\nIn his spare time Murray is an avid golfer as seen at Rock in Rio DVD.

M13 was chosen because it was the right size, and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony. \n\nDr. Frank Drake, then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation, wrote the message, with help from Carl Sagan, among others.

The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives.

I hope to continue doing that,\"\n\nIn an interview with both Ken Lim and Ratonel, Lim said that he \"didn't think that [Sylvia] did well\" when asked about his opinions about the results.

Tolkien and appears in their novels \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nIt is a region in the northwest of Middle-earth, one of the continents of the fictional world of Arda where elapses the most part of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. It is, in turn, within the great region of Eriador, where previously existed the kingdom of Arnor. Is inhabited only by hobbits, a race similar to the men and characterized by their short stature. Founded in the middle of the Third Age, their known history is small and with little significants events because the peaceful nature of its inhabitants, with the exception of the events that took place during the War of the Ring.\n\nEven if is not mentioned as such in the novel The Hobbit, J. R. R. Tolkien already was then an idea of what was the Shire, was created \"officially\" during the composition of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings and inspired principally in the neighborhood of Sarehole, Birmingham, where the author lived during his childhood.\n\nHobbits sometimes call it Sûza (which means \"Shire\") or Sûzat (\"the Shire\"), terms that have their origin in the Rohirric, the language of Rohan with which they came in contact before colonizing the Shire. On the other hand, in the Elvish language Sindarin they call it \"i Drann\". It is also called \"\"Four frames\"\", the name refers to their territorial division.\n\nAccording to Tolkien, the Shire measured 40 leagues (193 km, 120 miles) from the Far Downs in the west to the Brandywine Bridge in the east, and 50 leagues (241 km, 150 miles) from the northern moors to the marshes in the south, This is confirmed in an essay by Tolkien on translating The Lord of the Rings, where he describes the Shire as having an area of 18,000 square miles (47,000 km²).\n\nThe original territory of the Shire was bounded on the east by the Baranduin River, on the north by uplands rising to the old centre of Arnor, on the west by the White Downs, and on the south by marshland south of the River Shirebourne. After the original settlement, hobbits also expanded to the east into Buckland between the Baranduin and the Old Forest, and (much later) to the west into the Westmarch between the White Downs and the Tower Hills.\n\nThe Shire was originally divided into four Farthings. The outlying lands of Buckland and the Westmarch were formally added after the War of the Ring when they were officially granted by King Elessar. Within the Farthings there are some smaller unofficial clan homelands: the Tooks nearly all live in or near Tuckborough in Tookland, for instance. A Hobbit surname often indicates where the family came from: Samwise Gamgee's last name derives from Gamwich, where the family originated. Buckland was named for the Oldbucks (later called the Brandybucks).\n\nThe Shire was densely populated, with many towns and few cities, but still had large areas of forests and wetlands. It is described as a \"small land\", but beautiful and fruitful, beloved by its inhabitants. Their location gives it a natural fertility and therefore the hobbits have an extensive farming system, being able to find many supplies such as cereals, fruits, wood and pipe-weed (one of the favorite pleasures of the hobbits). However, its economy is almost self-sufficient and hobbits typically consume all the products of their crops, or reserve them for gifts.\n\nThe Shire is a region of low elevations, and these are no higher than hills. The main ones are:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe climate in the Shire was primarily temperate maritime or ocean, depending on the area. In general, temperatures are slightly warmer in the south than in the north and seasonal changes of temperature are lightly more pronounced (hotter summers and colder winters) in the extreme east than the extreme west. The rainfalls are moderate throughout the whole year and especially in the Northframe, Can snow during the occasional visits of polar air from the north.\n\nThe Shire is populated exclusively by hobbits and in the time of the War of the Ring, the whole race, except a few who lived in the nearby town of Bree, was there. The hobbits are characterized by short stature, between 60 and 120 centimeters, and the abundant hairs grow them on the tops of the feet.\n\nAlthough there were various branches of hobbits, all ended by unite when the Albos founded the Shire mixing thus their physical characteristics. The residents of marshes, descended of the Forts,are the only ones that can differ slightly from the rest hobbits because to them grow fuzz on his chin, while the rest have absolutely no beard. In Marish had also lived the \"family Gamoviejo\" before moving to \"Buckland\" and change his last name to Brandybuck.\n\nBetween the known families are the \"Took\",\"Handbag\",\"Bolger\",\"Gamgee\",\"Brandybuck\",\"Sackville\",\"Cornet\",\"Boffin\",\"Proudfoot\",\"Burrow\",\"Dachshund\", and \"Round\". Each family usually have a land or town in which usually sits and takes his name or any derivative, for example Gamgyi come from \"Town of Gamwich\" and \"Took\" live mostly on the \"Took Land\" in Green Hills.\n", "id": "300921", "title": "Shire (Middle-earth)"}

Suzette was put on the drums. A.B. was put on the bass guitar. The family first showcased their band at their restaurant \"Papa Gayos\" (English: \"Parrots\"). Then they continued to sing at more and more different places.\n\nWithin a year the family's restaurant went bankrupt and the family was forced to move in with relatives as Abraham had quit his job to manage the restaurant full-time. The band then performed wherever they could, including weddings, street corners, fairs, and quinceañeras, at some places gaining a lot of appreciation, while others not so much. The band was even \"booed\" off while performing at a wedding, followed by food being thrown on stage.\n\nIn 1988, the Quintanilla family was present at a party of the band Chris Pérez was currently in. Impressed by his talent, A.B. asked Chris to join \"Selena y Los Dinos\". Although he accepted, his support to the band proved to be much more than anticipated. Selena and Chris quickly fell in love and married in 1992. After Selena's death, Chris formed a band called the Chris Pérez Band which he dedicated a song to the Selena called \"The Best I Can\". After the band broke up in 2002, he formed another band with Selena's brother A.B. called Kumbia All Starz.\n\nThe band members reunited for the tribute concert, in honor of Selena, on April 7, 2005. Selena ¡VIVE!, was held at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. Not only did the event sold-out, it became the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language Television special ever in the history of American television. The introduction was made by Jennifer Lopez.\n\n\nSelena y Los Dinos made seven independent LP records. They also made eighteen compilation albums that were released and one remix album. In 1984, Selena y Los Dinos signed with Freddie Records and released their debut album entitled \"Mis Primeras Grabaciones\", the album ended up with disappointing sales and Freddie Records wanted to put Selena y Los Dinos second album on hold until the band became more seasoned, the band ended up leaving Freddie Records after contract disagreements.\n\nIn 1985, Selena y Los Dinos was signed with Cara Records. Selena's father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla Jr felt that the band would do much better with a Tejano record label. Selena y Los Dinos recorded a few singles for Cara Records but a full album was never produced. Selena was moved to GP Productions which was owned by Manny Guerra. Guerra was a Tejano singer-songwriter and music producer. Selena y Los Dinos recorded \"Alpha\" and released it in 1986. \"Alpha\" became the first LP record to be successfully released in stores without any issues involved.\n\nThe band then released their third LP record \"Muñequito de Trapo\" (\"Rag Doll\") on June 29, 1987. They also released their fourth LP record \"And the Winner Is...\" later that same year. Selena began recording the LP record right after she had won the \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" award at the Tejano Music Awards that same year. In early 1987, the band were moved to Record Producer (RP Records). This record company was also owned by Guerra. They had released \"Preciosa\" (\"Precious\") in February 1988, and sold only 20,000 units.\n\nThey then released their last LP record \"Dulce Amor\" (\"Sweet Love\") in December 1988. The album sold 24,000 units. In early 1989, Selena signed a record deal with EMI Latin. She became the first artist to sign with them. In March 1990, Selena y Los Dinos released their first compilation album called \"Mis Primeros Éxitos\" (\"My First Hits\"). The album had re-recorded songs that were released before Selena had signed with EMI Latin. In 1990, the band released \"Personal Best\". In 1992, the band released their third compilation album called \"Baila Esta Cumbia\" (\"Dance This Cumbia\"). The next year, they released \"Quiero...\". After Selena was killed in 1995, the band released \"Grandes Exitos\" (\"Greatest Hits\"). In the early 2000s, Selena's father had released an \"early years\" collection called \"Selena y Sus Inicios\" (\"Selena and Her Beginnings\"), a few years later, he had released another set of early recordings from Selena called \"Classic Series\"; which were re-issues of Selena's LP records from 1986-1989.\n\n\n 1995 re-release (\"Mis Primeras Grabaciones\").<br>\n\n\n\n", "id": "300943", "title": "Selena y Los Dinos"}

Gravity holds clusters together and gives them their spherical shape. Towards the centre of a clusters there are many stars in a relatively small space. \n\nGlobular clusters occur in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk. Those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense open clusters in the disk. Globular clusters are fairly common: there are about 150 to 158 known globular clusters in the Milky Way. Large galaxies can have more: Andromeda may have as many as 500. \n\nSome giant elliptical galaxies, particularly those at the centres of galaxy clusters, such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular clusters. These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to huge distances, 40 kiloparsecs (approximately 131,000 light-years) or more.\n\nEvery galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has its group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has a system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.\n\nThe first globular cluster discovered was M22 in 1665, but individual stars in a globular cluster were not seen until Charles Messier observed M4. The first eight globular clusters discovered are shown in the table. The \"M\" before a number refers to the catalogue of Charles Messier, while \"NGC\" is from the New General Catalogue.\n\nWilliam Herschel began a survey program in 1782 using larger telescopes and was able to resolve the stars in all 33 of the known globular clusters. In addition he found 37 additional clusters. In Herschel's 1789 catalog of deep sky objects, his second such, he became the first to use the name \"globular cluster\" as their description.\n\nThe number of globular clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters have now been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20.

The album was released on July 16, 1984 under Freddie Records, an independent studio label in South Texas. Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, removed his children from Freddie Records after he had told him that Selena would never become a famous singer, could not bring in large crowds, and wasn't professionally ready to release a full-length album. Selena was also underpaid because she was a female in a male-dominate genre and no could understand a female singer lead a Tejano band. She was made fun of and even booed off-stage by Tejano fans. Undetermined, Abraham moved his children to Cara Records. The album was re-released in 1995, after Selena's murder, entitled \"Mis Primeras Grabcaciones\" (English: \"My First Recordings\")\n\n", "id": "301017", "title": "Selena y Los Dinos (album)"}

Some of them were covers of songs performed by other artists before Selena. The rest were written by Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.\n\nWhen Selena and her band did not receive much support from Freddie Martinez, the founder of Freddie Records, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, the father of Selena, began searching for another record label for the band. In the summer of 1984, \"Cara Records\" contacted him who had heard Selena during a recent concert and so they can sign \"Selena y Los Dinos\". Selena began to record tracks for her new album \"The New Girl In Town\" in late 1984. Cara Records released the album in 1985, but had to withdraw it after only two months due to conflicts with various song rights. Quintanilla then moved the band to the Manny Guerra labels GP Productions and RP Productions/Record Producer from 1985–1989, and finally to EMI in 1989. The song \"Oh Mama\" on Cara Records became very popular leading to appearances by Selena y Los Dinos on television shows like the \"Johnny Canales Show\".\n\n\n", "id": "301019", "title": "The New Girl in Town"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301022", "text": "Dreaming of You (album)\n\nDreaming of You is the last studio album recorded by American singer Selena. It was released on July 18, 1995 by EMI Records and EMI Latin. It was re-released on September 24, 2002 as part of the \"Selena: 20 Years of Music\" collection, which included bonus tracks, music videos and spoken liner notes by her family, friends, and her former band. \"Dreaming of You\" contains unreleased English and Spanish-language songs while also containing previously released songs that were remixed with dance hall and reggae. The first half of \"Dreaming of You\" contains mid-tempo R&B ballads and pop songs, while the rest of \"Dreaming of You\" contains Latin music.\n\nBy 1993, EMI Latin believed Selena was ready to release a crossover album. They believed she was ready because she had won a Grammy Award and other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States (the Tejano Music Movement, which was a movement in Texas at the time, helped other people enjoy Tejano music and it becoming a popular trend). They also believed Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market and they wanted to launch her into a career as an American solo pop artist. She was partnered with major pop music producers, some of whom were Grammy Award winners. The record company wanted to change Selena's musical styles from Tejano to contemporary R&B music. While Selena was recording songs, a crossover tour was being planned. On March 31, 1995, before \"Dreaming of You\" was scheduled to be released, Selena was killed by Yolanda Saldivar, who was a friend and manager of her clothing stores.\n\n\"Dreaming of You\" debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart, and sold more than 331,000 copies in its first week. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to have an album, mostly in Spanish, to debut at number one. It went on to become the second-highest-selling debut album, behind Michael Jackson. On the date of release, \"Dreaming of You\" sold 175,000 copies, which helped Selena to become the second-fastest selling female artist, behind Janet Jackson. \"Dreaming of You\" had mixed to positive reviews from music critics, who many believed if Selena was alive to further promote the album, that it would have performed better on music charts globally. \"Dreaming of You\" won several awards including every award it was nominated at the 1996-98 Tejano Music Awards and the 1996-97 Premio Lo Nuestro awards.\n\nSeveral tracks from the album were released as singles in the United States and other countries. The title track, became instantly popular on radios throughout the United States. It peaked at number 22 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and was able to reach the top 20 in many other charts. \"I Could Fall in Love\" also had the same success of the title track and peaked at number two on the Hot Latin Tracks and number eight on the Hot 100 Airplay chart. \"I'm Getting Used to You\" peaked at number eight on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. The single \"Tú Sólo Tú\" peaked at number one on both the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts. Songs such as \"Captive Heart\", \"Techno Cumbia\", \"Como La Flor\" and \"Missing My Baby\", which were not released as a single, managed to peaked on \"Billboard\" charts including; Hot Latin Tracks, Latin Regional Mexican Airplay, Canadian Hot 100 and the PROMUSICAE (Spain music charts).\n\nSelena performed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, which was attended by Jose Behar. Behar, the former president of Sony Music Latin, had recently opened EMI Latin. EMI Latin became the Latin division of EMI Records. The new president of Sony Music Latin was also attending the event and had wanted Selena to sign with his company. Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla Jr was given offers from both Sony and EMI, however, Sony doubled the amount EMI was offering. Quintanilla Jr decided to go with EMI because they were offering the crossover deal Selena wanted, while Quintanilla Jr wanted his children to be the first band to sign with EMI Latin.\n\nBefore Selena signed her contract with EMI Latin in 1989, Behar and Stephen Finfer sent out a request to EMI Records for Selena to begin her crossover album. She recorded \"Only Love\", \"Is It the Beat?\", and \"Where Did the Feeling Go?\" for the presidents of EMI Records' pop division. Behar's and Finfer's request was denied. The presidents' told them that Selena needed a bigger fan base in order to sell a lot of copies of a crossover album. Behar told in an interview that he thought EMI Records, and people in general, did not believe that a Mexican American woman could be \"successful\". By 1993 Selena had won a Grammy Award for \"Selena Live!\" (1993), won several other awards, signed a sponsorship tour with Coca-Cola, dominated the Latin music charts, and expanded the Tejano Music Movement across the United States.\n\nEMI Latin believed Selena should release a crossover album, believing she had reached her peak in the Spanish-language market. They wanted to launch her career as an American solo pop artist. Selena was signed with EMI's SBK Records in November 1993 after less than twenty-four hours in Los Angeles. News of Selena being signed with SBK made front-page news on \"Billboard\" magazine. Selena said that she was frighten by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and that only a few people had believed she would achieve success in the pop world. Selena said in interviews that the album would be released in 1994. However, following the release of \"Amor Prohibido\" in March 1994, she said the album was still being developed. During a dinner in a Thai restaurant in 1994, Selena was upset about the pressure she was under from the press about the album. She said, to Behar, that she told a lot of news crews that the album was about to be released and that she has yet to record a single song. Behar believed Selena was joking because she had always like telling jokes, but then noticed she was not setting up a joke and believed she was right. Behar then told the chairman of EMI Records, Charles Koppelman, that Selena and her band Los Dinos would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman about Selena leaving in order to force the crossover album to begin. Koppelman did not want Selena to leave and began the recording sessions.\n\nSelena started recording the first song for the album, \"I Could Fall in Love\", in late 1994. Selena was partnered with major pop music producers, some of which were Grammy Award winners. Selena's sister Suzette Quintanilla stated that Selena would take a very long time before deciding on a song that was \"Selena\". However, SBK Records controlled the entire project and only allowed Selena to choose one song. This was because, SBK knew what they were doing for a crossover event. Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording studios, including: her father's Q-Productions studio in Corpus Christi; The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Bananaboat Studio in Burbank, California; Oakshire Recorders in Los Angeles; Conway Studios in Hollywood; Clinton Studios in Clinton, New York; and Levosia Entertainment in Hollywood. Producers and songwriters who worked with Selena on the album included Keith Thomas, Trey Lorenz of Epic Records, Mark Goldenberg, Kit Hain, Guy Roche, Donna Delorey, Diane Warren, Rhett Lawrence, David Byrne of Luaka Bop Inc., Franne Golde, Tom Snow, Full Force, Brian \"Red\" Moore, A.B. Quintanilla III Selena's brother, Barrio Boyzz, K.C. Porter, Felipe Bernmejo, Jose Hernandez and Felipe Valdes Leal. Singers, Amy Grant and Vanessa Williams were both in the process of writing a song for Selena. \"Dreaming of You\" was the first album that Selena's family did not produce. Her family had wanted professional pop producers to work with Selena. Selena found this decision stressful, and felt that it was forced on her in order to sell records.\n\nSelena co-wrote with David Byrne, former lead singer of Talking Heads, for his gospel song \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\". Her vocals were later used in the song after Byrne recorded it in Clifton, New York. Selena's brother Quintanilla III and her husband Chris Perez did not like \"Dreaming of You\". They both later stated that they grew to love it after Selena was murdered. While being interviewed, Keith Thomas stated that every time Selena would walk in the recording studio that all eyes would be on her because of her smiles, energy, and eager to succeed, who made everyone laugh. Thomas also stated that there were no ego problems with her. Selena had recorded songs in late 1994 and had recorded a total of six songs by January 20, 1995. Selena was supposed to record \"Oh No (I'll Never Fall in Love Again)\" on the morning of March 31, 1995. However, she was killed on the same day by Yolanda Saldivar, a friend and ex-manager of her clothing stores. \"Oh No\" was later recorded in Spanish by her brother's band, Kumbia Kings, on their album \"Amor, Familia y Respecto\" (2009). Thomas, who wrote \"I Could Fall in Love\", never finished his second song that Selena was supposed to record and talked about the song while being interviewed for the A&E series \"Biography\" in 2008. In 2008, freestyle singer Brenda K. Starr, revealed that she was supposed to be in two unrecorded duets with Selena. In June 2011, Dominican American Latin soul singer TeCheetah Lopez was given a demo of \"Love Me Now\", which was supposed to be for Selena to record. \"Love Me Now\" was written by Christopher Troy and Zac Harmon. According to Behar, \"Dreaming of You\" was supposed to be released in September or October 1995. In April 1995, EMI Latin decided to only release four out of the six English-language songs Selena had recorded. The song \"Siempre Hace Frio\" was taken off of \"Dreaming of You\".\n\n\"I Could Fall in Love\", the first promotional single, was written by Keith Thomas and is a soft rock, pop, R&B and soul. \"I Could Fall in Love\" is written in the key of E major and moves at a moderate 86 beats per minute. Selena's vocal range in the song spans four octaves with music notes F#3-A4. Its lyrics are about a woman who is in love with a guy who does not know about her true feelings for him. She tries to tell him, but is afraid of rejection, she decides not tell him. According to \"The Billboard Book of Number One Albums\", \"I Could Fall in Love\" was chosen as the \"best song\" off of \"Dreaming of You\" and \"... could melt the hearts of millions around the world\". Kathleen Tracy wrote that \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" are two hit \"ballads\". James Hunter of \"Vibe\" stated that he liked Selena's passion that she used to record \"I Could Fall in Love\". Hunter also stated that the song is a \"masterpiece\", while also stating that because of Selena's death, it was hard to listen to the song without crying. After Selena's death, \"I Could Fall in Love\" became a popular wedding song.\n\n\"Dreaming of You\", the lead single, was written by Franne Golde and Tom Snow. \"Dreaming of You\" is a power ballad and contemporary R&B. The song's main instruments are the piano, wind chimes and funk bass. \"Dreaming of You\" is written in Ab major and begins in the key of G♯(Ab). It changes to the key of A♯(Bb) after the bridge. Selena's vocal range spans Eb3-Eb5. \"The Los Angeles Times\" ranked \"Dreaming of You\" number five from their \"Top-ten Singles of 1995\". Its lyrics are about a lonely and depressed woman in her room at night, who dreams of being with her boyfriend. The song begins with a low-key instrumentation, which provides emphasis for Selena's vocals. Geraldo Martinez of \"El Dictamen\" wrote that the opening of the song was \"surprisingly tantalizing\". \"Dreaming of You\" became Selena's signature song and was given positive feedback from music critics.\n\n\"I'm Getting Used to You\", the second promotional single, was written by Diane Warren and was produced by Rhett Lawrence. Four dance mixes were remixed by David Morales, which were created for promotional use. \"I'm Getting Used to You\" is a baroque- and dream-pop song and is written in the key of F major. Because of the music's easy piano notes it was included in the \"Top Pop Hits of 1996 for Easy Piano\" book. Its lyrics are about a woman who does not know what love is and her boyfriend tries to help her understand by \"opening her eyes\" to true love.\n\n\"Captive Heart\", is a synthpop, electro and fast rock song. \"Captive Heart\" is an uptemo song written by Kit Hain. It was released as the album's first promotional single in the United Kingdom. Its lyrics are about a woman being controlled by her partner who will not let her be free of her own emotions. She is unable to end the relationship because she is too in love with him. Ed Morales of \"Vibe\" compared both Evelyn \"Champagne\" King and \"Wherever You Are\" (the English version of \"Donde Quiera Que Estes\") with \"Captive Heart\". According to the \"Chicago Tribune\" \"Captive Heart\" was the right song for urban-contemporary radios. The \"Daily Vault\" believed Selena made a mistake with \"Captive Heart\" because she had used too much \"throat\" in the song.\n\n\"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\", a duet with David Byrne, was originally recorded for the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack. After Selena was murdered, EMI Latin decided to use the song for \"Dreaming of You\". Byrne recorded his parts in New York, while Selena recorded her verse in Corpus Christi, Texas, at her father's recording studio. \"God's Child\" was later used for the \"Blue in The Face\" soundtrack. According to the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"God's Child (Baila Conmigo)\", is an \"energetic, dark and mysterious\" song. They also stated that the song is a rumba flamenco with rock and R&B. Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" stated that the song is a \" ... giddy soulful song\".\n\n\"El Toro Relajo\" was an unreleased Spanish-language mariachi-ballad. It was written by Felipe Bermejo and produced by Jose Hernandez. It became the sixth single to be released from \"Dreaming of You\". Its lyrics are about a woman warning a man, during a bullfighting competition, that the bull is not tame. She then tries to tame the bull before her lover rides it. The band Mariachi Sol de Mexico were the backup singers for the song. \"El Toro Relajo\" was also recorded for the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack. The \"Daily Vault\" believed the song was the \"most impressive track\" on \"Dreaming of You\". The \"Daily Vault\" also stated that it was \"short, amusing, and dedicated\". After Selena's death, the song became a traditional Cinco de Mayo celebration song. Brennan told \"Time\" magazine that he believes the company who dropped \"El Toro Relajo\" from the \"Don Juan DeMarco\" soundtrack, regrets ever doing so. \"Tú Sólo Tú\" became the seventh single released from \"Dreaming of You\". John Lannert of \"Billboard\" called it a \"classic emotive (emotional) ballad\". Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" said that \"Tú Sólo Tú\" is a \"spirited mariachi song\".\n\n\"Dreaming of You\" was scheduled to be released sometime in 1994. However, following \"Amor Prohibido\", Selena's last Spanish studio album, the album was delayed. Selena told in an interview on January 20, 1995 that the album would be released in July. EMI Records and EMI Latin released \"Dreaming of You\" on July 18, 1995. It debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. \"Dreaming of You\" replaced the \"Pocahontas\" soundtrack spot as the number one album on the \"Billboard\" 200. \"Dreaming of You\" was among the ten best-selling debuts ever, and was the best-selling debut by a female artist. Selena fans in Dallas, Texas, began lining up to buy the album hours before stores were open. \"Dreaming of You\" sold 331,000 copies in its first week. It became the biggest first-week seller by a female artist. It also became the first album by a Hispanic artist to debut at number one. EMI believed that \"Dreaming of You\" sold more than 400,000 copies because SoundScan did not track copies sold in small stores.\n\n\"Dreaming of You\" also debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top Latin Albums and \"Billboard\" Latin Pop Albums charts. It remained on the charts for nearly two-hundred weeks. In Austin, stores were sold out of \"Dreaming of You\" within minutes on the day it was released. Throughout the entire city, Austin stores only allowed two copies per costumer. Fans in Corpus Christi began celebrating the release of \"Dreaming of You\" the day before the album was released, at music stores across the city. \"Dreaming of You\" was sold in approximately fifteen countries, and in the months following its release, Selena became more famous. \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" were played on English speaking radio stations, mostly on Adult contemporary radios. In Texas alone, \"Dreaming of You\" sold half a million copies.\n\nWithin ten months of release, \"Dreaming of You\" was nearing triple-platinum status. It was certified 3.5 time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipping more than 3,500,000 copies in its first year. \"Billboard\" named \"I Could Fall in Love\" and \"Dreaming of You\" the number one and two spots, in the \"Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\". \"Dreaming of You\" sold over 2,000,000 copies its first year. EMI Latin was backed up with orders of 500,000 copies from retail stores. \"Dreaming of You\" was considered the \"highest selling Latin album\" since Julio Iglesias recorded his first English-language record \"110 Bel Air Place\" (1984). \"Dreaming of You\" was certified Gold in Canada, for shipments of 50,000 copies.\n\nIn the same month of its release, \"Dreaming of You\" joined five of Selena's studio albums that were in the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Top 50 Latin Albums. The album peaked at number one, two years later \"Dreaming of You\" and \"Siempre Selena\" (1996) continued to chart on the \"Billboard\" Latin 50. \"Dreaming of You\" became the first album by a Hispanic singer to debut at number one. Some Texas stores believed that the sale figures for \"Dreaming of You\" in their state were wrong because the album had sold poorly at their music stores.\n\nThe Crossover Tour was a scheduled world tour. It was supposed to help promote \"Dreaming of You\" worldwide. The tour was scheduled to begin in mid-1995, after the album was released. The Crossover Tour was also going to promote Selena in countries where she was not well known in.\n\nThere were several commercials released in the US, Mexico and South America. Behar said that promotion \"... will be on the superstar scale\" and that \"[We] didn't put this marketing campaign behind it because there was a tragedy. ... We put this marketing campaign behind it because we believed that this was going to be a huge album because of the music. This is a record that we're going to work over the next 10 months.\"\n\nIn Texas and Mexico, bootleggers sold copies of \"Dreaming of You\". A bootlegger is a person who takes the music of an album and copy's it to a blank CD and make profit by selling the blank CDs to people on the streets. One, in Corpus Christi, tried selling a bootleg to Selena's father, without knowing who he was. Quintanilla Jr, took all the copies and reported the man to local police. There are no known reports of the public bootleggers, although Quintanilla Jr reported any he found to police. \"TVyNovelas\" believed that 50,000 copies of \"Dreaming of You\" bootlegs were sold, at five dollars each.\n\nStephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that most Americans first learned about Selena because of her murder, and \"Dreaming of You\" was the first record of Selena's that they heard. He wrote: \"\"Dreaming of You\" would have been a stronger album if she had lived, but it still stands as a powerful – and touching – testament to her talents.\" \"Billboard\" stated that Selena recorded songs that were \"pop\" and not \"Tejano\" music. \"Vibe\" editor Ed Morales called the album a \"cumbia\" and \"Tex-Mex\" (Tejano) album. James Hunter, also from \"Vibe\", believed it was hard to listen to the album because Selena's death was recent.\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\"s Achy Obejas wrote that \"Dreaming of You\" was an \"incomplete\" album that has a lot of mistakes in the selection of songs Selena recorded. Christopher John Farley of \"Time\" believed \"Dreaming of You\" helped Selena to become more popular in America. Enrique Lopetegui of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Dreaming of You\" was Selena's most \"satisfying\" album. Mary Talbot of the \"New York Daily News\" believed the album was able to reveal what Selena's career would have been like if she was alive.\n\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "301022", "title": "Dreaming of You (album)"}

The album became the final album to be released from RP Records. Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter. Selena recorded fourteen songs but only released ten. All the songs were recorded in three different recording studios. \"Dulce Amor\" helped Selena to be noticed at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. She was then signed by EMI Latin. The album had only sold over 30,000 copies. It was ordered to be removed from stores by EMI Records.\n\nMost of the songs produced were Tejano music mixed with Cumbia and Jazz fusion. \"Dulce Amor\" was nominated for \"Album of the Year\" while the song of the same name was nominated for \"Song of the Year\". Selena had won \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" and \"Female Entertainer of the Year\". Selena had promoted the album during her Dulce Amor Tour which had only lasted for less than a year. The album had mixed to negative reviews from music critics. The album was re-released in 2007 as \"Classic Series Vol. 5\".\n\nAfter Selena's sixth LP record \"Preciosa\" (1988) sold only 25,000 copies, the company had wanted Selena to record another record. The success from \"Preciosa\" had the company believing that Selena would sell more copies with her next album. In July 1988, Selena was in the recording studio and began recording songs. Her brother, A.B. Quintanilla III had became the main songwriter for Selena. Juan Gabriel, a Mexican songwriter, had given Selena the rights to record \"Costumbres\". Ricky Vela, a Selena y Los Dinos member, had written the song \"Quisiera Darte\". The song \"Qué\" was written by Manny Guerra, the record manager for RP Records and GP Productions. The songs \"Tú Solamente Tú\" and \"La Puerta Se Cerro\" were written by unknown writers. On the liner notes, the writing credits are given to \"Pendiente\" which means \"Pending\" in Spanish.\n\nIt had took Selena three weeks to record fourteen songs. However, the record company only had wanted ten songs to be on the album. The others remained unreleased. Selena had recorded the songs \"Dulce Amor\", \"Tú Solamente Tú\", \"La Puerta Se Cerro\", \"Costumbres\", and \"Dime\" at RP Records studios in San Antonio, Texas. The songs \"Always Mine\", \"No Llores Más Corazón\" and \"Cariño, Cariño Mio\" were recorded in Houston, Texas. \"Quisiera Darte\" and the unreleased tracks were recorded in Hollywood, California. The song \"Tú Solamente Tú\" was originally recorded by Selena for her debut album \"Selena y Los Dinos\" (1984).\n\nWhile Selena was performing at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards, Jose Behar (who was the former head of Sony Music Latin) was among the audience that night. He instantly wanted Selena to sign with EMI. Behar called his boss stating that he believe he had found the next Gloria Estefan. His boss told him that he was crazy, because Behar only had been in South Texas for only a week. Selena was later signed with EMI Latin the following year. \"Dulce Amor\" became her last independent LP record.\n\n\"Dulce Amor\" was released on December 24, 1988. The album was supposed to be released in the summer of 1989. However, Manny Guerra had wanted the album to be released real quick. Guerra believed that if the album would have been released in the summer, that not too many Tejano fans would buy the album. He said, because popular music albums are released in that period. When the album was released, it had sold only 2,000 copies the first day. \"Preciosa\" (1988) had sold 3,600 copies on its first day. Guerra was not happy about the sales of the album. However, within a month the album sold 10,000 copies. It outperformed all of Selena's previous records. By August 1989, the album sold 33,206 copies. It was then pulled off shelves because of Selena's upcoming debut album with EMI Latin. EMI Latin bought all the original copies of the album. Only 50,000 copies of the album were shipped in Texas alone.\n\nIn 1995, Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla Jr had bought the rights to Selena's albums (1984-1989 period) from EMI Latin. Since then, he has released the songs in compilation albums. The songs \"Always Mine\", \"No Llores Mas Corazon\" and \"La Puerta Se Cerro\" were selected to be remixed for \"Anthology\" (1998).\n\nOn September 7, 2007, Quintanilla Jr re-released the album as part of the \"Classic Series\" collection. \"Dulce Amor\" was then re-titled \"Classic Series Vol. 5\". All the songs were remastered.\n\n\"Dulce Amor\" (\"Sweet Love\") was the lead single from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Timothy Muniz. \"Dulce Amor\" was nominated for \"Song of the Year\" at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on G minor with 106 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl expressing her emotions about a guy she really love. The song was mixed with Cumbia music and Jazz fusion.\n\n\"Qué\" (\"What\") was the second single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song's writer is unknown. It was produced by Manny Guerra. The song was performed on G minor with 147 beats per minute. The songs lyrics are about a girl who has been tricked into believing that a guy really loved her. She feels a sense of loneliness and doubts herself. The songs' message is that, you can't always trust someone until you get to know them for who they really are. The song was mixed with Ranchera music and Mariachi.\n\n\"Always Mine\" was the third single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Roger Garcia, who was the former back-up guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos. \"Always Mine\" was selected to be remixed for \"Anthology\" (1998). The remixed version peaked at number four on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart and number 94 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song describes a teen romance. A young girl who is under peer pressure by her friends must decide who she wants to be with. She struggles with low self-esteem. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on B minor with 100 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka, Pop and Contemporary R&B.\n\n\"Cariño, Cariño Mio\" (\"Sweetheart, Sweetheart of Mine\") was the fourth single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by A.B. Quintanilla III. It was produced by Lauren and Carlos Diaz. The songs lyrics are about a girl who is in love with a guy. She sings about giving anything to him, just to be with him. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on D major with 103 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Polka and Jazz.\n\n\"Quisiera Darte\" (\"I Give\") was the fifth and last single released from \"Dulce Amor\". The song was written by Ricky Vela, who was the lead keyboardist for Selena y Los Dinos. The song was produced by Manny Guerra. The songs lyrics are about a girl asking her boyfriend if their relationship is \"love\". She tells him that she would do anything for him, and feels that their relationship is love. The song had its key signature in common time. It was performed on C minor with 93 beats per minute. The song was mixed with Jazz and Cumbia music.\n\nSelena had promoted \"Dulce Amor\" during her Dulce Amor Tour. Selena also promoted \"Preciosa\" (1988) along with her Dulce Amor Tour. This was because the two albums were released in the same year. Selena had performed songs from \"Dulce Amor\" on the Johnny Canales Show in South Texas, she also had done live concerts across Texas. Selena earned $20,000 from the Dulce Amor Tour, which was double the amount she had made for her Preciosa Tour.\n\nNorberto Garcia of \"Texas Monthly\" stated that \"Dulce Amor\" was one of Selena's \"strongest\" LP record because it \"showcase her exotic voice and expanded her talents[...]\". Domingo Rivera of \"Tejano Nation\" believed every song on \"Dulce Amor\" was horrible. Rivera stated that he did not like not even one song. He also stated that Selena could have done better with modern styles of Tejano music instead of mixing 1960s music into her songs. Rivera then stated the album was \"out of date\" even when it was released in 1988. Sophia Vargas of \"Tejano Weekly\" believed that \"Dulce Amor\" was not Selena's best of work. Vargas believed that RP Records did not put their \"all\" for Selena.\n\nCredits are taken from the album's liner notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "301063", "title": "Dulce Amor"}

It was created by Jonathan Murray for Oxygen TV channel. The show is about seven women who are called \"bad girls\" because of their bad behavior. They come from different races and backgrounds. They have psychological and behavior problems. They are put in a big house to live for three months. The production team video tapes their life inside and outside of the house. They live in the house to try and change their \"bad ways\" and become role models. They have to obey the rules they were given. If they don't follow them, they can be removed from the show. If this happens, a \"replacement\" will arrive at the house. \n\nIn season one and season two, the premise of the show was different from other seasons. There has been six complete seasons of \"The Bad Girls Club\". The ninth season is currently airing on Oxygen. The fourth season had the highest ratings. It became the \"breakthrough season\" for the show. The show is broadcast in five different countries. \"The Bad Girls Club\" was given negative feedback from television critics. This is because the show is about girls fighting. Teenagers have also pretended to be like the girls in the show. This made schools in the United States to dislike the show. Some schools even started banning the show in their cities. \n\nThere has been a lot of conflicts about the show. This is because some cast-members stated opinions that made the public very angry. There have been three spin-offs of \"The Bad Girls Club\". has been a rating success. The show is about three former \"bad girls\" looking for love. Oxygen released mobile games, comic strip and merchandise to help promote the show. There has been 62 people who been on the show. Kerry Harvick (from the first season) became a country singer. Tanisha Thomas (from the second season) became a host in many \"Bad Girls Club\" spin-offs. Amber Meade, Amber Buhl, Sarah Michaels, Kendra Jones, Natalie Nunn and Lea Beaulieu were in the \"Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too\" show.\n\nThe show follows seven women. They are between the ages of 21 and 27. They live in a big house for three months. The production team video tapes their lives in and out of the house. The girls are called \"bad girls\". This is because of their bad behavior. However, they are put in the show because they want to change their \"bad ways\". They also want to become role models to young women. Other \"bad girls\" are only there to reach goals of their own. In the show, the \"bad girls\" must try to live with each other. They must also try and deal with a lot of changes from their roommates. They must follow all the rules that they were given. If they break a \"bad girl\" breaks a rule, she will be removed from the show. A \"replacement\" is then brought in. A replacement is a \"bad girl\" who did not enter the house on the first night. She is brought in the show, to fill in. This is because the show is about seven women trying to change. The \"bad girls\" have to talk in a room about their day. \n\nSometimes, a \"bad girl\" may divide into cliques. Create bad behavior to feel happy, book parties in nightclubs and shop for food. They must also maintain their personal lives. The \"bad girls\" are allowed to contact their families and boyfriends (or girlfriends). They are given a home computer to communicate with the world. However, watching television and having a cell phone is not allowed. Bullying and double tagging is known to happen in the show. Double tagging means that two or more \"bad girls\" jump one of their roommates. Sometimes, a \"bad girl\" may wish to leave the show. This is because of their roommates who are bullying them, being or feeling alone, problems at home, court dates, or because they feel like they are \"better\" then the girls in the house. \n\nIt is rare if two or more replacements come into the show. The only seasons to have a lot of replacements was season one (2006), season five (2010) and season six (2011). The replacement \"bad girl\" is always treated badly by the original cast. It is rare if a replacement wants to leave the show. The only season to have a replacement leave was on the fifth season.\n\nThis is the \"Bad Girls Club\" creed. It was first seen in the third season.\n\nThe show was different in these two seasons. The age requirements were 21 and 31. \"Nicknames\" were not given to anyone. Nicknames started in the third season. Season one was the first season to have a lot of replacement \"bad girls\". Even though this season was different, the rules were kept the same for later seasons. Another thing that stood the same was how the first episode started. The first episode always starts with a physical fight. The fight that is seen, shows how the first \"bad girl\" is removed from the show.\n\nFor the second season, the show began to change. The maximum age requirements to apply dropped from 35 to 27. The cast had to work. They were given jobs that did not give them any money. They had to learn how to be dependent on others for teamwork. They also needed to build a work ethic. This skill would help them in their life after the show. If a \"bad girl\" wanted to quit her job or did not show up, she would be removed from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning and decision making. This became the first and only season to have the \"bad girls\" working. This was also the last time episodes were only 30-minutes long.\n\nThe OxygenLive was released on August 3, 2010. This allowed fans of the show to submit their opinions about the season or the cast. Fans had to submit their comments on Facebook or Twitter. Their comments were then showed during the re-cap episode of \"The Bad Girls Club\". OxygenLive! was an online talk show. Tanisha Thomas (from season two) was the hose. The live show debuted after the first episode of the sixth season aired on Oxygen. The show was about talking with the cast of season six.

Applications and video tape submissions did not have a set deadline. Applicants chosen to be a finalist went to Los Angeles, California, from which applicants were narrowed down to a pool of 40 finalists. Casting calls were held around the United States on a later date. The cast has recently been selected, and they are now in sequester.\n\nThe house was revealed on June 27, 2011. It features a \"Venice Beach\" theme. With a Katy Perry themed room, a fortune teller/tarot card room and the backyard is of graffiti.\n\nIn the house tour that was exclusive to Yahoo, there was room for 14 houseguests on the picture wall. \n\nOn the first night, the houseguests were told of a surprise. They then were told that they had to pair up in groups of two. Before the HoH (Head of Household) competition, the houseguests were welcomed to three past dous. The first were Rachel and Brendon (from Big Brother 12). The second were Jordan and Jeff (from Big Brother 11). The last dous were Danielle and Dick (from Big Brother 8). During the HoH competition, the houseguests had to hold onto a banana. They were later squirted with chocolate and whip cream, while being rocked back-and-forth, to make the competition harder. Rachel then won the first HoH competition of the summer and her partner Brendon were safe from being evicted from the game. Host, Julie Chen, told the houseguests that Rachel had to choose only one dou. She was also told that only one of them would be evicted. However, the houseguest who wasn't eliminated can be safe until there are ten remaining houseguests. \n\n\nAs revealed on ET Canada on June 28, 2011; Julie Chen revealed that Dynamic Duos of seasons past would have a major impact on this season and the twist.\n\n", "id": "301098", "title": "Big Brother 13 (U.S.)"}

It was the third set of rings found in the Solar System after the rings found around Saturn and Uranus. The rings are very difficult to see from Earth, needing the most powerful telescopes. They were not discovered until the Voyager 1 space probe visited the planet in 1979. The Galileo space probe carried out more studies in the 1990s. The Hubble Space Telescope and large Earth telescopes have provided information recently.\n\nThe ring system is faint and is made mainly of dust. It has four main parts: a thick inner ring known as the \"halo\" ring, a bright but very thin \"main\" ring, and two outer, wide, faint \"gossamer\" rings. These gossamer rings are made from dust from the moons Amalthea and Thebe and have been name after them. They are known as \"gossamer\" rings because they are transparent, or \"see through\".\n", "id": "301099", "title": "Rings of Jupiter"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301221", "text": "Ecological genetics\n\nEcological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations. \n\nThis contrasts with classical genetics, which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains, and DNA sequence analysis, which studies genes at the molecular level. \n\nResearch in ecological genetics is on traits related to fitness, which affect an organism's survival and reproduction. Examples might be: flowering time, drought tolerance, polymorphism, mimicry, defence against predators. \n\nResearch usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies. Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed. Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted, and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied. Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times.\n\nAlthough work on natural populations had been done previously, it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist E.B. Ford (1901–1988) in the early 20th century. Ford was taught genetics at Oxford University by Julian Huxley, and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924. Ford also had a long working relationship with R.A. Fisher. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism, Fisher had got accustomed to high natural selection values in nature. This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations. Ford's magnum opus was \"Ecological genetics\", which ran to four editions and was widely influential. \n\nOther notable ecological geneticists would include Theodosius Dobzhansky who worked on chromosome polymorphism in fruit flies. As a young researcher in Russia, Dobzhansky had been influenced by Sergei Chetverikov, who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field, though his significance was not appreciated until much later. Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of \"Drosophila\" species in western USA and Mexico over many years.\n\nMany were influenced by Ford in the post WWII era.

They include primrose, cowslip and oxlip. \n\nMany species are grown for their ornamental flowers. They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere, south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia, Indonesia and New Guinea, and in temperate southern South America.\n\nPerennial primulas bloom mostly during the spring; their flowers can be purple, yellow, red, pink, or white. Generally, they prefer filtered sunlight. Many species are adapted to alpine climates.\n\nThe word \"primula\" is the Latin feminine diminutive of \"primus\", meaning first (prime), applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring. \n\nPrimroses are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some Lepidoptera species.\n\nSome flowering forms of (cultivated) \"Primula\" are commonly known as polyanthus (\"P. elatior\" hybrids) as opposite to primrose (\"P.vulgaris\" hybrids).\n\nThe common primrose, \"Primula vulgaris\", shows heterostyly. This is a type of morphism with flower forms which differ in the lengths of the pistil and stamens.\n\nThe morph phenotype is genetically closely linked to genes responsible for a system of self-incompatibility. That means the pollen from a flower on one morph cannot fertilize another flower of the same morph. \n\nIn one morph (termed 'pin') the stamens are short and the pistils are long; in the second morph (termed 'thrum') the stamens are long and the pistils are short. The length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph, and vice versa. The system prevents self-fertilisation.\n\nAll sections of the genus \"Primula\" have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.\n", "id": "301249", "title": "Primula"}

The French and British attacked the Chinese city of Canton. The city fell on January 1, 1858 and the Europeans took over.\n\nThe Second Opium War was a conflict between England and China. Other Western countries, including the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Second French Empire helped the English. The War began after an event called the \"\"Arrow\" incident.\" The English used the incident as an excuse to start the war. The Second Opium War is sometimes called the \"Arrow War.\"\n\nThe English had several goals in the war. Some of these were:\nIn 1856, the Qing Dynasty only let foreign merchants trade in certain cities. Goods like tea and silk had to be shipped to those trade cities, and were taxed on the way. The English did not want to pay the extra taxes for shipping things across China.\n\nThe Chinese had executed a French missionary named Father August Chapdelaine in Guangxi province. This made the French very angry. The French joined the English in fighting the Chinese.\n\nOn October 8, 1856, the Chinese arrested 12 crewmembers of a ship named \"Arrow\". The Chinese authorities believed that the \"Arrow\" was smuggling salt. The \"Arrow\" was owned by Chinese people, but it was registered with the British. Harry Smith Parkes was the British Consul in Canton. He sent a letter to the Chinese Imperial Commissioner (governor), Ye Mingchen. Ye replied that the \"Arrow\" was a Chinese ship. He claimed that Parkes and the British had no jurisdiction (no right to interfere.) Ye offered to return the arrested sailors, but Parkes refused. Parkes demanded an apology for the insult. Ye replied there was no need for an apology because there way no insult. The British decided that the Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue had been broken. On October 27, 1856, the British Royal Navy attacked Canton.\n\nThe first battle of Canton started on October 23, 1856. Three English warships entered the Bocca Tigris (), the waterway that leads to Canton. The English captured the forts that were protecting the city. Ye saw the warships, but did not want to fight them. He moved his navy back away from the English ships.\n\nOn October 25, the English navy surrounded the city. Ye ordered all trade with the English to stop.\n\nAdmiral Michael Seymour, the commander of the British navy, sent Ye a message on October 27. Seymour demanded that the English be allowed to enter Canton. (Before this, foreigners could not enter the city itself. If they wanted to do business or trade they had to do so in the suburbs or harbor.) Ye did not answer. Seymour ordered his ships to shoot at the government offices. Ye made a declaration that he would pay 30 pieces of silver for each English person killed.\n\nYe still had not answered on October 28. The English artillery attacked and destroyed the Southern wall of Canton. English soldiers invaded Ye's yamun (office.) The soldiers wanted to capture Ye, but they could not find him. The English occupied (stayed in) Canton for a short while. They had to leave because they did not have enough soldiers or resources to keep control of the city.\n\nWhen the news sent to London, the English government had a big argument, to start war with China or do not. The disagreement passed by 110:146, the proposal (suggestion) was veto (not to agree the political case). But the English prime minister Palmerston the House of Commons and restarted the election. His party won the election, so the policy passed. The English government ordered (command) Lord Elgin to be a new diplomat with China.\n\nJust in time, the French government said their churchman were killed by the Chinese government. Because the French minister (a man who says what his country said) always had (to be refused), it joined to the English government and sent armies. English and French armies entered into an alliance (become ally, no enemy).\n\nIn mid of October, 1857. The English army general had a plan to invade China. They decided to attack from the south of China, Canton. And then they would attack along the North China, to keep moving to Peking. \n\nBefore they go, the Russian minister suggested them, only occupy Canton would not make Qing dynasty give up. The better way was onward to Peking, Qing's dynasty would do. However, the English-French armies still kept their first decision. The decision was attack Canton. Lord Elgin talked with Seymour and the other generals about their plan to Canton. They were really sure they could take (to occupy) Canton.\nIn November. The English held down the Indian Revolution successfully. Therefore, they had enough armies to China. The alliance army prepared 10,000 soldiers. In Navy, the English army had 43 warships and the French army had 10 ships.\n\nIn December 10, 1857. Canton was blocked. On December 12, the alliance army made the last warning to Yeh and new demands as follow:\n\nOn December 14, Yeh refused them. After 12 days, The English and French minister sent back and said now their army had the right to do anything. At the same time, the English naval commander sent messages to Yeh, this time, he asked the Qing army must get away from Canton in 90 miles, only in 2 days. Yeh still refused. Over 2 days, they had no action.\n\nOn December 27, in the day before the battle. Yeh sent messages to his king, Xianfeng Emperor. He spoke about what happened in Canton, but in lie. In the letter, he was so sure, the English begged for peace, they only wanted the trade with China, said Yeh:\nIn December 28, the war begun. The alliance army sent troops about 5,500 men and included 700 French soldiers, extra 20 warships. They landed on near Canton, finally, they were so near the city. The alliance army opened fire at governor's office (Yeh's workplace). The Qing army ran away, but Yeh was still sitting on his office and reading the paper.\n\nOn December 29, the government office finally got destroyed by . The wall of Canton also lost. Until the afternoon at 2 p.m., the battle ended. Successfully, the English-French armies occupied Canton, easily, only 15 killed.\n\nOn January 5, after the occupation of Canton. Yeh was not leaving, after that, he got caught in by the English army. The English brought Yeh on their ship to Kolkata, India.

It is dedicated to St Bartholomew. It belongs to the most richly equipped churches of the upper valley of the Werra. It is one of the few buildings of the small town, first mentioned in 796, which outlasted all storms of the time. The Oberkirche (upper church) at the upper gate and the Unterkirche (lower church) at the Werra were the first places of worship in the place. Of the Roman Unterkirche there still exist some remainders in the vestry and in both lower floors of the church tower.\nPope Sixtus IV gave permission for the restoration of the church on 14th of May 1484 with countess Margaretha von Henneberg intermediating.\n\nOn 3rd of May 1488 the Chorherr (canon regular) of the Premonstratensian monastery Veßra and minister of Themar Antonius König founded the building of today's church. In 1502 the hall church in late Gothic style was completed.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation was introduced to Themar on 5th of October 1544 by the count Ernst von Henneberg. After the Reformation the church received several smaller carved altars from other churches. Since 1541 the church building was frequently converted in the course of the next decades.\n\nThe barrel vault and the two matroneums were inserted, whose support beams were decorated with beautiful\" Bartmannsköpfe\" (sculptures). Similar sculptures can be found in the churches of Rohr and Herpf near Meiningen.\n\nAt the columns the matroneums were decorated with sculptures of saints and apostles, partially from older Gothic altar works and with famous verses from the bible.\n\nIn the choir area there is the valuable \"Marienaltar\" (altar of St Mary), which was created by Hans Nußbaum from Bamberg about 1510.\n\nThe altar shows in the center Maria with Jesus as a child, to her sides archangel Michael killing the dragon with his lance, and St Bartholomew, the patron of church and town.\n\nOn the side panels of the altar there are stations from the life of St Mary: The announcement to the Virgin Mary, the birth of the Lord, the three Magi and the Lamentation of St. Mary by the apostles. At the back of the side panels there are paintings of St Barbara, St Dorothy, St Margaret, St Catherine. On the Predella of the altar is to be seen the Holy Kinship.\n\nApart from its artistic value the Marienaltar has also great importance for local history: It retained the town church in the Thirty Years' War of being burned down. After the defeat of Sweden in the battle of Nördlingen (1634) general Johann Ludwig Hektor of Isolani, „the commander of all Croats“, plundered the countries of the Thuringian princes.\n\nAt 16th of October (Gallustag) in 1634 Themar was burned down (on the same day as Suhl) after the plundering by the Croats. The town church would have been burned as well, but a pious Italian officer gave the order to extinguish the fire when it came near to the Marienaltar.\n\nFurther carvings and art treasures are: The shrine of the apostles (about 1500), that is called \"„Nasenaltar\"\" (nose altar) in popular because of the expressive faces of the apostles.\n\nAt the back of the side panels there is a painting of the \"Apostelabschied\" (Great Commission). At the north wall there is the Wallfahrtsaltar (altar of pilgrimage) one can see the \"\"Hühnchenlegende\"\" (miracle of the chicken) of Santo Domingo de la Calzada (on the way of St James) at the back of a side panel.\n\nAt the south wall there are a Pietà altar and a Gothic \"Mondsichelmadonna\", and in the choir area an epitaph in the Renaissance style. Furthermore, a fresco painting representing St. Catherine, that was detected in 1934, then the richly decorated Schalldeckel (abat-voix, or sounding-board) of the pulpit that dates from 1644 and an \"Epistelstuhl\" (reading-desk) likewise from the center of the 17th century and some paintings.\n\nAbout 1900 stained glass was donated for the windows in the choir area. The pictures show Biblical scenes: the prodigal or lost son, the \"Kindersegnung\" (benediction of children, St. Luke 18, 15-17), the Good Samaritan. 1972 The last renovation of the St Bartholomew's Church was in 1972.\n\nOriginally the organ of the town church was set up in 1851 at the east wall of the church nave by the organ-builders Johann Michel and Wilhelm Holland (from Schmiedefeld am Rennsteig). Three organ stops of the pedal division were taken over from the Weise-organ built in 1629. In 1866 the organ was moved to the extended second matroneum in the west and renewed and reorganized for the last time in the years 1999/2000 by the company Rösel and Hercher.\n\nFrom 1668 to 1684 Georg Christoph Bach, the oldest uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach, worked as Kantor at the town church and as a teacher at the Latin school of Themar. In 1684 he was appointed to Schweinfurt and became the ancestor of the Schweinfurt branch of the Bach family.\n\nThe church tower in Renaissance style contains three bells. The oldest bell was cast in 1488, another in 1507. The Bartholomäus bell that was cast in 1520 had to be delivered in 1942. In 1955 a steel bell was put in instead. In the church tower there lived a family of tower guards called Rust up to the fifties of the last century.

The prisoners were told if they did not do it they would be shot as well.\n\nA documentary movie was made in 2009 looking at mass killings in the US.

The banded layers are a common feature in sediments for much of the Earth's early history.\n\nThe formations are abundant around the time of the Great Oxygenation Event, 2,400 mya. They become less common after 1,800 mya. \n\nThe total amount of oxygen locked up in the banded iron beds is estimated to be perhaps twenty times the volume of oxygen present in the modern atmosphere of Earth. Banded iron beds are an important commercial source of iron ore, such as the Pilbara region of Western Australia and the Animikie Group in Minnesota.\n\nThe conventional concept is that the \"banded iron\" layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria. This combined with dissolved iron in Earth's oceans to form insoluble iron oxides. These precipitated out, forming a thin layer on the substrate, which may have been anoxic mud (forming shale and chert). Each band is similar to a varve: the banding is assumed to result from cyclic variations in available oxygen.\n\nIt is assumed that the Earth started out with vast amounts of iron dissolved in the world's acidic seas.\n\nEventually, as photosynthetic organisms generated oxygen, the available iron in the Earth's oceans was precipitated out as iron oxides. \n\nAt the tipping point where the oceans became permanently oxygenated, small variations in oxygen production produced pulses of free oxygen in the surface waters, alternating with pulses of iron oxide deposition.\n", "id": "301332", "title": "Banded iron formation"}

In these books, the primary action happens during armed combat. Other war novels take place on the home front. The characters may be busy getting ready for or recovering from war. It is sometimes called military fiction.\n\nThere have been war novels and other stories about war for many thousands of years. In Ancient Greece and Rome and the Middle Ages, people wrote epic poems about the glory of war. Some of the most famous epic poems are \"The Iliad\" by Homer, \"The Aeneid\" by Virgil, the Old English saga \"Beowulf\", and the legends of King Arthur.\n\nAnother important influence of war novels are tragedies (plays about human suffering.) Euripides, Seneca the Younger, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare wrote plays that are important influences on war novels. Shakespeare's play \"Henry V\" has many features of a war novel. It has history and military tactics, and it talks about the ethics of war. \n\nThe genres of romance and satire are also important. These works, especially in Early Modern Europe, show military heroism and folly (foolishness). Some important examples are \"The Faerie Queen\" by Edmund Spenser and \"Don Quixote\" by Miguel de Cervantes.\n\nThe themes and symbols found in modern war novels are also influenced by older works. In \"The Inferno\", Dante described Hell in a way that is very close to how war is described in war novels. Other influences are John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" and the Apocalypse in the \"Book of Revelation\" in the Bible.\n\nThe first war novels were from the 1600s. At that time fiction novels written in prose (instead of poetry) were becoming popular. These early war novels were usually satires and picaresque novels. The soldier was usually a rogue and not very realistic. One example is \"Simplicissimus\" by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen. \"Simplicissimus\" is a semi-autobiographical novel (based on the author's life) about the Thirty Years' War.\n\nInfluential war novels from this time include Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", about the Napoleonic Wars in Russia, and Stephen Crane's \"The Red Badge of Courage\", about the American Civil War.\nWar novels from this time included the experiences of trench warfare, but also began to tell the stories of what happened at home during the war. Many novels were written about the war. Writers were from countries on all sides of the conflict.\n\nOne of the first and most influential of these was the 1916 novel \"Le Feu\" (or \"Under Fire\") by the French novelist and soldier Henri Barbusse.\n\nThe 1920s saw the so-called \"war book boom,\" during which many men who had fought during the war were finally ready to write openly and critically about their war experiences. In 1929, Erich Maria Remarque's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" was a massive, worldwide bestseller. Also significant were Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" (1929), Richard Aldington's \"Death of a Hero\" (1929), Arnold Zweig's \"The Case of Sergeant Grischa\" (1927), Charles Yale Harrison's \"Generals Die in Bed\" (1930) and William March's \"Company K\" (1933).\n\nMany novels came out of soldiers' and peoples' experiences during World War II. These books were not only by European authors, but also by people around the world.\n\nJust after the war ended, Sakaguchi Ango (坂口安吾) published a book called \"Idiocy\" (白痴) about the strange life in Japan after the bombing and losing the war. There were many novels aout the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including: \"Summer Flowers\" (夏の花) by Hara Tamiki (原 民喜) in 1947 and \"Black Rain\" (黒い雨) by Ibuse Masuji (井伏鱒二). There were also novels about being part of the kamikaze. The 1949 book \"Last Friends\" (きけ、わだつみの声) was about a group of soldiers leaving for the front. It was a best-seller. Around 1970 another type of novel began to appear. Ordinary people wrote about their experiences of battles and air raids. Novels about the many different ways the war ended also began to appear and tell being left behind in China or becoming prisoners of the Soviet Union in Siberia.\n\nMany Americans and Vietnamese authors wrote books during or after this long war.\n\n", "id": "301382", "title": "War novel"}

It came after the Archaean eon, and lasted from 2500 to 1600 million years ago (mya).\n\nIn the Palaeoproterozoic, there was a huge production of stromatolites by cyanobacteria. The first unicellular eukaryote organisms also appeared in the fossil record. \n\nThe first supercontinent grew, and some of the rocks were normal sedimentary rocks, not metamorphosed.\n\nBecause the Earth was only half as old as now, there were some basic differences from today. Heat in the Earth's interior was greater than today. This was mainly due to the higher abundance of radioactive isotopes, which decay as time passes.\n\nTemperatures at the surface were also higher, due to radiation from the Earth's interior, and due to a methane and carbon dioxide-based greenhouse atmosphere. During the previous eon, the Archaean, the oceans were hot (55–85 °C). This was only partly balanced by the fact that the Sun's radiation was lower at that time. \n\nPaleontological evidence on the Earth's rotational history suggests that ~1.8 billion years ago, there were about 450 days in a year, implying 20 hour days. Further back, the Earth day had about 17 hours, and there were 514±33 days per year. The Earth–Moon distance for the earliest Palaeoproterozoic was 51.9±3.3 Earth radii (compared to 60.27 at present).\n\nA global supercontinent (called Columbia, or Nena) existed from about 1.8 to 1.5 billion years ago in the Palaeoproterozoic era.\n\nDuring the era climate changes were as severe as any in Earth history. From a global high temperature at the start, there were three massive ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics.\n\nThere are clear indications that the era saw a drop in atmospheric methane:\n\nOxygen was produced by the cyanobacteria, but it was mostly used up by chemical sinks. These were the unoxidized sulfur and iron. Until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1% to 2% of its current level. \n\nBanded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were formed by the oxygen forming compounds with iron; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago. Red beds, which are colored by hematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks.\n\nThere were three major ice ages, with ice deep into the tropics. Undoubtedly, they happened as a result of reduced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and the rise of oxygen production.\n\nThere is what researchers call \"a puzzling interval of ~1,400 million years with no verified glaciation between early Palaeoproterozoic glaciations at 2400–2200 mya in North America, South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia and the Neoproterozoic glaciations that affected all continents at 800–600 mya\".\n\nThere were major bolide impacts during the era, two of which caused the largest impact crators on Earth. There are also three smaller (equal or more than 30 kilometers diameter) in the time zone of 3.0 to 1.2 billion years ago.\n\nThe origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life, since they include all complex cells and almost all multi-cellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; Knoll suggests they developed approximately 1.6–2.1 billion years ago. Some acritarchs are known from at least 1650 million years ago, and the possible alga \"Grypania\" has been found as far back as 2100 million years ago.\n", "id": "301395", "title": "Palaeoproterozoic"}

The St Kilda Road Gallery, designed\nby Sir Roy Grounds, opened in 1968. Since December 2003, NGV has operated across two sites – NGV International on St Kilda Road, redesigned by Mario Bellini, and The Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia at Federation Square, designed by LAB Architecture Studio.\n\nWhen the gallery opened, Victoria had been an independent colony for ten years. After the Victorian gold rush, it was easily the richest part of Australia, and Melbourne the largest city. Generous gifts from rich citizens, including the industrialist Alfred Felton, made it possible for the National Gallery to start buying large collections of overseas works from both old and modern masters. It has over 65,000 works of art.\n\nThe National Gallery of Victoria Art School began in 1867. It was the leading centre for art training in Australia until about 1910.

The first edition was published on 2 June 1846.\n\nThe paper was known for its abuse and sarcasm and by 1853 Kerr lost ownership after a series of court actions. It was then published under the name of Edward Wilson. The paper was also linked to the weekly \"The Australasian\" which was to become \"The Australasian Post\" in 1946.\n\nDuring the Great Depression in 1933 it launched the \"Melbourne Evening Star\" in competition with \"The Herald\" newspaper, but was closed in 1936.\n\nIn 1949 the paper was bought by the London based \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper group.

The paper had interests in radio and in 1956, the new medium of television broadcasting. It wasg part of the group \"General Telecasters Victoria\" (GTV), and the GTV-9 television station.

He was most successful in the 1940s in the black music market but he reached also white audiences and recorded several cross over hits in the Pop charts.\nLouis Jordan was born in Brinkley,Arkansas. His mother, Addie, died in his younger years. His father, James Aron Jordan, was a music teacher and bandleader for the Brinkley Brass Band. From him he got his musical education. He started with the clarinet but also played piano very well.But the alto saxophon became his main instrument. He started his professionel career in the bands of his father.\n\nHe went north to Philadelphia and later to New York, where he started in 1932 with the band of Clarence Williams. In late 1936 he was invited to join the important Savoy Ballroom orchestra led by drummer Chick Webb.Webb was an excellent musician but no great showman, so Jordan took over the announcements when he started singing for the band. Later the young Ella Fitzgerald joined Webbs band and she often sang duets with Jordan. The following years she recorded some hit singles with Jordan.\n\n1938 Jordan was fired by Webb and he began to form an own band which made her first recordings for Decca in December 1938. The original lineup of the sextet was Jordan (saxes, vocals), Courtney Williams (trumpet), Lem Johnson (tenor sax), Clarence Johnson (piano), Charlie Drayton (bass) and Walter Martin (drums). The Decca recordings were from \"The Elks Rendezvous Band\" but Jordan changed the name to \"Tympany Five\" after the brand of Martins drums. The most successful time of the band was between 1942 and 1950. In this period they had 18 #1-hits in the Rhythm and Blues chart of Billboard magazine. Some of the hits like Caldonia, Let the good times roll, Saturday Night Fish Fry or Choo Choo Ch'Boogie are evergreens. Under his duet partners were Bing Crosby,Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong.\n\nIn the 1950s his singles did not sell very well so he left Decca. He signed with different other record companies but was not as successful as in the 1940s. He died in 1975 in Los Angeles and is buried in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was introduced to the Rock and Roll Hall of fame. There he is described as “the Father of Rhythm & Blues” and “the Grandfather of Rock ‘n’ Roll.” As jump blues artist he paved the way for Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris, Tiny Bradshaw and others. In his music one can hear the prototype of Rock and Roll. He influenced Bill Haley & His Comets, whose producer, Milt Gabler, had also worked with Jordan. The Broadway show, \"Five Guys Named Moe\", was devoted to Jordan's music and this title is given to both soundtrack (tribute) and original music collections. The show was played over 400 times on Broadway. Blues Guitarist B. B. King recorded an album called \"Let The Good Times Roll-The Music of Louis Jordan\", as well as the songs \"Let the Good Times Roll\" and \"Caldonia\". Rock singer Joe Jackson recorded Jumpin' Jive in 1981 which featured several songs by Jordan. Let The Good Times Roll, a Jordan biography, was written by British jazz historian John Chilton.\n\nThe music of Louis Jordan is still available in many different collections. To learn more about his music one can buy Bear Familys nine-CD collection of Jordan's work (\"Let the Good Times Roll: the Complete Decca Recordings 1938-1954\").

About 60% of all infectious diseases in humans are spread by animals.\n\nZoonotic diseases can be spread in different ways. They may be spread from a sick animal directly to a human - for example, through bites and infected saliva (like with rabies), or through the air. This is called \"direct zoonosis\".\n\nZoonotic diseases can also be spread through a vector. This is an animal that carries the pathogen that causes the disease without getting infected. Diseases like this are called \"vector-borne diseases\".\n\nSometimes the vector picks up the disease from another animal. For example, rats who have the bubonic plague do not directly infect humans. Instead, fleas bite the rats and pick up the bacteria that causes plague without getting sick. Then, if the flea bites a human, they can pass the bacteria on to the human, and the human can get the plague. The rat is the host of the disease, and the flea is the vector.\n\nMany foodborne illnesses are zoonotic diseases. In these cases, a human gets sick from eating food that came from a sick animal.\n\nThe most common pathogens that cause foodborne illnesses are \"Salmonella\", \"Campylobacter\", and \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\") bacteria.

It is used in ayahuasca brews (a \"magic\" drink) because of the psychedelic drug DMT in its roots.\n\nThe \"Mimosa\" genus has gone through many periods of time where it was split up into smaller groupings or lumped into larger ones. It has over 3,000 names to describe it and its species. Most of these names are now considered synonyms. Some of the names have been given to other species and genera.\n\nBecause of this, the name \"mimosa\" has been used for other species that look like mimosa but are not related. Some of the most common unrelated plants with this name are the Silk Tree (\"Albizia julibrissin\") and Sattle (\"Acacia dealbata\".)\n\nThis genus includes some plants that are able to move fast. This is very rare. The mimosa's leaves close quickly when touched.\n\n\"Mimosa\" is related to the genera \"Acacia\" and \"Albizia\". The difference between them is that the mimosa's flowers have ten or fewer stamens. The big round flower of the mimosa is actually an inflorescence, a cluster (close group) of many small flowers.\n\n\n", "id": "301616", "title": "Mimosa"}

There are several versions of it, including Coño English, Jejenese and Swardspeak. There are attempts to differentiate the usage of Taglish and Englog where Taglish refers to the usage of English words in Tagalog syntax while Englog refers to the usage of Tagalog words in English syntax. \n\nTaglish and Englog are used by Filipinos in countries like Australia, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It used in text messages to write more quickly.\n\nTaglish (or Englog) is a language of Manila created by mixing the English and the Tagalog languages together. The language is used because Tagalog words are longer than words in English. Example:\nEnglish action words, and even some naming words, can be Tagalog action words. This is done by the addition of one or more prefixes or infixes and by the doubling of the first sound of the starting form of the action or naming word. \n\nThe English action word \"drive\" can be changed to the Tagalog word \"magda-drive\" meaning \"will drive\" (used in place of the Tagalog word \"magmamaneho\"). The English naming word \"Internet\" can also be changed to the Tagalog word \"nag-Internet\" meaning \"have used the Internet\".\n\nTaglish and Englog also use sentences of mixed English or Tagalog words and phrases. The conjunctions used to connect them can come from eany of the two. Some examples include:\n\nBecause its informal nature, experts of English and Tagalog discourage its use.\n\nJejenese is the kind of speech used by people called \"Jejemons\". This is a subculture in the Philippines, made up of people who try to change the English language to better suit Spanish and Filipino. Their alphabet, Jejebet, is based on Leet. Words are created by mixing letters in a word, mixed large and small letters, using the letters H, X or Z many times, and mixing of numbers in words. The spelling is the same as in Leet.\n\nSwardspeak is a kind of Taglish and Englog used by gay people. It is a form of slang. Swardspeak uses word from Tagalog, English, Spanish, Cebuano, Japanese, Sanskrit, and other languages. Names of Celebrities and trademark brands are also used.\n\nCoño English (tl: \"Konyo\") or Colegiala English (es: ) is a creole of Taglish and Englog that originated from the children in rich families of Manila. The word \"coño\" itself came from the Spanish word \"coño\". It is a form of Philippine English that has Spanish and Tagalog words. Unlike other forms of Taglish and Englog, Coño English sounds more gentle and feminine.\n\nThe most common aspect of Coño English is the building of action words using the English action word \"make\" with the base form of a Tagalog action word. Examples:\n\nSometimes, Tagalog interjections such as \"ano\", \"naman\", \"pa\", \"na\" (or \"nah\"), \"no\" (or \"noh\"), \"a\" (or \"ha\"), \"e\" (or \"eh\"), and \"o\" (or \"oh\") are placed to add emphasis. \n\n\"No\" and \"a\" (from the Tagalog word \"ano\") are used for questions and are added to the end of a sentence only. \"Ano\" (meaning \"what\") is also used for questions and is placed in the front or the end.\n\n\"E\" (added to answers to questions) and \"o\" (for statements) are used for exclamations and are added to the front only. \"Pa\" (meaning \"not yet\", \"not yet done\", \"to continue\", or \"still\") and \"na\" (meaning \"now\", \"already\", or \"already done\") can be placed in the middle or end. \"Naman\" (same as \"na\" but mostly for emphasis only) is placed anywhere.\n\nThe interjection \"no?\" (equal to the Spanish \"¿no?\" and the German \"nicht?\") is pronounced as or (with a pure vowel instead of the English glide), which shows influence from Spanish.\n\nEnglish description words are often replaced with Tagalog action words. The language also has many Spanish words or Spanish words like \"baño\" (\"bathroom\"), \n\"tostado\" (\"toasted\") and \"jamón\" (\"ham\").\n\nDue to the feminine sound of Coño English, male speakers sometimes overuse the Tagalog word \"pare\" (which means \"pal\" or \"buddy\"), in order to make it sound more masculine. Sometimes \"tsong\" (whose meaning is the same) is used instead of \"pare\" or with it.Examples below:\n", "id": "301648", "title": "Taglish and Englog"}

It is caused by a parasite called \"Trichomonas vaginalis\", which is a protozoa made of just one cell. Trichomoniasis can affect both men and women. It is usually an infection of the urinary system and genitals.\n\nThe \"Trichomonas vaginalis\" parasite can only live in the human genital tract. Trichomoniasis is only spread through sex, or if two people's genitals touch.\n\nMost people with trichomoniasis do not have any symptoms. \n\nWhen people do have symptoms, they usually start about 5 to 28 days after the person got infected. Symptoms may include:\n\nComplications are serious problems that can happen because a person has a disease. These problems do not happen to everyone with trichomoniasis. They are the most serious problems that trichomoniasis can cause. Some of the most dangerous problems that can happen to a person with trichomoniasis include:\n\nTreatment for trichomoniasis is usually metronidazole (Flagyl), which kills protozoa like \"Trichomonas vaginalis\". However, this medication has to be used carefully with woman who are in the early stages of pregnancy. Anyone the infected person has had sex with should also get treatment, even if they have no symptoms.\n\nAbout 95% to 97% of people with trichomoniasis are cured after one dose of metronidazole. \n\nWithout treatment, trichomoniasis can stay in a woman's body for months to years. In many (but not all) men, it seems to go away on its own.\n\nTrichomoniasis can be prevented by having safe sex (for example, by using condoms).\n\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that women who are having vaginal discharge should get tested for trichomoniasis.\n\nTrichomoniasis is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the world that is not caused by a virus. Every year, about 248 million more people get trichomoniasis. It is more common in women than men. \n\nIt is also the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease in the United States. In the U.S., about 3.7 million people have trichomoniasis, and about 1.1 million more people get infected every year. Recent research has said that 3% of the U.S. population (3 in every 100 people) have trichomoniasis.

This is done in a lab, using an enzyme called DNA polymerase. It is called chain reaction because the result of one cycle is used immediately for the next cycle. This allows exponential growth to happen. \n\nPCR has many uses in a biological or biochemical setting. Because DNA is unique for every living thing, experimenters can often extract only small amounts of the DNA they are interested in from a specimen. These amounts are usually too little to be useful, and so a scientist will use PCR to make enough copies to start experimenting with. For this reason, it is one of the most common techniques used in genetics labs around the world, making it useful in experiments on many things, including gene therapy, infectious diseases, and even forensics.\n\nThis process was developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis. He was not the first person to develop the PCR process, but he was the first to make the process usable. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith for their work in the PCR process.\n\nThe method consists of repeated heating and cooling, causing \"melting\" (separation of the two strands) and replication of the original DNA, also called a template. Short DNA fragments consisting of DNA sequences complementary to the ends of the template, called primers, and a DNA polymerase are key materials for selective and repetitive steps.\n\nThe technique proceeds in three steps:\n\n\nAfter the first cycle, there are 4 DNA strands. The process repeats with the 4 DNA strands, which will go on to make 8 strands, then repeat itself again to make 16 strands. In this way, PCR doubles the amount of DNA in a sample after each cycle, making it possible to obtain millions of copies of a DNA strand overnight.\n", "id": "301808", "title": "Polymerase chain reaction"}

The small black snakes appear at the church of \"Panagia of Langouvarda\" on the site of a monastery, established as a nunnery and dedicated to \"Our Lady of Langouvarda\". \n\nThe myth about these snakes is attached to the year the monastery was attacked by pirates in 1705. The nuns prayed fervently to the Virgin Mary for protection and were then transformed into the snakes to avoid being taken as prisoners.\n\nThe snakes have a small cross on their head and their tongues are also in the shape of a cross. They are known to belong to the \"Telescopus fallax\" species, also known as the \"European Cat Snake\", and they appear in and around the courtyard of the church, on the walls and on the bell tower. The snakes show no fear while the services are held and are harmless during the festivities. As soon as the Liturgy concludes on the 15th of August, they become hostile and aggressive and disappear back into the wilderness of the area. The snakes cannot be found until the following year.\n\nThe people of the villages consider them to be holy, collecting them and setting them on the silver icon of the Virgin of the Snakes (\"Panagia Fidoussa\"). It has been recorded by the locals that during World War II and the year of the island's destructive 1953 earthquake in August, the snakes failed to appear. The locals now use this as a sign that if the snakes do not show just before the 15th of August that something bad is imminent.\n\nAlso on the island of Kefalonia at a different church on May of each year, women of the island pick lilies and place them on the icon of the Virgin Mary. Once a flower is cut and its stem is completely dry it can not bud again, but these dried lilies, on the 15th of August fully blossom again, they don't begin the blossoming on the previous days, but they begin and reach the full blossom on the 15th. \n\n", "id": "301847", "title": "Holy Snakes"}

It is about the experience in everyday life where people control the way that they appear to others. People do this by selecting certain gestures, speech patterns, feminine or masculine expressions, as well as certain expressions of class and cultural interest. This so that people can give a particular image to others about who they want to be and how they want to be seen.\n\nWhen gesturing a person might use reserved and minimal movements in a professional setting, whilst they may smile widely and wave about when with friends. A person might also change their speech pattern in a professional setting in order to sound more educated or refined, and may speak more casually or use swear words when in a casual setting. \n\nMales and females also often control how they are perceived in terms of masculinity or femininity. Boys and men might sometimes make their voices sound deeper or speak in short sentences to reflect an old stereotype that males are unfeeling and unconcerned with self-expression. Females on the other hand might feel the need to speak in line with the speech patterns of their peers, and this may include tacking on culturally specific phrases like \"or whatever\" and \"that's hot/cute\" to indicate they identify with the female gender and traditional interests.

It was led by the Boxers, a group of Chinese citizens who disliked the vast amount of foreign influence that existed in China.\n\nIt happened during a time when many foreign countries were dominating China. These countries were Japan, Britain, Germany, and Russia. China had lost many battles to these countries and were being humiliated by them.\n\nThe Boxers were Chinese citizens who were angry about the growing power of foreigners in China, who wanted to fight and drive out all foreigners and even some Chinese people. The Boxers got a lot of people to help them and drove their fight to Peking (Beijing).\n\nJapan, Russia, Britain, France, the United States, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy made an alliance to keep the Boxers out of their part of the city. While they did that, the Empress Dowager Cixi declared war on all of them and sent the Chinese Army to help the Boxers. They fought for 55 days before the foreign reinforcements got through and defeated the Chinese. Afterwards there was a celebration, and foreign soldiers ran around stealing from the people and raping Chinese women. Their commander heard about it and was angry, but they kept doing it anyway.\n\nThe foreigners were very angry with the Chinese. They said that China had to pay them even more money and give them more land. They also said China had to execute every Boxer. China had to agree, and the foreigners got what they wanted. A few years later in 1911, the Qing Empire collapsed and China had a new government, but the foreigners still influenced China, especially Japan.\n\n", "id": "301926", "title": "Boxer Rebellion"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=301955", "text": "List of characters in the Camp Half-Blood series\n\nThis is a list of characters in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus series.\n\nPerseus \"Percy\" Jackson is a son of Poseidon and is the protagonist and narrator of the series. Being a child of one of the \"Big Three\" (Zeus, Hades, Poseidon), Percy is the hero referred to within the prophecy of the Oracle, which foretells that the next half-blood child of the \"Big Three\" to reach the age of sixteen would have to make a decision that would mean the destruction or saving of Olympus. Percy also peed on him self when he knew that he had a half brother cyclops named Tyson.\n\nAnnabeth Chase is a daughter of Athena. So, she is very intelligent. She is fascinated with architecture. In battle, she is a skilled enough fighter to fight along with Percy. She is very good in strategy. She ran away from home when she was seven and met Luke and Thalia, who took her with them to get to Camp Half-Blood. She aids Percy in four of his five quests and is captured in one of them.\nPercy's girlfriend.\n\nGrover Underwood is a satyr and Percy Jackson's best friend. He has found the four most powerful demigods of the century: Percy Jackson (son of Poseidon), Thalia Grace (daughter of Zeus), and Nico and Bianca di Angelo (children of Hades). Before his death, Pan (the god of nature) says Grover is the bravest satyr ever to be. He names Grover as his successor to carry on his word to protect the wilderness. The Council of Cloven Elders is angered by this choice. He is the boyfriend of the tree nymph Juniper. But in \"The Last Olympian\" he is chosen as a replacement for Leneus (another Satyr who died in battle) on The Council of Cloven Elders after showing bravery on the battlefield.\n\nTyson is a Cyclops, the son of Poseidon and his mother is unknown. Technically he is not a demigod, but at camp he lives in Percy's cabin, and is considered to be Percy's brother. He first appears in \"The Sea of Monsters\" as a homeless boy. He is afraid of Grover while Grover is also afraid of him. Also in \"The Sea of Monsters\" he was Percy's best friend and was always picked on. At the end of the book, he gets to go to work for his father, Poseidon, in the Underwater Armory.\n\nNico di Angelo is a son of Hades, Bianca's younger brother and Hazel Levesque half-brother and Percy Jackson and Thalia and Jason Grace's cousin. At first Percy assumed Hades broke the oath not to have children after World War II, but Nico and his sister Bianca had been placed in the Lotus Casino, where 'time stands still' since before the oath was made. At the time, he took great interest in a game called Mythomagic. Nico has the power to raise skeletal warriors, shadow travel, and create great fissures in the ground that swallow up anyone or anything unfortunate enough to be standing on it at the time. For a time, he was Percy's enemy, blaming him for the fact that he had failed to protect Bianca as he had promised, but they became friends eventually. Nico tried multiple times to contact his sister and had difficulty contacting her, even using his dreams. Nico refused to stay at Camp Half-Blood in the fourth book after noting that he was not welcomed at Camp Half-Blood; he compares this to the fact that his father is not welcomed at Olympus. Several months later, he informed Percy of a plan that could lead to defeating Kronos. In the final book, he convinced Percy to bathe in the River Styx, making him invincible barring the small of his back. In the end of the final book Percy makes all the gods and goddess to 'claim' all their children and make sure they have cabin's in Camp Half-blood. Nico goes back to the camp and makes a cabin for himself and all the other minor gods and goddess.\n\nThalia Grace is a daughter of Zeus. She is Jason's older sister and the cousin of Percy Jackson and Hazel Levesque and Bianca and Nico di Angelo. Grover Underwood was assigned to watch over her when she ran away from home at ten years old. On her journey, she met Luke Castellan and Annabeth Chase. They also had brief encounters with the Hunters of Artemis and she was enticed to join by Zoë Nightshade. When she was twelve, they were all soon attacked by a herd of monsters and caught by a Cyclops in New York. She was captured, but thanks to Annabeth, was freed. They meet the satyr Grover Underwood on the way. They escaped, but found that the monsters they had briefly escaped caught up to them. As they reached Half-Blood Hill, Thalia sent Luke, Grover, and Annabeth over the boundary line while she faced the monsters. She sacrificed her life for her friends, and her father, Zeus, took pity on her and transformed her to a pine tree. She is later brought back to life by the Golden Fleece and joins the quest in the third book where she ultimately joins the Hunters, taking the place of Zoë Nightshade. She has a younger brother, Jason Grace who was separated from her when she was 10. This became the reason she ran away from home.She wears a lot of dark makeup and punk style clothing. She has electric blue eyes and spiky black hair. She is so like Percy that according to Annabeth, they either could be best friends... or worst enemies.\n\nLuke Castellan is one of Hermes's children and a major antagonist of the series. Though initially the counselor of Cabin 11 and an ally to Percy, he revealed his true nature as a high-ranking member of Kronos's army by attempting to kill Percy at the end of \"The Lightning Thief\", and on several occasions afterward. He is shown to harbor a great bitterness towards the gods (particularly his father, Hermes) for what he regards as abandonment. His mother had been driven crazy upon attempting to become the Oracle, leading to a stressful childhood. After reforming, Kronos does not need Luke's assistance. However, in his duel with Percy on Mount Olympus, striking Annabeth reminds him of his promise to protect her. This temporarily frees him from Kronos's influence. Percy makes his choice to give Luke Annabeth's knife, and Luke, cursed by the broken promise, kills himself by stabbing his own Achilles heel to destroy Kronos. This fulfills the prophecy, with Luke being the foretold hero. In the film, Luke is portrayed by Jake Abel.\nPercy refers to Luke as a hero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the known characters of Greek Mythology have made an appearance in this series:\n\n\n\n\nPercy is one of the few demigods whose last name does not reflect his godly parent, though his first name does. Many of the campers at Camp Half-Blood have last names that consist of a traditional role or trait of their parent. Other last names are often commonplace: Rodriguez, Nakamura.\n", "id": "301955", "title": "List of characters in the Camp Half-Blood series"}

Skinner. \n\nOperant conditioning is different from Pavlov's classical conditioning. Operant conditioning deals with the voluntary modification of behaviour; classical conditioning with training a reflex.\n\nOperant conditioning, sometimes called \"instrumental learning\", was first studied by Edward L. Thorndike (1874–1949). He observed the behavior of cats trying to escape from home-made puzzle boxes. When first put in the boxes, cats took a long time to escape. With experience, successful responses occurred more frequently, enabling the cats to escape in less time. In his law of effect, Thorndike theorized that behaviours followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated. In short, some consequences \"strengthened\" behavior and some consequences \"weakened\" behavior. Thorndike produced the first known learning curves by this procedure. \n\nB.F. Skinner (1904–1990) worked out a more detailed analysis of operant conditioning. Skinner invented the \"operant conditioning chamber\" which let him measure rate of response as a key dependent variable.

He was attempting the rescue by ship of a friend and his family from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The eruption had just destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.\n\nThe \"Naturalis Historia\" is one of the largest works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day. It claims to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge, based on the best authorities available to Pliny. He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work. It includes the fields of botany, zoology, astronomy, geology and mineralogy as well as the exploitation of those resources. It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time. \n\nSome technical advances he discusses are the only sources for those inventions, such as hushing in mining technology or the use of water mills for crushing or grinding corn. Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by archaeology. It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time, and is a reference work for the history of art.\n\nThe work became a model for all later encyclopedias in the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents. The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus, son of Pliny's close friend, the emperor Vespasian, in the first year of Titus' reign. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published, lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.\n\nThe \"Natural History\" consists of 37 books.

The phrase \"Manifest Destiny\" was created in 1845 by a newspaper writer named John L. O'Sullivan. Quickly, the idea became very popular. \n\nThe idea of Manifest Destiny told Americans that they had a mission a special job given only to Americans. This mission was to make the United States bigger so the \"borders of freedom\" could be open to even more people. Only they could make sure that people living in un-free countries across the world could learn how to govern themselves and live freely in America.\n\nIn 1845, James K. Polk was elected President. Polk believed very strongly in the idea of Manifest Destiny. During his Presidency, the United States grew by a million square miles. \n\nEver since he was running for President, Polk had talked about wanting the area that is now around Texas. At that time, Mexico controlled that land.\n\nIn June 1845, the United States decided to add Texas to the United States. President Polk sent the United States military to take over the area. The two sides fought for two years. Finally, Mexico surrendered. On February 2, 1848, it signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war. It also gave the United States all of the land above the Rio Grande. This meant the United States had gained all of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico; parts of Utah, Nevada, and Colorado; and northern California.\n\nA belief in Manifest Destiny helped convince Americans to support the war. It told them it was all right to fight, kill, and take land from Mexicans or other non-Americans. This was all right because they were only doing what God wanted. They were doing what they were destined to do. \n\nThe belief in Manifest Destiny was also important in encouraging people to go to other parts of the west, like Oregon and southern California.\n\nOf course, there were many other reasons, besides Manifest Destiny, that people wanted the United States to grow. More and more people were coming to America, especially to the cities, which were getting crowded. People wanted land of their own, instead of having to work for other people. The more land a person had, the more money they could make. If a person had their own land, they were working for themselves, and they were free. \n\nIf was a mixture of all these things, and many more, along with Manifest Destiny that caused the United States to grow this quickly in just 40 years:\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<BR>\n\nThe United States was very determined to take control of all of North America. Unfortunately, the parts of North America they wanted were not empty. They were places that Native Americans had always lived.\n\nThe United States government wanted these tribes to move outside the United States, to what is now Oklahoma. The government was able to convince some of these Native American tribes to sign treaties saying they would leave their lands. \n\nWhen some tribes refused to leave their lands, the United States government committed an ethnic cleansing against them. In an ethnic cleansing, ethnic or religious groups are forced to leave an area by a more powerful ethnic group. When the Cherokee Nation refused to leave their homes, United States President Martin van Buren ordered the military to make them leave.\n\nAbout 15,000 Cherokee were forced to walk to Oklahoma and Arkansas. Most historians think that about 4,000 of them died on the way. This was one out of every four people in the Cherokee population. Because so many people died, this forced migration is now called the Trail of Tears, and it is considered an ethnic cleansing.\n", "id": "302162", "title": "Manifest Destiny"}

It is believed he was killed because his ideas were not acceptable to various religious groups in Pakistan. Taseer had not supported the Pakistan's blasphemy laws which make an insult against Islam punishable by death.

Local residents asked the District government for help in the 1980s, because the current buildings were falling apart and many stores were empty. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development decided in 2005 that the District government could not use federal money to buy Skyland because of past mistakes.\n\nThe District is working with the Rappaport Cos. and the William S. Smith Cos. on a new plan for Skyland. They want to build of retail space. They hope that the new buildings will be filled with high-quality, national stores and locally-owned shops and restaurants. Torti Gallas & Partners are architects who are drawing the new plans. The new buildings will cost $260 million. On May 25, 2011, DC Mayor Vincent Gray told Wal-Mart officials that he would not allow them to build four other new stores in the District of Columbia unless Wal-Mart also opened a store in Skyland. However, Safeway holds the exclusive right to sell groceries in the development, which may block a Wal-Mart at Skyland.\n\nThe project will also include 420 to 470 units of housing. About 80 percent of the housing units will be owned by the people who live there and 20 percent will be rented. \n\nPeople are fighting the plan in court. The land owners do not want to sell their land to Rappaport and Smith.

It includes the area between K Street to the south, Rock Creek Park to the west and north, and New Hampshire Avenue and 21st Street to the east. The West End is so named because it was the westernmost part of the original Pierre L'Enfant plan for the city of Washington, before the annexation of Georgetown. It is home to the embassies of Qatar and Spain, as well as to the Egyptian Defense Office. The George Washington University and The George Washington University Medical Center are on the edge of the West End, at Washington Circle.\n\nIn the past, the West End had many vacant lots and old buildings. In 1972, the District's Office of Planning and Management wrote an urban renewal plan \"to bring life to a declining part of the city.\" Titled \"New Town for the West End,\" the aerial photograph on the cover of the study showed the area that was planned to become a \"new intown community.\" Today, the Ritz-Carlton Hotel and Residences, the Park Hyatt and Fairmont hotels, numerous luxury condominiums, and several of the city's best restaurants are in the West End. However, the Columbia Hospital for Women closed and became apartments.\n\nThe neighborhood is close to Georgetown, Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, the downtown business district, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Kennedy Center, and the Watergate.\n\nHistorically, West End was a predominantly African-American community with brick Victorian rowhouses and warehouses. From 1880 until May 2002, the Columbia Hospital for Women provided care for women having babies. The hospital was important because other hospitals in the area (such as Arlington Hospital) refused to help African-American women having babies. The hospital closed and the building became apartments.\n\nMany new buildings are coming to West End, with hundreds of new luxury condominiums either under construction or in the planning phase.\n\nIn 2007, controversy began over the last remaining \"underdeveloped\" parcel of land, known as Square 37. Bordered by 23rd Street, 24th Street, L Street, and an alleyway, this is unusual because its short buildings from the 1800s to the 1960s, are different from the many new, tall buildings on the neighboring blocks. Square 37 was home to the Tiverton, the last remaining rent-controlled apartment building in the West End. The Tiverton tenants gained local media attention for successfully stopping people who wanted to build new buildings on Square 37.\n\nThe DC Council passed controversial emergency legislation on July 10, 2007 to sell the West End public library branch, the DC Special Operations Police Station (both on Square 37), and a firehouse (on neighboring Square 50) to the developer called Eastbanc.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools operates Francis-Stevens Educational Center at 2425 N Street.\n\nDistrict of Columbia Public Library operates the West End Neighborhood Library.\n\n", "id": "302278", "title": "West End, Washington, D.C."}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302296", "text": "Capitol Hill\n\nCapitol Hill is the largest historic residential neighborhood in Washington D.C.. The neighborhood covers an area east of the United States Capitol along wide avenues. It is one of the oldest residential communities in Washington. Its two square miles house 35,000 people, so it isone of the most densely populated neighborhood. The phrase \"Capitol Hill\" can sometime mean the United States Congress instead of the neighborhood.\n\nCapitol Hill is also a hill as well as a neighborhood. The hill rises in the center of the District of Columbia and extends eastward. Pierre L'Enfant, as he began to develop his plan for the new Federal City in 1791, chose to locate the \"Congress House\" on the crest of the hill, facing the city, a site that L'Enfant characterized as a \"pedestal waiting for a monument.\"\n\nA large portion of the neighborhood is now designated as the Capitol Hill historic district. The name \"Capitol Hill\" is often used to refer to both the historic district and to the larger neighborhood around it. To the east of Capitol Hill lies the Anacostia River, to the north is the H Street corridor, to the south are the Southeast/Southwest Freeway and the Washington Navy Yard, and to the west are the National Mall and the city's central business district.\n\nL'Enfant referred to the hill chosen as the site of the future Congress House as \"Jenkins Hill\" or \"Jenkins Heights.\" However, the tract of land had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as \"New Troy.\" Some people have said that a man named Jenkins had once pastured some livestock at the site of the Capitol (and thus his name was associated with the site), artist John Trumbull, who would paint several murals inside the Capitol's rotunda, reported in 1791 that the site was covered with a thick wood, making it an unlikely place for livestock to graze. Noone knows who Jenkins was and how his name became associated with the hill, as reported by L'Enfant.\n\nThe neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations, the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard. It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer. The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress. In the early years of the Republic, few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city. Instead, most preferred to live in boarding houses within walking distance of the Capitol.\n\nIn 1799 the Washington Navy Yard was established on the banks of the Anacostia River, and provided jobs to craftsmen who built and repaired ships. Many of the craftsmen who were employed both at the Navy Yard and in the construction of the Capitol chose to live within walking distance, to the east of the Capitol and the north of the Navy Yard. They became the original residential population of the neighborhood. In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson selected the location of the Marine Barracks, which had to be within marching distance of both the Capitol and the White House, not far from the Washington Navy Yard. By 1810, shops, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and churches were flourishing in the area.\n\nThe Civil War resulted in more building in the Capitol Hill area, including new hospitals. Building new houses continued in the 1870s and 1880s. The neighborhood began to divide along racial and economic class lines.\n\nElectricity, piped water, and plumbing were introduced in the 1890s, and were first available in the downtown areas of the District of Columbia, including Capitol Hill. There was a real estate development boom between 1890 and 1910 as the Capitol Hill area became one of the first neighborhoods having these modern conveniences.\n\nIn 1976, the National Park Service added the Capitol Hill Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places. It is one of the largest historic districts in the United States. The boundaries of the historic district are irregular, extending southward from F Street NE, as far east as 14th Street, as far west as South Capitol Street, and with a southern limit marked chiefly by Virginia Avenue but including some territory as far south as M Street SE. It includes buildings from the Federal period (1800 to 1820) through 1919, but most of the buildings are late Victorian.\n\nCapitol Hill has remained a fairly stable middle-class neighborhood throughout its existence. It suffered a period of economic decline and rising crime in the mid-20th century but gradually recovered. During the so-called \"Crack Epidemic\" of the 1980s, its fringes were often affected. More recently, the neighborhood has undergone intense gentrification.\n\nCapitol Hill's landmarks include not only the United States Capitol, but also the Senate and House office buildings, the Supreme Court building, the Library of Congress, the Marine Barracks, the Washington Navy Yard, and Congressional Cemetery.\n\nIt is, however, largely a residential neighborhood composed predominantly of rowhouses of different stylistic varieties and periods. Side by side exist early 19th century manor houses, Federal townhouses, small frame dwellings, ornate Italianate bracketed houses and the late 19th century press brick rowhouses with their often whimsical decorative elements combining Richardsonian Romanesque, Queen Anne, and Eastlakian motifs.\n\nThe main shopping corridor of Capitol Hill is Pennsylvania Avenue. It has shops, restaurants and bars. Eastern Market is an 1873 public market on 7th Street SE, where vendors sell fresh meat and produce in indoor stalls and at outdoor farmers' stands. It is also the site of an outdoor flea market every weekend. After a major fire gutted the main market building on April 30, 2007, it underwent restoration and reopened on June 26, 2009. \n\nBarracks Row (8th Street SE), so called because of its proximity to the U.S. Marine Barracks, is one of the city's oldest commercial corridors. It dates to the late 18th century and has recently been revitalized.\n\nMore recently, the Old Naval Hospital has been converted into Hill Center, a new community center. It is at the corner of 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE. The rehabilitation of the Old Naval Hospital combines the restoration of a historically significant landmark with the cutting edge technologies of modern “green” architecture. Hill Center is a vibrant new home for cultural, educational and civic life on Capitol Hill.\n\nRecent estimates in Capitol Hill newspapers suggest as many as a third of all Members of Congress live on Capitol Hill while in Washington.\n\nFamous people who were born in the Capitol Hill neighborhood include John Philip Sousa (whose birthplace, on G St., is still standing) and J. Edgar Hoover. Frederick Douglass's former house can be found in the 300 block of A Street Northeast. (In the 1970s the Douglass house was later used as an African Art Museum by Warren M. Robbins). \nCapitol Hill has several local community newspapers, such as the \"Hill Rag\". The \"Voice of the Hill\" closed in May 2010.\n\n", "id": "302296", "title": "Capitol Hill"}
