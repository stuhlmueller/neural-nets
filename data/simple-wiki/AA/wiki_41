It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is a giant circular tunnel built underground. The tunnel is 17 miles (27 kilometers) long, and between 50 and 175 meters below the ground. It lies beneath the border of Switzerland and France. 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 different countries worked together in the making of this project, and it cost 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) to build. It is now the largest and most complicated experimental research facility in the world. \n\nAs its name states, the research at the LHC involves the collision of hadrons. A hadron is a particle which consists of a number of quarks held together by the subatomic strong force. Protons and neutrons are examples of a hadron. The LHC primarily uses the collision of protons in its experiments. Protons are parts of atoms with a positive charge. The LHC accelerates these protons through the tunnel until they reach nearly the speed of light. Different protons are directed through the tunnel in opposite directions. When they collide, they create conditions similar to the early universe. \n\nThe LHC attempts to study elementary particles and the ways they interact. It has already taught us a lot about quantum physics, and researchers are hoping to learn a lot more about the structure of space and time. The observations researchers are able to make can help us learn what the universe might have been like within milliseconds after the big bang.\n\nThe LHC ionizes Hydrogen atoms in order to get the protons they use. A Hydrogen atom consists of only one proton and one electron. When they ionize the atoms, they are removing the one electron to give it a net positive charge. The Hydrogen protons are then directed through the circle by electromagnets. In order for the magnets to be strong enough, it must be very cold. The inside of the tunnel is cooled by liquid helium. They keep the temperature at just above absolute zero. The protons hit one another at close to the speed of light and convert to energy using E=mc. It then reverses and creates mass. At the collision site, there are four layers of detectors. The explosion passes through each layer and each detector records a different stage of the reaction.\n\nWhen the particles hit each other, their energy is converted into many different particles, and sensitive detectors keep track of the pieces that are created. By looking carefully at the detector data, scientists can study what the particles are made of and how the particles interact. This is the only way to see some particles because very high energy is needed to create them. The LHC's particle collisions have the energy needed.\n\nThe LHC has three main parts to it. There is the particle accelerator, the four detectors, and the Grid. The accelerator creates the collision, but the results cannot be directly observed. The detectors turn it into useable data. This data is then sent to the Grid. The Grid is what the researchers use to interpret the data. It is a network of computers. There are 170 locations in 36 different countries which are filled with regular desktop computers. All of these computers are connected, and together they act as a supercomputer. The LHC's Grid is considered the most powerful supercomputer ever built. The computers share processing power and data storage space. \n\nThe Grid is very powerful, but it is only able to take in about one percent of the data it receives from the detectors. Its limitations have motivated attempts at creating quantum computers, which could use what the LHC has taught us about quantum mechanics in order to make faster computers.\n\nScientists used the LHC to find the Higgs boson, the last particle predicted to exist by the Standard Model. \n\nSome people think the LHC could create a black hole, which would be very dangerous. There are two reasons not to be worried. The first is that the LHC won't do anything that the cosmic rays that hit the Earth every day don't do, and these rays do not create black holes. The second reason is that even if the LHC did make black holes, they would be very tiny. The smaller a black hole is, the shorter its life. Very tiny black holes would die and turn into energy before they could hurt people.\n\nThe LHC was first used on September 10, 2008, but it did not work because a cooling system broke, which was important for the magnets that help to move the charged particles. This caused part of the facility to collapse. The winter shutdown meant that it was not used again until November 2009. While it was being repaired, scientists used the Tevatron to try and find the Higgs Boson. When the LHC was restarted in November 2009, it set a new speed record by accelerating protons to 1.18 TeV (teraelectronvolt, or trillion electronvolt). On March 30 2010, the LHC created a collison at 3.5 TeV.\n\n", "id": "129317", "title": "Large Hadron Collider"}

It does this by watching of the hard disks to try and see when a failure might happen and where.\n\nHard drive failures fall into two categories:\n\nPredictable failures can be detected by certain monitoring devices. This is like a thermometer in a vehicle that can alert the driver to do something before serious damage occurs, for example because the engine is too hot.\n\nAbout 60% of all drive failures are caused by failing mechanics. Most mechanical failures result from gradual wear. An eventual failure may be catastrophic. Before complete failure occurs, there are usually certain signs that failure is imminent. These may include increased heat output, a more noisy drive, problems with reading or writing data and a big increase in the number of damaged disk sectors.\n\nThe purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to warn a user or system administrator that a drive is about to fail. At the time of the warning, there is usually still time to do certain things to prevent data loss, for example copying the data to a different drive. Approximately 30% of failures can be predicted by S.M.A.R.T. Work at Google on over 100,000 drives has shown little overall predictive value of S.M.A.R.T. status as a whole. The study suggests that certain sub-categories of information which some S.M.A.R.T. implementations track \"do\" correlate with actual failure rates. In the 60 days after the first scan error on a drive, the drive is 39 times more likely to fail on average than it would have been had no such error occurred. Also, first errors in reallocations, offline reallocations and probational counts are strongly correlated to higher probabilities of failure.\n\nPCTechGuide's page on S.M.A.R.T. commented in 2003 that the technology had gone through three phases: \n\nThe industry's first hard disk monitoring technology was introduced by IBM in 1992 in their IBM 9337 Disk Arrays for AS/400 servers using IBM 0662 SCSI-2 disk drives. Later it was named Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) technology. It was measuring several key device health parameters and evaluating them within the drive firmware. Communications between the physical unit and the monitoring software were limited to a binary result – namely, either \"device is OK\" or \"drive is likely to fail soon\".\n\nLater, another variant, which was named IntelliSafe, was created by computer manufacturer Compaq and disk drive manufacturers Seagate, Quantum, and Conner. The disk drives would measure the disk’s \"health parameters\", and the values would be transferred to the operating system and user-space monitoring software. Each disk drive vendor was free to decide which parameters were to be included for monitoring, and what their thresholds should be. The unification was at the protocol level with the host.\n\nCompaq submitted their implementation to Small Form Committee for standardization in early 1995. It was supported by IBM, by Compaq's development partners Seagate, Quantum, and Conner, and by Western Digital, who did not have a failure prediction system at the time. The Committee chose IntelliSafe's approach, as it provided more flexibility. The resulting jointly developed standard was named S.M.A.R.T.\n\nThe technical documentation for SMART is in the AT Attachment (ATA) standard.\n\nThe most basic information that SMART provides is the SMART status. It provides only two values: \"threshold not exceeded\" and \"threshold exceeded\". Often these are represented as \"drive OK\" or \"drive fail\" respectively. A \"threshold exceeded\" value is intended to indicate that there is a relatively high probability that the drive will not be able to honour its specification in the future – that is, the drive is \"about to fail\". The predicted failure may be catastrophic or may be something as subtle as the inability to write to certain sectors, or perhaps slower performance than the manufacturer's declared minimum.\n\nThe SMART status does not necessarily indicate the drive's past or present reliability. If a drive has already failed catastrophically, the SMART status may be inaccessible. Alternatively, if a drive has experienced problems in the past, but the sensors no longer detect such problems, the SMART status may, depending on the manufacturer's programming, suggest that the drive is now sound.\n\nThe inability to \"read\" some sectors is not always an indication that a drive is about to fail. One way that unreadable sectors may be created, even when the drive is functioning within specification, is through a sudden power failure while the drive is writing. In order to prevent this problem, modern hard drives will always finish writing at least the current sector immediately after the power fails (typically using rotational energy from the disk). Also, even if the physical disk is damaged at one location, such that a certain sector is unreadable, the disk may be able to use spare space to replace the bad area, so that the sector can be overwritten.\n\nMore detail on the health of the drive may be obtained by examining the SMART Attributes. SMART Attributes were included in some drafts of the ATA standard, but were removed before the standard became final. The meaning and interpretation of the attributes varies between manufacturers, and are sometimes considered a trade secret for one manufacturer or another. Attributes are further discussed below.\n\nDrives with SMART may optionally support a number of 'logs'. The \"error log\" records information about the most recent errors that the drive has reported back to the host computer. Examining this log may help one to determine whether computer problems are disk-related or caused by something else.\n\nA drive supporting SMART may optionally support a number of self-test or maintenance routines, and the results of the tests are kept in the \"self-test log\". The self-test routines may be used to detect any unreadable sectors on the disk, so that they may be restored from back-up sources (for example, from other disks in a RAID). This helps to reduce the risk of incurring permanent loss of data.\n\nMany motherboards will display a warning message when a disk drive is approaching failure. Although an industry standard among most major hard drive manufacturers, there are some remaining issues and much proprietary \"secret knowledge\" held by individual manufacturers as to their specific approach.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the term \"S.M.A.R.T.\" refers only to a signalling method between internal disk drive electromechanical sensors and the host computer. Hence, a drive may be claimed by its manufacturers to include S.M.A.R.T. support even if it does not include, say, a temperature sensor, which the customer might reasonably expect to be present. Moreover, in the most extreme case, a disk manufacturer could, in theory, produce a drive which includes a sensor for just \"one\" physical attribute, and then legally advertise the product as \"S.M.A.R.T. compatible\".\n\nDepending on the type of interface being used, some S.M.A.R.T.-enabled motherboards and related software may not communicate with certain S.M.A.R.T.-capable drives. For example, few external drives connected via USB and Firewire correctly send S.M.A.R.T. data over those interfaces. With so many ways to connect a hard drive (SCSI, Fibre Channel, ATA, SATA, SAS, SSA, and so on), it is difficult to predict whether S.M.A.R.T. reports will function correctly in a given system.\n\nEven on hard drives and interfaces that support it, S.M.A.R.T. information may not be reported correctly to the computer's operating system. Some disk controllers can duplicate all write operations on a secondary \"back-up\" drive in real time. This feature is known as \"RAID mirroring\". However, many programs which are designed to analyze changes in drive behaviour and relay S.M.A.R.T. alerts to the operator do not function properly when a computer system is configured for RAID support. Generally this is because, under normal RAID operational conditions, the computer is not permitted by the RAID subsystem to 'see' (or directly access) individual physical drives, but may access only logical volumes instead.\n\nOn the Windows platform, many programs designed to monitor and report S.M.A.R.T. information will function only under an administrator account. At present, S.M.A.R.T. is implemented individually by manufacturers, and while some aspects are standardized for compatibility, others are not.\n\nEach drive manufacturer defines a set of attributes, and sets threshold values beyond which attributes should not pass under normal operation. Each attribute has a \"raw value\", whose meaning is entirely up to the drive manufacturer (but often corresponds to counts or a physical unit, such degrees Celsius or seconds), and a normalized value, which ranges from 1 to 253 (with 1 representing the worst case and 253 representing the best). Depending on the manufacturer, a value of 100 or 200 will often be chosen as the \"normal\" value.\n\nManufacturers that have supported at least one S.M.A.R.T. attribute in various products include: Samsung, Seagate, IBM (Hitachi), Fujitsu, Maxtor, Toshiba, Western Digital and ExcelStor Technology.\n\nThreshold Exceeds Condition (TEC) is a supposed date when a critical drive statistic attribute will reach its threshold value. When Drive Health software reports a \"Nearest T.E.C.\", it should be regarded as a \"Failure date\".\n\nPrognosis of this date is based on the factor \"Speed of attribute change\"; how many points each month the value is decreasing/increasing. This factor is calculated automatically at any change of S.M.A.R.T. attributes for each attribute individually. Note that TEC dates are not guarantees; hard drives can and will either last much longer or fail much sooner than the date given by a TEC.\n\n", "id": "129325", "title": "Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology"}

The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly.\n\nFor efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position, rather than in the order received. The queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests, and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read/write requests and the changing position of the head. The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself, but the host computer simply makes requests as needed, leaving the controller to handle the details.\n\nThis queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as \"elevator seeking\", as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimise travel illustrates the idea well.\n\nIf the buttons for floors 5, 2, and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1, an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested. A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2, 4, and 5, without unnecessary travel. Non-queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received, like an old elevator; queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order. This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user, but really comes into its own in a system with many users, making requests all over the disk surface.\n", "id": "129377", "title": "Tagged Command Queuing"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129378", "text": "Native Command Queuing\n\nNative Command Queuing (NCQ) is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks on computers. It can do this under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which it executes the read and write requests it received. This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement and resulting in better performance (and slightly decreased wear of the drive) for workloads where multiple read/write requests are outstanding at the same time. This situation most often occurs in server-type applications. However, the current (as of 2004) technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications, like games and sequential reads and writes, because of the added latency induced by NCQ logic.\n\nNative Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATA's version of Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ). ATA's attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system. The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ. \n\nNCQ differs from PATA TCQ in that the command re-ordering is performed by the drive rather than the operating system, and each command is equal in importance. This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics, and is able to take rotational position into account. NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 in-flight commands (31 in practice), while SCSI TCQ has a maximum queue length of 2 in-flight commands.\n\nFor NCQ to be enabled, it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself. The appropriate device driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter. Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI), which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ. In fact, newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively. Unfortunately, Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor-specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter. Windows Vista corrects this situation by including a generic AHCI driver.\n\n\n", "id": "129378", "title": "Native Command Queuing"}

They vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures to huge polyglot codices containing both the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and the New Testament, as well as other works.\n\nThe Aleppo Codex (\"c.\" 920 AD) and Leningrad Codex (\"c.\" 1008 AD) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the Tanakh. The 1947 find at Qumran of the Dead Sea scrolls pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the Old Testament were in Greek in manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the Book of Esther; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two scrolls of the Book of Isaiah, one complete (1QIs), and one around 75% complete (1QIs). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BC to 70 AD.\n\nAncient Jewish scribes developed many practices to protect copies of their scriptures from error.\n\nParts of the New Testament have been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work. There are over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages, such as Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic and Armenian. \n\nThe dates of these manuscripts range from about 125 AD (the Ryland manuscript, P; containing fragments of the oldest copy of John) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century. Most of these manuscripts date after the 10th century. Although there are more manuscripts that preserve the New Testament than there are for any other ancient writing, the text preserved in these later, numerous manuscripts may not be the same as the text as it existed in antiquity. \n\nTextual scholar Bart Ehrman wrote: \n\nIn reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, Bruce M.

He was born to a Turkish family in Central Asia. He was sold as a slave in his childhood. But this went well because he was bought up by a Qazi of Nishapur. He was treated like one of the sons of this Qazi. But after a few years, his master died and the Sultan Mohammad Ghori bought him. He soon became one of the favourites of Sultan Mohammad. When Mohammad died in 1206, he became the Sultan in India. He spent part of his time at Delhi, but was very fond of the city of Lahore, in Punjab (now in Pakistan) and did much to beautify it. He died in 1210 due to a fall from a horse whilst playing Polo and was buried at Lahore. Qutubuddin Aibak, a ruler of medieval India, was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate and also the founder of the Slave dynasty. He was a Turkish of the Aybak tribe and was the sultan for only four years, 1206-1210. He was captured in his childhood and sold as a slave to the chief Qazi of Nishapur, a town situated in the northeastern Iran. He was very well treated by the Qazi and imparted good education, including training in archery and horsemanship in his childhood. However when the master died, his jealous sons sold Qutubuddin Aibak to a slave merchant. \n\nHe was finally purchased by the ruler of Ghor in central Afghanistan, Sultan Muhammad Ghori. Qutubuddin Aibak gradually rose to the rank of a Commander and became one of the most trusted slave of Sultan Ghori. The conquests of northern India were executed mainly by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, which helped Ghori to consolidate his position there. Gradually, as Sultan Ghori concentrated on Central Asia after 1192, he was given the independent charge of the conquests in India. Qutb-ud-din Aibak gave large sums of money in charity, thus earning the name LAKH BAKSH or giver of lakhs.\n\nMuhammad Ghori established himself as strong ruler with his empire extending over Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India. Qutubuddin Aibak crowned himself the Sultan of Delhi in 1206, when Muhammad Ghori was killed on the battlefield. After his death, when Aibak came to the throne, he ruled over those places where he was appointed as the local receiver-general of Sultan Ghori. Despite the rebellions by nobles like Taj-ud-din Ildiz and Nasir-ud-din Qubachah, he strengthened the administrative system, which was established by Ghori. \n\nThough Qutb-ud-din Aibak started the construction of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque and the Qutub Minar, which were among the earliest Muslim monuments in Delhi, he could not complete them. These architectures were later completed by his successor Shamsuddin Iltutmish. \n\nIn 1210, Qutb-ud-din Aibak died in an accident while he was playing polo. He fell from a horse and was severely injured. He was buried in Lahore near the Anarkali Bazaar. He was succeeded by Shamsuddin Iltutmish, another slave who rose to the level of a Sultan, thus extending the Slave/Mamluk Dynasty.He wasnt interested in expanding his territory instead wanted to settle problems in his present empire.His one of the favorite ruler was Iltutmish .\n\n", "id": "129562", "title": "Qutb-ud-din Aibak"}

He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines. He was added into the College Football Hall of Fame after he was elected to it in 1967. He and his two brothers are three of the seven players who have had their uniform numbers retired by Michigan Wolverines football. While at college, Wistert helped Michigan win the Big Ten Conference football championship in 1931, 1932, and 1933. He was also Big Ten Most Valuable Player in college baseball. He later played for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball.\n\nWistert graduated from Chicago's Schurz High School in 1929. He attended the University of Michigan where he was an athlete in both football and baseball in 1931, 1932, and 1933.\n\nWistert played for the Michigan Wolverines before his two brothers, Al Wistert and Alvin Wistert, did. All three Wistert brothers wore the number 11 for the Wolverines football team, and all three were members of the College Football All-America team, which is the best players through all of the United States. When interviewed by the \"Detroit News\" in 2004, brother Alvin Wistert said, \"And if I'm not mistaken I think this is unprecedented in the of college football: that three brothers all would go to the same school, all played football. All played tackle, all wore the same number 11, all made All-American. Two of us played on four national championship teams. They all made it into the College Football Hall of Fame.\" \n\nThe Wistert brothers grew up on the northwest side of Chicago and were the sons of a Lithuanian family. Their father was a Spanish-American War veteran, who later died while working for the Chicago Police Department. Brother Alvin Wistert said that their father, \"was born Casmir Vistertus and he Anglicized it when he came to America to Wistert.\" \n\nThe story of the Wistert brothers at Michigan began when Whitey's Carl Schurz High School school-mate John Kowalik was invited to visit the University of Michigan. At the time, Whitey Wistert \"was working in a factory building \"Majestic radios\".\" Kowalik took Whitey with him on his visit Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Alvin Wistert later said, \"that's how it started: the Wisterts of Michigan.\"\n\nAs a football player, Wistert played for National Championship teams that never lost a game in 1932 and 1933 and was a chosen All-American in 1933. The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook, the \"Michiganensian\", had this to say by Grantland Rice: \"Wistert was unanimously selected as the best tackle in the Middle-West this year. He was an important part of Michigan's defensive line play. He was a very good tackler and it was nearly impossible to fool him on trick plays. He was keen, quick, and accurate in finding out how a play would happen.\" Wistert and Chuck Bernard were the leaders of the 1933 offensive line when the team went 7-0-1 with a tie to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.\n\nOne of Wistert's teammates on the 1932 and 1933 Michigan football teams was Gerald Ford who later became the U.S. President. In an interview in the February 1974 copy of \"Michigan Alumnus\", Wistert said about Ford: \"He was a real good competitor—a real bulldog type. Even during a losing year, he was voted team Most Valuable Player by his teammates, because they believed he was someone who could stay and fight even when they lose.\" In 1936, he was a member Michigan football coaching staff of Coach Harry Kipke.\n\nWistert earned varsity letters in baseball three years. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference in 1934. The 1934 \"Michiganensian\" yearbook wrote that the final game of the baseball season was a 4–0 shutout by Wistert against the University of Chicago Maroon. It wrote, \"Wistert, for the Wolves, allowed only five well- hits during the game. Although Whitey Wistert walked four men, he more than off-set this by striking out nine of the Maroons to face him.\" Wistert also allowed, as the pitcher, Ohio State four hits in a game.\n\nWistert, still being a minor league baseball player, played for a short while in Major League Baseball, playing in three games for the Cincinnati Reds between September 11, 1934 and September 25, 1934. In two times he pitched, Wistert let only one run in eight innings, for a career earned run average of 1.13. Though, in the three times he batted, he went did not hit the ball, so he struck out twice. Although he only played for a short while in Major League Baseball, Wistert played five years of professional baseball. Fellow 1933 Michigan Wolverines football All-American, Ted Petoskey also debuted for the Reds in September 1934.\n\nWistert became part of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967, one year before his brother Albert did so. In 1981, he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of Hall of Fame joiners with his brothers. Only five other Michigan football players earned this honor before him.\n\nWistert became a New York lawyer after he retired from sports. He went on to become a vice president of an industrial relations in . He was United States Navy lieutenant in World War II.\n\n", "id": "129577", "title": "Whitey Wistert"}

It is an entry level supervisory position. The word comes from the French language. Lieu means \"place\" and tenant means \"holding\". A lieutenant is someone who takes the place of a superior when that person is not available. It can also mean a deputy position to assist someone else to carry out their job. \n\nIn many military organizations, a lieutenant is an entry level commissioned officer's rank. Generally, but not always, it is divided into two levels. \n\nA second lieutanant (2LT) (2ndLt) (2d Lt) (O1) is the lower rank of lieutanant. A second lieutenant is addressed as \"lieutenant\" the same as a first lieutenant. In the United States Army, for example, a second lieutenant leads a platoon made up of two or more squads or about 16 to 44 soldiers. In this capacity he or she functions as a platoon leader or commander. The length of time an officer can hold the rank of second lieutenant is different in different services. For example, in the British Army it may be held for up to 2 years.\nA first lieutenant (1LT) (1stLt) (1st Lt) (O2) is the senior rank of lieutenant. A first lieutenant is also addressed as \"lieutenant\". In the army, a first lieutenant often functions as the executive officer of a Company (military unit). A company may have from 110 to 140 personnel. In the British Army, an officer may hold this rank for up to three years.\n\nThere is great variation in the insignia used worldwide. In most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, as well as a number of European and South American nations, full lieutenants (and equivalents) usually wear two stars (pips) and second lieutenants (and equivalents) one. An example of an exception is the United States, whose armed forces distinguish their lieutenant ranks with one silver bar for first lieutenant and one gold (brass) bar for second lieutenant.\nIn many Navies including the United States Navy, a lieutenant is the equivalent rank to an army captain and a lieutenant (junior grade) is the same as an army first lieutenant. The equivalent to a second lieutenant is the naval rank of ensign.\n\n\n", "id": "129612", "title": "Lieutenant"}

Murrurundi is by road from Newcastle and km from Sydney. In 2006 there were 2162 people (ABS 2006) living in Murrurundi. The town is circled by mountains of the Liverpool Range. It is on the Pages River, which flows into the Hunter River. The name \"Murrurundi\" is from an Aboriginal word meaning \"Five fingers\". This is the name given to a group of rocks at the north end of the town.\n\nThe first people to live in the Murrurundi area were the Australian aboriginal people, the Wanaruah and the Kamilaroi. European settlement of the area began in the 1820s. Benjamin Hall, the father of bushranger Ben Hall started a cattle farm in the area in 1839. The town was started by the New South Wales government in 1840. In the same year, a local land owner - Thomas Haydon - started his own town called Haydonton. Benjamin Hall opened a butcher's shop in Haydonton in 1842. Ben Hall lived here until the age of 13. In 1913, the two towns were joined together to make the modern-day town of Murrurundi.\n\nKerosene shale was first mined at Mount Temi, north of Murrurundi in 1886. The mine was reopened in 1910. The shale was moved from the mine on a rope system known as an aerial ropeway. It was then loaded onto trains at a railway built at Temple Court, just west of Murrurundi. The mine closed in the First World War.\n\nEvery year there is a rodeo and the King of the Ranges stockman (cowboy) contest. Other sports played in the town include rugby, touch football, swimming, and cricket.\n\nMurrurundi railway station is on the Main North railway line, from Sydney. The station opened in 1872.

He was only 17 years old when he joined up with Ben Hall and John Gilbert and became a member of their gang.\n\nHe was born at Murrumburrah near Yass, New South Wales. His parents were Michael Dunn and Margaret Kelly. Dunn was only a small youth and worked as a jockey. He had robbed a Chinese gold miner and been in trouble with the police. \n\nDunn was a member of the gang when they tried to rob the mail coach near Jugiong on 16 November, 1864. Gilbert shot dead Sergeant Parry during the robbery. The government already had offered reward money for the capture of the Gilbert and Hall; they now offered £500 for John Dunn.\n\nThe bushrangers spent Christmas, 1864, with Dunn's parents at Murrumburrah. After visiting Dunn's grandfather, John Kelly, near Binalong they rode to Binda on Boxing Day, 26 December. Gilbert and Dunn spent the night dancing at the Flag Hotel. Hall stood at the door and stopped people from going to get the police.\n\nOn 26 January 1865, Hall, Gilbert and Dunn were at Collector, south of Goulburn. While Hall and Gilbert were robbing the hotel, John Dunn stayed outside to watch for the police. Most of the police were out in the bush searching for the bushrangers. Policeman, Constable Samuel Nelson, was told the bushrangers were at the hotel. He told his wife he would \"have to do his best\". As he walked up to the hotel Dunn shot him in the side of the body, and then fired two shots into his face. Nelson was the father of nine children. One of the children saw the shooting. The bushrangers stole Nelson's gun, and his personal belongings and then left the town. During the next three months, the gang continued to rob from farmhouses and mail coaches.\n\nIn May 1865, Hall, Gilbert, and Dunn were made \"outlaws\"; they could be killed by anyone at anytime. Hall was found by the police in the bush near Forbes, New South Wales and shot dead. A week later, Gilbert was shot by the police at the home of John Kelly, Dunn's grandfather, near Binalong, on 13 May. Dunn was able to escape, although he was shot in the foot. Kelly had told the police where the bushrangers were so that he could get the reward money. \n\nDunn went into hiding near Quambone Station (a farm) but another friend told the police where he was living. Dunn was shot and badly hurt when the police went to capture him on 26 December 1865. A policeman, McHale, was shot in the groin. Even though he was hurt, he climbed out of the police station window but was soon caught again. He was taken to Sydney to be tried in court. On 19 January 1866, he was found guilty of killing Nelson and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 19 March, 1865 at the Darlinghurst Gaol. He was only 19 years old.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129648", "text": "Saffron\n\nSaffron () (Persian: زَعْفَرَان) is a spice made from the stigma of the flower of the saffron plant. The spice is used in cooking as a seasoning and as a food colouring. It is native to Southwest Asia. It is the world's most costly spice, and has been for a long time.\n\nSaffron has a bitter taste and smells like hay. This smell is caused by the chemicals picrocrocin and safranal. Saffron also contains a dye, crocin, that gives food a rich golden colour. Saffron is a part of many foods from around the world, and is also used in medicine.\nThe word \"saffron\" comes from the 12th century Old French word ', which comes from the Latin word '. ' is also related to the Italian ' and Spanish '. \"Safranum\" comes from the Arabic word ' (), which means \"yellow\".\n\nThe cultivated saffron (saffron crocus \"C. sativus\") flowers in the autumn and comes up every year, so it is known as a perennial plant. It does not grow wild, and is now a triploid form of the eastern Mediterranean plant called \"Crocus cartwrightianus\". It is thought that \"C. cartwrightianus\" came from Crete. The saffron crocus resulted when \"C. cartwrightianus\" was subjected to a lot of artificial selection by growers who wanted plants with longer stigmas. It can not reproduce because the saffron crocus's purple flowers do not produce useful seeds. This means that reproduction needs human help. The corms (underground bulb-like starch-storing organs) must be dug up, broken apart, and planted again. A corm lives for only one season, reproducing by splitting into up to ten \"cormlets\" that will grow into new plants. The corms are small brown balls up to in diameter and are covered in thick parallel fibres.\n\nAfter a period in summer known as \"aestivation\", some narrow green leaves come up from the ground. These can grow to up to in length. The number of leaves is between five and eleven. In autumn, purple buds appear. In October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, the saffron grows its brightly-coloured flowers, which are coloured from light to dark purple. At the time of flowering, the plant is usually less than in height. Inside each flower are three prongs, called the \"style\". Each prong has a crimson \"stigma\" of between 25 and 30 mm in length at the end of it.\n\nThe saffron crocus grows best in climates like that of the Mediterranean maquis or the North American chaparral, where hot, dry summer winds blow across the land. However, saffron can live through temperatures as cold as , and short periods of snow. Saffron needs no extra water if it grows in a wet place like Kashmir, where there is usually 1000–1500 mm of rain each year. It is also important for the rain to fall at the right time of year: there should be a lot of rain in the spring and little in the summer. Rainfall just before flowering also makes the plant give more saffron. Rainy or cold weather during flowering can cause disease, so the plant gives less saffron. Other things that can make the plant give less saffron are: the weather being damp or hot for a long time; rabbits, rats, and birds, digging in the ground near the plant; parasites such as the roundworm; fungus and corm rot. Saffron plants grow best in strong and direct sunlight. Planting is best done in fields that slope towards the sunlight (i.e. south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere), giving the crocuses' more sunlight. In the Northern Hemisphere, planting is mostly done in June, with corms planted some 7–15 cm deep.\n\nGrowers have found that planting corms deep and in rows spaced 2–3 cm apart makes more threads, whereas planting depths of 8–10 cm makes more flowers and corms. Saffron crocuses grow best in crumbly, moist and well-drained clay soils with high organic content. They are often planted in raised beds, to help with drainage. Farmers often use 20–30 tonnes of manure per hectare on the plants before plating the corms The buds do not start to grow until early autumn, then in the middle of autumn the plants begin to flower. Picking the flowers must be done quickly: they flower at dawn, but curl up and die during the day. The flowers of the saffron crocuses only last for one or two weeks. From 150 flowers, the farmer can get about 1 g of dry saffron threads. To produce 12 g of dried saffron (72 g freshly harvested) would take about 1 kg of flowers (1 lb for 0.2 oz of dried saffron). It can be worked out that from this that one freshly picked flower makes 0.03 g of fresh saffron, or 0.007 g of dried saffron.\n\nThe history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3,000 years. The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called \"Crocus cartwrightianus\". Humans began choosing wild plants that had long \"stigmas\". Gradually, a form of \"C. cartwrightianus\", \"C. sativus\", came into being in the late Bronze Age Crete. Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a 7th century BC Assyrian book about botany which was written in the time of Ashurbanipal. There is evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4,000 years. \nThe Minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces as long ago as 1500–1600 BC, showing how it could be used as a medicine. Later, Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia, where adventurers hoped to find the world's most valuable saffron. Another legend tells how someone named Crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus. Ancient Mediterranean peoples–including perfumers in Egypt, physicians in Gaza, townspeople in Rhodes, and the Greek \"hetaerae\" courtesans–used saffron in their perfumes, ointments, potpourris, mascaras, divine offerings, and medical treatments. \nIn late Hellenistic Egypt, Cleopatra used saffron in her baths to make her feel good. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all types of gastrointestinal ailments. Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levant cities as Sidon and Tyre. Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds, cough, colic, and scabies, and in the mithridatium. Such was the Romans' love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until Rome's fall. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD.\n\nPaints made from saffron were being used for drawing 50,000 years ago. These have been found in the country that is today called Iraq. Later, people called the Sumerians used wild-growing saffron in their medicines and magical potions. Traders carried saffron for long distances before the 2nd millennium BC. Ancient Persians were growing their own type of saffron (\"Crocus sativus\" 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. Sometimes saffron threads were woven into textiles. They were given as offerings to the gods and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads were also scattered across beds and mixed into hot tea as a way of curing sad feelings. Other people were afraid that the Persians would use saffron as a drug and aphrodisiac. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his tea, rice, and baths to help heal his battle wounds. Alexander's troops copied their leader's actions and brought the habit of saffron-bathing back to Greece.\n\nNo one knows how saffron arrived in South Asia. Traditional Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 900–2500 years ago. Historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime before 500 BC, saying it was either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks or a Persian invasion and colonization of Kashmir. Phoenicians then sold Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. From there, saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia. For example, Buddhist monks in India started wearing saffron-coloured robes after the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's death. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit.\n\nSome historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. On the other hand, saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the forty-volume \"Shennong Bencaojing\" (神農本草經—\"Shennong's Great Herbal\", also known as \"Pen Ts'ao\" or \"Pun Tsao\") pharmacopoeia, a tome dating from 200–300 BC. Traditionally attributed to the legendary \"Yan\" (\"Fire\") Emperor (炎帝) Shennong, it documents 252 phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders. Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that \"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.\" Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: \"The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine.\"\n\nIn Europe, saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empire's fall. Saffron was reintroduced when the Islamic civilization \"Al-Andalus\" spread to Spain, France, and Italy. During the 14th century Black Death, there was a huge increase in demand for saffron-based medicine. Much saffron had to be imported by Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes. The theft of one such shipment by noblemen started the 14 week long \"Saffron War\". The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in Basel, which grew prosperous. Cultivation and trade then spread to Nuremberg, where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the \"Safranschou\" code. Under this law under saffron adulterers were fined, imprisoned, and executed. Soon after, saffron cultivation spread throughout England, especially Norfolk and Suffolk. The Essex town of Saffron Walden, named for its new specialty crop, became England's main saffron growing and trading center. However, an influx of more exotic spices such as chocolate, coffee, tea, and vanilla from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline. Only in southern France, Italy, and Spain, did significant cultivation continue.\n\nEuropeans brought saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms; indeed, many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch were growing saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold. The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812, when many saffron-transporting merchant vessels were destroyed. Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.\n\nSaffron's aroma is often described to be something like metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes. Its taste has also been noted as hay-like and somewhat bitter. Saffron gives a light yellow-orange colouring to foods. Saffron is widely used in Iranian (Persian), Arab, Central Asian, European, Indian,Turkish, Moroccan and Cornish cuisines. Confectioneries and liquors also often include saffron. Common saffron substitutes include safflower (\"Carthamus tinctorius\", which is often sold as \"Portuguese saffron\" or \"assafroa\") and turmeric (\"Curcuma longa\"). Saffron has been used as a traditional medicine for a long time. Modern medicine has also discovered itas having anticarcinogenic (cancer-suppressing), anti-mutagenic (mutation-preventing), immunomodulating, and antioxidant-like properties. Saffron has also been used as a fabric dye, particularly in China and India, and in perfumery.\nMost saffron is grown in a belt of land ranging from the Mediterranean in the west to Kashmir in the east. Annually, around 300 tonnes of saffron are produced worldwide. Iran ranks first in the world production of saffron, with more than 94 percent of the world yield. Iran's annual saffron production is expected to hit 300 tons by the end of the nation's Fourth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan in 2009. Other minor producers of saffron are Spain, India, Greece, Azerbaijan, Morocco, and Italy. A pound of dry saffron (0.45 kg) requires 50,000–75,000 flowers. These flowers would need about a football field's area of cultivation. Some forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers. Upon extraction, stigmas are dried quickly and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers. Saffron prices at wholesale and retail rates range from US$500/pound to US$5,000/pound (US$1100–US$11,000 per kilogram)—equivalent to £250/€350 per pound or £5,500/€7,500 per kilo. In Western countries, the average retail price is $1,000/£500/€700 per pound (US$2200/£1100/€1550 per kilogram). A pound comprises between 70,000 and 200,000 threads. Vivid crimson colouring, slight moistness, elasticity, recent harvest date, and lack of broken-off thread debris are all traits of fresh saffron.\nSeveral saffron cultivars are grown worldwide. Spain's varieties, including the tradenames 'Spanish Superior' and 'Creme', are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish, while the most intense varieties tend to be Iranian in origin. Westerners may face significant obstacles in obtaining saffron from India. For example, India has banned the export of high-grade saffron abroad. Aside from these, various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries, some organically grown. In the U.S., Pennsylvania Dutch saffron—known for its earthy notes—is marketed in small quantities.\n\nConsumers regard certain cultivars as \"premium\" quality. The \"Aquila\" saffron (\"zafferano dell'Aquila\")—defined by high safranal and crocin content, shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour—is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's Abruzzo region, near L'Aquila. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican monk from Inquisition-era Spain. But in Italy the biggest saffron cultivation, for quality and quantity, is in San Gavino Monreale, Sardinia. There, saffron is grown on 40 hectares (60% of Italian production); it also has very high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the Kashmiri \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron (\"Crocus sativus\" 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir, combined with an Indian export ban, contribute to its high prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its extremely dark maroon-purple hue, among the world's darkest, which suggests the saffron's strong flavour, aroma, and colourative effect.\n\nSaffron types are graded by quality according to laboratory measurements of such characteristics as crocin (colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance) content. Other metrics include floral waste content (i.e. the saffron spice sample's non-stigma floral content) and measurements of other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"ash\"). A uniform set of international standards in saffron grading was established by the International Organization for Standardization, which is an international federation of national standards bodies. Namely, ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron. It establishes four empirical grades of colour intensity: IV (poorest), III, II, and I (finest quality). Saffron samples are then assigned to one of these grades by gauging the spice's crocin content, which is revealed by measurements of crocin-specific spectroscopic absorbance. Absorbance is defined as formula_1, with formula_2 as absorbance (Beer-Lambert law). It is a measure of a given substance's transparency (formula_3, the ratio of light intensity passing through sample to that of the incident light) to a given wavelength of light.\n\nFor saffron, absorbance is determined for the crocin-specific photon wavelength of 440 nm in a given dry sample of spice. Higher absorbances at this wavelength imply greater crocin concentration, and thus a greater colourative intensity. These data are measured through spectrophotometry reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. These colour grades proceed from grades with absorbances lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 190 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected most red-maroon tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive absorbance scores in excess of 250. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO scores. However, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. They prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of thread for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practiced by practised wine tasters.\n\nDespite such attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron adulteration–particularly among the cheapest grades–continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the \"Safranschou\" code. Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like beet, pomegranate fibers, red-dyed silk fibers, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odorless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibers with viscid substances like honey or vegetable oil. However, powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with turmeric, paprika, and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabeled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, in India, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.\n\n", "id": "129648", "title": "Saffron"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129669", "text": "Virgin birth of Jesus\n\nThe virgin birth of Jesus is a belief held by Christians,Jews and Muslims. It says that Mary, Jesus' mother, was a virgin even after she became pregnant with Jesus. By the 2nd century, most people in the Christian church believed this. The idea of the virgin birth was included in the two most common Christian creeds, the Nicene Creed and the Apostles' Creed. The Nicene Creed says that Jesus \"was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary\" (meaning that Jesus was God in human form, and was born to the Virgin Mary). The Apostles' Creed also says that Jesus was \"born of the Virgin Mary.\" The belief was not challenged, except by some sects which were not very important, before the Enlightenment theology of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew and Luke say that Mary was a virgin and that Jesus was created by the Holy Spirit. These Gospels started the belief that Jesus' creation was a miracle. This belief, which is now common in Christianity, says that Jesus had no natural father; no sexual intercourse and no male seed was involved in creating him. The Gospel of Matthew also says that the virgin birth of Jesus fulfills a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah.\n\nSince the second century, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have taught that Mary gave birth as a virgin (meaning she stayed a \"virgo intacta\" - an \"intact virgin\" - even after giving birth).\n\nThe virgin birth of Jesus is also part of Islam. The Qur'an often describes Jesus as \"Jesus, son of Mary\" (\"Isa bin Maryam\").\n\nAccording to Uta Ranke-Heinemann, the idea that Jesus was born to a virgin was not meant to be taken literally (as if it really happened). Instead, it is an allegory about something special that God did. It is like the story about how God made Adam. Both Adam and Jesus were God's creations.\n\nRaymond Brown argues that Jesus may have been an illegitimate child. This idea first appeared around 177-180 AD. Around this time, Celsus wrote that Jesus himself had made up the story about being born to a virgin. In fact, Celsus wrote, Jesus' mother was a poor country woman who earned her money by spinning (making thread). She had been married to a carpenter, but he kicked her out. He did this because she was convicted of adultery with a soldier named Panthera. After this, she wandered around and secretly gave birth to Jesus. Later, because he was poor, Jesus found work in Egypt. There, he learned magical powers. These made him confident, and he started calling himself God.\n\nThe letters of Paul of Tarsus are thought to be the earliest texts in the New Testament. They do not say that Jesus' mother was a virgin.\n\nIn Galatians 4:4, Paul wrote:\n\nBut when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law ...\n\nIn this sentence, Paul says that Jesus was born \"of a woman\", not \"of a virgin\". This could be evidence that Paul did not know about the virgin birth of Jesus. However, when Paul was alive, when Hebrew people talked about a new baby, they usually listed only the child's father, or both parents. The fact that Paul listed no father may suggest that there was no human father.\n\nSome people think God created Jesus without a human father so Jesus could avoid a curse. In the Old Testament (), God put a curse on Jeconiah, who had been King of Judah. God told Jeconiah that none of his family would ever 'sit on the throne of David.' David was one of Jeconiah's ancestors, and had been King of Jerusalem. says that Jeconiah was an ancestor of Joseph, Mary's husband. If Jesus was Joseph's child, Jesus would be related to Jeconiah. God's curse would keep him from being King of Jerusalem. However, because God created Jesus without a human father, Jesus was not related to Jeconiah, and could be King.\n\nIn his Epistle (letter) to the Romans, Paul says: \nPeople argue about what Paul meant when he said Jesus was \"descended from David according to the flesh.\" David, Jeconiah, and Joseph were all in the same family line. For Jesus to be part of David's family line, he would have to be related to Joseph. This would mean Joseph had to be Jesus' human father. However, some people think Paul did not mean Jesus was physically descended from Joseph, only that Joseph acted like Jesus' father.\n\nRaymond Brown argues that it is important to look at when each book in the Bible was written. He says that looking at this shows:\n\nHowever, Paul, in Epistle to the Colossians 1:15, calls Jesus the \"first-born Son, superior to all created things.\" This makes it clear that Paul saw Jesus as very special, unlike any other human being.\n\n", "id": "129669", "title": "Virgin birth of Jesus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129706", "text": "Food coloring\n\nA food coloring is any substance that is added to food or drink to change its color. Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in cooking at home.\n\nPeople associate certain colors with certain flavors. The color of the food can therefore influence its perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine.\nFor this reason, food manufacturers add dyes to their products. One of the reasons this is done is to simulate the colour the customer expects as \"natural\". An example would be to add red coloring to glacé cherries. Without coloring, the cherries would be beige. Food coloring can also be done for effect, such as a green ketchup instead of an expected red.\nMost people are aware that food with bright or unnatural colors, such as the green ketchup mentioned, contains food coloring. Far fewer people know that \"natural\" foods such as oranges and salmon may also be dyed to hide natural variations in color. The color of foods varies through the seasons. Processing food and storing it may change its color. For these reasons, it may give a commercial advantage to add colors to food, so that it has the color expected or preferred by the customers. Some of the main reasons are:\n\nFood colorings need to be tested before they can be used. These tests are done to make sure the coloring is not poisonous, and has no unwanted side-effects. Sometimes, different testing-bodies have different opinions on the safety of a certain coloring. In the United States, FD&C (generally indicates that the FDA has approved the colorant for use in Foods, Drugs and Cosmetics) numbers are given to approved synthetic food dyes that do not exist in nature. In the European Union, E numbers are used for all additives, both synthetic and natural, that are approved in food applications.\n\nMost other countries have their own regulations and list of food colors which can be used in various applications, including maximum daily intake limits.\n\nNatural colors are not required to be tested by a number of regulatory bodies throughout the world, including the United States FDA. The FDA lists \"color additives exempt from certification\" for food.\n\nA growing number of natural food dyes are being commercially produced, partly due to consumer concerns surrounding synthetic dyes. Some examples include:\n\n\nTo make it easy to get the exact color, these color components are often available in very pure form. They can also be used with suitable carrier materials.\n\nIn the United States, certifiable color additives are available for use in food as either \"dyes\" or \"lakes\".\n\nDyes dissolve in water, but are not soluble in oil. Dyes are manufactured as powders, granules, liquids or other special purpose forms. They can be used in drinks, dry mixes, baked goods, confections, dairy products, pet foods and many other products. Dyes also have side effects which lakes do not, including the fact that large amounts of dyes ingested can color stools.\n\nLakes are the combination of dyes and insoluble material. Lakes tint by dispersion. Lakes are not oil soluble, but are oil dispersible. Lakes are more stable than dyes and are ideal for coloring products containing fats and oils or items lacking sufficient moisture to dissolve dyes. Typical uses include coated tablets, cake and donut mixes, hard candies and chewing gums, lipsticks, soaps, shampoos, talc etc.\n\nBecause food dyes are generally safer to use than normal artistic dyes and pigments, some artists have used food coloring as a means of making pictures, especially in forms such as body-painting.\nFood colorings can be used to dye fabric, but are usually not wash-fast when used on cotton, hemp and other plant fibres. Some food dyes can be fixed on Nylon and animal fibers.\n\nIn the past, research has not shown any link between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and food dyes. Newer studies show that synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents can make the symptoms of ADD and ADHD worse. The older studies were inclonclusive on this point, perhaps because the clinical methods of measuring this behavior were inappropriate. Parents' reports of food additives proved to be better indicators whether additives were present than clinical tests. Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non-ADD student populations when artificial ingredients and artificial coloring were eliminated from school food programs.\n\n", "id": "129706", "title": "Food coloring"}

For example Korea was under Qing rule, but was seized by Japan. The Russians wanted a 'warm-water port' on the Pacific Ocean for their navy and trade. The harbour at Vladivostok freezes over in the winter, but Port Arthur (now called the Liaodong Peninsula in China) can be used all the time. Russia had already rented the port from the Qing and had got their permission to build a railway from St Petersburg to Port Arthur. \n\nRussia wanted a warm-water Pacific Ocean port for trade and her navy. Japan wanted to expand her empire into Korea and China.

To avoid war Japan would have to compromise with Russia, and Russia would get the better deal. Japan wanted a bigger share of Korea and China than she thought Russia would offer and decided to attack before the railway was complete and she still had a chance of doing well in a war with Russia.\n\nThe war started with a Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur. It continued with Japanese victories in Manchuria and elsewhere. The last major battle at Tsushima destroyed the Russian navy.\n\nUnited States President Theodore Roosevelt helped Russia and Japan make peace after the war. He won a Nobel Prize for this. Russia had to give up all influence in the Far East. The Russian people were very angry at the government and at Tzar Nicholas II for not continuing the war because everyone was sure that Russia could have won. This is true because Japan was completely broke and she would have suffered an economic crisis after just a few more months of fighting. Russia's army was also much stronger than Japan's and had very large reserves to replace the soldiers she lost, but Japan had no more men with military training to replace her losses and no money to give new men training. \n\nJapan would take over Korea five years later in 1910. The Japanese got Port Arthur and the Russian railway in China. Japan would continue to grow its empire in Asia until World War II. The Russian defeat was one of the reasons for the Russian army's great improvement after 1904 and this improvement helped start the European arms-race that was a cause of World War I. The war also contributed to the Russian Revolution and Civil War in 1917.\n\n", "id": "129771", "title": "Russo-Japanese War"}

The website was started in 2006, and had over 1.2 million documents in its database by the time one year had passed. Usually, it does not give out the names and addresses of people who post documents. The site is based in Sweden. Though its name is similar to Wikipedia, it is not related to Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Foundation. The name was chosen because WikiLeaks used a wiki model at first, where people could edit the site, but it has since changed and is no longer open for editing.\n\nIn July 2010, WikiLeaks was in the news for publishing over 76,900 documents related to the War in Afghanistan. In October that same year, WikiLeaks posted almost 400,000 documents that were about the War in Iraq.\n\nThis was the largest ever leak of documents about the US Army. It reported mainly on deaths of civilians, soldiers, and sightings of homemade bombs or armed civilians.\n\nOn 28 November WikiLeaks and five major newspapers - from Spain (\"El País\"), France (\"Le Monde\"), Germany (\"Der Spiegel\"), the United Kingdom (\"The Guardian\"), and the United States (\"The New York Times\") - all began to publish the first 291 of 251,287 confidential diplomatic cables from 274 embassies dated from 1966–2010. WikiLeaks plans to release all of the cables in phases over several months.\n\nThis leak was widely covered by the international media, as many of the leaks contained information that affected countries other than the United States. Some leaks were published by other news organizations like Fairfax Media.

The town is placed west of the state capital, Sydney. In 2006, 535 people lived in Eugowra.\n\nThe word \"Eugowra\" comes from an Australian aboriginal word meaning \"\"the place where the sand washes down the hill\"\". The first people to live in the Eugowra area were the Wiradjuri people. Europeans first began exploring the area in 1815. John Oxley went through the area on his trip to explore the inland of NSW in 1817. Farming began at Eugowra station (farm) in 1834.\n\nThe town was started in the 1860s on the site of the farm. This was where the track for people going to the Lachlan gold fields crossed the Mandagery Creek. A bridge was built over the creek, and then the John Bull Hotel (later the Fat Lamb Hotel) was built next to it. In 1881, the town was laid out and a police station, courthouse and school were built. The creek has flooded many times; in 2005 it had a flood peak of . This cut the town in two, and water flowed through many buildings and houses.\n\nAustralia's biggest gold robbery took place near Eugowra. The bushrangers, Frank Gardiner, Ben Hall and their gang robbed the Forbes to Orange Ford and Company coach on 15 June, 1862. The bushrangers stole of gold and £3,700 in cash. The value in 2008 money is about A$4 million. The site of the robbery was a gully north of Eugowra, known as Eugowra Rocks. Coaches and wagons had to slow down to get around a steep gully which went down to Mandagery Creek. They also had to get past many large granite rocks. One of these rocks was called \"Coonbong\" (dead man) by the Wiradjuri people. Gardiner’s gang stopped two bullock wagons and left them in the middle of the road. When the gold escort coach arrived it had to slow right down and try to get past the wagons. The bushrangers, hidden behind the rocks, fired their guns at the coach. The coach driver and two policemen were wounded. One policeman had been shot in the testicles. The horses reared up and the coach was tipped on its side. One policemen assisted the wounded and they escaped into the bush. They went towards the Eugowra homestead for help. The other policeman went back down the road to a small hotel, Lyell's Shanty.\n\nThe bushrangers took the gold and money. They put it onto the back of one of the coach horses. They went back to their horses which had been hidden up the hill. They escaped into the bush and stopped at the southern end of Noble’s Lagoon to share out the bags of gold. They went to Mount Wheogo, north of the Weddin Mountains, where Gardiner had his camp.\n\nA local farmer, Hanbury Clements, heard the gun shots and went to find out what was going on. He found the wounded men and helped them back to the farm house. He got on to his horse and rode the to Forbes in the dark in less than three hours to report the robbery. The police arrived quickly, and with the help of an aboriginal tracker, Jimmy Dargan, they were soon following the bushrangers. Gardiner’s camp at Wheogo had a good view of the country. John \"the Warrigal Walsh\", (the brother of Ben Hall's wife), warned the bushrangers that the police were coming and the gang got away.\n\nMost of the gold was still loaded on the back of the very tired coach horse. The bushrangers finally had to leave the horse in the foothills of the Weddin Mountains. They only took the money with them. The police got most of the gold back. Only Ben Hall and Frank Gardiner's share of the gold was not found.\n\n\nToday, the town has a supermarket, two hotels, a newsagent, a butcher and golf and bowling clubs. There is also farm supplies, a lucerne plant and a sawmill. Eugowra is famous for its granite. More than 2000 slabs of granite were used in the new Parliament House, Canberra in Canberra.\n\n", "id": "129784", "title": "Eugowra, New South Wales"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129793", "text": "Dan Kelly\n\nDan Kelly (1 June 1861 – 28 June 1880) was an Australian bushranger and outlaw. The son of an Irish convict, he was the youngest brother of bushranger Ned Kelly. Dan and his brother killed three policemen. With two friends, they formed the Kelly Gang. Dan Kelly died during the famous siege of Glenrowan.\n\nMore books have been written about the Kelly Gang than any other subject in Australian history. The Kelly Gang were the subject of the world's first full length feature movie, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", made in 1906. They robbed banks, took over whole towns, and kept the people in Victoria and New South Wales frightened. For two years the Victorian police searched for them, locked up their friends and families, but could not find them.\n\nDan Kelly's father, John \"Red\" Kelly, was an Irishman, a convict who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land in 1842. He would have been kept in the convict gaol at Port Arthur.\n\nIn 1848, after his time in gaol, Red Kelly moved to Victoria, and began working as a farmer around Beveridge. There he built a simple wooden house. The house in Kelly Street is still standing. The original three rooms have been added to over the years, and the house now has 11 rooms.\n\nRed married an Irish girl, Ellen Quinn, in Melbourne in 1850. They had seven children: Annie (1853), Edward \"Ned\" (1854), Maggie (1856), Jim (1859), Dan (1861), Kate (1862) and Grace (1863).\n\nIn 1864, Dan Kelly's family moved north to a farm at Avenel. Red Kelly stole a calf and was sent to gaol for six months. Dan was in trouble with the police when he was five years old because they believed he had stolen a horse. Dan's father died in 1866, and in 1867, his mother, Ellen Kelly, moved the family to a small farm near Greta in north east Victoria. Ellen Kelly's two sisters, Catherine and Jane Lloyd, were living at Greta, and her two brothers, John and James Quinn, had moved to the area in 1864. The Quinn family were well known to the police. Dan Kelly was again in trouble with the law when he was only 10 years old. He and his brother Jim, aged 12, were arrested by Constable Flood for riding a horse that did not belong to them. Jim was working for a local farmer and had taken the horse to ride home on. Flood did not believe them, and the boys were forced to spend two nights in a prison cell.\nIn 1875, like many other young men in north east Victoria, Dan Kelly and his cousins, the Lloyds, went to New South Wales to look for seasonal farm work in the Riverina area and on the Monaro High Plains. His group of friends were known as \"the Greta mob\". They went out together to hotels, dances and horse races. By 1876, they were well known for their visits to nearby towns such as Wangaratta, Beechworth and Benalla.\n\nOn one visit to Benalla in 1876, Dan was arrested for stealing a saddle. The police let him go when they could not get enough evidence. Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877. They had gone to a shop to pick up food and other supplies, but the shop was shut. When the owner refused to open the shop, Dan Kelly broke down the door. They were charged with violent assault, damage to property (the door), breaking into houses and stealing things worth £113. The boys went into hiding, and the police spent three weeks looking for them. Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves up. In court, the police were not able to prove most of the charges, but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth £10.\n\nOn 15 April 1878, Constable Fitzpatrick, went to the Kelly's house to arrest Dan Kelly for stealing horses. Dan had been seen in Chiltern riding a stolen horse. What happened at the house is now called the \"Fitzpatrick incident\". There was a fight with Fitzpatrick, and he said the Kelly family had tried to kill him. Dan and Ned went into the bush to hide. Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years for attempted murder. Maggie's husband, William Skillion, and a neighbour, William Williamson, were sent to gaol for six years.\n\nNed and Dan Kelly went into the bush to a place in the Wombat Ranges. Dan Kelly had built a small hut some time earlier on Bullock Creek, where he had cleared an area of about to keep horses. He had also built a small still for making alcohol. The brothers spent their time searching for gold in the creek.\n\nDuring the months they were hiding at Bullock Creek, they were often visited by their friends including Steve Hart, Joe Byrne, Aaron Sherritt and the Lloyds. The police took the charge of attempted murder very seriously. A reward of £100 was offered for the capture of the two Kelly boys. The police thought the brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges. In October 1878, they sent two search groups out to find them. One group travelled south from Greta, and the other started from Mansfield and travelled north.\n\nThe Mansfield group was led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy, with three policemen; Constables Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area. Kennedy and Scanlon went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp. The Kellys were living in a hut close by at Bullock Creek. They heard noises and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses. Ned and Dan, and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart, went to the police camp and told them to surrender.\n\nConstable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan got out his gun. Ned Kelly shot him dead. When the other two police came back to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. Scanlon went for his gun but Ned shot him dead. Kennedy ran shooting from tree to tree with Ned chasing him. During the shooting, Kennedy was shot and was badly wounded. Ned shot him in the chest to end his suffering. McIntyre was able to escape during the confusion. It was later reported in the newspapers that it was Dan who had shot Kennedy. Dan was wounded during the shooting.\n\nThe Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, making the Kelly Gang outlaws; they no longer had any legal rights. They could be shot by anyone, at any time, without warning. Anyone who could capture one of the Gang, alive or dead, would be paid a reward of £500, or £2,000 for the four men. The bushrangers were seen at several places around north east Victoria. They had tried to cross the Murray River into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them. On 10 December, the Kelly Gang robbed the bank at Euroa. In February 1879, they went to Jerilderie, New South Wales. They locked the town's policemen in the police station cells, and kept many people prisoner in the Royal Mail Hotel for three days. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the people in the hotel, while Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne robbed the bank. After the bank robberies, the reward was increased to £2,000 for each man, or the larger amount of £8,000 for the Gang.\n\nOver the next 18 months many policemen were sent to north-east Victoria to search for the Kelly Gang. The police could not find the bushrangers because they were badly led and they did not know how to live in the bush. However the Kellys were experts in living in the bush and they had the support of the local people.\n\nIn June 1880, the Kelly Gang came out of hiding. They knew that Joe Byrne's friend, Aaron Sherritt, had been giving information to the police. Four policemen were living at Sherritt's house, near Beechworth, to protect him. Dan Kelly and Byrne went to Sherritt's house late at night and knocked on the door. When Sherritt opened the door, Byrne shot him dead. The policemen were hiding under the bed. Kelly and Byrne rode quickly back to Glenrowan where Ned Kelly and Hart had forced many of the town people into a hotel, the Glenrowan Inn. They also had forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks. They knew that more police would be sent by train to Beechworth to find them. They wanted the train to crash when it reached the place where tracks had been removed near Glenrowan. The bushrangers, wearing homemade armour, would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crash. With the police out of the way, the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bank. The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly, William Williamson, and William Skillion, were let out of gaol.\n\nThe plan did not work because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritt's house until the next morning. This meant that the news of the murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped. The people held prisoner in the hotel became restless. Ned organised music and Dan joined in dancing to keep the people in the hotel entertained. Dan also organised some sporting games including long jump and hop, step and jump. Dan wanted to leave Glenrowan when they knew the plan was not going to work because the train was late. Ned Kelly let Thomas Curnow, the school teacher, go home to his wife. Dan told his brother not to trust Curnow, and to keep him at the hotel. Instead of going home, Curnow went to the railway and about 3.00am he was able to stop the train before it reached the broken rails. The police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside.\n\nWhen the bushrangers heard the train pull into the station, they knew their plan to destroy the train had failed. They put on their suits of armour and went on to the verandah of the hotel to wait for the police. In the first few shots, police Superintendent Hare, Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne were wounded, and Jack Jones, son of the hotel owner was killed. Ned Kelly, who was dressed in his armour, was able to leave the hotel and kept shooting at the police. The police fired their guns into the hotel building for seven hours. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired during the shooting. Byrne died after being shot in the groin. Ned Kelly went back to the hotel but could not find Dan or Steve Hart who were hiding in a back room. He again left and tried to find his horse. Ned Kelly was shot in the legs as he searched outside for his brother. The police were then easily able to capture him.\n\nAt 10.00am there was a large crowd of people watching the action. Police Inspector Sadleir was forced to stop the shooting to allow many of the hostages to escape. He would not let Dan's sister Maggie, or a Catholic priest Father Gibney, go into the hotel to tell the men to give themselves up. Instead, he ordered that a cannon be sent from Melbourne so that they could destroy the hotel.\n\nAt 2.30pm, the police set fire to the building to try and make the rest of the Kelly Gang leave the building. Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held prisoner inside the hotel died during the siege.\n\nFamily members, including his sisters, Kate and Maggie, and friends took the bodies back to Greta. The police tried to get the bodies back, and sent a group of 16 policemen to Greta, but they became worried that this would start another fight and they went back to Benalla. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were buried in unmarked graves at Greta, on 30 June 1880. About 100 people were at the funeral, with Dan's cousin, Tom Lloyd, as the undertaker, and a Greta farmer, Daniel O'Keefe, acting as a preacher. After the graves were filled in, the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the graves hidden. The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies.\n\nAfter Glenrowan, Dan Kelly and Steve Hart's armour was taken by the police and kept at Benalla. Ned Kelly's armour was sent to Melbourne to be used at his trial. Joe Byrne's armour was sent to the police depot in Richmond. At the end of 1880, all the pieces were in Melbourne. One set of armour was given to Sir William Clarke. Over the years the pieces became mixed up. In 2002, the State Library of Victoria and the police exchanged some pieces to try and get the sets complete. The State Library has Ned's armour, Joe's is still owned by the Clarke family, and the police have Dan and Steve's armour which can be seen at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne australia.\n\nBecause it was not possible to prove how they died, or that the bodies were really Dan and Steve, there have been many stories about what might have happened. It is possible they may have killed themselves. This was the story that was used in the first Kelly movie, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" in 1906, and in the 2003 Ned Kelly movie. There have also been stories that both survived the fire. There is little evidence to support these claims. One man, James Ryan, said he was Dan Kelly. In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang. He died on 29 July 1948, after being struck by a train. The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave. In 2001, scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba, Queensland, to see if they could find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly. Devine, who had burn scars on his body, told his family he was really Dan. He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire. In October 1902, a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa. The men had fought in the Second Boer War. Another man, Jim Davis from Darra (a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland), said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly. He claimed that he, Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel. He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, which makes him too old to have really been Dan.\n\nThe story of Dan and Ned Kelly has been told many times. There have been more books written about the Kelly Gang than any other event in Australian history. The very first full length movie in the world, made in 1906, was \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\". In the 2003 Ned Kelly movie starring Heath Ledger as Ned Kelly, the part of Dan Kelly was played by Laurence Kinlan. Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne.\n\nIn 2012 a pistol was put up for sale which had \"1876 DAN KELLY\" carved into it. A pistol was known to have been found at Glenrowan after the siege but it is now lost. The pistol being sold was found on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River in 1900. It is a muzzle load single shot pistol made for the East India Company Cavalry.\n\n", "id": "129793", "title": "Dan Kelly"}

It has the name of one of the Founding Fathers of the country, Juan Pablo Duarte.\n\nIt was created in 1896 as a district (an old country subdivision) with the name \"Distrito Pacificador\" but the Constitution of 1907 changed all districts to provinces. In 1925 its name was changed to \"Duarte\".\n\nThe Duarte province is bordered on the east by the María Trinidad Sánchez and Samaná provinces, on the south by the Monte Plata and Sánchez Ramírez provinces, on the west by the La Vega and Hermanas Mirabal provinces and on the north by the Espaillat and María Trinidad Sánchez provinces.\n\nThe area that currently forms the Duarte province was originally part of La Vega province until 1885 when it was made part of the Espaillat province.\n\nIn 1896, this part of the country was made a province, including some coastal towns that are now part of the María Trinidad Sánchez province. With the creation of this last province in 1959, the Duarte province lost all coastal areas and became a landlocked province (surrounded by other provinces by all sides). At this time, the municipalities of the Duarte province were San Francisco de Macorís, Castillo, Pimentel and Villa Riva, with Hostos as a municipal district.\n\nArenoso was made a municipality in 1993, Las Guáranas in 1998 and Hostos (with the name of Eugenio María de Hostos) in 2004.\n\nThe municipal districts of the province were created in:\n\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Duarte province, and 191,878 () living in towns and cities.

The first road comes from Moca and Salcedo and goes to the southeast and then to the north to end in Nagua, on the northern coast.\n\nThe second road is shorter than the first and is a branch of the \"Carretera Duarte\" (Duarte National Road) that ends in San Francisco de Macorís.\n\nMost rivers in the province are short and have their sources in the \"Cordillera Septentrional\".

It is a renewable source of energy that helps to cut down on the pollution of earth's air. \n\nWind power capacity has expanded quickly to 336 GW in June 2014, and wind energy production was about 4% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing fast. Wind power is widely used in European countries, and more recently in the United States and Asia. In 2012 wind power accounted for approximately 30% of electricity generation in Denmark, 20% in Portugal and 18% in Spain.\n\nWind power stations use the wind to turn a turbine which turns a magnet inside a coil (a type of generator). The wind has kinetic energy (movement energy) which is changed into mechanical energy by the blades on the turbine. The turbine then turns a generator which creates electrical energy (voltage). The turbine is usually connected by a gearbox to help control the speed it turns the generator at.\n\nWind Power Stations have the advantage over Fossil Fuel Power Stations as they do not produce any greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or water vapour. They also do not produce gases that help make acid rain such as sulfur dioxide.\n\nWind turbines have to be carefully placed. They must be in positions where there is a constant, steady supply of wind. In fact, the wind must not become too strong or it may damage the turbine. Because wind is unpredictable, so is the amount of power that wind turbines will produce, making them an unreliable source of energy.\nSome people also consider wind turbines to be ugly and unsightly. Also, huge numbers of electricity pylons (\"transmission towers\") are built on land to carry the electricity to the electric company. These pylons in areas of natural beauty are a major reason for local people to object to wind farms and their consequences.\n\n\n", "id": "129880", "title": "Wind power"}

In his book \"Po: Beyond Yes and No\" (1973), de Bono describes what he calls an \"open block\". This is when people ignore certain things that may solve a problem, because they already have an idea of how the problem should be solved. They may therefore not recognise other solutions to the problem. For example, if a person's car breaks down, the open block of being used to being in a car may cause them to wait for a taxi, ignoring buses passing by, without even reading the destinations.\n\nIn this book de Bono suggested a number of techniques for overcoming the open block. This includes going back and challenging assumptions, or generating new ideas for addressing problems. De Bono calls this a \"po\". A po is an idea that moves thinking forward to a new place from where new ideas or solutions may be found.

The first round of Premier League matches took place on 15 August 1992. 11 clubs hosted the opening fixtures. Following the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989, the Taylor Report suggested the removal of standing terraces by the start of the 1994–95 season. They were replaced by all-seater stadiums.\n\nWhen Fulham came up from Division 1 in the 2000–2001 season, terraces returned for a short while. This gave them more time to complete the changes. For a bit of time they had to play at Loftus Road after not enough progress was made in converting Craven Cottage. They returned to their home ground after building work was completed in time for the 2004–05 season.\n\nBurnley's Turf Moor stadium became the 50th Premier League stadium on 19 August 2009, where they faced Manchester United. Bournemouth's Dean Court is the most recent stadium to host a Premier League match, when they played their first ever home Premier League match against Aston Villa on 8 August 2015.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130049", "text": "City of Manchester Stadium\n\nThe City of Manchester Stadium is a stadium in Manchester, England. It is also called the Etihad Stadium, COMS or Eastlands. The stadium was designed by Arup and built by John Laing. It was first designed as part of Manchester's failed bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. The stadium was built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games at a cost of £110 million. After the Games, it was turned into a football stadium. It became the home of Manchester City F.C. who moved there from Maine Road in 2003 after signing a 250-year lease.\n\nThe stadium is shaped like a bowl. It has two levels all the way around. There is a third level along the two side stands. As of the start of the 2010/2011 season, it is the third-largest stadium in the FA Premier League and the ninth-largest in the United Kingdom, with 55,097 seats. The highest attendance for a football game at the stadium was on 6 February 2016 when 54,693 fans watched Manchester City play Leicester City. On 14 May 2008, it hosted the UEFA Cup Final.\n\nManchester City F.C. signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow redevelopment of land around the stadium. This may include adding more seats to make 60,000 in the stadium. Work on land around the stadium started in September 2010. The club is also talking with Manchester City Council to make a new lease on the stadium for the future.\n\nPlans to build a stadium in east Manchester were made around 1990 as part of the city's bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics. Manchester City Council paid for a design for an 80,000 seat stadium on a brownfield site known as \"Eastlands\". However, in October 1993, the games were awarded to Sydney, Australia. Manchester then made a successful bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games. They used the stadium plans from the Olympic bid. In 1996, the planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the national stadium. The money was used to redevelop Wembley instead.\nCity of Manchester Stadium's foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in December 1999. Construction began in January 2000. The stadium was designed by Arup and built by John Laing. The stadium cost about £110 million. £77 million of that was paid by Sport England and the rest was paid by the Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games, the stadium had one lower level along three sides of the athletics track. There was a second level on the two sides. It had an open-air temporary stand at one end. The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on 25 July 2002. Among the celebrities present at the ceremony was Queen Elizabeth II. During the ten days of competition, the stadium hosted all athletics events and the rugby sevens. Four Commonwealth records were set at the stadium, including the women's triple jump and the women's 5000 m.\n\nAfter the Commonwealth Games, the stadium was changed so it could be used as a football stadium. Athletics events had been very successful at the Commonwealth Games. Athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe therefore criticised the decision to change the stadium into a football stadium. Redevelopment was called necessary to give the stadium a future. Sections of the track were removed and placed at other athletics stadiums. The ground level was lowered to make way for another level of seating. The temporary stand was taken apart. It was replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took a year and added 12,000 seats. Manchester City F.C. moved to the new ground for the 2003–04 season. The change cost over £30 million. It was paid for by the football club.\n\nThe first public football match at the stadium was a friendly between Manchester City and Barcelona on 10 August 2003. Manchester City won the game 2–1. The first goal at the stadium was scored by Nicolas Anelka. The first competitive match followed four days later. It was a UEFA Cup game between Manchester City and Welsh Premier League side TNS. City won 5–0. Manchester City started the Premier League season with an away match. They beat Charlton 3–0. Their first home league match in their new stadium was not until 23 August. They drew 1-1 with Portsmouth. David Sommeil scored City's goal. Portsmouth's was scored by Yakubu Aiyegbeni. Their first Premier League win did not come until 14 September. Nicolas Anelka scored a hat-trick to help City beat Aston Villa 4–1. The record football attendance at the stadium is 47,348. It was set at a Premier League game against Chelsea on 5 December 2009.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted several other sporting events. It became the 50th stadium to host an England international football match when the English and Japanese national teams played on 1 June 2004. On 30 October of that year, it played host to a rugby league match between Great Britain and Australia in the Tri-Nations series. In June 2005, the stadium hosted England's opening game in the UEFA Women's Championship. It set an attendance record for the competition. It is rated as an elite stadium by UEFA. It hosted the 2008 UEFA Cup Final between Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg.\n\nThe stadium has a number of unofficial nicknames. \"Eastlands\" was used before the stadium was officially named. It is still commonly used. \"City of Manchester Stadium\" is sometimes abbreviated to \"COMS\" when written. \"The Blue Camp\", a pun on Barcelona's Nou Camp, has been used rarely. After the club was taken over by the Emirati Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008, some fans called the stadium \"Middle Eastlands\" as a joke. The stadium has generally received positive feedback from fans. It came in second behind Old Trafford in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom's favourite football ground. As Manchester City Council owns the stadium, it is also called the \"Council House\" by fans of City's rivals, Manchester United.\n\nThe stadium is owned by Manchester City Council. It is leased by the football club. The 2008 takeover made the football club the richest in the world. This led to rumors that the club could think about buying the stadium from the city.\n\nThe inside of the City of Manchester Stadium is a full oval bowl. It has three levels of seating at the sides and two levels at each end. While the seating is a full bowl, each side of the stadium has its own name. This is like other football grounds. At first, all sides of the stadium were named by compass direction (\"North Stand\" and \"South Stand\" for the ends, \"East Stand\" and \"West Stand\" for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the \"Colin Bell Stand.\" It was named in honour of the former player. The vote was almost stopped, as it was taken over by rival fans. They hoped the stand would be nicknamed \"The Bell End\" (even though the stand is to the side, not at an end). However, fans of the club made it clear they wanted the name to stay. The South Stand was officially named the \"Key 103 Stand\" for sponsorship reasons from 2003 to 2006. Fans mostly ignored this name for it. Part of the North Stand is called the \"Family Stand\". It is reserved for supporters with children. The East Stand is unofficially known to fans as \"the Kippax\". It is named after the East Stand from Maine Road. Supporters of visiting teams sit in part of the South Stand. There are 68 executive boxes within the stadium. They are along the West, North and East Stands.\n\nThe stadium roof is toroidal (like a doughnut) in shape. It is suspended from steel cables attached to eight towers. These provide access to the upper level of seating via spiral ramps. The areas without seating in each corner have movable louvres. This allows for air to move through the pitch. Entry is gained by contactless smart card rather than the usual manned turnstile. This system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute around all entrances. A service tunnel running under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles. It allows the visiting team's bus to enter the stadium directly. Inside the stadium are six themed restaurants. Two of restaurants have views of the pitch. There are also a number of conference facilities. The stadium is also licensed for marriage ceremonies.\n\nThe City of Manchester Stadium has a UEFA standard dimension pitch, . It has a natural grass pitch reinforced with artificial grass fibres made by Desso. There are 218 floodlights in the stadium. Each uses 2000 watts. In total they use 436,000 watts when they are all on.\n\nThe stadium is the centrepiece of an area known as Sportcity. It also includes several other sporting venues. Next to the stadium is the \"Manchester Regional Arena\". The Arena served as a warm-up track during the Commonwealth Games. It is now a 6,178 capacity venue that hosts national athletics trials and Manchester City reserve team games. The Manchester Velodrome and the National Squash Centre are close to the stadium. In September 2006, Manchester City received planning permission to build an wind turbine at the stadium. Designed by Norman Foster, the turbine was meant to give power for the stadium and nearby homes. Safety concerns about ice on the blades led to the proposal being stopped. From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, \"B of the Bang\", was present in front of the stadium. Built to honor the success of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, it was the tallest sculpture in the UK. However, structural problems led to the sculpture being taken apart in 2009.\n\nOn 30 January 2007, it was announced that the UK's first Super Casino would be built in the Sportcity area close to the stadium.\nPlans for this have since been stopped. It did receive authorisation from the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nMany people called The 2002 Commonwealth Games a huge success with the stadium gaining positive reviews for its atmosphere and architectural design.\n\nThe City of Manchester Stadium has won a number of design awards. This includes the 2004 Royal Institute of British Architects Inclusive Design Award for inclusive building design, and the 2003 Institution of Structural Engineers Structural Special Award.\n\nManchester City's reaction to the stadium was a mix of positive and negative. Some fans were not too excited about moving from the famous Maine Road, Maine Road had a reputation for having a great atmosphere and character. Others were happy about the bigger stadium and move back to east Manchester where Manchester City formed. A 2007 Premier League fan poll found that fans thought views at the stadium were second best in the Premier League after the Emirates Stadium. But the stadium had a problem common in modern stadia; the atmosphere was rated as second lowest in the league by City fans. Fans of opposing teams have generally given positive feedback. The stadium came in second behind Old Trafford in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom's favourite football ground.\n\nThe City of Manchester Stadium is to the east of Manchester city centre. The stadium site itself has 2,000 parking spaces. Another 8,000 spaces in the area around the stadium are provided by local businesses and schools working with the football club. The nearest railway station is Ashburys. It is a 20-minute walk south of the stadium. Services are limited due to the small size of the station. Manchester Piccadilly, which serves mainline trains from London, Birmingham and Edinburgh, is a 30-minute walk away. Several special bus services serve the stadium when events take place.\n\nAn extension to the Metrolink tram system with a stop at the stadium was announced in 2000. However, after a government spending review, the plan was put on hold in July 2004. In July 2006, funding for the extension was reinstated, but for a shorter length. A Sportcity Metrolink station opened on 11 February 2013.\n\nOutside the football season, the stadium hosts concerts. It is one of the UK's largest music venues. It has a maximum capacity of 60,000 for performances. The first concert at the stadium was a performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2004. They were supported by James Brown. Local band and vocal Manchester City supporters, Oasis, have played concerts at the stadium. One of their shows was featured on their DVD \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\". Another Manchester act, Take That, also released a DVD of their performance at the stadium, \"\".\n\nOther artists who have played the stadium are U2, Rod Stewart, Foo Fighters supported by Manic Street Preachers and The Futureheads, Bon Jovi & George Michael.\n\nSummer activities such as concerts and boxing matches often tear up the pitch. In 2008, end-of-season fixes, along with an early start to the football season, meant the pitch was not ready in time for the first scheduled home game. Because of this, Manchester City played their UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium.\n\n\n\n", "id": "130049", "title": "City of Manchester Stadium"}

At the 2006 census, 3227 people lived in Beechworth.\n\nBeechworth has many old buildings which have been well looked after. The town has changed from a gold field to a popular place for people to visit. Wine making is also an important activity around Beechworth.\n\nThe area was first used as a cattle farm by David Reid and was called Mayday Hills. In 1853 it was renamed Beechworth.\n\nFrom 1852-1857, Beechworth was an important gold area. Thousands of people moved to the area to dig for gold. One group of miners found 14 lb (about 7 kg) of gold in one gold pan (a small metal dish used separate gold from the soil). Another group found 50 lb (approx. 25 kg) of gold in a week. In the first election in 1855, one candidate, Daniel Cameron, rode a horse with solid gold horse shoes through the main street. This event is the reason the logo for Beechworth is a golden horse shoe, and the ride is remembered every year with the Golden Horseshoe Festival.\n\nBeechworth was a long way from the centre of colonial government in Melbourne, both in distance and time taken to get there. The railway was built to Beechworth in September 1876. By this time the miners had found most of the gold, and the town was no longer important. The rail line was closed in 1977 and the tracks were taken away, after 101 years of service. The rail line is now used as a walking and bicycle path.\n\nIn the gold rush, Beechworth had a tannery, jewelers, boot makers, a brewery, blacksmiths, and farm animal sale yards. It had schools, a convent, hotels, a prison with high stone walls, a hospital, a mental hospital, courthouse, police station, stage coach companies and a gunpowder magazine (building for storing gunpowder).\n\nIn the gold rush men and women came from the USA, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and China. At one time more than 30,000 people lived in Beechworth. Gold mining camps started up up as thousands of miners rushed into areas such as Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, Silver Creek, the Nine Mile Creek and the Woolshed. The Chinese were not allowed live in Beechworth and so they lived on the edge of town. There were many rules and laws to try to control the Chinese miners. Beechworth Cemetery has a large number of early Chinese miners graves. There was a lot of unrest and complaints about having the Chinese goldminers around Beechworth.\n\nRobert O'Hara Burke, leader of the Burke and Wills expedition was a policeman in Beechworth. He was the Senior Inspector of Police from 1854 to 1857.\n\nThe Burke Museum is in Loch Street and holds a lot of items on Beechworth and the local area. They have newspapers, photographs, artifacts, clothings, pictures, books on local history and other papers about the area. They have displays about the gold rush, Chinese miners and the gold diggings of the 1850s.\n\nThe bushranger Ned Kelly had many links to Beechworth. He was a prisoner in the gaol. He fought a famous boxing match with Isaiah 'Wild\" Wright in behind a local hotel. Aaron Sherritt and Joe Byrne of the Kelly Gang came from the Woolshed gold field, near Beechworth. Twenty-one men, thought to be friends or relatives of the Kelly Gang were prisoners in the gaol. They were held without trial or evidence for over 3 months, by the Chief Commissioner of Police, Captain Standish.\n\nSadlier was a policeman who became famous in the hunt for Ned Kelly in the 1870s. He had been a policeman in Beechworth during the gold rush.\n\nGeorge B. Kerferd (1836-1889) lived in Beechworth and became a Premier of Victoria. He helped Beechworth get a railway to Melbourne.\n\nCastieau (1831-1885)was the Prison Governor at Beechworth from 1856 to 1869. The prison, famous for its huge granite walls, was known as \"Castieau's Castle\". As the Governor of the Melbourne gaol in 1880 he was an official witness to the hanging of Ned Kelly.\n\nIn the gold rush Beechworth had 2 newspapers: \"The Ovens and Murray Advertiser\" and \"The Constitution and Mining Intelligencer\". \"The Ovens and Murray Advertiser\" is still a local paper printed each week.\n\nBeechworth is a popular place for visitors. Items to see are Ned Kelly displays at the old court house, Burke Museum, waterfalls, Gun Powder Magazine, Newtown Bridge (Stone Bridge), Tail Race (Mining Race), Spring Creek Water Falls, Spring Creek Gorge, Beechworth Asylum ghost tours, lakes, old buildings, goldfields, walks, the Beechworth Bakery, brewery, the Beechworth lolly shop and night tours.

Murray started a farm and built a 12-room house on the land in 1837. A post office opened at Collector in 1848. The village is named after the Australian aboriginal name for the area, \"colegadar\". The village was by-passed by the Federal Highway in 1988.\n\nThe Bushranger Hotel in Collector was the site of the shooting of policeman, Constable Samuel Nelson on 26 Jan 1865, by John Dunn.

They are a sister group to the Coelacanths and to the early lobe-finned fish which gave rise to the tetrapods. All these fish have paired appendages, fins or limbs, attached to a pelvis or shoulder by means of a single bone, the femur or humerus.\n\nThe living members of the group are special freshwater fish. They are the only living fish that have both lungs, as well as gills. They need this because they live in small lakes and rivers that sometimes dry up. When this happens, these fish don't die, but they can survive in the mud, for up to 4 years. They use their lungs during this time.

He is most notable for his theory of continental drift, which he proposed in 1912. This was the idea that the continents were slowly drifting around the Earth. At the time he was unable to demonstrate a mechanism for this movement, and other scientists thought it was simply impossible. His hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s when several discoveries gave evidence of continental drift.\n\nWegener was born in Berlin and in 1904 he earned his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Berlin. In 1914 he was drafted ('called up') into the German Army. After he was severely wounded he was transferred to the army weather service. \n\nThe theory had been proposed before, more than once. The first time was by the mapmaker Abraham Ortelius in the 16th century. \n\nWegener used geologic, fossil, and glacial evidence from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean to support his theory of continental drift. For example, he said that there were geological similarities between the Appalachian Mountains in North America, and the Scottish Highlands. Also, he said that the rock strata in South Africa and Brazil were similar.\n\nHe believed these similarities could be explained only if these geologic features were once part of the same continent. Wegener said that because they are less dense, continents float on top of the denser rock of the ocean floor. Although continental drift explained many of Wegener's observations, he could not find scientific evidence to make a complete explanation of how continents move.\n\nThe British geologist Arthur Holmes championed the theory of continental drift at a time when it was deeply unfashionable. He proposed in 1931 that the Earth's mantle contained convection cells that dissipated radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface. His \"Principles of Physical Geology\", ending with a chapter on continental drift, was published in 1944.\n\nHowever, most Earth scientists and palaeontologists did not believe Wegener's theory and thought it was foolish. Some critics thought the old theories of giant land bridges could explain the similarities among fossils in South America and Africa. Others argued that Wegener's theory did not explain the forces that would have been needed to move continents to such great distances. Wegener thought that the forces that moved the continents could be the same forces that made earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.\n\nDuring the 1950s, in the mid-atlantic ridge discoveries of sea-floor spreading and magnetic reversal proved that Wegener's theory was real and led to the theory of plate tectonics. Today geologists say that continents are actually parts of moving tectonic plates that float on the asthenosphere, a layer of partly molten rock.\n", "id": "130166", "title": "Alfred Wegener"}

Many of them were built in the 11th and 12th century around Europe. These structures were made on a hill (that was often artificial). On this hill, a keep of wood or stone was built. This was easy to build, and the materials were readily available and cheap. However, this meant they were easy to burn down. Also wood rots when it gets wet so the structure doesn't often last long and need lots of repairing. They used to be made out of wood but as time went by different types of castles made of stone became more common as they were much stronger. These were surrounded by a ditch and protected with a stone wall. Motte and bailey castles appeared in England after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Motte and bailey castles were a common feature in England by the death of William the Conqueror in 1087. Their construction was the start of what was to become a massive castle building programme in England and Wales.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130418", "text": "Cell\n\nIn biology, the cell is the basic structure of organisms. All cells are made by the division of other cells.\n\nThe environment outside the cell is separated from the inside of the cell by the cell membrane. Inside some cells, parts of the cell stay separate from other parts. These separate parts are called organelles (like small organs). They each do different things in the cell. Examples are the nucleus (where DNA is), and mitochondria (where usable energy is created).\n\nThere are two basic kinds of cells: prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea, are simple cells that have no cell nucleus. They do have bacterial microcompartments.\n\nEukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell. They are larger than prokaryote cells: they can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. Eukaryotes store their genetic information (DNA) on chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Organisms (living things) which are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes.\n\nThe only kinds of prokaryotic organisms alive at present are bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotic organisms evolved before eukaryotic organisms, so at one point the world consisted of nothing but prokaryotic organisms. There are also viruses, which are hard to classify, but cause some important diseases. Viruses are made of RNA, or DNA, and protein, and they reproduce themselves inside the cells of bacteria or eukaryotes.\n\nUnicellular organisms are made up of one cell. Examples of unicellular organisms are:\n\nUnicellular organisms need to:\n\nAll unicellular organisms must:\n\nSome may:\n\nMulticellular organisms are made from many cells. They are complex organisms. This can be a small number of cells, or millions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialized. This means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They live together, but cannot live alone.\n\nCells were discovered by Robert Hooke (1635–1703). He used a compound microscope with two lenses to look at the structure of cork, and to look at leaves and some insects. He did this from about 1660, and reported it in his book \"Micrographica\" in 1665. He named cells after the Latin word \"cella\", meaning room. He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms.\n\nMany other naturalists and philosophers tried out the new instrument. The structure of plants was investigated by Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694). Grew's major work was \"The anatomy of plants\" (1682). It is not clear who first saw animal cells, Malpighi, Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680) or Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723).\n\nLeeuwenhoek's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalules' opened up a whole new world for naturalists. Protozoa, and microorganisms generally were discovered, and the discoveries about them are still going on today. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg's book \"Die Infusionsthierchen\" summarised what was known in 1838. Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) in 1805 wrote that infusoria (microscopic forms) were the basis of all life. \n\nThe idea that cells were the basis of the larger forms of life came in the 18th century. Finding out who did the work has taken some time:\n\nThe cell theory includes these important ideas: \n\nThe body cells of metazoans divide by simple mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is ancestral in eukaryotes, and in metazoa it is carried out by specialised sex cells. They are produced by a process called meiosis. \n\nProkaryotic cells reproduce using binary fission, where the cell simply splits in half. For both mitosis and binary fission the cell must replicate (copy) all its genetic information (DNA) so that each new cell will have a copy.\n", "id": "130418", "title": "Cell"}

She was said to be the \"Iron Lady\" \"(a strong minded woman)\" of Israel's politics years before that name became said about the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Meir was Israel's first and so far only female prime minister. She was the world's third female prime minister. The two biggest events of her time as prime minister were the murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. After questions about her handling of the war, Meir resigned from her job even though she had been found to be not to blame for problems with the war.\n\nHer name at birth was Golda Mabovitch () in Kiev in the former Russian Empire (today Ukraine), to Blume Naidich and Moshe Mabovitch, a carpenter. The family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Her father found a job as a carpenter, and her mother ran a grocery store. At the age of eight, she was already put in charge of watching the store when her mother went to the market for supplies. At age 14, Golda went to North Division High School and worked part-time. Her mother wanted her to leave school and marry, but she did not. She ran away from home and bought a train ticket to Denver, Colorado, and went to live with her married sister, Sheyna Korngold. The Korngolds held evening meetings at their home where Meir learned about the Jew's desire for a country of their own, literature, women's rights, trade unions and more. In Denver, she also met Morris Meyerson, a sign painter, whom she later married at the age of 19.\n\nThe two biggest things to happen during her time as prime minister were; the murder of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games by the terrorist group Black September, and the twenty day war called the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab states led by Egypt and Syria in October 1973.\n\nThe Yom Kippur War was from October 6 to October 26, 1973 and was between a group of Arab countries led by Syria and Egypt against Israel. Israel was surprised by the attack and after the Yom Kippur War, the government was asked questions about Israel's not being ready for the war. A group of people who were asked to look into the war cleared her of direct blame, and her party won the elections in December 1973, but she left on April 11 1974, because of what she felt the people of Israel wanted. Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister after her on June 3 1974.\n\nIn 1975, Meir was awarded the Israel Prize for her services to the State of Israel.\n\nOn December 8 1978, Golda Meir died of cancer in Jerusalem at the age of 80.

The final version of Windows 7 was sent to PC makers on July 22nd, 2009, so that they have three months to change it and include it with their computers. Windows 7 was released to the public on October 22nd, 2009.\n\nFirst, a beta version of Windows codenamed \"Blackcomb\" was planned as the successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Big features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on looking for data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such situations. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed \"Longhorn\" was announced for 2003, delaying the making of Blackcomb. By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had gotten some of the features meant for Blackcomb. After three major viruses exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while they made new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Development of Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also \"reset\", or delayed in September 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn.\n\nBlackcomb was renamed \"Vienna\" in early 2006, and again to \"Windows 7\" in 2007. In 2008, it was announced that \"Windows 7\" would also be the official name of the operating system.\n\nThe first known build was called Milestone 1. It was just a customized version of Windows Vista and it had a send feedback feature since it was a pre-release version.\n\nThe next build was called Milestone 2. It had a new taskbar and got Windows Live v 3.1.1.0.\n\nThe third Milestone was released in September 2008. It looked like Vista, but it had a new Action Center instead of the Security Center. The action center shows messages for many more stuff, not just security for Windows.\n\nBuild 6801 was a customized version of Milestone 3 that was shown at the Professional Developers Conference and was given to the people that were there.\n\nBuild 6933 was shown at PDC but was not given to the people attending. In December 2008, a leaked version of build 6956 was available for download on Peer To Peer networks.\n\nOn January 9th 2009, build 7000 was released as a public beta.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130710", "text": "Fellatio\n\nFellatio is oral sex performed on the penis. Fellatio is often called a blow job. The opposite of this is cunnilingus. Cunnilingus is oral sex performed on the vulva. \nFellatio can continue until the receiver ejaculates or as part of foreplay, before actual sexual intercourse. Fellatio began in what is called pornography.\n\nThere is no risk of getting pregnant by performing a fellatio, because there is no connection from the mouth to the womb and the fallopian tubes. There is however a large risk of transmitting diseases if the mouth comes in contact with semen on the penis. If the person drinks alcoholic drinks, it can make this risk higher. HIV can also enter through open sores or bleeding gums. \n\nVery few people are allergic to semen. Some claim that swallowing ejaculate is an intimate act. \n\nDiseases such as Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), as well as viruses such as HIV, can be transmitted through oral sex. The risk of transmitting HIV through fellatio is unknown, but it is thought to be low. Any kind of direct contact with body fluids of a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. The risk from most of these types of infection, however, is generally considered far lower than that associated with vaginal or anal sex.\n\nIf the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of STD transmission. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, or eating crunchy foods such as potato crisps relatively soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STDs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions. Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in, around and secreted from the genital regions. Because of this, some medical professionals advise the use of condoms when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STD status is unknown. Flavoured condoms may be used for this purpose.\n\nMany people accuse someone of performing fellatio as an insult. For example 'cock sucker!' or 'suck my dick'. \nMany cultures see fellatio as showing control over ones partner, as often the giver is on their knees. In ancient Greece it was called \"playing the flute\". The Moche people of ancient Peru practiced it regularly and made vases showing it.\n\n", "id": "130710", "title": "Fellatio"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130711", "text": "Halo 3\n\nHalo 3 is a first-person shooter video game made by Bungie Studios for the Xbox 360, published by Microsoft. The game brings an end to the story started in the two previous video games of the Halo series; \"\" and \"Halo 2\". The game came out on September 25, 2007 all over the world, except Europe and Japan where it was released on September 26.\nMicrosoft made 4.2 million copies of \"Halo 3\" for the first day of sales to make sure there were enough copies.\n\nThe game's story is based around a future war between a fictional alien race known as \"the Covenant\" and the human race. The player takes the role of Master Chief, a genetically enhanced \"super soldier\" who fights for the human race. The player is helped through the story by marines and another alien race known as \"the elites\". The game had many new features that were not in the first two games including more vehicles, weapons and equipment.\n\nSales of the game added up to over $900 billion USD in its first week. More than a million people played the game on Xbox Live in the first 24 hours of its release.\nBy January 1, 2008 it had sold over 8 million copies making it the best selling video game of 2007.\nThe game was mostly well-reviewed in the press. It received a 94 out of 100 rating on Metacritic, a website that puts many reviews together and gives an average score.\n\nThe gameplay in \"Halo 3\" is similar to the gameplay in \"\" and \"Halo 2\" but with added features. It is a first-person shooter that takes place mostly on foot but with sections that have vehicles the player can drive. A player can carry a range of weapons including sniper rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and alien weapons such as \"beam rifles\" and \"needlers\". Unlike the old games, during multiplayer all weapons a player is carrying can be seen on the player. This includes side holsters for pistols and larger weapons that can be slung across the players back. \"Halo 3\" also introduces 'support weapons', large two handed weapons that slow the players movement but do a lot of damage. Two examples include the flamethrower and a heavy machine gun, which are new to \"Halo 3\". The game also included a map-editor called \"forge\" where players can create their own arenas and battlegrounds to fight in. Almost all weapons and objects in a level can be moved or deleted in forge mode. The game also has \"theater\" mode which lets players record some of their best kills or plays from multiplayer mode. The last 20 games played are automatically saved, although this feature needs an Xbox 360 hard drive to work. These movies can be uploaded to Bungie's website where other people can download them and watch them on their PC.\n\n\"Halo 3's\" story mode contains nine levels. It finishes the story of the \"Halo\" trilogy. The story can be played alone, with a friend on the same console or with four players over Xbox Live. The first player takes control of Master Chief, the second player plays as the leader of the Elites, \"Arbiter\" and the last two as elites themselves. There are skulls hidden through the levels. If they are found by any of the players the gameplay changes in some way. For example one skull makes confetti and balloons appear when a player gets a headshot and another makes all enemies stronger and tougher.\n\nA multiplayer game can have up to four people on one console, or up to sixteen players over Xbox Live. There are many different types of multiplayer games. There is a death match, where the goal is to kill all the players (called \"Slayer\" in Halo). There are capture the flag games with two teams (eight people on each team). In capture the flag, each team has their own flag. The goal of the game is to steal the enemy flag, and take it back to base to score a point. Aside from these there are also team games. These games can have two, six, or eight players on each team.\n\nThere is a ranking system in Halo 3 that matches players with other players of the same ability, to make sure it is a fair game. The ranks are based on real life military ranks. The lowest is corporal but players can progress all the way up to general. Because multiplayer Halo is often played online there is a mute option, which lets any one player blank out the voice of any other player if they are being insulting or annoying.\n\nThe game is set in the same fictional world as the rest of the Halo series. Most of the game takes place in the future year 2553, over 500 years from now. In the storyline humans have developed faster than light travel, and now live on many planets and moons of the Solar System. When humanity started to build another settlement on a planet around another star they met the alien \"Covenant\". The Covenant declared religious war on humanity. During Halo 2 the Covenant discovered Earth. At the start of Halo 3, the Covenant are launching a full-scale invasion of Earth.\n\nThe Halo of the games title is the name of a series of space super weapons built by a mysterious race called the Forerunners a long time before the game. The Halo's are the last defence against another alien race known as \"the Flood\". The Flood want to use every living thing in the galaxy for food. The Halos are actually giant super weapons, that when activated, will kill all life in the galaxy. This is the only way to stop the Flood,to starve them by killing all their food. The Covenant do not know this and are attempting to fire Halos as part of a wrong religious prophecy. In the first Halo game, , the humans and Master Chief manage to stop the Covenant from firing one of the Halos. They also destroy one of them in the process. The destruction of one of the Halos starts an emergency. The Halos can now \"all\" be fired from one place, using a device called \"the Ark\". The Covenant, still not understanding the truth, launch an invasion of Earth, where they believe the Ark is buried. This is where the \"Halo 3\" story starts.\n\nThe main character of \"Halo 3\", as in all the Halo games, is Master Chief. Master Chief is a super soldier, the last surviving member of the Spartan Project. The Spartan Project was started by humans to genetically, using genes, make soldiers who were stronger, faster and tougher than any normal human. Another character from Halo 1 and 2, controlled by the second player in a co-op game is \"Arbiter\", the leader of the alien Elites. In \"Halo 2\" he is an enemy but in \"Halo 3\" he joins forces with the humans. Other returning characters include the veteran human soldier \"sagent Avery Johnson\", the AI \"Cortana\", the robot \"343 Guilty Spark\" and \"the Gravemind\", dangerous leader of the Flood.\n\n\"Halo 3\" begins where Halo 2 left off. The player once again plays as Master Chief as he falls towards Earth. He crashes in Kenya near the city of Mombasa. He is found by a squad of marines led by sergeant Avery Johnson, the commander from Halo and Halo 2. The player and the marines fight their way through invading Covenant force to a human outpost. Here they find human forces making a last attempt to stop the Covenant from activating a they found buried in the Kenyan desert. They are unsuccessful however, and the Covenant open the portal to the Ark, where they will be able to fire the Halos and destroy the galaxy. \nJust after the Covenant fleet of spacecraft leave the portal, a big ship crashes into the city of Mombasa. This ship has been taken over by the Flood. The player as Master Chief, must fight their way into the ruined spacecraft and recover the robot Cortana who can tell them the way to re-open the portal and follow the Covenant. Once the player is successful, the humans re-open the portal and head after the Covenant to stop them firing the Halos. Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark, one of the robots who helped build the destroyed Halo from the first game. Once through the portal the player and his allies discover the huge, planet-sized structure known as the Ark, where all the Halos can be fired from. Led by 343 Guilty Spark the player makes their way to the centre of the Ark where the Covenant leader, the Prophet of Truth is preparing to fire.\n\nJust as the player arrives to stop the Prophet of Truth, the Flood infested ship \"High Charity\", arrives in an attempt to take over the Ark. The player, Arbiter and Johnson now take out all the Flood in the area before Arbiter kills the Prophet of Truth and prevents the Halos from being fired. There is no time for the player to rest however, as he must now head to the nuclear reactor at the center of the Flood infested spacecraft, \"High Charity\" in an effort to kill the Flood. Once this is complete, the player and Arbiter must go and activate \"one\" Halo ring. This will destroy the Ark and kill all the Flood in this area of the Milky Way Galaxy whilst saving the rest. The player and the Arbiter head off to activate the single Halo and save the Galaxy. \nWhen they arrive 343 Guilty Spark warns them that activating this Halo will destroy the whole Ark and the Halo itself. The player ignores the warning. This angers 343 Guilty Spark. He kills Sergent Johnson, and attempts to kill Master Chief to keep'his' Halo from being destroyed. This is in effect the final 'boss battle' of the game. The player defeats the robot, and activates the Halo. A countdown starts but it too late for the player as Master Chief and the AI Cortana. They manage to board a spacecraft to take them away but it is caught in the explosion and is split in two. Master Chief is assumed dead.\n\nIf the player completes the game on any difficulty, after the credits you see that the Master Chief and Cortana survived. If you finish the game on the \"Legendary\" difficulty you can see an alternate ending after the credits.\n\nThe first work was started on \"Halo 3\" before the release of Halo 2 in 2004. Through 2004/2005 Bungie refused to confirm they were working on \"Halo 3\", only saying that they had a 'new project'. The game was officially announced with a trailer at E3 2006. While details of the multiplayer were openly announced and talked about before release, details of the story were kept mostly secret until the day of the launch. \nThere are over 40,000 recorded clips of Non Player Character (NPC) dialogue in Halo 3. That is more than twice times as many for Halo 2. Separate sound recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make a more believable experience. Like Halo 1 and 2 the game has its own especially recorded classical soundtrack. The music was recorded with a 27 piece choir and a 60 piece orchestra.\n\n Various marketing ideas were used to promote the release of Halo 3. A Beta, unfinished version, of the multiplayer mode was released with the Microsoft game Crackdown a few months before the actual release. The advertising campaign cost an estimated $10 million US dollars. The 'Believe' campaign was a high profile launch on television, radio, billboards and other high profile places. It focused on the epic quality of the games storyline. The game's tagline or key phrase was \" 'finish the fight' \". Pepsi also announced a new energy drink called Game Fuel. It had an image of Master Chief and the Halo 3 logo on the packaging. Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft personally sold copies of the game at a Washington game store.\n\n\"Halo 3\" sales reached $170 million within 24 hours, making it the biggest selling entertainment product launch in US history. It beat the previous record set by Halo 2 in 2004. It was the best selling video game of 2007 in the US, despite only being available on Xbox 360. On January 3, 2008 Microsoft announced \"Halo 3\" has sold 8.1 million copies worldwide.\n\nHalo 3 was mostly given very good reviews in the media. On Metacritic the game has an average score of 94 out of 100. This was an average from 74 reviews. The multiplayer was often given praise and IGN said that the multiplayer was 'the strongest of the series so far'.\nThe music to the campaign was also highly praised, along with the voice acting. The main bad points from reviews were the short length of the story mode and the AI of your allies. Bryan Vore of gamecritics said that some parts of the story mode were 'embarrassing'. Nevertheless he still said the full game was a 'masterpiece'.\n\nHalo 3 has one of the largest amounts of players online of games. The online multiplayer has many different game types such as 4 vs 4, 2 vs 2, 8 vs 8 and a lot more. In most gametypes, the player spawns (comes to life) with an Assault Rifle or a Battle Rifle, but other games have other weapons (like Shotty Snipers, which has a Shotgun and a Sniper). Some games require working as a team, while others require single skills. Increasing your skill and timing is important to win in Halo 3, just like every other game.\n\n", "id": "130711", "title": "Halo 3"}

He began playing for the national team in 2006.\n\nDel Piero is considered among the best talents that Italian football has ever produced. In 2004, he was included in the FIFA 100, a list of 125 greatest living players. In 1999, he was listed 77th in the list of the best players of the 20th century published by World Soccer magazine. He is one of five Italian players to score over 300 goals (312 as pf 6 November 2010) along with Filippo Inzaghi (315), Roberto Baggio (318), Giuseppe Meazza (338) and Silvio Piola (364).\n\nDel Piero is the son of Gino, an electrician, and Bruna, a housekeeper. He regularly played football in the backyard with two friends, Nelso and Pierpaolo as a child. All three dreamed of becoming footballers, but only Del Piero would eventually manage to do so. Alessandro's older brother, Stefano, briefly played professional football for Sampdoria before injury struck him. The family lived in the hamlet of Saccon near San Vendemiano. While growing up, Del Piero's family did not have much money for travelling abroad, so he was considering being a truck driver in order to see the world.\n\nDel Piero played for the local youth team of San Vendemiano since the age of 7. He used to play as a goalkeeper because he could play a lot more football that way. His mother thought it would be better for him if he played as a goalkeeper, since he would not have to run and the possibility of him getting injured was less likely. His brother told their mother that Alex was better at attacking and Del Piero switched position.\n\nIt was while playing with his local side of San Vendemiano in 1988 that Del Piero was first spotted by scouts.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130839", "text": "Eratosthenes\n\nEratosthenes of Cyrene (276 –194 ) was a third century BC Greek mathematician, geographer and astronomer. He was head of the Library of Alexandria from 240 until his death: this was the most important library of the ancient world. \n\nAccording to the Suda, his contemporaries nicknamed him \"Beta\", (the second letter of the Greek alphabet), because he was the second best in the world in almost any field. Eratosthenes was a friend of Archimedes, who also lived and worked in Alexandria. Archimedes was the greatest mathematician and inventor of the age, so perhaps the Beta nickname was not unjust.\n\nThe works Eratosthenes wrote are known to us only indirectly: the great Library was destroyed, and no copies survived. Strabo (~63–24) wrote about geography in antiquity. He tells us that the works of Eratosthenes were \"On the measurement of the Earth\" and \"Geographica\".\n\nEratosthenes made several remarkable discoveries and inventions. He was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth (with remarkable accuracy), and he invented a system of latitude and longitude. He calculated the tilt of the earth's axis (again with remarkable accuracy); he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day. He created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era. Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy.\n\nEratosthenes measured the circumference of the Earth without leaving Egypt. He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon at the city now called Aswan on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead. He also knew, from measurement, that in Alexandria, the angle of elevation of the sun would be 1/50 of a full circle (7°12') south of the zenith at the same time. \n\nAssuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 1/50 of the total circumference of the Earth (360 degrees). His estimated distance between the cities was 5000 stadia (about 500 geographical miles or 800 km) by estimating the time that he had taken to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel. He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. The exact size of the stadion he used is frequently argued. The common Attic stadium was about 185 m, which would imply a circumference of 46,620 km, which is 16.3% too large. However, if we assume that Eratosthenes used the \"Egyptian stadium\" of about 157.5 m, his measurement turns out to be 39,375 km, an error of less than 1%. The method is an early application of trigonometry in the measurement science of geodesy. \n\nIn mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους) is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It works efficiently for the smaller primes (below 10 million).\nThe sieve was described and attributed to Eratosthenes in the \"Introduction to Arithmetic\" by Nicomachus.\nEratosthenes went further and computed the tilt of the Earth's axis to within a degree. This is the tilt which is the main cause of the annual climate cycle of spring, summer, autumn, winter. He also deduced the length of the year as 365¼ days. He suggested that calendars should have a leap day every fourth year, an idea taken up two centuries later by Julius Caesar.\n", "id": "130839", "title": "Eratosthenes"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=130911", "text": "Racism\n\nRacism is the belief that some races are better than others, and the actions which result from those beliefs. For example, during The Holocaust, Nazis in Germany believed that some races did not even deserve to exist. These beliefs were racist. Because of those beliefs, they killed many people who belonged to those races. Those actions, which resulted from their racist beliefs, were also racist.\n\nRacism has existed throughout human history. It has influenced wars, slavery, the creation of nations, and laws. However, racism has never been the \"only\" cause of wars and slavery. Leaders often used racism to make their actions seem all right. For example, the Nazis used the idea that Slavic peoples were less than human to make it seem all right to take over those people's countries.\n\nHumans often categorize themselves by race or ethnicity. They do this based on ancestry, as well as visible traits like skin color and facial features. People of the same ethnic group are often connected by ancestry, speaking the same language, having the same culture, and living in the same places.\n\nHowever, scientists say that humans do not really fit well into these categories, biologically. The DNA of people from different races is very similar. Evidence from genetics and archaeology suggests that all humans came from the same group of early humans in East Africa. This means that different races did not appear at different times. All humans came from the same race, and separated into different races later.\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, Europeans began using the term \"Aryan\" to refer to the original prehistoric Proto-Indo-Europeans and their descendants up to the present day (i.e., the Indo-European peoples—those Caucasians who speak the Indo-European languages). It was also assumed at the time, that, Aryans were a culturally superior people. By the late 19th century, some Europeans began to use the name \"Aryan\" for only the Nordic peoples of Europe (one branch of the Indo-European peoples), as a \"pure,\" \"noble\" and racially \"superior\" race they claimed were descended from the original Aryan tribes. The theory that the Aryans first came from Europe became especially popular in Germany and to a lesser degree in Austria and Hungary.\nThere was much prejudice based upon this perception of the world as the Europeans and Orientals both regarded them selves as superior to the other skin colours, which lead to African slavery, Apartheid, the Jim Crow Laws, Nazism and Japanese imperialism.\n\nWhen Europeans came to America, they killed thousands of Native Americans and when the European settlers got to Australia, they started killing off large numbers of Aborigines.\n\nWith the birth of their empires, many other native tribes suffered in Canada, New Zealand, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.\n\nJapan also held similar beliefs about Chinese and Koreans in their colonies.\n\nRacism in the U.K., Ireland and France was usually about limiting the rights of Jews, Roma and minorities like the French Basques.\n\nAs the countries became independent after the 1950s, many migrated to the U.K. and France, but were decremented against. Some British cafes and hotels would not welcome in Caribbean guests and the French made Arabs feel unwelcome in some French towns as well. Since the 1960s, India, Pakistani and Bangladeshi people have moved to the U.K. and been victimised and 'Paki-bashed'. 9/11, 2001, has heightened the French and British fears about Islam and Arabs in general. Polish and Brazilian migrant labours are also discriminated against in some places. Racist parties like the U.K.'s British National Party and National Front trade on these fears to get votes.\n\nAlleged scientific findings of racial differences were used by Nazi Germany to justify the racialist policy with its concept of \"Großdeutschland\" (Greater Germany) and the Nordic race idea. The Nazis' attitude towards the Jews were anti-Semitic and falsely blamed them for Germany's defeat in World War I and the Great Depression. The Nazis and some of their anti-Semitic allies, like Hungary, committed genocide against the Jews during the Holocaust of World War II.\n\nBoth the Nazis and Romania's Iron Guard also persecuted the Roma, who were considered part of the allegedly inferior 'Indic' race. During World War II, the Nazis embarked on a systematic attempt at genocide of the Roma, known as the \"Porajmos\". The Nazis also knowingly killed of thousands of Slavs, lesbians, Communists, liberals and gays.\n\nFascist Benito Mussolini, in a 1919 speech to denounce Soviet Russia, claimed that Jewish bankers in London and New York City were bound by the chains of race to Moscow, and claimed that 80 percent of the Soviet leaders were Jews.\n\nMany Italian fascists held anti-Slavist views, especially against neighbouring Yugoslav nations, who they saw as being in competition with Italy, which had laid claim to the Yugoslavia's region of Dalmatia.\n\nMussolini said Italy would get its own way and was willing to use force to settle arguments. An early example was Italy's bombardment of the Greek island of Corfu in 1923. Soon after he succeeded in setting up a puppet regime in Albania and crushed a rebellion in Libya, which had been an Italian colony since 1912.\n\nItaly, like Germany, Austria and Hungary regarded all Slavs and Roma as stupid, racially inferior due to the effects of Social Darwinism and undeserving of their basic rights. Anti-Arab discrimination was also used in parts of Libya.\n\nThe Iron Guard was an antisemitic fascist movement and political party in Romania from 1927 to 1941. They despised and denounced both Jews and the Roma.\n\nAmerican racism has been a major issue in the country since before its founding. Historically dominated by White settler society, race in the United States as a concept became significant in relation to other groups. Generally racist attitudes in the country have been most onerously applied to Native Americans, African Americans and some \"foreign-seeming\" action against Mexican immigrants among others. The Chinese, Japanese and Irish had trouble in America, during the 19th century, but the Blacks fell foul of the Jim Crow Laws which once racially separated the racist parts of America between Blacks and Whites. These first emerged in the late 19th Century and lasted to the mid 1960s and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nMillions of Africans were killed while they were held as prisoners or as slaves by the Europeans and Arabs. The African-American people and some others call this \"The Black Holocaust\".\n\nThe United States' legal system has been accused of racism. 40% of the prison population are black. 12% of the general population is black. Black people are more likely than white people to be sentenced to death for a crime.\nThe New York Police Department stop-and-frisk program has been accused of racial profiling.\n\nThe book To Kill A Mockingbird is a well-known American novel largely focusing on race in the Jim Crow era, described earlier.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the two most popular nationalist political parties are the British National Party (BNP) and the UK Independence Party (UKIP). There is also a group called the English Defense League (EDL). They are thought to be racist by a lot of people. They are against unlimited immigration and colonization by the disciples of Islam. Although Muslims can be of any race, they are usually South Asian. Muslims traditionally practice and ordain the Shariah Law (which traditionally punishes criminals with public amputations and stoning). In a 2013 poll, 27% of 1000 British people aged between 18 and 24 said that they did not trust Muslims.\nIn the United Kingdom most people are white. 7% are Asian and 3% are black. 4.83% of the British population are Muslims.\n\nSouth African Apartheid laws were a system was used to deny many rights of non-white people. They started in 1948. The laws allowed the white minority to keep the Black majority out of certain areas. Black people had to carry special papers (passes) or have permission to live and work in particular areas. Whites opposed intermarriage with non-whites and coloured people were also discriminated against, but not as badly as the non-whites. The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between persons of different races and the Immorality Act of 1950 made sexual relations with a person of a different race a criminal offence. The blacks suffered greatly and were even banned from voting at one point. Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994. Mandela ended apartheid. Currently, racial quota laws discriminate against Whites in South Africa. The Black President Zuma of South Africa publicly sings \"Kill The Boer\", which means, Kill the White [Farmer]\". Genocidewatch.org reports that the White South Africans are facing genocide.\n\nThe Imperial Rule Assistance Association (\"Taisei Yokusankai\") was a coalition of fascist and nationalist political movements of Japan such as the Imperial Way Faction (\"Kōdōha\") and the Society of the East (\"Tōhōkai\"). It was formed under the guidance of Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe Prior to creation of the IRAA, Konoe had already effectively nationalized strategic industries, the news media, and labour unions, in preparation for total war with China. Japan needed more land, minerals and colonies, so they annexed Korea, Manchuria and part of China. The Japanese regarded the Chinese, Koreans and Europeans as an inferior race that should be crushed and exploited.\n\nWhen Konoe's successor, Hideki Tōjō took over the IRAA he attempted to establish himself as the absolute leader, or \"Shogun\", of Japan, under the Emperor of Japan.\n\nSome Japanese people still believe that they did not commit as many massacres as the Western World and China said they did.\n\nWith the revelations of the holocaust, as well as worldwide antiracist efforts, old ideas about race changed and, more slowly, some prejudices about race faded. The civil rights movement tried to liberate persons of African origin from racist white supremacist rule in South Africa and the southern USA. Blacks could vote in South Africa after a 50 year ban.\n\nIn some cases positive discrimination and political correctness have taken the situation to the opposite extreme, leading to accusations in the UK, USA and Australia of reverse racism, that is to say racism in favor, not against the ethnic minorities. 'Political correctness' is a term applied to language, ideas, policies, or behavior seen as seeking to minimize offense to gender, racial, cultural, disabled, aged or other identity groups. Conversely, the term \"politically incorrect\" is used to refer to language or ideas that may cause offense or that are unconstrained by orthodoxy or good manners (e.g. racists and Islamophobes).\n\nThe growth of the Hispanic population through immigration from Mexico and elsewhere, combined with and high birth rates, are a factor in the USA's rising population in the last quarter-century. The 2000 census also found Native Americans/Amerindians at their highest population ever, 4.5 million, since the U.S was founded in 1776.\n\n", "id": "130911", "title": "Racism"}

During limb development in a foetus, apoptosis allows body digits (fingers and toes) to separate from each other. The process is most prevalent until puberty begins. The rate of apoptosis should be balanced by the rate of cell production via mitosis.\n\nThe phenomenon of programmed cell death was first described by Carl Vogt in 1842. However, it was only in 1965 that John Foxton Ross Kerr researched the idea extensively. Using electron microscopy, he was successfully able to distinguish between necrosis and apoptosis. He then joined the research team of Professor Currie and Andrew Wyllie who, in 1972, published a report on their findings in the \"British Journal of Cancer\". They used the term \"apoptosis\" as used by Hippocrates to mean \"bones falling off\". \n\nWhen a cell dies by apoptosis, surrounding tissue is not harmed. <br>\n1. Enzymes break down the cytoskeleton of the cell.<br>\n2. Cytoplasm becomes dense, with organelles tightly packed.<br>\n3. Cell surface membrane forms \"blebs\".<br>\n4. Chromatin condenses and the nuclear envelope breaks. DNA breaks into fragments.<br>\n5. The cell breaks down into vesicles, taken up by phagocytosis. \n\nApoptosis is the normal end of a cell's life. At any point in time, there may be too many cells in one area, and the DNA\ncoding for apoptosis will activate in some of those cells and they will die safely. This is important to the overall functioning of the organism. If, for example, the making of liver cells were to speed up and they never died, the liver would no longer function properly. The liver cells would eventually take over the organism's body. Apoptosis takes place by the help of lysosomes. Lysosomes rupture when the cell is old or damaged, this lets out digestive enzymes all over the cell and digests it, therefore killing the cell.\n\nCancerous cells do not undergo apoptosis, and that is why they are such a problem. They continuously multiply until the host organ or the organism's body cannot function anymore. This occurs because the apoptosis coding has mutated and so has other coding. This causes rapid mitotic division of the unwanted cells. This is a cancerous growth. \n", "id": "130918", "title": "Apoptosis"}

They are important for fighting infections. They are also important for becoming immune. Phagocytes are important in all animals and are very complex in vertebrates. One liter of human blood has about six billion phagocytes. \n\nTheir name comes from the Greek \"phagein\", 'to eat or devour ', and \"kutos\", 'hollow vessel'. Phagocytes were first seen in 1882 by Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov. Phagocytes can be found in many animals. Some amoebae behave like macrophages, and scientists think macrophages evolved a long time ago.\n\nPhagocytes of humans and other animals are called professional or non-professional, depending on how good they are at phagocytosis. The professional phagocytes are neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. The reason they are called professional phagocytes is because they have receptors on their surfaces which can detect harmful objects, such as bacteria. Phagocytes are very important in fighting infections and in getting rid of dead and dying cells.\n\nWhen there is an infection, phagocytes move to the bacteria by sensing chemicals. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes that are already there. The phagocytes move by a way called chemotaxis. When bacteria touch a phagocyte, they bind to the receptors on the phagocyte and are eaten (phagocytosed). When bacteria enter some phagocytes, the phagocytes use oxidants and nitric oxide to kill the pathogen. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can also do 'antigen presentation': this is when the phagocyte moves parts of the killed bacteria back to its surface. These parts are then shown to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then move to the body's lymph nodes and show the bacterial parts to white blood cells called lymphocytes. This action is important in getting immunity. \n\nMany bacteria have ways to not be eaten or killed by phagocytes. They may avoid contact by\n", "id": "130919", "title": "Phagocyte"}

However, in 1933, Linus Pauling said that heavy noble gases could react with fluorine or oxygen, as they are the most electronegative atoms. His prediction was correct, and xenon hexafluoride (XeF) was later discovered.

The electronegativity of an atom is influenced by the atom's atomic number and the distance between the atom's valence electrons (the outermost electrons that take part in chemical bonding) and its nucleus. It was first theorised by Linus Pauling in 1932 as part of his valence bond theory, and is related to other chemical properties. Generally, electronegativity increases from the bottom-left to the upper-right of the periodic table; this is known as a periodic trend.\n\nThere are many ways to calculate the electronegativity of an atom. The most common way of calculation is the one suggested by Linus Pauling, and it gives the relative Pauling scale. This scale gives elements dimensionless quantities (values) between 0.7 to 3.98, with hydrogen being at 2.20.\n\nThe opposite of electronegativity is electropositivity; the measure of how well an atom gives away electrons.\n\nPauling suggested the idea of electronegativity in 1932 to explain why the strength of a covalent bond between two different atoms (A-B) is stronger than the average of the strengths of the covalent bonds A-A and B-B. His valence bond theory said that this stronger bond between different atoms is caused by the ionic effects to the bonding.\n\nThe difference between the electronegativity of atom A and atom B is\n\nwhere the dissociation energies (that is, the energy needed to break the bond between the atoms), \"E\", of A-B, A-A and B-B bonds are given in electronvolts, and the factor (eV) is added to make sure the final answer has no unit. With the above formula, we can calculate the difference in elecronegativity between hydrogen and bromine to be 0.73. (dissociation energies: H-Br, 3.79 eV; H-H, 4.52 eV; Br-Br, 2.00 eV)\n\nThe above equation only calculates the difference in electronegativity between two elements. To make a scale from the equation, a reference point has to be chosen. Hydrogen was chosen as a reference point because it bonds covalently with many elements. Hydrogen's electronegativity was first fixed at 2.1, but was later changed to 2.20. Another thing that need to be known to make an electronegativity scale is which element is more electronegative than the reference point, which is hydrogen. This is often done with the so-called \"chemical intuition\": in the above example, hydrogen bromide (H-Br) dissolves in water and breaks into H cation and Br anion. So, it can be assumed that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen.\n\nTo calculate Pauling electronegativity for an element, the data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bonds created by the element is needed. In 1961, A. L. Allred improved Pauling's original data to include the thermodynamic data that is much more available. These \"revised Pauling\" electronegativity values are used more often.\n\nElectropositivity is a measure of an element's ability to donate electrons, and form positive ions. \n\nMainly, this is an attribute of metals. The alkali metals have a single electron in their outer shell and it is easily lost. These metals have low ionization energies.\n", "id": "131074", "title": "Electronegativity"}

He is one of a small group of people to have been given more than one Nobel Prize. He is one of only two people to receive them in different fields (the other person was Marie Curie) and the only person in that group to have been awarded each of his prizes without having to share it with another winner. \n\nPauling was born and grew-up in Oregon, USA. He went to Oregon Agricultural College and graduated in 1922 with a degree in chemical engineering. Pauling then went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he received his Ph. D in physical chemistry and mathematical physics in 1925. Two years later, he became an assistant professor at Caltech, and he completed his academic career there after many decades on the faculty. He was a Unitarian.\n\nIn 1932, Pauling came up with the idea of electronegativity and made a scale that would help the chemical bonding. Pauling kept doing this work while he also did work on the structure of the atomic . \n\nIn 1954, Pauling was given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work that he did on the structure of DNA. This work led scientists in the UK to come up with the double helix of DNA. \n\nDuring the Second World War, Pauling worked on military research and development. But, after the war had ended he became worried about the making and future use of atomic weapons and with the destruction forced on the world by war. Ava Helen Pauling, Linus's wife, was a and in time he came to share her beliefs. Pauling then began to talk about his worries with the effects of nuclear fallout and in 1962, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work against above ground nuclear testing.\n\nPauling was also an author and a teacher. His first book, \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\" (1939), is still used today. his introductory textbook, \"General Chemistry\" (1949). Later in life, he became an advocate for greatly increased consumption of vitamin C and other nutrients. He generalized his ideas to define orthomolecular medicine, which is still regarded as unorthodox by conventional medicine. He popularized his concepts, analyses, research and insights in several successful but controversial books, such as \"How to Live Longer and Feel Better\" in 1986.\n\nPauling died of prostate cancer on August 19, 1994, at 7:20 PM at home in Big Sur, California.

It could be found in all of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Curse tablets were used to influence other people, often the gods were asked to influence someone else, or to do harm to them. This would involve magic.\n\nUsually, texts were scratched on very thin sheets of lead using a small writing. These sheets would then be rolled up, folded, or pierced with nails.They would then be moved under ground, placed in graves, or thrown into wells, pools or lakes. Sometimes they were put on temple walls. Like an analogy the treatment done to the material should also be done to the target of the spell. \n\nSome of the tablets contained love spells. If they were used this way, they had to be placed in the home of the desired person, so that the spell could work. \n\nAbout 1600 tablets have been found, distributed over all the known lands in Antiquity. About 600 of them were found in Greece. \n\nSome of the spells were discovered together with small figures, which have falsely been described as voodoo dolls. The dolls or figurines were sometimes also pierced with nails. The figurines looked like the target and often had both their feet and hands bound. Not all curse tablets were made with lead. Curses were also written on papyrus, wax, wood or other perishable materials, but these are less likely to show up in the archaeological record.\n\nThe texts on curse tablets are typically addressed to infernal or liminal gods such as Hermes, Charon, Hecate, and Persephone. Sometimes, a sometimes a dead person (probably the corpse in whose grave the tablet was placed) had to mediate. Some texts do not invoke the gods, but merely list the targets of the curse, the crimes or conditions when the curse is valid, and/or the intended ill to befall them. Some tablets are inscribed with nothing more than the names of the targets. Some people think that an oral spell may have accompanied the making of the curse.\n\nThe text on the tablets were not always curses, sometimes tablets wereused to help the dead. Those whose grave sites these were placed at usually died at a very young age or in a violent manner, and the tablet was supposed to help lay their souls to rest in spite of their untimely deaths. The language of those texts that do give context is often concerned with justice, either listing the target's crimes in great detail, handing over responsibility for their punishment to the gods, using indefinite grammar (\"whoever committed this crime\"), or conditional (\"if he is guilty\"), or even future conditional (\"if he ever breaks his word\").. Frequently, such curse tablets are also inscribed with additional, otherwise meaningless \"curse\" words such as Bazagra, Bescu, or Berebescu, seemingly in order to lend them a kind of supernatural efficacy.\n\nMany of those discovered at Athens refer to court cases and curse the opposing litigant, asking (\"May he...\") that he botch his performance in court, forget his words, become dizzy and so forth. Others include erotic binding-spells, spells ranged against thieves, and business and sporting rivals. Those curse tablets targeted at thieves or other criminals may have been more public, more acceptable; some scholars even refuse to use the word \"curse\" of such \"positive\" texts, preferring expressions such as \"judicial prayers\".\n\nAbout 130 curse tablets have been found at \"Aquae Sulis\" (now Bath in England), where many of the curses related to thefts of clothes whilst the victim was bathing. Over 80 more have similarly been discovered in and about the remains of a temple to Mercury nearby, at West Hill, Uley, making south-western Britain one of the major centres for finds of Latin \"defixiones\".\n\nIn Ancient Egypt, so-called \"Execration Texts\" appear around the time of the 12th Dynasty, listing the names of enemies written on clay figurines or pottery which were then smashed and buried beneath a building under construction (so that they were symbolically \"smothered\"), or in a cemetery.\n\n", "id": "131199", "title": "Curse tablet"}

After the batter hits the ball he runs as fast as he can around the bases and tries to get to a base before he is called out by an umpire. If he gets to a base before he is called out he is safe and the next batter comes forward and tries to hit a ball from the pitcher. The old batter who is \"on base\" becomes a runner.\n\n\nThere are other kinds of hits, but these are the major ones. These hits can be made by many ways. For example; a single can come from a hit that travelled along the ground (called a \"grounder\") or that travelled in the air (a \"fly ball\"). A grounder can often be harder for the other team to stop than a fly ball. This is because when it moves along the ground it has more chance of hitting bumps and the glove or foot of the other teams player than it does if it moves in the air. There are also more ways in which hits can happen but these are the two major ways. \n\nA no-hitter is a baseball game in which the other team does not get any hits during the whole game. The winning pitcher who has stopped the losing team from getting a hit is said to have \"thrown a no-hitter\".

They can also be found in warm waters around the world and are found along the coast of 140 countries.\n\nThe female turtle lays eggs in nests she builds in the sand on the beaches. She uses the same beach that she was born on. During the nesting season in summer she can make up to five nests. She can lay as many as 135 eggs in a nest. The eggs take about two months to hatch. The baby turtles are about in length.\n\nGreen turtles are omnivorous when they are young, eating plants, algae, plankton and other small animals. As they get older, they become herbivorous, eating only plants such as sea grass. Their body fat is green from the chlorophyll of the plants they eat. The edges of their jaws have many points, like the edge of a saw. Their jaws can rip off pieces of plants and the turtles swallows the pieces whole.\n\nThe numbers of green turtles around the world has dropped by more than half over the last 150 years. The main reasons are hunting of turtles and the taking of their eggs. Many turtles are killed when they get caught in fishing nets. There is also a disease called fibropapillomatosis which is affecting them.

Guitarist Kim Thayil said he learned about the tuning from the Melvins's Buzz Osborne. The original version of \"Tears to Forget\" appeared on the 1985 \"Deep Six\" compilation album, which featured some of the first recordings by the earliest Seattle grunge bands, including Soundgarden. That version was recorded with drummer Scott Sundquist, but the version on \"Screaming Life\" was recorded with Cameron.\n\nSome time prior to recording, producer Jack Endino found old rolls of quarter-inch tape at a garage sale, and some contained recordings of a Christian preacher giving sermons in the early 1950s. Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell had the idea to have the preacher's voice on \"Hand of God\". The recording was synched with the eight-track machine, copied to an empty track and by coincidence (or because, as Endino says, \"God smiled upon us\") the tape rolls matched perfectly with the song. Cornell also added his own sarcastic preacher-style vocals, with the lines \"let it be known today that if you've got two hands you're supposed to pray!\". However, according to Endino, the labels on the rolls of tape were near-illegible and thus the name of the preacher remains unknown.\n\nCornell said that the EP was met with rave reviews and that \"everybody loved it.\" \"Hunted Down\" was Soundgarden's first single and also the first song on Sub Pop's \"hold music\" tape. According to Thayil, \"you would call them up, and when they put you on hold you heard 'Hunted Down'\". It was the only single released from the EP. \"Nothing to Say\" was Soundgarden's first B-side, released on the \"Hunted Down\" single. The song also appeared on the KCMU compilation tape \"Bands That Will Make Money\", which was distributed to record companies. Upon hearing the song, record labels began contacting the band, which eventually led to the band signing with A&M Records.\n\nThe cover of \"Screaming Life\" was taken by grunge photographer Charles Peterson, and features Cornell singing and Thayil playing guitar in the background. The album cover was an attempt by Sub Pop to capitalize on Cornell's image. The first 500<nowiki> </nowiki>copies of the EP were pressed on orange vinyl; after that, they were released on standard black vinyl.\n\nThe title of the EP inspired the title of a book of photography by Peterson, named \"Screaming Life: A Chronicle of the Seattle Music Scene\". Published in 1995, it is composed mainly of live photos taken by Peterson from the mid 1980s though the mid 1990s. Many of Peterson's photographs were used as album artwork for grunge bands. The book is accompanied by a CD, with 9 songs selected by Peterson from bands of the era – Soundgarden's \"Entering\" is one of these songs.\n\nAll songs written by Chris Cornell and Kim Thayil, except where noted:\n\n\n", "id": "131369", "title": "Screaming Life"}

English speakers call it \"Rome\" to make it sound more English. Another example is the city of Moscow in Russia, which sounds like \"Moskva\" in Russian, though it is written much differently because Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet (it is written in that language as ). Still, English speakers call the city \"Moscow\" because it is easier to say.\n\nMost of these changes were made a few centuries ago. In some cases the original language was different to the modern one. Turin in the Piedmont province of Italy was called ' in Piedmontese, the native language of the region, but is now officially known as ' after its Italian name. The English and French name for Florence, also in Italy, is closer to the original name in Latin (') than is the modern Italian name of '.\n\nAnglicization has both a political and cultural dimension. Most Welsh and Scottish Gaelic place names were once anglicized when they were under English rule. Now that they have their own local parliaments, they changed the official names back again. In Scotland, however, few people speak Gaelic, so in most places the English versions are almost always used.

From 1890 on, she lived in Paris and moved in an artistic circle with painters of the \"Ile de la Grande Jatte\" in Montmartre. She was a student of Maurice Denis and Paul Sérusier. Sérusier's had ideas about the relationship of music and painting. She used these ideas to form the theory of vibrism, which is a combination of Synthetic Cubism of the pre-war period and Larionov and Goncharova's Rayonism.\n\nJuan Gris was a close friend of hers. From 1911 on, Rij-Rousseau showed her works in Salon d'Automne, Salon des Indépendants and Salon Tuileries. In 1920, she was a member of the artist circle called Section d'Or. She often traveled to South France, especially to Céret, and also to Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. Her paintings were displayed in Zurich, Brussels, New York, and Boston.\n\nIn Aubusson and Beauvais' manufactories large-size tapestries designed by her were produced. In 1925, she was awarded a gold medal for one of them in the first Arts Décoratifs' exhibition.\nGuillaume Apollinaire named her a \"searcher\", and her colour choices were admired by Florent Fels and André Salmon.\n\nAlso in 1925, Rij-Rousseau founded the Association of Modern-Age Female Painters. She exhibited with Suzanne Duchamp and Marie Laurencin, among others.

It is on the American Library Association's list of the \"Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century\".\n\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" is a story about friendship and loneliness. It also talks about the American Dream: the hope that in America, anyone can become rich or famous if they work hard.\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was made into a movie several times, the first in 1939, only two years after the publication of the novel.

It stores recorded music (or other sounds). It was popular during most of the 20th century. Gramophone records are played on a phonograph (\"record player\").\n\nA gramophone record is a flat disk that is usually made of plastic. The sound is recorded on a very fine line or groove which goes around and around in a spiral from the outside edge of the disk to the center. The phonograph plays the sound with a needle that touches the groove. A record usually has different music on each side. When made of vinyl they were also known as vinyl records. Most music made in the 20th century used this format.\nThomas Edison made early phonographs in the 1870s. He originally used tin foil to record the sound. Soon wax cylinders were used in place of the tin foil. The cylinders could be taken off the machine and put back on without destroying the recording. Although discs were made as early as 1888, it was not until 1902 that discs became more popular than cylinder records. Discs were first made out of a shellac mixture, and then vinyl. Singles usually carried only one or two songs or recordings. EPs (extended play records) carried from three to five songs. Albums carried many more recordings; a dozen was normal, or from 30 to 45 minutes of playing time. These formats are still used today, with digital recordings, and playing time for singles and albums has grown considerably.\n\nVinyl records lost popularity but never went out of production. Now, in recent years vinyl is gaining popularity, while CD record shops have gone out of business, more and more vinyl only record shops are opening.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=131582", "text": "Sabellianism\n\nSabelianism is a position in Christian theology. It is against to the idea of the trinity, but embraces Morpheus. Sabellianism is also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism. Basically, the teaching says that God has three masks, and humans see him in three different ways, but he is in fact only one. \n\nHistoric Sabellianism taught that God the Father was the only person of the Godhead, a belief known as Monarchianism. One author has described Sabellius' teaching thus: \"The true question, therefore, turns on this, viz., what is it which constitutes what we name ‘person’ in the Godhead? Is it original, substantial, essential to divinity itself? Or does it belong to and arise from the exhibitions and developments which the divine Being has made of himself to his creatures? The former Sabellius denied; the latter he fully admitted.\" \n\nModalists say that the only number given to God in the Holy Bible is \"One\". Christian texts do not explicitley talk about God being \"three\". The number three is never mentioned in texts talking about God. The number three is the number that is central to the word \"Trinity\". There is one text known as Comma Johanneum which may be an exception to this. The comma Johanneum is a disputed text passage in First John. The text is mainly known from the King James Version of the Bible and some versions of the Textus Receptus. It is usually not included in modern critical texts. Modalism has been mainly associated with Sabellius, who taught a form of it in Rome in the third century. \n\nHippolytus of Rome knew Sabellius personally and mentioned him in the \"Philosophumena\". He knew Sabellius disliked Trinitarian theology, but he said Modal Monarchism was the heresy of Noetos, not that of Sabellius. \n\nChristians in Cyrenaica liked Sabellianism, and converted to it. Demetrius, Patriarch of Alexandria, wrote many letters to them arguing against this belief.\n\nThe primary critic was Tertullian, who said that they crucified the Father. \n\nIt is important to note that our only sources available for our understanding of Sabellianism are from people who opposed it. Scholars today do not agree what exactly Sabellius or Praxeus taught. It is easy to think Tertullian and Hippolytus misrepresented the opinions of their opponents.\n\nTertullian seems to suggest that the majority of believers at that time favoured the Sabellian view of the oneness of God. Epiphanius (Haeres 62) about 375 AD notes that Sabellius still had many followers, both in Mesopotamia and at Rome. The second general council at Constantinople in 533 AD declared the baptism of Sabellius to be invalid, which indicates that Sabellianism was still around.\n\nSabellianism has been rejected by the majority of Christian churches in favour of Trinitarianism. This was done through the Athanasian Creed, which says that God is three distinct persons. Each one of the three is equal to the others, and eternal in the same way than the other two.\n\nMichael Servetus and Emanuel Swedenborg were scientists of the 16th and 17th century. Some of the tests thy have written seem to suggest that they were in favor of Modalism. Neither of the two describes God as appearing in three modes. Both describe him as the One Divine Person, Jesus Christ, who has a Divine Soul of Love, Divine Mind of Truth, and Divine Body of Activity. Jesus merged his human form with the divine. By doing this, he became entirely One with His Divine Soul from the Father in such a way that the persons could no longer be kept apart. \n\nOneness Pentecostalism teaches that the Father (a spirit) is united with Jesus (a man) as the Son of God. However, Oneness Pentecostalism is very different from Sabellianism, because it rejects sequential modalism. They teach that God was fully God and fully man. \n\nOneness Pentecostalism and Sabellianism can be compared to each other, because they are both Notrinitarian. There may be several differences between both positions though.\n\nIt is difficult to find out what Sabellianism really taught, because all that is left today are the texts of those who were against it. All of his original works were burned. The following excerpts which demonstrate some of the known doctrinal characteristics of ancient Sabellians may be seen to compare with the doctrines in the modern Oneness movement:\n", "id": "131582", "title": "Sabellianism"}

He was the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville and eldest by his second wife Fressenda (or Fredesenda), daughter of Duke Richard I of Normandy. \n\nLike many other impoverished Norman knights (Rainulf Drengot, William Ironarm, and more), Robert de Hauteville went to Italy, arriving there about 1046. After serving in the forces of the prince lombard of Capua, Pandulf, he organized an army to secure possessions for himself in Calabria. In 1053, when the Pope Leo IX attempted to expel the Normans from the South Italy, Robert Guiscard played an important role in defeating the papal forces at Civitate, near the modern city of San Severo (Province of Foggia). \n\nAfter the death in 1057 of his older brother Humphrey, count of Apulia, Guiscard became leader of the Normans in Italy. The pope, seeking independence from the Holy Roman Empire, decided to enlist the Normans as allies. In 1059 the French Pope Nicholas II created Robert \"by the Grace of God and Saint Peter, duke of Apulia and Calabria and, with their help, hereafter of Sicily\" (\"Robertus Guiscardus, Normannus Dux Apuliae, Calabriae et Siciliae\"). In return, Robert acknowledged the pope as his feudal overlord. Sicily was in Muslim hands at the time and so Robert and his brother Roger Bosso embarked on a series of campaigns, capturing Messina in 1061 and Palermo in 1072. \n\nTurning his attention to the Balkans in 1081, Guiscard gained a great victory over the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus at Durazzo (Albania). In Greece, his campaigns at Macedonia and Thessalia were being carried on, meanwhile, by his son Bohamund. Robert was recalled from his victorious campaigns in 1084 to go to the aid of Pope Gregory VII, who was besieged in the castle of Sant'Angelo by Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV. Robert drove Henry from Rome, and reduced one-third of the city to ashes. Because of the unpopularity of Gregory VII in Rome, he took the pope to Monte Cassino. Robert then went to the support of Bohamund in the Greek campaign but died of fever at Kefalonia a few weeks later (July 1085).

He was the thirty-eighth Vice President of the United States from 1965 to 1969, under Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nHumphrey was born in a room over his father's drugstore in Wallace, South Dakota. He was the son of Ragnild Kristine Sannes (1883–1973), a Norwegian immigrant, and Hubert Humphrey, Sr. (1882–1949). Humphrey spent most of his childhood in Doland, South Dakota, on the Dakota prairie; the town's population was about 600 people when he lived there. His father was a licensed pharmacist who served as mayor and a town council member. In the late 1920s a severe economic decline hit Doland; both of the town's banks closed and Humphrey's father fought to keep his drugstore business open.\n\nAfter his son graduated from Doland's high school, Hubert Humphrey, Sr. left Doland and opened a new drugstore in the larger town of Huron, South Dakota; a population of 11,000 people, where he hoped to improve his fortunes. Because of the family's financial struggles, Humphrey had to leave the University of Minnesota after just one year. He earned a pharmacist's license from the Capitol College of Pharmacy in Denver, Colorado (completing a two-year licensure program in just six months), and spent years from 1931 to 1937 helping his father run the family drugstore. Over time the Humphrey Drug Company became a financial gain business and the family again succeded.\n\nHumphrey did not enjoy working as a pharmacist, and his dream was to earn a doctorate in political science and become a college professor. In 1937 he returned to the University of Minnesota and earned a bachelor's degree in 1939. He was a member of Phi Delta Chi Fraternity. He also earned a master's degree from Louisiana State University in 1940, serving as an assistant instructor of political science. One of his classmates was Russell B. Long, who would become a U.S. Senator from Louisiana. He then became an instructor and doctoral student at the University of Minnesota from 1940 to 1941 (joining the American Federation of Teachers), and was a supervisor for the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Humphrey soon became active in Minneapolis politics, and as a result he never finished his PhD.\n\nHumphrey twice served as a United States Senator from Minnesota, and served as Democratic Majority Whip. He was a founder of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and Americans for Democratic Action. He also served as mayor of Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1945–1949. \nIn 1968, Humphrey was the nominee of the Democratic Party in the United States presidential election but narrowly lost to the Republican nominee, Richard Nixon.\n", "id": "131646", "title": "Hubert Humphrey"}

In the song, during the first verse, the two Matts sing back to each other as if in a phone conversation.\n\nFor their fourth album, titled \"Mmhmm\", they added instruments like a banjo and another guitar player, because they wanted more piano in their music, and the addition of another guitar player made this possible for Matt. It can be pronounced different ways, and can also be written as \"MMHMM\" or \"MmHmm\".\n\nRelient K is known for their brand of tongue-in cheek humor. Tongue-in-cheek meaning when words are said only half seriously. They used this in many of their earlier songs such as \"Marilyn Manson Ate My Girlfriend\" \"Nancy Drew\" (a song about the fictional character) and \"May the Horse Be With You\" (which clearly plays on the popular Star Wars phrase).\n\nTheir second album was indeed titled \"The Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek\" although you could argue the third album used more humor.\n\n\n\n", "id": "131721", "title": "Relient K"}

He lived, worked and died in 's-Hertogenbosch, a Dutch town. This was then the capital of the Duchy of Brabant, a region which included much of modern Belgium and Holland.\n\nMany of his works depict temptation, sin and punishment in hell. The paintings have a dreamlike surreal quality, with sexual and sadistic images. The intent was probably serious, to warn of the punishment which awaited sinners in hell.\n\nThe paintings often look like, and certainly did influence, the modern art movement known as surrealism. Bosch used images of demons, half-human animals and machines, to evoke fear and confusion, and to portray the evil of man. His works contain complex, highly original, imaginative, and dense use of symbolic figures and iconography, some of which was obscure even in his own time.\n\nToday only 25 paintings are known to be by him; Philip II of Spain collected some of the best, which are now in the Prado Museum, Madrid.\n", "id": "131723", "title": "Hieronymus Bosch"}

It would later appear on the band's greatest hits album \"A-Sides\" and the 2007 Chris Cornell compilation \"The Roads We Choose - A Retrospective\".\n\nThe song was written by frontman Chris Cornell. The time signature of the song is in 6/4.\n\nCornell on the song:\n\"Fell on Black Days\" was like this ongoing fear I've had for years...It's a feeling that everyone gets. You're happy with your life, everything's going well, things are exciting - when all of a sudden you realise you're unhappy in the extreme, to the point of being really, really scared. There's no particular event you can pin the feeling down to, it's just that you realise one day that everything in your life is FUCKED!\n\nIt was released as a single in a large number of different versions, each with different B-sides. Several of the singles featured an original demo version of the song. This demo is completely different from the more familiar version. It features different lyrics and music, with considerably heavier drop-D guitar. Only the chorus contains lyrical similarities to the final version. Soundgarden performed this version live on Pearl Jam's \"Self-Pollution\" radio broadcast in early 1995.\n\nIt appeared on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 Airplay chart, peaking at number 54 in its tenth week and remaining on the chart until its twentieth week. The song peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart.\n\nOutside of the United States, the single was released in Australia and the United Kingdom. In Canada, the song reached the top 70 on the Canadian Singles Chart and remained in the top 70 for two weeks. \"Fell on Black Days\" reached the top 50 in the Netherlands and in Ireland it was a moderate top 20 success.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Clear Channel included the song on its list of possibly inappropriate songs.\n\nIn the music video, the band was filmed performing the song in-studio, with Brendan O'Brien producing the recording. The video was directed by Jake Scott. The video was released in November 1994. It is available on the CD-ROM \"Alive in the Superunknown\".

The crucifixion happens after Jesus' arrest at Gethsemane and trial before Pontius Pilate. It includes his scourging, crucifixion on the cross, and burial. In Christian theology, the death of Jesus by crucifixion is a major event. (See salvation).\n\nChristians believe that Jesus was God in human form. They believe that after he died on the Cross on Friday, he went down to Hell to free the souls of the people who had died before Jesus' coming. On Sunday, Christians believe that Jesus came back to life and left the tomb where he was buried. This is called the \"resurrection\". \n\nThe crucifixion is, according to the Bible, necessary to Christianity. Christians believe that Jesus suffered very much on the cross as a way of paying for all of mankind's sins (bad actions, thoughts, and deeds). By taking on all of this suffering, mankind was freed from the punishment that God should have given to man (because of man's weakness and bad choices in life). \n\nThe crucifixion itself is a very sad event as Jesus had to suffer horribly. His friends and his own mother had to see it. However, Christians believe this was necessary for him to come back to life and to show that death had no power over him. Through the crucifixion, Christians believe that God has set us free and shown to the world that Jesus is God and that life is forever. According to the Bible, Jesus sacrificed himself for all of mankind to show his love.\n\nA \"passion play\" is a play that tells this story of Jesus' trial and then his crucifixion. A recent version, The Passion of the Christ, was produced and released by Mel Gibson. It was and still is very popular with Christians and non-Christians alike.\n", "id": "131807", "title": "Crucifixion of Jesus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=131815", "text": "Exploration\n\nExploration is the act of searching an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it. It involves the discovery of new information. Human beings explore even when they have everything they need where they are. They are the only mammal that does this. \n\nNeanderthals existed for hundreds of thousands of years in Eurasia. But their range was limited compared to modern humans. In less than 50,000 years humans have explored and spread out to all the continents. Exploration had its most dramatic rise during the Age of Discovery. This is when European explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world. Humans have explored geographically even into outer space. They explore ideas, art, even the very nature of life.\n\nThe Phoenicians were a culture that existed in the coastal region of the Levant as early as the 3rd millennium BC. They were not a significant culture until about 1100 bc. By the 9th century BC the Phoenicians had became the dominant culture in the Mediterranean Sea. They grew wealthy through trade. Instead of war they used trade agreements and alliances to expand their colonies. The Phoenicians developed advanced navigational skills and had the best ships in the Mediterranean. They explored over land routes and developed caravan routes to trade with distant places. Carthage got its start as a Phoenician colony on the north coast of Africa. It grew to be their largest and most successful colony. \nGradually the western Mediterranean Phoenician colonies all came under the control of Carthage. The Carthaginians were explorers too. Two major explorations are are mentioned by early writers. Both took place around 500 BC. Pliny the Elder wrote that Carthage sent an explorer named Himilco to explore the remote parts of Europe. The report, or \"periplus\" (sailing record), has not survived but other early writers have seen it. He had as many as 60 ships in his fleet. He would have traveled along the Iberian Peninsula up the coast of Gaul. Avienus, a Roman writer of the 4th century AD, wrote about the expedition. Himilco moved north from Brittany to the British Isles. It is likely he was looking for tin, a rare metal at the time. He reached a land called , “The Holy Island”, generally believed to be Ireland.\nAbout the same time, Hanno the Navigator was sent to explore the western coast of Africa. His periplus has survived and is one of the earliest surviving manuscripts. The periplus records landmarks, ports and sailing distance between them. It is a guide for other ship captains to follow. Hanno's 60 ships moved south along the African coast. He may have reached as far as as an island off the coast of Sierra Leone. There is no record of any other explorations of the west Africa coast until the time of Henry the Navigator, the Portuguese explorer.\n\nOne of the first scientific explorers was Pytheas of Massalia. He was an ancient Greek from the then Greek colony of Massalia (now Marseille). He made a voyage to northwestern Europe in about 325 BC. He circumnavigated Great Britain. Pytheas was the first person on record to describe the Midnight Sun. He is the first known scientific visitor and reporter of the Arctic polar ice. His account of the tides is the earliest known to suggest the moon as their cause.\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty explored much of the eastern part of the Northern Hemisphere. In 139 BC, the Han diplomat Zhang Qian traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da Yuezhi. He discovered countries the Chinese did not even know existed. He had traveled as far as the Indus River in northwestern India.\n\nDuring the Viking Age Three different groups of Vikings can be identified from different parts of Scandinavia. The Danes, Swedes (also called the \"Rus\") and Norwegian vikings. The 'Rus', founded the settlement of Kiev. Named for themselves they called it Russland (later known as Russia). Swedish Viking explorer Garðar Svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island. About 890 CE Vikings, led by Ohthere of Norway, traveled north above the Arctic Circle to the White Sea. \n\nAbout 982, the Norwegian Erik the Red explored Greenland. In 986 he returned to Iceland, from where he sailed. He convinced others to follow him and founded the first settlement there. By the year 1000 there were a thousand settlers living there. Erik's second of three sons, Leif Erikson was probably the first European to set foot on North America. He landed at a place he called \"Vinland\".\n\nMarco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant and explorer. He traveled across Asia during the height of the Mongol Empire. He was one of the first Europeans to explore Eastern Asia. He left Venice at age 17 with his father and uncle. They traveled what later became the Silk Road. They reached Cathay (China) where Marco Polo entered the court of Kublai Khan. He traveled and explored China for 24 years. He brought back ivory, jade, jewels, porcelain and silk. He brought back many other things including noodles from China which the Italians called pasta.\n\nThis was a period in European history from the early 15th century to the early 17th century. During this relatively short period of time, the way Europeans saw the world was completely changed. The European powers sent ships around the world to search for new trading routes. They were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. In the process, Europeans discovered new people and lands completely unknown to them. Some of the explorers of this age are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons humans explore outer space. It was first explored with human eyes. Ancient men mapped the universe they could see. Then came the invention of telescopes. In the mid-twentieth century man actually began exploring space with rockets and Spacecraft. The most important reasons are scientific research and the interest of humans to learn more about the universe. Space exploration has developed new technologies. It has created new products and new industries.\n\nIn scientific research, exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research. The other two are description and explanation. The term is commonly used metaphorically. For example, a person may speak of exploring the Internet, exploring sexuality, or concepts one cannot physically explore.\n\n\n", "id": "131815", "title": "Exploration"}

By birth, she was a member of the House of Teck in Germany, and through her mother, she was a distant member of the British Royal Family. Within her family, she was given the nickname \"May\". \n\nPrincess Mary was born at Kensington Palace in London on 26 May 1867. Her mother was Princess Mary Adelaide, a daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of King George III. Her father was Francis, Duke of Teck. Due to her parent's financial troubles, Princess Mary spent much of her early life abroad in order to economise, and in 1883, the Tecks returned to London in 1883, living at White Lodge in Richmond Park. \n\nIn 1891, Princess Mary, who was liked by Queen Victoria, became engaged to her double second cousin once removed Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of Prince Albert Edward, Prince of Wales. Prince Albert Victor was the heir to the throne after his father, bringing Princess Mary and her family to the senior end of the Royal Family. However, a few weeks before the wedding, Prince Albert Victor died of influenza. Nevertheless, Queen Victoria still favoured Mary as a royal bride, and therefore arranged for her to marry Albert Victor's brother, Prince George, created Duke of York. They were married at St. James's Palace, London, on 6 July 1893. \n\nPrincess Mary was devoted to her children and to her public duties. She left her children in the care of a nanny, Charlotte \"Lalla\" Bill, and taught her children history and music. With her public duties, she was equally devoted, becoming Patron of a number of charities. When her father-in-law became King Edward VII, Prince George and Princess Mary undertook an eight month tour of the British Empire. No royal had undertaken such a big tour before. Princess Mary broke down in tears at the thought of leaving her children, though they were in the care of their doting grandparents. \n\nIn 1910, Edward VII died, and Prince George ascended the throne as George V. Mary thus became Queen. During the First World War, Queen Mary was criticised for her German heritage. The conflict with Germany forced George V to change the name of the Royal House from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also stripped all titles from those members of the Royal Family who fought for Germany. Following the war, Queen Mary continued her public duties, and suffered family tragedy when she lost her youngest son, Prince John. In 1935, King George celebrated his Silver Jubilee, commemorating 25 years of his reign, and Queen Mary accompanied him during the official tours and visits that took place. Queen Mary used her extensive knowledge of history and royal protocol to advise and support her husband on matters of state. \n\nIn 1936, King George V died. His death was shortened by an injection of morphine and cocaine, administered by his doctor. Queen Mary supported her son, now King Edward VIII, during his reign. In December, however, the King abdicated the throne because he wished to marry a divorced American commoner, Wallis Simpson. This put his brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, in his place as King George VI. King George VI was shy, and was at first reluctant to take on his new duties and responsibilities. Queen Mary and his wife, Queen Elizabeth, supported him in his new role. The former King Edward VIII became the Duke of Windsor, went to live in France, and maintained a cool relationship with his family in England. No member of the family attended his wedding to Wallis in 1937, and she was never received by Queen Mary. \n\nDuring the Second World War, Queen Mary lived at Badminton House, owned by her niece's husband, the Duke of Beaufort. She continued her duties and supported the war effort. Following the war, she returned to her pre-war home, Marlborough House. She continued her public duties in old age, surviving to see her granddaughter, Elizabeth, ascend the throne as Queen Elizabeth II. After suffering with lung cancer (described publically as \"gastric problems\"), Queen Mary died of the disease at Marlborough House on 24 March 1953. She lay in state at Westminster Hall before being buried beside her husband at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n", "id": "131898", "title": "Mary of Teck"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=131960", "text": "Parqués\n\nParqués is the Colombian board game. The game is similar to those in the Cross and Circle family (the category that includes Pachisi). The game is described as a \"random thinking\" one: the moves depend on the roll of the dice but players must consider possible strategies before executing their move. The objective of the game is to advance all the pieces to the end.\n\nParqués is the Colombian version of Pachisi, which originated in India. Although it could be argued that the game comes from Spain (exactly as a derivation from Parchís) due to the similarity between both games, there is wide agreement in Colombia that the game is completely Colombian. Parqués stems directly from Pachisi in the same way as Parcheesi, Parchís or Ludo. There is no proof to the claim that it stems from a country other than India. Moreover, no Parqués game is played in any other Latin American countries, neither the world.\n\nParqués is a mixture of the original Indian game and the influences of local Colombian culture. Other Colombian variations also exist.\n\nIn Colombia, people from all parts of the country play the game; it is very popular, played by both children and adults. Adults usually play the game by betting money on the first piece, on capturing pieces, or on winning the game, to make gameplay more interesting. There are boards for 4, 6 and 8 players. The boards usually contain pictures of soccer teams, singers, actors, or other cultural figures on the jail boxes.\n\nThe board itself is usually placed on a box covered by glass. The use of glass is to allow dice to be thrown more easily. There are versions of the board that are made from paper to make it portable.\n\nParqués is played with two dice; two to eight players can compete in the same match, depending on what type of game board is used. Each player is given four pieces and uses a specific colour. The most common colours are red, blue, yellow and green, usually arranged in that order. The game can also be played with fewer than four pieces\n\nThe jail box is where the pieces are placed at the beginning of the match and is where they go whenever an opponent \"captures\" them. The player throws the dice three times and attempts to get a pair in order to \"free\" the pieces. Rolling different pairs or \"doubles\" allows more pieces to be \"freed\": \n\n\nWhen the pieces are freed, they are placed in a special box next to the jail. This box is called \"Home\", or \"Salida\" (literally, \"exit\" in Spanish). \n\nIf a player does not roll any pairs during his turn, he passes the dice to the player on his right. Otherwise, he frees the pieces and wins an extra turn to move them. He throws again and must move the values of the dice with his pieces. \n\nFor example:\n\nThe player rolls 5-3\n\nAfter he makes his move, he must pass his turn to the player on the right.\n\nThe pieces cannot advance backwards and they cannot be in any of the four boxes before their \"Home\" box. \n\nEach player can throw the dice once. There are some exceptions to this rule:\n\n\nThe player can capture an opponent’s piece by placing his own piece on the same box as the other player’s piece. However, he cannot capture a piece that is on a SAFE or a HOME box. Capturing in Colombia is called “eating” (“comer” in Spanish).\n\nHowever, the player can capture pieces on his HOME box. When he frees any piece from jail, the pieces placed on his HOME are captured, that is, sent to its jail, losing all their advances.\n\nThe player can avoid capturing the piece. On that case, an opponent has to accuse him and the piece that did not capture must go to jail. If nobody notices, nothing happens.\n\nThere are three types of special boxes.\n\n\n", "id": "131960", "title": "Parqués"}

In the summer of 2007 he entered a feud with King Booker over who was the real 'King' which resulted in Booker beating down Jerry on an episode of Raw and an episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. At the Great American Bash 2007, Booker demanded that Jerry give him his crown but Jerry told him to get it himself which Booker refused.

Had Cole won, Lawler would have been forced to give him his Hall of Fame ring. The following week on Raw, Cole apologised and they went back to being a commentary team. \nJerry Lawler participated in the 2012 Royal Rumble match but was eliminated by Cody Rhodes after just 43 seconds. Fellow commentators, Michael Cole and Booker T also competed with Rhodes eliminating Booker and them both eliminating Cole.

On July 23rd during Raw 1000, CM Punk attacked The Rock and Lawler proclaiméd that Punk had turned his back on the WWE Universe. The following week, Punk defended this and was involved in a confrontation with Lawler and Jerry apologised. On the August 30th episode of Raw after John Cena refused to say that Punk was the 'Best in the World' seeing as Punk had been WWE Champion for almost a year, Punk told Jerry to come in the ring and say it. When Jerry refused, Punk attacked him.

By this, a worker tells the others where it has found nectar. This was shown by the Austrian ethologist Karl von Frisch.\n\nThe dance is a type of communication for bees. It is done to give other bees information about the direction and distance to flowers that have nectar or pollen, or both. It is also used to tell the bees where water can be found.\n\nThe dance is used for bees to get others to help them collect resources for the hive. It used to be thought that bees have two distinct \"recruitment\" dances. There were the \"round dances\" and waggle dances. Round dances were thought to be used for things that were close by and wiggle dances were for things farther away. It is now known that a round dance is only a waggle dance with a very short \"waggle run\" (see below). \n\nA waggle dance is made up of one to 100 or more circuits. Each circuit has two phases. These phases are the waggle phase and the return phase. When a bee returns to the hive after finding a good food source, it performs the dance. The bee will run through a small wave-like pattern (a waggle run or waggle phase). After this, it will turn to the right and circle back to the starting point (the return phase). It will then do another waggle run and then turn to the left and circle back to the beginning. The waggle phase of the dance is the most notable and informative part of the dance. \n\nThe direction and duration of waggle runs show the direction and distance to flowers. Flowers that are located directly in line with the sun are shown by waggle runs in an upward direction on the vertical combs. If the flowers are at an angle to the right or left of the sun, the waggle run is done at the same angle to the upward direction. The distance between hive and flowers is shown in the duration of the waggle runs. The farther the flowers are from the hive, the longer the waggle phase. For every 100 meters the flowers are distant from the hive, the waggle phase lasts about 75 milliseconds.\n\nPeople study the swarm intelligence of social insects and animals such as fish, birds, and ants. Recently, there has been research on using bee waggle dance behavior for fault-tolerant routing. From the abstract of Wedde, Farooq, and Zhang (2004)\n\nAnother technique based on bees is called bee colony optimization. It is used help Internet servers communicate better.\n\n\n", "id": "132083", "title": "Waggle dance"}

During the five years of The Smiths Marr and Morrissey produced four studio albums, one live album as well as nineteen singles, along with the two other band members, bass player Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce. \n\nEach of their four albums The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead and Strangeways, Here We Come charted in the top two of the UK Albums Chart, with Meat Is Murder charting at number one.

He has become known for what he wrote and said on the Informal economy and property rights.\n\nIn his books, de Soto says that an economy cannot go past the stage of a subsistence economy if there is not a formal system of owning property (land or goods). Developing countries have \"informal ownership\" since no formal certificate says that land or goods really belong to a certain person.\n\nDe Soto thinks the capitalist economies of the United States developed because they had a clear system of owning property. For the United States, the formal system of owning property came from it being a colony of England. Japan's formal system came after the Second World War.\n\nBecause formal ownership systems do not exist in developing countries, the poor people in these nations cannot develop. They cannot use their land as a guarantee to the bank to get money to build something, for example. De Soto argues that this is the basis for enterpreneurship. In much of the developing world,famers therefore are left with subsistence agriculture. As such, he argues that this informal ownership should be made formal, for example by giving squatters in shanty towns land titles to the land they now live on.\n\nDe Soto also argues that government bureaucracy greatly hinders the ability for people to hold private property, for example:\n\nThus entrepreneurs are driven to form \"underground\" economies, but de Soto points out the serious disadvantages:\n\nThomas Sowell writes:\n", "id": "132113", "title": "Hernando de Soto (economist)"}

He lead the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States and was probably the first European to discover the Mississippi River.\n\nThe expedition was looking for gold and for a way to China. They explored the southern United States. De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River at present-day Lake Village, Arkansas. Hernando de Soto was born to parents who were hidalgos in Extremadura, a region of poverty and hardship from which many young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere. His parents were poor, too. Two towns, Badajoz and Jerez de los Caballeros, claim to be his birthplace. All that is known with certainty is that he spent time as a child at both places. In his will, he wanted to be buried at Jerez de los Caballeros, where other members of his family were also buried. The age of the Conquerors came on the heels of the Spanish reconquest of the Iberian peninsula from Islamic forces. Spain and Portugal were filled with young men begging for a chance to find military fame after the Moors were defeated. With discovery of new lands to the West (which seemed at the time to be far East Asia), the whispers of glory and wealth were too compelling for the poor.\n\nDe Soto sailed to the New World in 1514 with the first Governor of Panama, Pedrarias Dávila. Brave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and clever schemes for the extortion of native villages for their captured chiefs, became De Soto's hallmark during the Conquest of Central America. He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician, but was notorious for the extreme brutality with which he wielded these gifts.\n\nDuring that time, Juan Ponce de León, who discovered Florida, Vasco Núñez de Balboa, who discovered the Pacific (he called it the \"South Sea\" below Panama), and Ferdinand Magellan, who first sailed that ocean to the Orient, profoundly influenced de Soto's ambitions.\n", "id": "132116", "title": "Hernando de Soto"}

There are about 10 species, all native to Europe Asia and North America.\n\nThe leaves of beech trees are smooth with light hairs and with a smooth or slightly toothed edge, they are from 5–15 cm long and 4–10 cm broad. The flowers are small and single-sex (monoecious), the female flowers are carried in pairs, the male flowers are wind-pollinating catkins, produced in spring shortly after the new leaves appear. The bark is smooth and light grey. The fruit is a small, sharply three–anglend nut 10–15 mm long, borne singly or in pairs in soft-spined husks 1.5–2.5 cm long, known as cupules. The nuts are edible, though bitter (though not nearly as bitter as acorns) with a high tannin content, and are called beechnuts or beechmast.\n\nBeech grows on a wide range of soil types, acid or basic, provided they are not wet for long periods. The tree canopy casts a heavy shade shade, and the leaves, when dropped, cover the ground thickly. Few plant grow under beech trees.\n\nIn North America, they often form Beech-Maple forests by growing together with the Sugar Maple.\n\nThe beech has been used for its wood by man for thousands of years. The wood is white, or reddish if grown on acid soil, but fine grained, smooth and heavy when first cut. It may split as it dries. It is a good wood for making ornaments, tool handles, kitchen utensils, furniture and parts of buildings. Beechwood burns well and is used, among other woods, to smoke herrings in Scotland. It can also be made into charcoal.\nThe southern beeches Nothofagus previously thought closely related to beeches, are now treated as members of a separate family, Nothofagaceae. They are found in Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Argentina and Chile (mostly on the southern tip in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego).\n\nThe beech blight aphid (Grylloprociphilus imbricator) is a common pest of beech trees.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132196", "text": "Pollen\n\nPollen is a powder made of pollen grains, which produce sperm cells (male cells used for reproduction) of seed plants. The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes.\n\nThe anther contains microsporangia. Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis, and produce pollen grains, which produce the male gametes (sperm).\n\nThe pollen is released by the opening of the anther. The pollen is carried by some agent (wind, or some animal) to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower. This process is known as pollination. After successful pollination, the pollen grain (immature microgametophyte) completes its development by growing a \"pollen tube\" and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes.\n\nThere are two main kinds of pollination. One kind happens when pollen from a stamen sticks to the pistil of the same plant. That is self-pollination.\n\nThe other kind of pollination takes place when pollen from one plant travels to the pistil of another plant. Most plants use this kind of pollination. Plants need help for this kind of pollination, because they cannot move. So, they need another way to move pollen from one plant to another plant.\n\nThe wind helps move pollen between plants. The pollen of some plants is very light. Wind blows it from the flowers on one plant to the flowers on another plant. The wind can move pollen a long way before the pollen hits the sticky top of a pistil.\n\nAnimals also help move pollen between plants. Many flowers are colourful and their scent attracts some animals. These flowers also make a sweet juice called nectar. Sometimes an animal, such as a bee, sees or smells a flower. Then, it lands on the flower to get nectar. As the bee drinks the nectar, the stamens brush pollen onto its body. Then, the bee flies to another flower that has a pistil. The pollen on the bee's body brushes onto the sticky top of the flower's pistil. The pollen is used as protein for the bee larvae.\n\nThe plants help feed the animal. In return, the animal helps the plants by moving pollen from flower to flower. The relationship has evolved together; it is a kind of co-evolution called mutualism or symbiosis.\n", "id": "132196", "title": "Pollen"}

Many older sniper rifles, as well as many hunting rifles today, work in this way.\n\nWhen the bolt is opened, the first cartridge in the gun is loaded. After firing the gun, opening the bolt takes out the empty cartridge, and closing the bolt puts in a new one. Bolt action rifles are usually the most accurate type of small arms, leading them to be used more widely than probably any other type of marksman rifle. The rifle won't cycle a round without the shooter doing it manually, causing less movement of parts and gases while the round is being fired. This puts accuracy at the very least excellent, but also increasing recoil over automatic rifles of the same caliber.\n\nDespite being significantly slower to fire than lever-action rifles, which were invented around the same time, militaries across the world chose to replace the muzzleloading musket with bolt action guns over level action ones because bolt action rifles are loaded over the barrel. This makes it easy to load without throwing off the shooter's aim when he or she is laying on the ground. With lever action guns, on the other hand, the ground is in the way of loading downwards, and to load the gun would mean to throw off the shooter's aim.\n\nFamous bolt action rifles include the Springfield M1903, the Mauser 98k, the Lee-Enfield, and the Mosin-Nagant.\n", "id": "132348", "title": "Bolt action"}

He was born in Long Beach, California.\n\nZack was interested in punk rock- including bands such as the Sex Pistols and the Clash- from a young age. In seventh grade, Zack played guitar in a punk band called Juvenile Expression, along with his friend Tim Commerford, who played bass. As a teenager, Zack grew to like hardcore punk bands such as Minor Threat and Fugazi, and joined Hardstance as a guitarist. In 1988, Hardstance changed it's name to Inside Out, and Zack became vocalist. Inside Out broke up in 1991. In August of that year, while performing in a club, Zack was approached by Los Angeles local musicians Tom Morello, a guitarist, and Brad Wilk, a drummer and the three agreed to form a band called Rage Against the Machine, which was the name of a song Zack had written when he was vocalist. De la Rocha asked former Juvenile Expression bandmate Tim Commerford to play bass, and he agreed.\n\nAs a teenager, de la Rocha became a vegetarian for ethical reasons\n\nZack wrote most of Rage Against the Machine's songs, with lyrics that talked about politics and current events. The band signed with Epic Records in 1992 and released three original albums between 1992 and 1999- \"Rage Against the Machine\" in 1992, \"Evil Empire\" in 1996, and \"The Battle of Los Angeles\" in 1999.

These things are heat, fuel, and oxygen. If one of these three is removed, the fire will be put out. In the middle of the fire triangle there is also a chemical reaction.\n\nWithout heat, a fire cannot begin. If fire becomes cool enough, it will not keep burning. Heat can be removed by using water. This only works on some types of fire. Separating burning fuels from each other can also reduce the heat. In forest fires, burning logs are separated and placed into safe areas where there is no other fuel. Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the heat source, but other fuels may have caught fire. They will continue burning until the firefighters deal with them and their fire triangles. Without oxygen, a fire can not start. Oxygen may be removed from a fire by covering it in some way. Some foams and heavy gases (for example, carbon dioxide) are often used for this. The fire can also be closed off away from a source of oxygen. Once all the oxygen in the closed off area is used by the fire, it will go out if it cannot get more oxygen because it needs oxygen.\n", "id": "132589", "title": "Fire triangle"}

They are brothers and always work together. They have won many awards including the Academy Award \"(Oscar)\" four times and the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival. Their movies are different genres. They sometimes make movies that are funny like \"Raising Arizona\" or movies with a lot of violence like \"No Country For Old Men\". They can also mix both styles like, for example in \"Fargo\".\n\nThey write, direct and produce their movies and they share the credits. People sometimes call them \"A two-headed director\" because when actors who work in their movies have a question they can ask either Joel or Ethan and get the same answer.\n\nJoel was born on November 29, 1954 and Ethan on September 21, 1957 in St. Louis Park, Minnesota near Minneapolis in the United States. Their parents were teachers, their father taught economy and their mother art history. Joel bought a camera and with it they started making new versions of the movies they saw on television.\n\nWhen they finished high school, Joel studied movie at Bard College at Simon's Rock in Massachusetts and Ethan studied philosophy at Princeton University.\n\nThey are married. Joel married actress Frances McDormand in 1984 (she has acted in six of their movies). Ethan is married to Tricia Cook who edits their movies. They live in New York with their families.\n\nTheir first movie, \"Blood Simple\" (1984), follows the story of a bar-owner who asks a detective to murder his wife and her lover. The Cohens directed, but only Joel appears in the credits and he accepted awards at Sundance and Independent Spirit.\n\nThey wrote the screenplay for the Sam Raimi movie, \"Crimewave\" in 1985.\n\nIn 1987 they wrote and directed \"Raising Arizona\". The movie is about a couple that cannot have babies and decides to steal one. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter played the married couple. The movie was not very successful and it did not make a lot of money in the box offices but many people consider it a cult movie (a movie that has a relatively small number of fans who constantly repeat lines from the dialogs, buy or create merchandise and gather to comment on it).\n\nTheir next movie was \"Miller's Crossing\". It is about gangsters and was made in 1990.\n\nAfter \"Miller's Crossing\", \"Raising Arizona\" and \"Blood Simple\", the brothers received good comments on their movies and their directing style as well as the dialogs in their movies. It was not until they made \"Barton Fink\" in 1991 that the brothers achieved international fame. The movie was nominated for Academy Awards. It won three awards at Cannes International Film Festival (the Palme d'Or, best director, and best actor). The story is about a playwright (a person who writes plays) whose name is Barton Fink and he moves to Los Angeles to write movies. Fink is played by John Turturro.\n\nAfter \"Barton Fink\"'s success, the brothers had the chance to make a big-budget movie (with more money than the previous ones). That movie was \"The Hudsucker Proxy\". The story talks about a man who is given the opportunity to be the director of a big company because the other people in the company (the board) want to buy it at a low price so they intend to have him ruin it. Instead of ruining the company, the man invents the hula hoop and becomes famous.\nThe Coens had 25 million dollars to make this movie but it only earned 3 million so it is considered a commercial failure (not successful). The critics said the movie was not good because it had nothing new to offer the viewers.\n\nThe brothers made another movie in 1996 with a little money. The name was \"Fargo\". It was universally praised (almost everybody said it was good). They returned to Minnesota because the story takes place there and in North Dakota. The story is about a man who needs money to start his own business so he pays other men to kidnap his wife and plans to ask his rich father-in-law for the ransom (money given in exchange for the woman). Everything goes wrong and a series of violent events starts.\nExperts say the movie was very good because of the dialog used by the actors (they used different accents) and Frances McDormand's performance (acting). She won the Best Actress Oscar. The brothers also won Best Original Screenplay and the Palme d'Or for Best Directing for a second time.\n\nBy 1998 they were famous for their style and talent and they made another movie \"The Big Lebowski\", a comedy about a man who does not work and spends his time bowling. The man's name is Jeffrey Lebowski so some guys mistake him for a millionaire who has the same name. Fans of the movie consider it a cult movie.\n\nInspired by parts of Homer's Odyssey, \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000), received wide critical acclaim.\n\nIn 2001 they created \"The Man Who Wasn't There\". The movie is supposed to be in 1940's in California.\n\nIn 2003 they directed \"Intolerable Cruelty\". It is their most mainstream movie (the movie that is closest to the most common or popular genres). The leading roles are played by George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\nThey worked with Tom Hanks in \"The Ladykillers\" in 2004. A previous version had been made before (not by the brothers) in 1955.\n\n\"No Country for Old Men\" came out in 2007. The movie is based on the book with the same name written by Corman McCarthy.\n\n\"A Serious Man\", set in the 1960s in the suburbs of Minneapolis, came out in 2009.\n\nThe Coen brothers are two of only seven directors with three Oscars for the same movie.\n\n\"'1991: \"Barton Fink\"\n\n\"'1996: \"Fargo\"\n\n\"'2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\n\"'2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n\n\"'2007: \"No Country for Old Men\"\n\n\"'2009: \"A Serious Man\"\n\n\"'2010: \"True Grit\"\n\n\"'1996: \"Fargo\"\n\n\"'2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\n\"'2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n\n\"'2007: \"No Country for Old Men\"\n\n\"'2008: \"Burn After Reading\"\n\n\"'2009: \"A Serious Man\"\n\n\"'2010: \"True Grit\"\n\n1998: The Big Lebowski\n\n\"'1991: \"Barton Fink\"\n\n\"'1994: \"The Hudsucker Proxy\"\n\n\"'1996: \"Fargo\"\n\n\"'2000: \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\n\"'2001: \"The Man Who Wasn't There\"\n\n\"'2004: \"The Ladykillers\"\n\n\"'2007: \"No Country for Old Men\"\n", "id": "132669", "title": "Coen brothers"}

For males it can include placing the penis in one's mouth and for females licking the vaginal area.\n\nSometimes oral sex is performed as a way of getting ready for intercourse, but it may be done as an alternative to intercourse. \n\nIf someone is performing oral sex on a male, he or she may decide to swallow the semen if the male ejaculates in the mouth. There is no risk of pregnancy from swallowing semen.\n\nOne can get sexually transmitted diseases from oral sex, such as herpes simplex (which can be passed between mouth and groin or the other way). Some STDs, like HIV, are much harder to pass through oral sex, but it is still possible.\n\nThe technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female. Slang for oral sex is common in Western cultures, for example: \"going down on\" or \"giving a blowjob\" or \"giving head.\" \n\n", "id": "132717", "title": "Oral sex"}

Siamangs grow to about 1 m in height, and weigh up to 23 kg. The Siamang is the only species in the genus Symphalangus.\n\nThe Siamang is different form other gibbons. In Siamangs, two fingers on each hand are fused together, that's where the name \"syndactylus\" is from. Siamangs have large \"gular sacs\". These can be found in both males and females. The gular sac is a throat pouch that can be inflated to the size of its head. This allows the Siamang to make loud resonating calls or songs.\n\nThere may be two subspecies of the Siamang. If so, they are the nominate Sumatran Siamang (\"S. s. syndactylus\") and the Malaysian Siamang (\"S. s. continentis\", in peninsular Malaysia).

He is probably more famous by his pen name Jeremias Gotthelf. He was born in Murten, where his father was pastor.\n\nIn 1804 the home was moved to Utzenstorf, a village in the Bernese Emmental. Bitzius gew up there and received his early education. He also had to help his father to cultivate his glebe. In 1812 he went to complete his education at Bern, and in 1820 was received as a pastor. In 1821 he visited the University of Göttingen, but returned home in 1822 to act as his father's assistant. When his father died in 1824, he went to Herzogenbuchsee as a priest. In 1829, he went to Bern. Early in 1831 he went to help the old pastor of the village of Lützelflüh, in the Upper Emmenthal (between Langnau and Burgdorf). In 1832 he was chosen as his successor. He married one of his granddaughters in 1833. He spent the rest of his life there, leaving three children (the son was a pastor, the two daughters married pastors).\n\nHis first work, the \"Bauernspiegel\", appeared in 1837. It claimed to be the life of Jeremias Gotthelf, narrated by himself, and this name was later adopted by the author as his pen name. It is a living picture of Bernese (or, strictly speaking, Emmenthal) village life, true to nature, and not attempting to gloss over its defects and failings. It is written (like the rest of his works) in German, but contains expressions from the Bernese dialect of the Emmenthal. Unlike Auerbach, Bitzius was not a peasant by birth, but belonged to the educated classes. He reproduces what he had seen and learnt, and not what he had himself personally experienced. The book was a great success, as it was a picture of real life, and not of fancifully beribboned eighteenth-century villagers.\n\nHis best known work is without doubt the short novel \"Die Schwarze Spinne\" (The Black Spider), a semi-allegorical tale of the plague in form of the titular monster that devastates a Swiss valley community; first as a result of a pact with the devil born out of need and a second time due to the moral decay that releases the monster from its prison again.\n\nAmong his later tales are the \"Leiden und Freuden eines Schulmeisters\" (1838-1839), \"Uli der Knecht\" (1841), with its continuation, \"Uli der Pächter\" (1849), \"Anne-Bäbi Jowäger\" (1843-1844), \"Käthi, die Großmutter\" (1846), \"Die Käserei in der Vehfreude\" (1850), and the \"Erlebnisse eines Schuldenbauers\" (1853). He also published several volumes of shorter tales.\n\nOne slight drawback to some of his writings is the echo of local political controversies, for Bitzius was a Whig and strongly opposed to the Radical party in the canton, which carried the day in 1846.\n\nHe died on October 22, 1854 in Lützelflüh in Canton of Bern.\n\nLives by C. Manuel, in the Berlin edition of Bitzius's works (Berlin, 1861), and by J. Ammann in vol. i. (Bern, 1884) of time \"Sammlung Bernischer Biographien\". His works were issued in 24 vols. at Berlin, 1856-1861, while 10 vols., giving the original text of each story, were issued at Bern, 1898-1900.\n\nThe article is available here.\n\n", "id": "132791", "title": "Jeremias Gotthelf"}

It is also the name of a television channel that often shows these programmes. The programmes are meant for children that are between 6 and 12 years old. The \"Children's BBC\" name began on 9 September 1985. Before then there were BBC children's programmes, but they were not branded under one name. The name \"CBBC\" was used informally since 1990, and became the official name in 1997.\n\nCBBC programmes are shown on BBC One, BBC Two and the CBBC Channel. CBBC has a sister brand, CBeebies, for children under 6. The CBBC brands for BBC One and BBC Two are \"CBBC One\" and \"CBBC Two\".\n\nCBBC is run by the BBC Children's department, who make the programmes for children up to the age of 16. Most of their offices are in the East Tower of the BBC Television Centre, with some programmes coming from Scotland and Bristol. CBBC produces a whole range of programme types, including drama, news, entertainment and educational programmes.\n\nSince February 2006, the Controller of the BBC Children's department has been Richard Deverell. The department splits output into age groups:\n\n\nAnne Gilchrist is Creative Director of CBBC, and Michael Carrington is Creative Director of CBeebies.\n\nMonday 3 September 2007 saw the fifth CBBC relaunch. As part of the relaunch, new logos, idents, interactive services, programmes and presenters were introduced. The previous computer generated backgrounds used from December 2006 were replaced by a real set.\n\nEd Petrie became the chief continuity presenter, accompanied by a puppet sidekick \"Oucho T. Cactus\" (operated and voiced by Warrick Brownlow-Pike). They regularly present live, weekday afternoon links on the CBBC channel with Petrie voicing pre-recorded, out-of-vision announcements during for weekdays on BBC One. On 29 August 2008, they went on extended leave to record a new series for CBBC - they returned to continuity duties on 1 December 2008. During this period, relief presenter Holly Walsh presented weekday afternoon links for the channel with Dunceton the Talking Brain.\n\nAnne Foy presented pre-recorded in-vision links at the weekend alongside her dog, Elliot, until her departure in March 2008. Foy was replaced by two new presenters, Ben Hanson and Ciaran Joyce, who previously appeared in CBBC show \"The Story of Tracy Beaker\". They have since been replaced by comedy double act Dan and Jeff.\n\nThe idents were replaced with new ones in 2014, but the logo stayed the same.\n\nOn Monday 14 March 2016, CBBC got a whole new look, which saw a new logo, plus new idents and presentation.\n\n\"CBBC extra\" is a free interactive television service from CBBC. It is found on the BBCi pages. It is accessible from the CBBC Channel by pressing the red button and then selecting \"CBBC extra\". It can also be accessed from any other BBCi page by pressing 570.\n\nThe service is different on different digital platforms, for example Sky viewers can access the video loop. But it is only available on Freeview when BBCi is not showing other interactive services, like sports events.\n\nCBBC extra offers games, the UK Top 40 music, jokes sent in by viewers, \"Nev's Horoscopes\", and a weekly competition. The current presenter of CBBC extra is Ed Petrie.\n\nThis new feature allows the viewers to play a quiz. There are 5 levels, each containing 5 questions. Viewers can also send in their questions which could be shown on the service. The \"CBBC Quiz\" can be from the CBBC extra page, by selecting the option called \"CBBC Quiz\".

The website is found .\n\n\"My CBBC\" is a feature to the new CBBC website. It allows users to create their own room which they can decorate. It is also possible to create your own avatar. The new feature is often promoted on the \"CBBC Channel\".\n\n\"Adventure Rock\" (renamed from CBBC World) is a virtual online world that launched on 1 March 2008. Press releases have stated \"it would allow digitally literate children the access to characters and resources they had come to expect.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132835", "text": "Mermaid\n\nA mermaid is a mythological creature with a female human head and upper body and the tail of a fish. Mermaids live mostly in the water, although sometimes they are known to come out and sit on the rocks above the sea.\n\nThe word is a compound of mere, the Old English word for \"sea\", and maid, a woman. The male equivalent is a merman.\nMuch like sirens, mermaids sometimes sing to people and gods and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off the deck or run their ships aground. Other stories depict them squeezing the life out of drowning men while attempting to rescue them. They are also said to carry humans down to their underwater kingdoms. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, it is said that they forget that humans cannot breathe underwater, while others say they drown men out of spite.[citation needed]\nThe sirens of Greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as mermaid-like; in fact, some languages use the same word for both bird and fish creatures, such as the Maltese word 'sirena'. Other related types of mythical or legendary creatures are water fairies (e.g., various water nymphs) and selkies, animals that can transform themselves from seals to humans.\n\nThe first known mermaid stories appeared in Assyria, ca. 1000 BC. The goddess Atargatis loved a shepherd and accidentally killed him. She was so sad she jumped into a lake to become a fish, but the waters would not let her beauty be hidden. Because of this, she took the form of a mermaid.\n\nA popular Greek legend turns Alexander the Great's sister into a mermaid after she died. She lived, it was said, in the Aegean that when she met a ship, she asked its sailors only one question: \"\"Is King Alexander alive?\"\" (;\") The answer was \"\"He lives and reigns and conquers the world\"\" (Greek: \"Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμο κυριεύει\"). If they answered her question correctly, she calmed the waters for the ship, but any other answer would make her angry, and raise a storm.\n\nThe \"One Thousand and One Nights\" includes several tales have \"Sea People\", such as \"Djullanar the Sea-girl\". Unlike other mythologies, these are almost the same as humans, except the fact that they can breathe and live underwater. They also breed with land humans, the children of them being able to live underwater.\n\nIn \"The Adventures of Bulukiya\", the protagonist Bulukiya's explore the seas, and meets some mermaids.\n\nMermaids were noted in British folklore as unlucky omens. Several parts of the song \"Sir Patrick Spens\" is about a mermaid speaking to doomed ships, or telling them they will never see land again. Mermaids can also be a sign of bad weather.\n\nSome mermaids were described as very big, up to .\n\nMermaids could also swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. One day, in a lake near his house, the Laird of Lorntie went to help a woman he thought drowning, and a servant of his pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed after him that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant.\n\nSometimes, though, mermaids could appear as nicer characters, teaching humans how to cure diseases.\n\nMermen were thought of as more wild and ugly than mermaids, but they also were not interested in humans.\n\nThe mermaid, or \"syrenka\", is the symbol of Warsaw. Images of a mermaid symbolized Warsaw on its crest since the middle of the 14th century.\n\nSome people claim to have seen dead or living mermaids from places such as Java and British Columbia. There are two Canadian reports from the area of Vancouver and Victoria, BC, one from sometime between 1870 and 1890, the other from 1967.\n\nIn August 2009, the town of Kiryat Yam in Israel offered a prize of $1 million for anyone who could prove that mermaids existed off its coast, after dozens of people said they had seen a mermaid leaping out of the water like a dolphin and doing tricks in the air before returning back to where it had come from. The prize has not yet been awarded.\n\nOne famous image was created by John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, called \"A Mermaid\" (see the top of this article). It was an example of late British Academy style art, but disappeared and was not found until the 1970s. It is again in the collection of the Royal Academy.\n\nThe most famous in more recent centuries is Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" (1836), which has been translated into many languages.\n\nThe best known musical about mermaids are those by Felix Mendelssohn in his \"Fair Melusina\" and the three \"Rhine daughters\" in Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.\n\nMovies with mermaids in them are drama television series such as \"Charmed\". Animated movies include Disney's popular musical version of Andersen's tale, and Hayao Miyazaki's Ponyo.\n\nIn heraldry, mermaids are most well known to be presented with a comb or a mirror, and also thought of to be very vain.\n\nA mermaid that had a shield and sword (\"Syrenka\") is on the official Coat of arms of Warsaw. The city of Norfolk, Virginia also uses a mermaid as a symbol.\n\nThe personal coat of arms of Michaëlle Jean, Canada's Governor General, features two mermaids.\n\nIn the 19th century, P. T. Barnum showed in his museum a taxidermal hoax called the \"Fiji mermaid.\" Others have made similar hoaxes, which are usually made by paper-mâché or parts of dead creatures, usually monkeys and fish, stitched together too look like a mermaid. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, pictures of Fiji \"mermaids\" came up on the Internet as examples of items that had washed up onto the beach, though they were no more real than Barnum's exhibit.\n\nSirenia is a type of plant-eating mammal like the manatee the dugong that only live in rivers, swamps, and in other large areas of water. Mariners used to call these animals mermaids.\n\nSirenomelia, also called \"mermaid syndrome\", is a rare disorder. It happens when a child is born with his or her legs grown together and little or no genitalia. This, however, is as rare as conjoined twins, and only happens to one out of every 100,000 live births. It is usually very bad for the kidney and bladder, and only about four survivors were known to be alive as of July 2003.\n\nIn Thai folklore \"Phra Abhai Manee\" there is a beautiful mermaid named \"Praphanpheloung\". She is a beautiful lady who has tail instead of legs. The story told us about a charming prince who was taken by the giantess \"Pisua Samudr\" and lived together with her until they have a son named \"Sin -Samudr\". One day Sin Samudr went out of a cave and took a merman to his father who was locked in the cave. The merman knew the story well about a young prince so he want to help him and his son escape from the giantess. The story also mention about what mermaid look like. They are very beautiful with long black hair and pale skin. They love to sing and swim under the moon. Their eyes can be able to see in the dark but blur vision in the sun. Thai folklore \"Phra Abhai Manee\" was written by the famous poet named \"Sunthornphu\" because of the story happened near the shore so people placed his characters statues such as a giantess, the prince and a mermaid at Rayong, Thailand\n\nMermaids are shown as characters in movies, including \"Splash\" and \"Aquamarine\".\n\n", "id": "132835", "title": "Mermaid"}

It is a very difficult book, even for the German reader.\n\nIn it, and later works, Heidegger maintained that our way of questioning defines our nature. But philosophy, western civilization's chief way of questioning, has lost its way. Finding ourselves \"always already\" fallen in a world of presuppositions, we lose touch with what being was before its truth became \"muddled\". As a solution to this condition, Heidegger advocated a return to practical life in the world, allowing it to reveal, or \"unconceal\" itself.\n", "id": "132925", "title": "Martin Heidegger"}

His philosophy was based on materialistic monism. Materialistic monism is the belief that everything in the universe is made of a single substance. Parmenides' biggest argument was that change does not exist.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=132957", "text": "Alcoholic drink\n\nAn alcoholic drink is a drink that contains 0.5% or more ethanol. In chemistry there is a whole class of substances known as alcohols. The alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is known as ethanol or \"grain alcohol\". Grain alcohol is generally made through a process called fermentation. In fermentation, bacteria change sugar to make ethanol or vinegar. Other kinds of alcohol are usually harmful to drink, so the only kind of alcohol used in alcoholic drinks is grain alcohol. Since most people do not have to use any other kind of alcohol except ethanol, they will use the word \"alcohol\" to mean only ethanol. Sometimes people also use the world \"alcohol\" to talk about any drink containing ethanol, such as whiskey, vodka, or gin.\n\nFermenting grain can only make a drink that is 20% alcohol. To get higher amounts of alcohol in drinks, distillation is used. This allows to get substances that are made of alcohol to about 80-85% (Certain kinds of Rum used for cooking are at 70–80% alcohol). When beverages are sold, the amount of alcohol is listed as alcoholic proof rather than percentage. \n\nGenerally, alcoholic drinks are divided into three classes:\n\nMost countries limit the sale of the different kinds of alcohol. Usually there are two limits, one for wines and beers, and the other for distilled alcoholic drinks. \n\nAlcopops are very sweet, and usually do not contain much alcohol (most have less than beer), but many governments make it illegal to buy them in certain places or at certain times because they have distilled alcohol mixed into them. They are controversial because some people think that they might be popular among young people.\n\nDrinking ethanol causes a person to feel relaxed. Ethanol is very commonly used, and has been made by humans for thousands of years. It is one of the oldest and most used recreational drug (drugs used for fun) in the world. People may overuse it for the same reason. The addiction to alcohol is called alcoholism. Alcoholic drinks can be dangerous. If a person drinks a lot of alcohol, they become intoxicated, meaning that they get drunk. People who are drunk may do or say strange things and may not be able to control themselves. The amount of alcohol that it takes to get somebody drunk is different from person to person. All alcohols are toxic, but ethanol is less toxic because the human body can break it down quickly. Some strong alcohols can also cause intoxication and impairment.\n\n", "id": "132957", "title": "Alcoholic drink"}

She is the lead vocalist and co-founder of the alternative metal band Evanescence. She is also a classically trained pianist and a multi-instrumentalist.\n\nLee is musically influenced by musicians and artists of different genres, from classical artists such as Mozart to modern artists like Björk, Portishead, Danny Elfman, Korn and Tori Amos. Lee is the main lyricist and composer in the band and won the National Music Publisher's Association's Songwriter Icon Award in 2008 for her achievements as a songwriter. As of mid-2007, she is the only original band member who is still in the band.\n\nLee is the spokesperson of the Epilepsy Foundation. She started a campaign called \"Out of the Shadows\". She advocates for the \"To Write Love on Her Arms\" organization. She was chosen as the 2012 recipient of the Luella Bennack award at United Cerebral Palsy's 11th annual Women Who Care luncheon for her community projects and social impact.\n\nLee ranked at #69 in Hit Parader's list of \"Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time\". She was #49 in VH1's \"100 Greatest Women in Music\". She was listed by About.com as one of the greatest female rock artists. She won the 2012 Revolver's Golden Gods award for best vocalist, and was named the 2012 \"Rock Goddess of the Year\" in the Loudwire Music Awards.\n\nLee was born in Riverside, California. Her parents were John Lee, a disc jockey, and Sara Lee (née Cargill). She was named after the 1970s song \"Amie\" by Pure Prairie League. Her family moved to many places. They settled in Little Rock, Arkansas when she was 13 years old. She has two sisters, Carrie and Lori, and one brother, Robby. She had a third sister who died 1987. Lee wrote the songs \"Hello\" and \"Like You\" for her late sister. She is mostly of Scottish and English heritage. Lee recalls growing up around music and that she and her siblings, took music lessons.\n\nLee first wanted to become a classical composer. She wrote “Eternity of the Remorse” on piano at the age of eleven. She describes it as a \"depressing\" and \"dramatic\" piece. Her first “real” song is “A Single Tear”. It was written for an English assignment for eighth grade. She wrote the song and recorded it on a cassette with a friend who sang back-up vocals.\n\nLee studied at Pulaski Academy. She identified herself as an \"art nerd\" or \"choir nerd\" during her high school years and would listen to alternative and heavy metal music. She joined the school's mixed choir and sang as an alto. She became president of the choir council in her senior year. At age 17, Lee wrote a choir arrangement called \"Listen to the Rain\". It impressed her choir teacher, who encouraged Lee to direct the choir's performance of the song. Her direction of the choir during her graduation ceremony received a positive reaction from the audience. This experience made her feel more accepted for her skills amongst her peers. The song was also featured in Evanescence's EP \"Sound Asleep\".\n\nLee described her school years as a \"weird fit for [her]\" and was \"a loner for while\". She believes that this is what inspired her to get into writing, which became an \"outlet for all the bad stuff [she] was feeling\". Lee was voted to be on homecoming court, but missed the announcement because she didn't expect to get chosen. She graduated from high school in 2000. She briefly attended Middle Tennessee State University to study music theory and composition. She dropped out to focus on her band.\n\nBen Moody first met Lee at a Christian youth summer camp in 1994 and was impressed by her performance of the Meat Loaf song \"I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Will not Do That)\" on the piano. The two started writing songs together and performing at bookstores and coffee houses. After two of their songs were played on local radio stations, they became more popular in their area and were asked to appear in local concerts. The band went on to make two EPs, \"Evanescence EP\" (1998) \"and Sound Asleep/Whisper EP\" (1999). The EPs were distributed and sold to concert audiences.\n\nIn 2001, the band went to Ardent Studios in Memphis to mix a number of demos. There they met producer Pete Matthews who was impressed by their work and invited the band to move to Memphis and work on more songs while he showcased their demos to a number of labels. After playing the song \"My Immortal\" to Matthews' friend Diana Meltzer at Wind-Up Records, she became interested in signing the band a record deal. The band moved to Los Angeles once they were signed; however, because they were \"still young and needed to be developed\", they were enrolled in an artist development program for two years before they were given a producer to work with. During this time, Lee was given classes in stage presence and movement. She also applied to become a waitress before Fallen was released.\n\nLee was involved in a number of controversial issues with the band. Moody left the band in 2003 because of \"creative differences\" with Lee. Moody later explained his reason for leaving Evanescence in an interview with MTV \"If I stayed, I think Amy and I would have destroyed [Evanescence] because we just weren't heading in the same direction; we were pulling it in two different directions. It was bad\". Moody also revealed in an interview with Spin Magazine that he had tried convincing her of leaving the band instead \"I had tried before, out of ignorance, pride, and resentment, to convince Amy that she should leave. That we'd be better off and Evanescence didn't need her\" and followed this statement with an apology to Lee.\n\nLee has not spoken to Moody since his departure from the band. She stated in an interview with Blender in 2006 that she doesn't hate Ben, but they \"need to just live [their] separate lives\". In an interview with MTV, Moody hinted towards his advances for mending their relationship by inviting her for a movie along with David Hodges. Though Lee didn’t respond, a representative told Moody that she was actually considering accepting the invitation.\n\nIn 2005, former Evanescence manager Dennis Rider filed a $10 million lawsuit against Lee for breach of contract, which she responded to with a counter-suit for \"breach of fiduciary duty\" among other claims.\n\nIn 2007, she fired guitarist John LeCompt and soon after, drummer Rocky Gray quit the band, making Lee the only original member left in the band. In a blog post, LeCompt claimed that Lee fired him through a phone call without \"any warning or negotiations\" and \"for no good reason\". Lee defended her choice, claiming that LeCompt \"didn't really care about Evanescence at all, and just stayed around for the money\" and that she fired him to save the band from being \"driven into the ground\". Later, in an interview with Spin Magazine, Lee noted that both LeCompt and Gray's writing \"didn't work for Evanescence\" and believes they \"got bored or frustrated\" because of this.\n\nLee often addresses these issues in interviews. In an interview with MTV, Lee noted that “there's always freaking drama”. However, since the line-up change in 2010, Lee has stated that the band has become \"stronger\" and more cohesive.\n\nLee is the main lyricist and composer in the band, being credited as a songwriter in every song since the release of Fallen. She also maintains solo writing credits for songs such as Lithium and Lost in Paradise. Lee claims that during her years as a high school student, she would listen to music that was not necessarily popular at the time. Her lyrics are often associated to themes ranging from hopelessness, introspection and loss to self-respect and empowerment.\n\nLee is influenced by a variety of artists and genres. Her music is often described as a blend between rock and classical music, possessing an emotional and dark character. During her early years, Lee wanted to be a classical composer after watching the movie Amadeus, which was based on the life of Mozart. She wrote her first classical composition on piano at the age of 11 and describes it as a \"very dramatic\" piece. She also named “Lacrymosa”, a part of Mozart’s Requiem, her favorite classical music piece.\n\nShe credits “The Nightmare Before Christmas” as her “number one biggest influence artistically in every way” and would often sing to “Sally’s Song” when she was younger. She cites Björk as a big influence. In an interviews with Revolver Magazine, Lee noted Björk's influence on her lyrics \"The way [Björk] uses the English language, probably because it’s not her first language, she uses it for the way the words sound as much as what the words mean. That always inspired me. When I’m writing lyrics, I think that way, too. I want the meaning to matter, but the way they actually sound coming out your mouth matters, too\". She also listed songs such as \"Pagan Poetry\", \"Joga\" and \"Crystalline\" as some of her favorite and most inspirational Björk songs. Additionally, Michael Jackson was one of Lee’s music idols as a teenager and considers him to be highly inspirational. Other influences include: Portishead, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Korn, Marvin Gaye, Massive Attack, Depeche Mode and SoundGarden.\n\nLee has stated in several interviews that she likes to experiment with different musical elements and doesn't like \"doing the same thing over and over again”. She has experimented with electronic music, most prominently in the first sessions of the pre-production phase of the bands’ third album. She has also expressed interest in folk music.\n\nLee has been classically trained in piano for 9 years and uses simple chords with left-hand backing in songs. She often includes the piano as a main or background instrument into the bands’ music, most prominently in the album \"The Open Door\". Several music critics consider the piano accompaniment as a characteristic feature of Evanescence’s music. Lee often plays the piano during live performances in selected songs, and has been known to cover songs on the piano as well, such the Korn song “Thoughtless”. She can play the acoustic guitar and has been training in harp, lightly utilizing this instrument in the bands’ third record, most prominently in the song “Secret Door”.\n\nAmerican recording artist Kelly Clarkson described Lee's concert performances as \"intense\" and thinks that she's \"a beautiful vocalist, and has great taste in melodies and music\". Clarkson also revealed through her Twitter that she would like to sing a duet with Lee.\n\nLee has a total vocal range that goes from a dark C3 (With or Without You) to a E6 (MTV Diary warm up), with her highest recorded note in mixed voice being an F5 in the songs \"The Only One\" and \"Never Go Back\"; and in head voice a C#6 in the song “Weight of the World” and D#6 in \"Your Star\". Her lowest recorded notes are D3 in the song \"Weight of the World\" and Eb3 in \"Cloud Nine\". In an MTV special, Lee managed to hit an E6 live during a vocal warm-up in full head voice, also showing that she is capable of reaching up to Bb7 through exclamation. She is popularly classified as a lyric Soprano, though this has not been confirmed by Lee herself.\n\nLee is not professionally trained in singing and applies what she learned from her years as a choir member in high school. Her lower to mid-range belts are often supported, if not resonant, and she can sustain notes in the 5th octave in all vowels. She also uses several vocal dynamics in her singing, most notably crescendos.\n\nCritics often consider Lee’s vocals to be one of the highlights of the bands’ music, describing it as “ethereal”, “dramatic” and “haunting” while praising its “powerful” and “crystalline” qualities.\n\nA very notable theme in Lee's lyrics is relationship struggles. She often identifies various events in life with a story between herself and a lover, evident in the song “What You Want” which is actually inspired by her love for her band and fans. She also writes about her actual relationship struggles, examples include “Call Me When You’re Sober”, referring to her ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan. Additionally, she often incorporates dark and mysterious themes into the bands’ music, and has mentioned that she is particularly fascinated with the idea of death and beyond. She also resorts to imaginative and picturesque themes as seen in songs such as “Imaginary” and “Lithium”. The songs “Hello” and “Like You” were written in honor of Lee’s deceased sister.\nFurthermore, Lee’s songs are generally inspired by her life struggles and personal experiences. “Bring Me to Life” was written after meeting a psychiatrist who understood her hidden feelings, while “Snow White Queen” was written after a turbulent experience with a stalker. She described her writing process in the song “All That I’m Living For”, explaining that she mostly writes at night time.\nAfter Moody's departure from the band, Lee dismissed the public assumption that Evanescence's music would be softer and that \"all the sappy stuff comes from [her]\", explaining that Moody was \"more about the pop influence and being commercial\" while she wanted to do \"the more artistic, weird thing\".\n\nLee wrote most of the bands’ self-titled album with the fans in mind, describing her relationship with them through different lyrical themes. She also explored more into global issues such as sex trafficking and the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami for this album in the songs “My Heart is Broken” and “Never Go Back”, respectively.\n\nLee was honored by the National Music Publisher's Association with their 2008 Songwriter Icon Award, which recognizes outstanding songwriters for personal achievement. Lee received the award during the annual NMPA meeting in New York City and performed a song to the attendance as well.\n\nLee has an eclectic clothing style mostly inspired by Victorian, Gothic and Japanese fashion. She is known to design many of her outfits, such as the outfits she wore for the video of “Going Under” and the dress she wore to the Noble Peace Prize concert in 2011. She occasionally makes her clothes herself. In an interview with VEVO stylized, Lee showcased and explained her fashion style, commenting that she’d rather make her own clothes because it’s hard to find what she exactly wants elsewhere. Lee stated that her daily style is very different from when she performs; describing it as \"funky, spooky, cute\" in an interview. She explained that her on-stage wardrobe was meant to preserve the atmosphere of the songs and complete the image. In another interview, she stated that when the band first started performing, she used to heavily wear corsets in fear of diluting the bands’ image, but has gradually become more comfortable with her own style. Her current on-stage style is often characterized by boots, a simple black tank top, a skirt and various ornaments and accessories.\n\nFurthermore, Lee dyes her hair jet black. During the Fallen era, she used to use blue contact lenses and had a distinct piercing on her left eyebrow. She has not used them since.\n\nMany fans admire Lee for not using sex appeal in her music. Lee frequently criticized women who are involved in show-business for abusing their positions as idols by sexualizing their image. The song “Everybody’s Fool” was written by Lee to mock such celebrities after seeing how her sister was infatuated by this trend. The video to this song emphasizes how celebrities peddle lies through projecting an image opposite to who they are.\n\nIn 2005, Lee came in 4th in Kerrang!'s 50 Sexiest People in Rock list. She was listed in Blender as one of the hottest women in rock in 2006, alongside other singers such as Joan Jett and Liz Phair. Revolver Magazine named Lee the #1 Hottest Chick in Hard Rock for their 2011 annual issue and she appeared on the front cover. When asked about this in an interview, Lee responded \"You have to look at all of that as just press. I'm not the hottest chick in whatever. I'm a normal girl and it takes a lot of makeup and retouching to make that cover look good\". She also came in at #9 in KROQ's 2011 list of \"The Twenty Sexiest Singers of Female-Fronted Rock Bands\".\n\nLee is married to therapist and long time friend Josh Hartzler. They were engaged on January 8th, 2007, with Lee making the first official announcement on January 9th. They were married on May 6th, 2007 and through a post to the bands' fan club message boards, she announced that she was \"officially Mrs. Amy Hartzler\". Hartzler was the inspiration behind the songs \"Bring Me to Life\" and \"Good Enough\".\n\nLee was involved in a romantic relationship with Seether frontman Shaun Morgan from 2003 till 2005. Their breakup inspired Lee to write the song \"Call When Me You're Sober\" which she said was about “the big relationship [she] was in, and the whole breakup, which was really long”. Morgan responded to the song, saying that he was “really upset that she would say and do those things” yet “didn't feel the need to write back and be mean”.\n\nWhen she was younger, Lee wanted to become a veterinarian, but lost her interest after seeing a dog surgery on the television. Lee mentioned that if she wasn’t pursuing a career in music, she would have entered a field in which she could help people, especially abused kids. During the bands’ hiatus, Lee was considering taking a job as a music teacher for children.\n\nLee’s hobbies include painting and cooking. She sketched the design of the cover art for “The Open Door” and painted the cover art of the charity single “Together Again”. She also hinted during a Q&A with fans that she wanted to start a cooking show. Lee owns two cats named Stella and Shermie.\n\nIn 2011, Lee explained that one of the reasons behind Evanescence's lengthy hiatus after the conclusion of \"The Open Door Tour\" was because she was feeling pressurized by her band duties, mostly due to the hectic schedule and quick rise to fame. According to Lee, she \"just needed to get away from it\" and \"wanted to be a normal person for a minute\" because her \"entire adult life [...] was all about [Evanescence]\".\n\nLee became the American chairperson of the Epilepsy foundation in 2005, and started a campaign called \"Out of the Shadows\" to raise awareness about epilepsy. She gained interest about this medical condition because her brother suffers from epilepsy.\n\nLee supports and advocates To Write Love on Her Arm, a non profit organization aiming to help people struggling with depression, addiction and self-harm. In 2010, she supported Restore Freedom, a campaign against sex trafficking, where she helped and advocated towards building a safehouse in New York that shelters and helps survivors of sex trafficking. She currently has page in the Restore NYC website in which she urges people to donate and help the cause. Lee later revealed that being involved in this cause inspired her to write the song \"My Heart is Broken\".\n\nLee was chosen as the 2012 recipient of the Luella Bennack award at United Cerebral Palsy's 11th annual Women Who Care luncheon, which celebrates women who dedicate time for community projects and charities. In a statement released by the UCP of New York City, Lee was selected \"because of her personal pledge to making life more accessible and understood by everyone\", as well as for the \"integrity\" of her music that \"inspired and transformed millions of women worldwide\".\n\nIn 2000, Lee was featured in two songs by former Evanescence member David Hodges, “Breathe” and “Fall into You”. In 2003, Lee joined artists such as Milla Jovovich and Maynard James Keenan in a discrete musical project for supergroup The Damning Well. She provided vocals on two tracks, one of which was a duet with former Filter vocalist Richard patrick, but her vocals were eventually taken off the final release because of record label issues. She also sang backup vocals on Big Dismal’s song \"Believe\" from their first album.\n\nLee appeared in the Seether song \"Broken\" in 2004, where she performed a duet with Shaun Morgan. The song was featured in Seether’s 2004 album, Disclaimer II, and soundtrack for the 2004 movie The Punisher. Broken was released as a single and Lee appeared in the music video wearing black wings.\n\nIn February 2007, during an MTV: Unplugged session featuring the band Korn, Lee performed a duet with vocalist Jonathan Davis in an acoustic version of the song “Freak on a Leash”. MTV later released the song as part of MTV: Unplugged Korn, and became the first single off the album.\n\nDuring Finger Eleven's opening act for an Evanescence concert in Providence, Rhode Island in 2007, Lee came on stage to perform the song \"One Thing\" with the band. Additionally, Lee performed the song \"Epiphany\" with Staind's lead singer Aaron Lewis during the 2007 \"My Coke Fest\" held in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nWhen asked who she was interested in collaborating with, Lee chose Depeche Mode, Danny Elfman and Daft Punk. She further described a collaboration in which Elfman would write music similar to movie scores, while Lee would write the vocal parts and lyrics.\n\nLee hinted towards releasing a solo album since 2008. Lee told Spin Magazine that she wanted to prove she’s “more than a one trick pony” and would like to do something different. She also mentioned that the music she was writing at the time was “nothing [she] would categorize as Evanescence\".\n\nAfter writing much of the material for Evanescence’s third album, Lee decided to scrap the songs and start over with the writing process because the songs were “not right for Evanescence” and had little involvement from the rest of the band members. However, in an interview with Pulse of Radio, Lee noted the possibility of using the discarded tracks in future projects “I think it’s totally possible that some of those songs will end up in a different project someday – maybe solo, maybe something else”.\n\nLee made an appearance on Cartoon Network in 2004, where she \"did an interview with a puppet\" and performed a \"cheesy song on the guitar about Cartoon Network\". She made this appearance for her brother, Robby, who was 10 at the time.\n\nShe appeared briefly in the music video for Johnny Cash’s “God’s Gonna Cut You Down” in late 2006.

These warheads are attached to a rocket motor and the rocket has fins which help it to fly straight. Some types of RPG are reloadable, while others are used only once and then thrown away. RPGs, with the exception of self-contained versions, are loaded from the muzzle, that is the front part. \n\nRPGs with High explosive anti-tank warheads are very effective against armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs). They can also be used against tanks, as long as the shooter targets a weak part of the tank, such as the tracks or the top door of the turret. \n\nIn general, the front armour on a tank is too thick to be penetrated by an RPG warhead. In some cases, teams attacking tanks with RPGs will have multiple RPG users fire at the same tank, which may penetrate the armour.

He was a native of Ephesus, Ionia, on the coast of Asia Minor. \n\nHis teaching, as we have it now, is a series of epigrams. that is, sayings and remarks, rather than systematic essays. Heraclitus is famous for his doctrine of change being central to the universe. His famous sayings, \"All is flux\", and \"You cannot step twice into the same river\" is still remembered today. Another of his sayings appeals to some psychologists:\n\nOften it is difficult to understand what he saying. He believed in the unity of opposites, stating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\". His utterance that \"all things come to be in accordance with this \"logos\",\" (literally, \"word,\" \"reason,\" or \"account\") has been the subject of many interpretations.\n\nDiogenes Laërtius states that Heraclitus' work was \"a continuous treatise \"On Nature\", but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology.\" Theophrastus says (in Diogenes) \"... some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley\".\n\nDiogenes also tells us that Heraclitus deposited his book as a dedication in the great temple of Artemis, the Artemisium, one of the largest temples of the 6th century BC, and one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Ancient temples were regularly used for storing treasures, and were open to private individuals under exceptional circumstances.

Many, notably Aristotle, regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition.\n\nAccording to Bertrand Russell, \"Western philosophy begins with Thales\". Thales attempted to explain natural phenomena without reference to mythology and was tremendously influential in this respect. Almost all of the other pre-Socratic philosophers follow him in attempting to provide an explanation of ultimate substance, change, and the existence of the world—without reference to mythology. Those philosophers were also influential, and eventually Thales' rejection of mythological explanations became an essential idea for science. He was also the first to define general principles and set forth hypotheses. As a result he has been called the \"Father of Science\", though maybe Democritus is more deserving of this title.\n\nIn mathematics, Thales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Also, Thales was the first person known to have studied electricity.\n", "id": "133011", "title": "Thales"}

In Ancient Greece, sophism was practiced by \"sophists\", who were a group of teachers of philosophy and rhetoric. In the modern definition, a sophism is a confusing or slightly incorrect argument used for deceiving someone.\n\nThe word \"sophism\" originated from the Greek word σόφισμα, \"sophisma\" (from σοφίζω, \"sophizo\" meaning \"I am wise\"). \n\nThe similar Greek word σοφιστής, \"sophistēs\" means \"wise-ist, one who does wisdom, one who makes a business out of wisdom\" while σοφός, \"sophós\" means a \"wise man\".\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras \n(ca. 490–420 BC) is often said to be the first of the sophists. Others include: Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias, Thrasymachus, Lycophron, Callicles, Antiphon, and Cratylus.\n\nPlato opposed those sophists because they only abused wisdom for their own interest and refused the truth and justice.\nIn modern usage, \"sophism\", \"sophist\", and \"sophistry\" are derogatory terms, due the influence of many philosophers in the past. Sophism and platonism were rival schools, as enemies of each other.\n\nA \"sophism\" is a statement to deceive someone in a debate or conversation. It might be made to seem to make sense when really being wrong, or it might use difficult words and complicated sentences to intimidate the audience into agreeing. An argument \"ad hominem\" is an example of sophistry.\n\nA \"sophist\" is a person who uses sophisms. \"Sophistry\" means using sophisms for subtly deceptive reasoning or argumentation.\n", "id": "133020", "title": "Sophism"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133052", "text": "Pirate code\n\nA pirate code is a code of conduct for pirates - a set of rules for how to behave. Some of these codes were used by real pirates; others are from movies.\n\nIn the second half of the 17th century, pirates started following rules. These rules had many different names, including Chasse-Partie, Charter Party, Custom of the Coast, or Jamaica Discipline. Eventually, they became known as Articles of Agreement, or the pirate's code. These changed from one captain to another. Sometimes they were different from one voyage (journey) to another. These rules included punishments for rule breakers and said how much treasure each crew member would receive.\n\nEach crew member signed the articles (or if they could not write, they would make a mark to show they agreed). After the rules were signed, they were then posted in a common place, often the door of the grand cabin.\n\nThere are three known sets of these rules that still exist today. Most of these come from Charles Johnson's book \"A General History of the Pyrates\". Part of a code from Henry Morgan, a famous British pirate, is remembered in a book called \"The Buccaneers of America\" by Alexandre Exquemelin, who probably sailed with Morgan as a ship's doctor. Very few of these rules still exist today, because often pirates burned the papers before being caught. They did this to prevent these papers from being used against them.\n\nOne of the most famous sets of pirate rules was written in 1720 by the famous Welsh pirate Bartholomew Roberts.\n\nI. Every man has a vote in affairs of moment; has equal title to the fresh provisions, or strong liquors, at any time seized, and may use them at pleasure, unless a scarcity (not an uncommon thing among them) makes it necessary, for the good of all, to vote a retrenchment.\n\n\"(This means that all crew members can vote on issues on the ship. All crew members can have any food or drink they have stolen, unless there is not much to go around.)\"\n\nII. Every man to be called fairly in turn, by list, on board of prizes because, (over and above their proper share) they were on these occasions allowed a shift of clothes: but if they defrauded the company to the value of a dollar in plate, jewels, or money, marooning was their punishment. If the robbery was only betwixt one another, they contented themselves with slitting the ears and nose of him that was guilty, and set him on shore, not in an uninhabited place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter hardships.\n\n\"(When the pirates stole money or other treasure, every pirate would get a share. But if one pirate defrauded the group by taking more than his share, he would be punished by marooning - being left alone on an island where there were no other people, with no food or water and no way to escape. If a pirate stole from one other pirate, the guilty pirate would be punished by having his ears and nose cut, and left on shore.)\"\n\nIII. No person to game at cards or dice for money.\n\n\"(This means that crew members cannot gamble using money while playing cards or dice)\"\n\nIV. The lights and candles to be put out at eight o'clock at night: if any of the crew, after that hour still remained inclined for drinking, they were to do it on the open deck.\n\n\"(This means that all fires had to be put out by 8:00 PM. If crew members wanted to drink after 8:00 PM, then they had to do it on deck.)\"\n\nV. To keep their piece, pistols, and cutlass clean and fit for service.\n\n\"(This means that crew members' weapons had to be kept clean)\"\n\nVI. No boy or woman to be allowed amongst them. If any man were to be found seducing any of the latter sex, and carried her to sea, disguised, he was to suffer death;(so that when any fell into their hands, as it chanced in the Onslow, they put a sentinel immediately over her to prevent ill consequences from so dangerous an instrument of division and quarrel; but then here lies the roguery; they contend who shall be sentinel, which happens generally to one of the greatest bullies, who, to secure the lady's virtue, will let none lie with her but himself.)\n\n\"(This means that no young boys or women were allowed to be crew members. If a crew member took a woman out to sea in disguise, then he would be killed as punishment.)\"\n\nVII. To desert the ship or their quarters in battle, was punished with death or marooning.\n\n\"(This means that if a crew member ran away from battle, he would be killed or left on a deserted island.)\"\n\nVIII. No striking one another on board, but every man's quarrels to be ended on shore, at sword and pistol. (The quarter-master of the ship, when the parties will not come to any reconciliation, accompanies them on shore with what assistance he thinks proper, and turns the disputant back to back, at so many paces distance; at the word of command, they turn and fire immediately, (or else the piece is knocked out of their hands). If both miss, they come to their cutlasses, and then he is declared the victor who draws the first blood.)\n\n\"(This means that the crew members were not allowed to fight on the ship. If they had to fight, they would fight on shore. They would start with a duel where both pirates tried to shoot each other. If both of them missed, they would fight with their swords. They were not allowed any help from other crew members in their fight.)\"\n\nIX. No man to talk of breaking up their way of living, till each had shared one thousand pounds. If in order to this, any man should lose a limb, or become a cripple in their service, he was to have eight hundred dollars, out of the public stock, and for lesser hurts, proportionately.\n\n\"(This means that no crew member was allowed to leave the ship's crew until each member had 1000 pounds' share of plunder (stolen money or goods). If a crew member became seriously injured, he would be given 800 dollars.)\"\n\nX. The captain and quartermaster to receive two shares of a prize: the master, boatswain, and gunner, one share and a half, and other officers one and quarter.\n\n\"(The captain and the quartermaster each receive two shares of stolen money or goods (double what the regular pirates got). The master, boatswain, and gunner each receive one and a half shares of stolen money or goods. Other officers receive one and one fourth shares of stolen money or goods.)\"\n\nXI. The musicians to have rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other six days and nights, none without special favour.\n\n\"(Musicians could not play music on the Sabbath Day.)\"\n\nCaptain John Phillips, captain of the \"Revenge\", also set a code for his men in 1724:\n\nI. Every Man Shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share and a half of all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.\n\n\"(Every pirate had to obey the rules and orders of the Captain and other people in charge. The Captain would get one and a half shares of any stolen money or goods. The Master, Carpenter, Boatswain, and Gunner would get one and a quarter shares.)\"\n\nII. If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be marooned with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.\n\n\"(If any pirate talked about running away from the ship, or kept any secret from the group, he would be marooned. A pirate who was marooned by Captain Phillips would be left on a deserted island with one bottle of water, a small gun, a bottle of gunpowder and one bullet, so he could shoot and kill himself if he wanted to.)\"\n\nIII. If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be marooned or shot.\n\n\"(If a pirate stole anything from the ship that was worth more than a piece of eight (a Spanish dollar), he would be marooned or killed.)\"\n\nIV. If any time we shall meet another Marooner that Man shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.\n\nV. That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive Moses’s Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare Back.\n\n\"(A pirate who hit another pirate would be whipped 39 times on his bare back.)\"\n\nVI. That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoke Tobacco in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.\n\n\"(A pirate that fired a gun when not in battle, smoked tobacco in the hold (where gunpowder was kept), or carried a candle that was not in a lantern, would be whipped 39 times on the bare back. These things were dangerous because they could start fires on the ship or make the gunpowder on the ship explode.)\"\n\nVII. That Man shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.\n\n\"(If a pirate did not keep his weapons clean and ready for battle, or did not do his job, he would not get a share of any stolen money or goods. He could also be punished in any other way that the Captain and other pirates decided.)\"\n\nVIII. If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have 400 Pieces of Eight ; if a Limb, 800.\n\n\"(A pirate who lost a joint in battle would be given 400 pieces of eight. A pirate who lost an arm or a leg would be given 800 pieces of eight.)\"\n\nIX. If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death.\n\n\"(Any pirate that tried to rape a woman would be killed.)\"\n\nThe \"Boston News-Letter\", an old newspaper published in the 1700s, printed these rules and said they were set by Captain Edward Low. The first eight of these articles are basically the same as the rules that Charles Johnson's book says Captain George Lowther used. Since Lowther and Low are known to have sailed together from about January 1, 1722 to May 28, 1722, Low and Lowther probably did use the same articles. Low's two extra articles were probably \"ordinance\", or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.\n\nI. The Captain is to have two full Shares; the [quarter] Master is to have one Share and one Half; The Doctor, Mate, Gunner and Boatswain, one Share and one Quarter.\n\nII. He that shall be found guilty of taking up any Unlawful Weapon on Board the Privateer or any other prize by us taken, so as to Strike or Abuse one another in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall see fit.\n\n\"(A pirate who was found guilty of taking a weapon onto the ship with the goal of hurting another pirate would be punished. The punishment would be voted on by the pirates, and would be whatever the Captain and most of the pirates decided.)\"\n\nIII. He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardice in the time of engagements, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.\n\n\"(A pirate who was found guilty of being a coward - not being brave enough - during battle would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.)\"\n\nIV. If any Gold, Jewels, Silver, &c. be found on Board of any Prize or Prizes to the value of a Piece of Eight, & the finder do not deliver it to the Quarter Master in the space of 24 hours he shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.\n\n\"(If a pirate had any stolen money or goods that were worth more than a piece of eight, he had to give it to the Quarter-Master within 24 hours. If he did not, he would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.)\"\n\nV. He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding one another to the value of a Royal of Plate, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and the Majority of the Company shall think fit.\n\n\"(If a pirate was found guilty of gambling for money, or stealing money from another pirate, he would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.)\"\n\nVI. He that shall have the Misfortune to loose a Limb in time of Engagement, shall have the Sum of Six hundred pieces of Eight, and remain aboard as long as he shall think fit.\n\n\"(If a pirate lost an arm or a leg during battle, he would be given 600 pieces of eight. The pirate could decide whether to stay on the ship or leave.)\"\n\nVII. Good Quarters to be given when Craved.\n\nVIII. He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol or Small Arm aboard of her.\n\n\"(The first pirate to see a ship that the pirates could attack would be given the best gun the pirates were able to steal from that ship.)\"\n\nIX. He that shall be guilty of Drunkenness in time of Engagement shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the Company shall think fit.\n\n\"(A pirate who was drunk during a battle would be punished however the Captain and most of the other pirates decided.)\"\n\nX. No snapping of Guns in the Hold.\n\nIn the Disney movie trilogy \"Pirates of the Caribbean\", all the featured pirates are governed by a single Code. While the Code has the force of law in Shipwreck Cove, where a codex containing the complete code is kept under the care of Captain Teague, elsewhere, the Code is treated more as a set of guidelines than as actual rules.\n\n\n", "id": "133052", "title": "Pirate code"}

His work was mostly about religion, politics, sexuality, and personal relationships most notably seen in his best known work \"Hallelujah\". \n\nCohen was added into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.\n\nCohen was born on September 21, 1934 in Westmount, Quebec into a middle-class Canadian Jewish family. His mother was Marsha (Masha) Klonitsky and his father was Nathan Cohen. Cohen's father died when he was nine years old. \n\nDuring his high school years in Westmount, Cohen learned and played the guitar many times and wrote poems. He studied at McGill University.\n\nCohen started a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s. Cohen did not start his music career until 1967, at the age of 33. His first album, \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\" (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: \"Songs from a Room\" (1969), \"Songs of Love and Hate\" (1971) and \"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\" (1974). \n\nHis 1977 record \"Death of a Ladies' Man\" was co-written and produced by Phil Spector. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional \"Recent Songs\", which blended his acoustic style with jazz and Oriental and Mediterranean influences.\n\n\"Hallelujah\" was first released on Cohen's studio album \"Various Positions\" in 1984. Cohen wrote around 80 draft verses for \"Hallelujah\", with one writing session at the Royalton Hotel in New York where he was reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, banging his head on the floor. This became Cohen's best known work. \"I'm Your Man\" in 1988 marked Cohen's most popular album. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, \"The Future\", which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.\n\nCohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of \"Ten New Songs\", which was a major hit in Canada and Europe.

The broadcast meteorologists are employed by the Met Office. The longest serving presenter of BBC weather was Michael Fish, now retired, who appeared for 30 years between 1974 and 2004.\n\nThe first BBC weather forecast was a shipping forecast read on the radio for the Met Office on 14 November 1922. The first daily weather forecast was broadcast 26 March 1923.\n\nIn 1936, the BBC experimented with the world's first weather maps on television. Weather maps were first published in \"The Times\" on 1 April 1875. The BBC started broadcasting the maps in 1949 after World War II. The map filled the whole TV screen, and an off-screen narrator would comment on the next day's weather.\n\nOn 11 January 1954, George Cowling was the first weather forecaster to stand in front of a weather map. To do this, the maps were drawn by hand in the London Weather Centre and were taken across London. The forecasts were presented by the same person who had made them, and were not always right.\n\nIn 1962, a fax machine and an electronic computer were bought by the Met Office. This gave better and quicker forecasting.\n\nSatellite photography was available from 1964, but was of a poor quality and was given on paper, with the coastline etched in felt-tip pen. This did not change until 1973 when a new computer was bought. This made forecasts twice as accurate as earlier ones.\n\nAs computational capability improved, so did graphics technology. Early hand-drawn maps gave way to magnetic symbols, which in turn gave way to bluescreen (CSO) computer-generated imagery technology, each of which allowed the presenter greater control over the information displayed.\n\nEarly magnetic symbols tended to adhere poorly to the maps, and occasional spelling errors (such as the presenter writing 'GOF' instead of 'FOG') marred some broadcasts, but allowed the presenter to show how weather would change over time. The symbols were designed to be 'self-explicit', allowing the viewer to understand the map without a key or legend.\n\nThese were phased out in 1985 for computer graphics, although the basic design of symbols was kept the same. These forecasts were widely acclaimed for their simplicity, winning an award from the Royal Television Society.\n\nPossibly the most famous of the forecasters is the now retired Michael Fish. Famous for his informal manner and eccentric dress sense (he once wore a blue and green blazer emblazoned with all the weather symbols), he was a viewer favourite despite an unfortunate comment before The Great Storm of 1987.\n\nDuring a weather forecast some hours before the storm, Michael Fish started his forecast with the now famous line \nAlthough he was actually referring to a Florida hurricane (Floyd), and went on to forecast stormy conditions over the South of England, the statement has gone down in popular culture as one of the worst mistakes made so publicly.\n\nOn 2 October 2000 BBC Weather underwent a more significant change. Whilst there was not much change to the existing weather symbols new symbols giving information Pollen and Sun levels were introduced. A new more detailed map of Britain was used based on satellite data.\n\n16 May 2005 saw the end of the weather symbols on television after 29 years and 9 months on air. They were replaced by a controversial format as the forecast underwent another redesign, with the flat map replaced by a 3D globe, and weather conditions shown by coloured areas. Cloud cover is indicated by the brightness of the map, while rain and snow are indicated by animated blue and white areas respectively.\n\nThe graphics are provided by Weatherscape XT, which was developed by the commercial arm of the New Zealand Metservice.\n\nThe move polarised opinion; some saw it as more accurate and modern, while others disliked the brown colour chosen for the landmass and the presumed high cost of the graphics. Poor angling of the map, in order to show the curvature of the Earth, led to Scotland appearing little larger than Devon, and Shetland being almost invisible while exaggerating London and the South East. This led to many Scottish commentators claiming the BBC was guilty of a London bias. As a result, the map was realigned, and the moving tour of the UK was lengthened.\n\nThe new look won a prestigious Silver Award at the Promax/BDA Awards in 2006. Criticism has been ongoing however, with some viewers complaining about the colour scheme, and of a lack of detail beyond 36 hours.\n\nThere have been continuous developments since May 2005. In 2006, a rippling effect was introduced to define seas and oceans.\n\nThe BBC Weather website provides outlook weather forecasts for UK and international locations using animated symbols and a format similar in design to that used for the televised broadcasts.\n\nThe website also runs frequent special features about seasonal sports, White Christmas, nature and meteorological science. It also has world weather, UK outlook and weather news. A new beta weather site is currently being developed, to fit in with the rest of the BBC site style.\n\n", "id": "133095", "title": "BBC Weather"}

The substances were discovered early in the 19th century, but it took about 150 years before Robert Robinson worked out their structure.\n\nWhen purified, strychnine is a very toxic colorless crystalline alkaloid. It is very poisonous, the LD is about 10 mg. Strychnine is soluble in alcohol and chloroform, but not in water.\n\nStrychnine has few uses today. It can act as a stimulant, much like caffeine, and is on the list of substances tested for doping in sports. \nIt was used as a pesticide, for killing small vertebrates such as birds and rodents. \n\nStrychnine causes muscular convulsions. It leads to death through asphyxia or exhaustion. The most common source is from the seeds of the \"Strychnos nux vomica\" tree. Strychnine is one of the most bitter substances known. Its taste is detectable in concentrations as low as 1 ppm.\n\nBetween 30 and 120 mg can kill an adult human. Strychnine is rapidly absorbed by the mucous membranes. If it is given under the skin, or intravenously, a quantity of 15 mg may be enough to kill an adult. Benzodiazepines (such as Diazepam) are used by default for emergency treatment. \n\nUnlike the illustrations given in fiction crime novels, Strychnine is not very good for killing someone (when given orally). This is because even diluted at 1:130.000 it can still be tasted. Despite this, some murders happened with Strychnine. Thomas Neill Cream, a serial killer, used it on some of his victims. \n\nBecause of its high toxicity and tendency to cause convulsions, the use of strychnine in medicine was eventually abandoned once safer alternatives became available. \n", "id": "133102", "title": "Strychnine"}

Even today, quinine is used to treat certain forms of malaria, when other drugs fail or are unavailable. In that way, quinine is currently one of the best treatments for \"malaria tropica\", which is caused by plasmodium falciparum. For the other forms of malaria, quinine is no longer used, as other drugs have replaced it. \n\nQuinine relaxes muscles, and was used by the Inca of Peru to stop people from shivering. Europeans first reported using quinine against malaria in Rome in 1631. \n\nThe best type of quinine used to treat malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. Quinine helped Europeans colonize Africa. A historian said that \"it was quinine ... that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa\".\n\nQuinine can cause cinchonism and even death (usually by pulmonary oedema) in some cases.

Human hands are chiral. The left hand is a mirror image of the right hand. You cannot turn or move one of your hands to look exactly the same as the other. This is why you can not put a left handed glove on your right hand, or shake the right hand of a person using your left hand. \n\nIn chemistry, chirality refers to molecules. If a molecule is chiral it has two forms that are mirror images of each other but \"otherwise identical\". \n\nChemists call these \"enantiomers\" or \"optical isomers\". Because the difference between right and left hands is easy to understand, chemists call enantiomers either 'right-' or 'left-handed'. A mixture of equal amounts of the two enantiomers is called a \"racemic mixture\". \n\nMolecular chirality is quite common. It is found in stereochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and biochemistry.\n\nThe symmetry of a molecule (or any other object) tells us whether it is chiral. A molecule is \"achiral\" (not chiral) if it has an axis of symmetry.\n\nA racemic mixture is one with has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. \n\nMany biologically active molecules are chiral, including amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) and sugars. Most of these compounds are of the same chirality. Most amino acids are (left-handed) and sugars are . (right-handed). Proteins made of amino acids, are known as \"left-handed proteins\", whereas amino acids produce \"right-handed proteins\".\n\nThe origin of homochirality in the first place is much discussed. Most believe that the original origin of chiralities was purely random. They think if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, the chemistry might have different chirality. Other theories are possible.\n\nEnzymes, which are chiral, usually only work with one enantiomer of a chiral substrate. Imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.\n\nIt was economical for life-forms to adopt one form or the other of each type of chiral compound. That way we do not need two enzymes for every chemical reaction which involves chirality.\n", "id": "133165", "title": "Chirality"}

This is usually done to add to the overall image effect or to hide something (such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a photograph). \n\nThis technique is used in cartography to produce photomaps by superimposing grid lines, contour lines and other linear or textual mapping features over aerial photographs.\n\nSuperimposition of 2D images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce moiré patterns. Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moiré patterns. The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moiré superimposition image. Such optical acceleration is known as moiré speedup (check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns). When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines, at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moiré patterns, namely line Glass patterns (after Leon Glass, 1969) appear. Similarly, when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns, namely random dot moiré, appears. When one of the layers embeds complex shapes, such as sequences of symbols forming a text, and another layer contains parallel lines or curves, the superimposition image may gives rise to magnified shapes, called shape moiré patterns.\n", "id": "133171", "title": "Superimposition"}

(Some sources give \"by ignorance of the issues\" or even \"by ignoring the issues\" as a translation of ignoratio elenchi.)\n\nAristotle believed that an ignoratio elenchi is a mistake made by a questioner while attempting to falsify a respondent's argument. He called it an ignorance of what makes for a refutation. For Aristotle, ignoratio elenchi amounts to \"ignorance of logic\". In fact, Aristotle goes so far as to say that all logical fallacies can be reduced to what he calls ignoratio elenchi.\n\nModern use limits this term much more narrowly to the kind of mistake described in the first paragraph above.\n\nSimilar to ignoratio elenchi, a \"red herring\" is an argument, given in reply, that does not address the original issue. Critically, a red herring is a \"deliberate\" attempt to change the subject or divert the argument. This is known formally in the English vocabulary as digression which is a neutrally connotated \"Red herring\". The actual problem is eclipsed by the process of re-focusing on something else.\n\n\nMaher: It's arbitrary, isn't it? If you had been born in Pakistan, you wouldn't be believing in Jesus Christ. You would have been told another fairy tale and you would have been believing that.\n\nScarborough: Well, Bill, that's your opinion.\n\n\"Whether Maher's argument is his opinion or not is irrelevant and does not address the argument made.\"\n\n\"The conclusion is ignoratio elenchi, since friendliness and charity are not the main qualifications for induction into the Hall of Fame.\"\n\n\"The existence of worse criminals is a secondary issue which has no bearing on whether the driver deserves a fine for recklessness. If the speaker were deliberately attempting to divert the issue, this would be an example of a red herring. While the argument about how the police should spend their time may have merit, the question of whom the police should prioritize pursuing and the question of what should be done with those the police have caught are separate questions.\"\n\n\"A red herring, the unrelated alleged affair, attempts to change the subject away from the popular policies. However, if the original discussion were of the prime minister's public integrity (encompassing both popularity and conduct), this argument could be perfectly valid. Such as if a politician's election campaign revolved around family values. Then an argument about such an affair would be valid, as it is in direct conflict with a family values platform.\"\n\n", "id": "133317", "title": "Ignoratio elenchi"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133318", "text": "Informal fallacy\n\nAn informal fallacy is an argument whose stated premises fail to support their proposed conclusion. Informal fallacies often come about because of an error in reasoning. The premises are then incorrectly linked to the conclusion. In contrast to a formal fallacy, the error has to do with issues of inference because language is used to state the propositions; natural language allows to say more than the symbolism of formal logic can represent. All informal fallacies of deductive reasoning contain a fundamental disconnect between the premises and the conclusion. This makes the argument invalid. The disconnect often arises because there is a hidden co-premise. If this co premise were stated, it would validate the argument.\n\nInductive informal fallacies are slightly different from their deductive counterparts, because their merit rests in the inductive strength of the premise-conclusion link rather than in the presence of hidden premises. For instance, the fallacy of hasty generalization, can be roughly stated as:\nIf the populations of \"P\" and \"Q\" are both too large to sample completely, then the statement is inductive. In such a case, a hasty generalization occurs when the number of \"P\"s and \"Q\"s is insufficient to represent the respective populations. It is important to distinguish between a principle of reasoning (deductive or inductive) and the premise of an argument.\n\n\n", "id": "133318", "title": "Informal fallacy"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133387", "text": "Self-injury\n\nSelf-injury (SI) or self-harm (SH) occurs when a person hurts his or her body on purpose. This kind of harm is not suicidal behaviour. Many self-harmers hurt themselves because they feel it is the only way to stay alive. However, in some cases the self-harm becomes so bad it can lead to death, and those who self-harm are more likely to commit suicide than those who do not.\n\nThere are many different reasons why a person may hurt themselves, though it is often hard to find an exact cause. Sometimes, the self-harm helps relieve unbearable emotions, or feelings of unreality or numbness. Self-harm is often a symptom of other problems. These problems may include physical abuse, sexual abuse, or eating disorders. Self-harm may also stem from mental problems such as low self esteem or perfectionism.\n\nStudying the causes of self-injury can be difficult or inaccurate, because many self-harmers try to hide their injuries.\n\nSelf-injury is a general term that includes many different types of deliberate harm to the body. There are many things that can be considered self-harm. If someone works their body too hard, for example, this can be seen as a mild form of self-injury. In other mild cases, a self-harmer may purposely pick off scabs to keep cuts or scratches from healing. Compulsive hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and compulsive skin-picking (dermotillomania) are impulse control disorders which are also mild forms of self-harm. \n\nIn more severe cases, a self-harmer could break or sprain a bone, or lose a dangerous amount of blood. Biting, burning, and cutting are other forms of self-injury. Overdosing on medication is another common type of self-harm.\n\nSelf-harm may get worse the longer a person has been doing it. This is because a person's body builds up tolerance to (gets used to) the pain from their injuries. Because of this, they have to hurt themselves more to get the same effect. In some cases, this can lead to fatal or near-fatal injuries.\n\nA person may go through voluntary pain for other reasons that are usually not considered self-injury. A self-inflicted wound is when someone injures themselves to avoid something, not because of psychological problems. Some people give themselves a self-inflicted wound during wartime so that they do not have to serve in the military.\n\nSome people go through pain to change the way they look, such as in ear piercing. This is called body modification. Body modification is not a form of self-injury. \n\nScarification is a type of body modification where someone cuts or burns their skin for decoration. This can include branding, which is common in some fraternities. It can also include cutting the skin repeatedly in a pattern or design. This will create very large scars. Some African tribes use scarification as a symbol of beauty and strength.\n\nExperts estimate that about 1% of the population has self-harmed. While people of all ages and ethnic groups have self-harmed, some groups are more likely to self-harm than others. Age, gender, and race can be factors in the risk of self-injury. Some evidence suggests that self-injury is also more common in people who have a family history of suicide or self-injury.\n\nIn general, more young people are treated for self-injury than any other age group. According to one Australian study 30% of teenagers say they have self-injured. It is more widespread among those with mental illness. One in four (25%) of teenagers with mental illnesses have self-harmed. Self-harm in females is most common between the ages of 15-24. Males are most likely to self-harm through the ages 25-34.\n\nRecent research focusing on young people suggests that 10 percent of 15 to 16 year olds have self-harmed. In this case, the self-harm was usually done by cutting.\n\nA study in Oxford in the year 2000 found that approximately 300 per 100,000 (0.3%) of males aged between 15 and 24 years, and 700 per 100,000 (0.7%) of females of the same age, were admitted into a hospital after self-harming. Based on statistics like these, most agree that young white females are most likely to self-injure. Possibly because of this, it is usually believed that women have higher rates of self-harm than men. However, this may not be true because women are more likely to get help for their self-injury. Males may have the same or similar rates of self-injury as women. Some findings have even suggested that in the mid-30s age range, more men are treated for self-harm than women.\n\nMinority groups who face discrimination are also more likely to self-injure. If someone is bullied because they are different (for example, because of their race, ethnicity or sexual orientation), this can lead to low self-esteem and a feeling of helplessness over emotions. This can lead some people to self-harm.\n\nStudies have show that those who have been abused are more likely to self-injure. Sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse can cause low self-esteem, especially in children. It can also cause other emotional problems. Some people may turn to self-harm to relieve these emotions. Low self-esteem in victims of abuse may lead them to believe that the abuse was their fault. They may turn to self-injury because of this.\n\nUnstable living conditions such as unemployment or divorce may also make a person more likely to self-harm.\n\nPrisoners are also more likely to self-harm. This may be because of the ongoing trauma that happens in prisons, including sexual and physical violence and intimidation. In an environment such as prison, where options for inmates are limited, prisoners may turn to self-injury. In England and Wales, a report from The Howard League says that over 22,000 prisoners harmed themselves in 2007.\n\nThose with learning and developmental disabilities such as autism are more likely to self-harm. The cause of this is unclear. Some case studies have shown that it may be a form of self-stimulation. It may be that autistic children who self-harm are trying to express frustration that they cannot explain with words. Autistic children who self-harm may do so by head-banging or biting.\n\nSelf-harm is an addictive behaviour. Once someone starts self-injury, it is difficult for them to stop, even if they want to. This makes professional help and treatment an important part of recovery from self-injury.\n\nThe type of treatment that is most effective is different from person to person. There are many different types of therapy that have been used to help people that self-harm.\n\nCognitive-behavioural therapy may help a person understand why they self-harm. Cognitive-behavioural therapy is used to help patients understand the reasons for their problem. This is so that the patient may learn what is causing their self-harm, and learn how to deal with these problems in a way other than self-harm.\n\nTherapies used for post-traumatic stress disorder may also help. This is because many people who self-harm have been victims of abuse. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR) is an example of this.\n\nDrugs may also be used to help treat self-injury. It is thought that self-injury can release chemical endorphins into the brain. Over time, these chemicals can become addictive. There are some drugs that can help with this addiction, but they have not been proven to help people who self-injure. Naltrexone and naloxone are two drugs being researched for this kind of treatment. Research involving endorphins has been mostly done with animals. It is unclear if their brain chemistry changes the outcome of the research.\n\n\n", "id": "133387", "title": "Self-injury"}

No writing by Socrates survives. \n\nSocrates was famous for not answering questions in a direct manner. \"I know that I know nothing\", he said. Socrates's stated position (as presented in Plato's dialogues) was that other person already knew the answer to a question. He (S.) only drew out what was already in the other's mind. \n\nIn Plato's early dialogues, the \"elenchus\" is the technique Socrates uses to investigate ethical concepts, such as justice or virtue. According to one scholar, it has the following steps:\n\n\nThe exact nature of the elenchus is subject to a great deal of debate. In particular, whether it is a positive method leading to knowledge, or a negative method used solely to refute false claims to knowledge.\n\nAccording to W.K.C. Guthrie, the Socratic method was intended to demonstrate one's ignorance. Socrates, unlike the Sophists, did believe that knowledge was possible, but believed that the first step to knowledge was recognition of one's ignorance. Guthrie writes, \"[Socrates] was accustomed to say that he did not himself know anything, and that the only way in which he was wiser than other men was that he was conscious of his own ignorance, while they were not. The essence of the Socratic method is to convince the interlocutor that whereas he thought he knew something, in fact he does not\".\n", "id": "133395", "title": "Socratic method"}

They usually use strings or other things to make the puppet move and to look alive. Some puppets are very simple to make and use, but others are very complicated and need skill to use. The person who works the puppet and makes it move is a puppeteer. The audience cannot usually see the puppeteer. Some, like a ventriloquist and dummy, are in full view of the audience. There are many different types of puppets to be found around the world. Puppetry is a special art form that is very important in some cultures.\n\nFinger Puppet: A very simple type of puppet where the puppet is placed on a finger and worked by moving the finger. \n\nPop-up puppets: A cone with a rod through and a puppet inside. When the rod is pushed up, the puppet appears.\n\nPaddle Puppet: The puppet is on the end of a paddle. When the puppeteer steps on the paddles back end the other end lifts up, making it seem that the puppet moves by itself.\n\nJumping Jack: A puppet where the arms and legs of the puppet are joined to a string. When the string is pulled down, the arms and legs go up.\n\nHand Puppet: Similar to a finger puppet, but only larger. The puppeteer uses his fingers and hand to work the puppet. Punch and Judy are famous glove puppets.\n\nRod Puppet and Bunraku: The puppet is worked with rods joined to the puppets arms and legs, while another puppeteer moves the head and sometimes the mouth. Bunraku is a special type of Japanese rod puppetry.\n\nShadow Puppet: Another very simple puppet. A cut out figure on a rod is held in front of a light. Its shadow is projected onto a screen. The puppeteer moves the puppet around, giving it some life. Sometimes coloured paper is used to give a certain amount of colour to the puppet.\n\nMarionette or String Puppet: This puppet is moved around with strings that hang from above the theatre. This is one of the more complex types of puppetry and is hard to master as some marionettes can have up to thirty strings.\n\nVentriloquist Figure or Dummy: This puppet is one of the few where the audience sees the puppeteer. The puppeteer moves the puppets head arms and mouth with his hands as well as with levers. The performance usually takes the shape of a conversation between the dummy and the puppeteer. The puppeteer speaks normally, then puts on a different voice when the puppet is supposed to be talking. His voice seems to be coming from his stomach (Latin: \"venter\").

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133447", "text": "Paranthropus\n\nParanthropus is an extinct genus of robust australopithecines. They probably descended from the gracile australopithecine \"Australopithecus\".\n\nAll species of \"Paranthropus\" were bipedal, and many lived during a time when species of the genus \"Homo\", such as \"Homo ergaster\" and \"Homo erectus\", were living. \n\n\"Paranthropus\" first appeared roughly 2.7 million years ago. Most species of \"Paranthropus\" had a brain about 40 percent of the size of modern man. There was some size variation between the different species of \"Paranthropus\", but most stood roughly 1.3-1.4 m (4.26 to 4.59 feet) tall and were quite well muscled. \"Paranthropus\" is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of the \"Australopithecus\".\n\n\"Australopithecus\" and \"Paranthropus\" also looked very different from each other. These differences were only found in remains of the skull. The other parts of the skeleton were still very similar, so it is reasonable to think the difference was an adaptation to different food. \"Paranthropus\" was more massively built as to skull and teeth. It often had gorilla-like sagittal crests on the cranium which anchored massive temporalis muscles for chewing.\n\n\"Paranthropus\" did not behave in the same way as \"Homo\". They lived on a diet of heavy-duty plant material: leaves, slim branches, grass, roots. The diet might be supplemented with insect grubs. Lacking our flexible behaviour, \"Paranthropus\" relied on the steady environmental conditions of the tropical forest. Members of the genus \"Homo\", such as \"Homo habilis\", had proportionately larger brains and more flexible behaviour. They were able to eat a much wider variety of foods.\n\nOpinions differ whether the species \"P. aethiopicus, P. boisei\" and \"P. robustus\" should be included within the genus \"Australopithecus\". On Wikipedia, the genus \"Paranthropus\" is used for all articles which mention the species \"P. aethiopicus, P. boisei\" and \"P. robustus\".\n\nFor the most part the \"Australopithecus\" species \"A. afarensis\", \"A. africanus\", and \"A. anamensis\" either disappeared from the fossil record before the appearance of early humans or seem to have been the ancestors of \"Homo habilis\". \"P. boisei\" and \"P. aethiopicus\", on the other hand, continued to evolve along a separate path distinct and unrelated to early humans. \"Paranthropus\" shared the earth with some early examples of the \"Homo\" genus, such as \"H. habilis\", \"H. ergaster\", and possibly even \"H. erectus\". \n\nSpecies of \"Paranthropus\" had smaller braincases than \"Homo\", yet they had significantly larger braincases than \"Australopithecus\". Paranthropus is associated with stone tools both in southern and eastern Africa, although there is considerable debate whether they were made and utilized by these robust australopithecines. Most believe that early \"Homo\" was the tool maker. Most \"Paranthropus\" species almost certainly did not have language or to have controlled fire, although they are directly associated with the latter at Swartkrans, South Africa.\n\nA partial cranium and mandible of \"Paranthropus robustus\" was discovered in 1938 by a schoolboy, 70 km south west of Pretoria in South Africa. It was described as a new genus and species by Robert Broom of the Transvaal Museum. A date of at least 1.95 million years has been obtained for the site. \n\n\"Paranthropus boisei\" was discovered by Mary Leakey in July 1959 at the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Mary was working alone, as Louis was ill in camp. She rushed back to camp and at the news Louis made a remarkable recovery. \n\nIn his notes Louis recorded a first name, \"Titanohomo mirabilis\", reflecting an initial impression of close human affinity. Louis and Mary began to call it \"Dear Boy\". Recovery was halted on August 7. Dear Boy was in context with Oldowan tools and animal bones.\n\nThe fossil was published in \"Nature\" on 15 August 1959, but due to a strike of the printers the issue was not released until September. In it Louis placed the fossil in Broom's Australopithecinae family, creating a new genus for it, \"Zinjanthropus\", species \"boisei\". \"Zinj\" is an ancient Arabic word for the coast of East Africa and \"boisei\" referred to Charles Boise, an anthropological benefactor of the Leakeys. Louis based his classification on twenty differences from Australopithecus.\n\nBroom had died in 1951 but Dart was still living. He is said to have wept for joy on Louis' behalf on being personally shown Zinj, which Louis and Mary carried around in a tin (later a box). Louis had considered Broom's \"Paranthropus\" genus, but rejected it because he believed Zinj was in the \"Homo\" ancestral stock but Paranthropus was not. He relied heavily on the larger size of Zinj's canines.\n\nThe battle of the name raged on for many years and drove a wedge between Louis and LeGros Clark, who took the \"Paranthropus\" view. On the other hand it brought the Leakeys and Dr. Melville Bell Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society together. The Leakeys became international figures and had no trouble finding funds from then on. The Zinj question ultimately became part of the \"Australopithecus\"/\"Paranthropus\" question (which only applied to the robust Australopithecines).\n\n", "id": "133447", "title": "Paranthropus"}

It usually measures in millimetres. Rain gauge is a meteorological instrument for determining the depth of precipitation (usually in mm) that occurs over a unit area (usually one metre squared) and thus measuring rainfall amount. One millimetre of measured precipitation is the equivalent of one litre of rainfall per metre squared.\n\nUsually a tapering funnel of copper or polyester of standard dimension allows the rain water to collect in an enclosed bottle or cylinder for subsequent measurement. The gauge is set in open ground with the funnel rim up to 30 cm above the ground surface. Some gauges are calibrated to allow the amount of rainfall to be read directly; with others it must be calculated from the depth of water in the container and the dimensions of the funnel.\n\nThe second type of rain gauge is the autographic gauge which can be either of the tilting-siphon type or the tipping-bucket type. The recording chart on an autographic rain gauge is mounted on a drum which is driven by clockwork and typically rotates round a vertical axis once per day. For a tilting-siphon rain gauge, the rainwater in a collector displaces a float so that a marking pen attached to the float makes a continuous trace on the paper. The two buckets in a tipping-bucket rain gauge rest on a pivot so that when one bucket has received 0.2 (or 0.5 mm) of rain it tips by gravity, empties the rainwater and allows the other bucket to start collection. During the tip, an electrical switch is closed and triggers a nearby autographic recorder to register each 'tilt', thus giving a fairly continuous record of precipitation and, in a more sophisticated form, even rainfall intensity. Rain gauges must be sited in as representative a location as possible, but the choice of location is difficult, since many precipitation events are highly aggregate. King Sejong the Great was the man who introduced rain gauge to the world.\n", "id": "133613", "title": "Rain gauge"}

He was also a distant relative of Louis XVI. Her mother, Sophie-Victoire Delaborde was a common woman. Sand was born in Paris. She spent much of her childhood with her grandmother, Marie Aurore de Saxe, Madame Dupin de Franceuil. Her grandmother lived in her estate, Nohant, in the French region of Berry. She later used the setting in many of her novels. In 1822, at age 19, she married Baron Casimir Dudevant (1795–1871), illegitimate son of Jean-François. She and Dudevant had two children: Maurice (1823–1889) and Solange (1828–1899). In early 1831 she left her prosaic husband and entered upon a four- or five-year period of \"romantic rebellion.\" In 1835 she was legally separated from Dudevant.\n\nSand started to wear men's clothes in public. This harmed her reputation. She said that men's clothes were tougher, and also less expensive to buy than women's. The clothes she wore were comfortable, and they also allowed her to go around Paris more freely than the other women, even those of her own social standing. \n\nSand also smoked in public. This led to a scandal. At her time, women were not supposed to smoke, not even those of her standing. Franz Liszt had a relationship with a woman called Marie D'Agoult, who did this as well. D'Argoult smoked large cigars. These and other behaviors were exceptional for a woman of the early and mid-19th century, when social codes–especially in the upper classes–were very important. \n\nPoet Charles Baudelaire was a contemporary critic of George Sand: \"She is stupid, heavy and garrulous. Her ideas on morals have the same depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women... The fact that there are men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation.\"\n\nSand had affairs with several men. Some lasted longer, others shorter. These men included Jules Sandeau (1831), Prosper Mérimée, Alfred de Musset (summer 1833 – March 1834), Louis-Chrystosome Michel, Charles Didier, Pierre-François Bocage, Félicien Mallefille and Frédéric Chopin (1837–47). \n\nLater in life, she wrote letters to Gustave Flaubert. Despite their obvious differences in temperament and aesthetic preference, they eventually became good friends. \n\nShe was engaged in an intimate friendship with actress Marie Dorval, which led to widespread but unconfirmed rumors of a lesbian affair. \n\nIn Majorca one can still visit the (then abandoned) Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa, where she spent the winter of 1838–39 with Chopin and her children. This trip to Majorca was described by her in \"Un Hiver à Majorque\" (A Winter in Majorca), published in 1855.\n\nChopin left her two years before his death, because of a family disturbance wherein he supported her daughter Solange's marriage choice, which had caused Sand to disown the daughter.\n\nA liaison with the writer Jules Sandeau heralded her literary debut. They published a few stories in collaboration, signing them \"Jules Sand.\" She consequently adopted, for her first independent novel, \"Indiana\" (1832), the pen name that made her famous – George Sand. \n\nHer first published novel, \"Rose et Blanche\" (1831), was written in collaboration with Jules Sandeau. \nDrawing from her childhood experiences of the countryside, she wrote the rural novels \"La Mare au Diable\" (1846), \"François le Champi\" (1847–1848), \"La Petite Fadette\" (1849), and \"Les Beaux Messieurs Bois-Doré\" (1857). \"A Winter in Majorca\" described the period that she and Chopin spent on that island in 1838-9.\n\nHer other novels include \"Indiana\" (1832), \"Lélia\" (1833), \"Mauprat\" (1837), \"Le Compagnon du Tour de France\" (1840), \"Consuelo\" (1842–1843), and \"Le Meunier d'Angibault\" (1845). \n\nFurther theatre pieces and autobiographical pieces include \"Histoire de ma vie\" (1855), \"Elle et Lui\" (1859) (about her affair with Musset), \"Journal Intime\" (posthumously published in 1926), and \"Correspondence\". Sand often performed her theatrical works in her small private theatre at the Nohant estate. \n\nIn addition, Sand authored literary criticism and political texts. Her most widely used quote being, \"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved.\" \n\nShe was known well in far reaches of the world, and her social practices, her writings and her beliefs prompted much commentary, often by other luminaries in the world of arts and letters. A few excerpts demonstrate much of what was often said about George Sand:\n\nGeorge Sand died at Nohant, near Châteauroux, in France's Indre \"département\" on June 8, 1876, at the age of 71 and was buried in the grounds of her home there. In 2004, controversial plans were suggested to move her remains to the Panthéon in Paris.\n\nFrequent literary references to George Sand can be found in \"\" (1990) by A. S. Byatt. The American poet Walt Whitman cited Sand's novel \"Consuelo\" as a personal favorite and the sequel to this novel \"La Comtesse De Rudolstady\" contains at least a couple of passages that appear to have had a very direct influence on him. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861), the English poet, produced two poems \"To George Sand: A Desire\" and \"To George Sand: A Recognition\". The character, Stepan Verkhovensky, in Dostoevsky's novel \"The Possessed\" took to translating the works of George Sand in his periodical, before the periodical was subsequently seized by the ever-cautious Russian government of the 1840s. George Sand is referenced a number of times in the play \"Voyage\", the first part of Tom Stoppard's \"The Coast of Utopia\" trilogy. And, in the first episode of the \"Overture\" to \"Swann's Way\" - the first novel in Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\" sequence - a young, distraught Marcel is calmed by his mother as she reads from \"François le Champi\", a novel which it is explained was part of a birthday package from his grandmother which also included \"La Mare au Diable,\" \"La Petite Fadette,\" and \"Les Maîtres Sonneurs.\" As with many episodes involving art in \"À la recherche du temps perdu\", this reminiscence includes commentary on the work.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "133758", "title": "George Sand"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133902", "text": "Animal testing\n\nAnimal testing is also known as animal experimentation and animal research is the use of animals for experiments. Fruit flies and mice are often used for animal testing. About 50 to 100 million vertebrate animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year. The source of the animals are different according to the country and species. Most animals used for experiments are bred for this purpose. But others may be caught from the wild or bought from people who buy them from animal shelters.\n\nAnimals are used for experiments inside universities, medical schools, farms, large companies and other places that provide animal-testing services. People who support animal testing argue that almost every medical discovery in the 20th century used animals in some way. They say that even complex computers cannot model connections between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment. But some scientists and animal rights organizations such as PETA do not support animal testing. They say that it is cruel, poorly done, and costly. Others argue that animals have the right not to be used for experiments, and that animal models are different from humans. The limits to animal testing is different in various countries.\n\nThe words animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, \"in vitro\" testing, and vivisection have similar meanings,differently. \"tatiosion\" means to \"cut up\" a living animal. It was used only in experiments that dissected live animals. The word \"vivisection\" is sometimes used negatively about any experiment with live animals. For example, the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" described \"vivisection\" as: \"Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals\". However, dictionaries note that the wider definition is \"used only by people who are opposed (dislike) to such work\". The word makes people think of torture, pain, and death. People who dislike animal testing often use the word \"vivisection\", while scientists usually use the expression \"animal experimentation\" instead.\n\nThe earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the Greeks in the second and fourth centuries BCE. Aristotle (Αριστοτέλης) (384 – 322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304 – 258 BCE) were some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals. Galen, a doctor in second-century Rome who was known as the \"father of vivisection\", dissected pigs and goats. Avenzoar, an Arabic doctor in twelfth-century Spain, tested out surgical processes on animals before applying them to humans.\n\nAnimals have often been used in the history of scientific study. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur showed the germ theory of medicine by putting anthrax in sheep. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. On November 3, 1957, a Russian dog, Laika, became the first animal to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were made using armadillos, then given to humans. In 1974, Rudolf Jaenisch produced the first genetically changed mammal. He put DNA from a virus into the genome of mice. Genetic study grew quickly after that. In 1996, Dolly the sheep was born—the first cloned mammal.\n\nIn the 20th century, toxicology testing became important. In the 19th century, laws about drugs were less strict. Drugs did not have to be checked for safety. But in 1937, a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide killed more than 100 people. They caused great and long lasting pain, vomiting, and fits. After that, the U.S. congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold. Other countries passed similar laws.\n\nEven back in the 17th century, people disagreed about animal testing. In 1655, Edmund O'Meara said that \"the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state.\" O'Meara and others said that animals could be affected by pain during vivisection, making results unreliable. Others also disliked animal testing because they felt that animals should not be hurt for humans. Others opposed animal testing for different reasons: many believed that animals were not as good as humans and that they were so different that results of animal testing would not work on humans.\n\nSupporters had different views. They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge. Claude Bernard, the \"prince of vivisectors\" and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that \"the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly (brightly) lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen\". He declared that \"experiments on entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree\". Because of Bernard, animal testing became a regular scientific method. Surprisingly, though, his wife, Marie Françoise Martin, began the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883.\n\nIn 1896, Dr. Walter B. Cannon said, “The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, ‘Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden (servant) of crime.’ ” The public first began giving its attention to the supporters and opposers of animal testing during the brown dog affair in the early 1990s. In the brown dog affair, hundreds of medical students and anti-vivisectionists and police argued over a memorial to a vivisected dog.\n\n\n", "id": "133902", "title": "Animal testing"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133935", "text": "Ancient Greek boxing\n\nAncient Greek boxing is a very old kind of sport. It has been practiced at least since the eighth century BC. Homer wrote about it in his poem \"Iliad\". At that time, Greece was made of many city-states that were independent. Each city state seems to have had its own version of the sport.\n\nToday, most of the sources that talk about Greek boxing are either legends, or they are fragmentary. When a source is fragmentary, this means that part of the text has been lost, or is missing. This makes it difficult to find the rules, or where and how the activity was done. Several details are missing, but it seems boxing with gloves was an important part of the Greek athletic culture of the time.\n\nThe activity was called \"pyx\" or \"pygme\" in Ancient Greek. Archeologists have found evidence that this activity was probably done by the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures. Many legends tell about the origins of boxing in Greece. One legend says that the heroic ruler Theseus invented a type of boxing where two men sat face to face and beat each other with their fists until one of them was killed. Later, the boxers began to fight while standing. They also started to wear gloves (with spikes) and wrappings on their arms below the elbows. In Ancient Greece, most sports were done naked, boxing too. \n\nAccording to \"Iliad\", Mycenaean warriors included boxing in their competitions. They did this to honor those who had died. It is possible that Homer told about what the Greeks did, at a later time. Boxing was one of the contests held in memory of Achilles' friend Patroclus, who was killed toward the end of the Trojan War. To commemorate Patroclus the Greeks later introduced boxing (\"pygme / pygmachia\") to the Olympic Games in 688 BC. People taking part trained on punching bags (called a \"korykos\"). Fighters wore leather straps (called \"himantes\") over their hands, wrists, and sometimes chest, to protect themselves from injury. The straps also left the fingers free. \n\nPhilostratus was a scholar and an historian. According to him, boxing was originally developed in Sparta, in order to harden warriors’ faces for battle. The early Spartans believed helmets were unnecessary and boxing prepared them for when they were hit on the head in battle. However, Spartans never took part in the competitive version of boxing. They thought it was dishonorable to be defeated that way. \n\nUntil around 500 BC \"himantes\" were used as protection for the knuckles and hand. They were thongs of ox hide between 3 and 3.7 meters long. The \"himantes\" were wrapped around the hands and knuckles many times.\n\nAround 400 BC \"sphairai\" were introduced. The \"sphairai\" were very similar to \"himantes\". The biggest difference was that the inside was padded when they were wrapped around the hands. The outside of the thong was more rigid too.\n\nSoon after the \"saphirai\" had been introduced, they were replaced by \"oxys\" used for boxing. \"Oxys\" were made of several thick leather bands that were wrapped around the hand, wrist, and forearm. A band of fleece was placed on the forearm to wipe away sweat. Leather braces extended up the forearm to give greater support when punching. The knuckles were reinforced with leather as well.\n\n\"Korykos\" were the equivalent to modern punching bags. They were used for practice in the Palaestra and were filled with sand, flour, or millet.\n\nThe rules currently used for the sport are based on the old rules. As pointed out above, there are only incomplete sources for the rules. The rules needed to be deduced from old texts and images:\n", "id": "133935", "title": "Ancient Greek boxing"}

It is about \n\nThere was a lahar after an eruption in 1985. About 23,000 people died when the lahar covered the Armero, making this the most deadly lahar in the history of the world. People who live near the volcano call it \"the Sleeping Lion\", because it was dormant or sleeping for nearly 150 years before the Armero lahar.\n\nNevado del Ruiz is a broad, icy stratovolcano that covers more than . Three major edifices, composed of andesitic and dacitic lavas and andesitic pyroclastics, have built up since the beginning of the Pleistocene. The modern cone consists of a wide cluster of lava domes produced within the summit caldera of an ancient Ruiz. The 1–kilometer wide, 240–meter deep Arenas crater currently occupies the summit. The prominent La Olleta pyroclastic cone is on the volcano's southwest flank and may also have been active in historical times. The mountain's flanks are lined by the steep headwalls of massive landslides. Melting of its summit icecap during historical eruptions, which date back to the 16th century, has resulted in devastating lahars, including the famous eruption in 1985 that was the world's deadliest. last eruption at 2016 latest update!!!\n\nIn 1595, a lahar flowed down a the valleys of the River Guali and the River Lagunillas, killing 636 people. In 1845, another massive lahar flooded the upper valley of the River Lagunillas, killing over 1000 people. It continued for 70 kilometers downstream before spreading across a plain in the lower valley floor. It is believed both of these formed from melting of the snow and ice that cover the summit, as did the original eruption.\n\nNevado del Ruiz was very active in the three months before it erupted. An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from the fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct magmatic release into surface environment. A very high lahar risk was stressed in the mission's report delivered on October 22, 1985 and various simple preparedness techniques were proposed to local authorities.\n\nDuring the following \"quiet\" period in October, the hydrothermal component of the vapor discharge steadily increased. The gases were super-saturated with elemental sulfur; their thermodynamic equilibration temperatures can range from 200 to 600° Celsius. Gases and water from fumaroles and thermal springs on the flanks of the volcano are likely to be produced from a two-phase vapor-brine envelope adjoining the eruptive system within the volcano. The chemistry of the fumarole discharges is compatible with the comparison of an eruptive mechanism involving the build-up of pressure in an extensive vapor zone by gas released from a stagnant, already extensively degassed body of magmatic material at depth. Production of such a residual gas over extended periods may account for the large amount of sulfur dioxide (SO) being released from the volcano in relation to the small amount of ejected solids.\n\nThe destruction wrought by the 1985 eruption was partially due to the fact that scientists vacillated over whether or not to evacuate the area. Nevertheless, a group of scientists informed them that they faced eminent and almost certain death. The people in Armero assumed that because the volcano had not erupted in 100 years, it had no reason to erupt so abruptly. Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long period earthquakes had occurred. Long-period earthquakes are those which start out strong and then die down very slowly. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that these earthquakes occurred in the final hours before an eruption. According to Chouet, \"the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode',\" but scientists at the time doubted his theory.\n\nOn November 13, 1985, at 9:08 pm, Nevado del Ruiz erupted; ejecting dacitic tephra more than 30 kilometers into the atmosphere. The amount of magma erupted from the volcano was 3% of that from Mount St. Helens in 1980. The eruption reached Volcanic Explosivity Index 3. The material ejected was described by scientists as \"unusually rich in sulfur dioxide\".\n\nPyroclastic flows melted ice and snow at the summit, forming 4 thick lahars that rushed down several river valleys. As most lahars do, the mudflows began as flows of water, sand, and gravel, and mixed with clay along the way. The lahars were up to 50 meters thick and six feet deep and traveled more than 100 kilometers.\n\nThe lahars destroyed many houses and towns. The town of Armero was completely covered by debris, killing approximately 21,000 people (three-fourths of the population), as well as affecting 13 other villages. The eruption caused an estimated 23,000 deaths, 5,000 injuries, and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. This was the second deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, ousted only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelee, and the fourth deadliest eruption in recorded history. In addition, it was the deadliest lahar in recorded history, and Colombia's worst natural disaster.\n\nThe disaster gained some major international notoriety due in part to a photograph taken by photographer Frank Fournier, of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. In response to the eruption, the USGS Volcano Crisis Assistance Team was formed in 1986, and the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program.\n\nThe volcano erupted again in 1988 and 1991.\n\nThe eruption cost Colombia 7.7 billion dollars, about 20% of the country’s GNP for the year.\nA lack of preparation contributed to the high death toll. Armero had been built directly on old mudflows and authorities ignored a hazard-zone map which showed the potential damage to the town if lahars were to avalanche down the mountain. Habitants were also told to stay inside and avoid the falling ash, not thinking the mudflows would bury them. Dr. Stanley Williams of Louisiana University said that following the eruption, \"With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately.\"\n\nIn April 2008, the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted, and thousands were evacuated. Volcanologists were worried that this could be another \"Nevado del Ruiz\". Hundreds of these eruptions have had huge evacuation numbers for similar reasons.\n\nSurvivors who fled to other towns in the area were gradually housed in new government schemes. Armero was not rebuilt because the old lahar traces were discovered, and Colombian government declared the site \"holy ground\" so that no one would ever suffer again like Armero.\n\nNow a new system can detect lahars, giving people more warning to evacuate before they happen. The system involves the use of Acoustic Flow Monitors (AFM) which analyze ground shaking that could result in a lahar. These AFMs are placed in the volcano and warn officials if there is a high amount of shaking. These devices were tested on Mount Rainier in the United States.\n\nThe glaciers of Nevado del Ruiz were composed gradually over hundreds of years. Due to global warming, the glaciers are starting to melt. Since Ruiz gained instant fame after its devastating eruption in 1985, scientists and government officials in Colombia are afraid the glaciers might melt completely.\n\nThe stratovolcano lays within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a area of the earth's crust where the land is unstable. It encircles the Pacific Ocean, and houses some of the world's most active volcanoes. The volcano is the northernmost of several Colombian stratovolcanoes in the Andean Volcanic Belt of western South America. The Andean volcanic belt was produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate beneath the South American continental plate. Normally, these type of stratovolcanoes generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, thus producing devastating lahars.\n\nThe volcano is part of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif (or Cordillera Central), a group of five different icy stratovolcanoes.\n\n", "id": "134001", "title": "Nevado del Ruiz"}

The series is named after the title of the first book in the series. The 12 books are about the adventures by groups of children during school holidays. They mostly take place in England and Scotland between the World War I and World War II. The stories usually are about outdoor activities, especially camping, fishing and sailing.\n\nThe series remains popular today for its lovely, yet often realistic, depiction of childhood and the interplay between children's imagination and reality. It is part of the basis for a large tourist industry in the Lake District and Norfolk Broads areas of England, where many of the books are set. There are also several societies dedicated to the study and promotion of Ransome's work which are largely inspired by the series. The first was the Arthur Ransome Club in Japan. There is also the British-based group, The Arthur Ransome Society (TARS), which has an international membership.\n\nThe series begins with \"Swallows and Amazons\", published in 1930. It tells the story of the Walker children, who sail a dinghy (boat) named \"Swallow\", and the Blackett children, who sail a dinghy named \"Amazon\". The Walkers are staying at a farm near a lake during the school holidays; the Blacketts live in a house on the opposite shore. The children meet on an island on the lake, and have a series of adventures that weave imaginative tales of pirates and exploration into everyday life in inter-War, rural England.\n", "id": "134241", "title": "Swallows and Amazons (series)"}

He is best known for writing the \"Swallows and Amazons series\" of children's books. \n\nRansome was born in Leeds. His father was Professor of History there. His father's death in 1897 affected Ransome for a long time. He always tried to get past his belief that his father had did not think his abilities were very good.\n\nRansome got his formal education first in Windermere. He then studied at the Rugby School (where he lived in Lewis Carroll's study room). He did not fully like his time there because of his poor vision, lack of skills at sports, and limited achievement. He attended Yorkshire College, his father's college studying chemistry. After a year there, he stopped going to the college. He went to London to become a writer. He took low-paying jobs as an office assistant in a publishing company. He also worked as editor of a magazine, \"Temple Bar Magazine\", that was not making much money. During this time, he was writing and became a member of the literary scene of London.\n\nRansom's most well known book series, \"Swallows and Amazons\", tells the stories of school-holiday adventures of children. The stories are mostly set in the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. Many of the books involve sailing. Other common things are fishing and camping.

Each round is a best-of-seven series. This means up to seven games are played until one team wins 4 of the games. The first three rounds decide which team from each conference will move on to the last round. The last round is called the Stanley Cup Finals. The winner of that set of games becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup winner. \n\nThe first round of the playoffs is called the Conference Quarterfinals. There are four games in each conference. The winners of the first round advance to the second round. The third round is the Conference Finals. The two teams left in each conference (Eastern Conference and Western Conference) play each other. The conference champions advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nFor the first three rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts games 3, 4 and 6 (games 5–7 are played \"if needed\").\n\nBefore the 1993–94 season, the style was completely different. The league was split into four divisions, and the best four teams in each of the divisions went to the playoffs. Also, instead of the top team playing the 8th place team in the conference, the first place team played the fourth place team in each division, and the second place team played the third place team. In the second round, the two winning teams in each division would face each other for the divisional championship. The divisional winners in each conference would play one another in the third round for the right to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. This style is still used for deciding the teams in the playoffs in the American Hockey League.\n", "id": "134248", "title": "Stanley Cup Playoffs"}

Part of the suspence of seeing the Replacements play, was that the audience never knew until the start of a concert if the band would be sober enough to play.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134378", "text": "CM Punk\n\nPhillip Jack Brooks (born on October 26, 1978), better known by his ring name CM Punk, is an American mixed martial artist and retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his time with the WWE where he worked for them from 2005 until his abrupt walk out from the company on January 27, 2014. During his time there, he was credited as being \"the longest-reigning WWE Champion of the modern era\" and held the championship for 434 days. He is also recognized as the sixth-longest reigning champion of all time. He was also a one-time ECW Champion, three-time World Heavyweight Champion, two-time WWE Champion, one-time World Tag Team Champion with Kofi Kingston, one-time Intercontinental Champion, Mr. Money in the Bank in 2008 and 2009 (the only wrestler to win the match twice), and won the Slammy Award for Superstar of the Year in 2011.\n\nAfter he retired from professional wrestling, Punk signed a deal to fight with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and he began to pursue a career in mixed martial arts. He plans to begin fighting for them in 2015.\n\nPunk is Straight edge and is an Atheist\n\nHe started out wrestling in a backyard wrestling federation called the Lunatic Wrestling Federation along with his friends and his brother Mike Brooks in the mid-late 1990s and used the ring name CM Punk as a member of the Chick Magnets with his tag team partner CM Venom after another wrestler had skipped out on the card. He actually wanted to become a professional wrestler unlike his friends and thought of it more than just simple fun. Punk distanced himself from his brother Mike and has not spoke to him since after he found out that Mike was stealing thousands of dollars from the company.\n\nHe left LWF to be trained to become a professional wrestler by Ace Steel, Danny Dominion and Kevin Quinn at the \"Steel Dominion\" wrestling school in Chicago. He also competed at Steel Domain Wrestling in St. Paul, Minnesota and met Scott Colton, later known by the ring name Colt Cabana. Punk and Colton would later become best friends.\n\nPunk began competing for the promotion Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. He won the IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship 2 times and the IWA Mid-South Heavyweight Championship five time, defeating the likes of A.J. Styles, Colt Cabana and Eddie Guerrero. He feuded with wrestlers like Colt Cabana and Chris Hero. During his feud with Hero, they competed in a 55-minute TLC match, a 93-minute two out of three falls match, and many 60-minute time limit draws. During the feud with Cabana, Punk wrestled him in many different matches. The matches he had with Cabana would lead Punk to being hired by Ring of Honor. He chose not to compete for Mid-South anymore from February 2003 until May 2004 because he said that he was protesting the mistreatment of Chris Hero from Ian Rotten. Punk returned to the company and performed as both a wrestler and commentator. He stayed with the company until 2005 when he was signed by the World Wrestling Entertainment. His last match in the company was against Delirious which ended in a 60-minute time limit draw\n\nOn August 1, 2003, Punk joined the Japanese promotion Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE for the final day of their 2003 Fire Festival at Korakuen Hall. At the event, Punk teamed with C.W. Anderson, Josh Daniels, and Vansack Acid in losing effort against the team of Ikuto Hidaka, Jun Kasai, Naohiro Hoshikawa, and Tatsuhito Takaiwa.\n\nIn 2002, Punk joined Ring of Honor. He feuded with Raven and their feud was considered to be one of the best feuds of ROH in 2003. The feud was based around Punk's straight-edge lifestyle and him comparing Raven to his alcoholic father. Their feud ended when Punk defeated Raven in a steel cage match at \"The Conclusion\". During that time, Punk joined NWA Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and was a member of Raven's stable, The Gathering along with Julio Dinero.\n\nPunk would begin to climb the ranks in ROH. He was able to come in second at the \"Second Anniversary Show\" during the tournament to crown the first ROH Pure Champion, losing to A.J. Styles in the finals. He also was able to win the ROH Tag Team Championship twice with Colt Cabana as a member of the Second City Saints. Both of their championship wins were against the Briscoe Brothers who they defeated. Around October 2003, Punk was hired to become the first head trainer at the Ring of Honor wrestling school.\n\nOn February 25, 2004, before a TNA show, Punk was involved in a physical fight with Teddy Hart outside of a restaurant which was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle was reportedly because of an ROH show where Hart performed three unplanned spots which put many other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around the time of the fight, Punk and Dinero had stopped showing up on TNA shows,which lead to speculation that he was fired because of the incident. Punk would say that the scuffle had nothing to do with his TNA career. He said that the reason he and Dinero had stopped showing up on TNA pay-per-views was because TNA officials believed that they did not connect with the fans as heels. Punk decided to quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after he had an argument with the TNA offices over his ability to work for ROH after a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were no longer allowed to wrestle in ROH.\n\nWhen Punk returned to ROH, he wrestled ROH World Champion Samoa Joe for the championship in a three match series. The first match between the two was held on June 12, 2004 at \"World Title Classic\" in Dayton, Ohio. The match would end in a 60-minute time limit draw when neither Punk nor Joe were able to pin or cause the other to submit within the time limit given. The second match was supposed to be held on December 4, 2004 but because of Steve Corino being pulled from a match with Joe by Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE, it was rescheduled to be held on October 11, 2004 for October 16 in Punk's hometown of Chicago. At the event titled \"Joe vs. Punk II\" on October 16, Punk and Joe fought to another 60-minute time limit draw. \"Joe vs. Punk II\" became Ring of Honor's best-selling DVD at the time and the match between Punk and Joe was also given a five-star rating by Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer Newsletter. The series ended after Joe defeated Punk in their third and final match on December 4, 2004 at \"All-Star Extravaganza 2\" where there was no time limit.\n\nPunk started in the WWE's developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling and debuted on September 8, 2005 in a six-man tag team dark match where he teamed with Nigel McGuinness and Paul Burchill in a losing effort to the team of Deuce Shade, Elijah Burke and Seth Skyfire. On November 9, 2005, Punk defeated Ken Doane to become the OVW Television Champion. Brent Albright was supposed to face Doane but lost his chance when Punk hit him with a steel chair. This led to Punk feuding with Albright. On January 4, 2006, Punk was involved in a Three-Way Dance match with both Doane and Albright. He lost the championship when Punk submitted to Albright's finishing move, the Crowbar. The feud ended on February 1, 2006 when a double turn occurred. Albright turned heel by allowing the Spirit Squad to beat Punk which turned Punk face. During John Cena's WrestleMania 22 entrance, Punk made a small appearance as a gangster and rode on the side of a 1930s era car to the ring.\n\nMatt Cappotelli, the OVW Heavyweight Champion at the time, vacated the championship in February 2006 after he found out that he had a brain tumor. After Cappotelli vacated the title, OVW held a tournament to crown a new champion. Punk was able to reach the finals and faced Brent Albright. Albright defeated Punk in the finals to become the new champion. Punk and Albright feuded again and Punk was able to defeat Albright in a strap match on May 3, 2006 to become the champion. He also became one-half of the Southern Tag Team Champions when he teamed with Seth Skyfire and defeated Shad Gaspard and the Neighborhoodie at a house show on July 28, 2006. They lost the championships to Deuce Shade and \"Domino\" Cliff Compton on July 28, 2006 and Punk feuded with Skyfire. Skyfire was supposed to face Punk in a match for the OVW Heavyweight Championship but he was attacked before the match by Charles \"The Hammer\" Evans. Chet Jablonski replaced Skyfire in the match and defeated Punk to win the championship. After Punk lost the championship, he was called up to WWE's main roster full-time.\n\nPunk debuted in the WWE on the ECW brand in a match against Stevie Richards on June 24, 2006. He made his televised debut on the July 4 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\". During his debut, he cut a short pre-taped promo where he talked about his straight edge lifestyle. His first televised match was on August 1, 2006 at the Hammerstein Ballroom where he defeated Justin Credible. During his time there, he started a winning streak. He started a feud with Mike Knox over Knox's girlfriend, Kelly Kelly. Punk was able to qualify for the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember after he defeated Knox in their first match. He competed in the Survivor Series match where he teamed with D-Generation X and the Hardy Boyz to defeat Rated-RKO, Knox, John Morrison and Gregory Helms. During the Chamber match, Punk was the first person eliminated by Rob Van Dam.\n\nHe then began a feud with Hardcore Holly. On January 9, 2007, Holly was able to snap Punk's six-month unbeaten streak after he defeated him. When his feud with Holly was over, Punk started a feud with Matt Striker. Striker defeated Punk which gave Punk a second loss on his record. Punk defeated Johnny Nitro and earned a chance to compete in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. Punk didn't win the match though as it was won by Mr. Kennedy.\n\nPunk turned heel by joining the New Breed alliance on the April 10, 2007 \"ECW on Sci Fi\". He turned face again two weeks later when he kicked the New Breed's leader Elijah Burke in the head and cost them a four on four elimination match. Punk delivered his finishing move, the Go To Sleep, to Burke and sarcastically apologized before he left the ring. Punk would defeat Burke in a singles match at Judgment Day and teamed with The ECW Originals (Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman) to defeat The New Breed (Elijah Burke, Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von) in a six-man tag team tables match at One Night Stand.\n\nWhen then-ECW Champion Bobby Lashley was drafted to \"Raw\", he was stripped of the championship and ECW held a tournament to decide the new champion. Punk defeated Marcus Cor Von on the June 19 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\". Punk was supposed to face Chris Benoit at next but Benoit legitimately no-showed the event after he killed his family and himself. He was replaced by Johnny Nitro and Nitro defeated Punk for the vacant championship.\n\nPunk was able to challenge for the title again at The Great American Bash against Nitro (who changed his ring name to John Morrison at this point) but was again defeated by Morrison. Punk challenged Elijah Burke and Tommy Dreamer in a triple threat match. The match was to determine who the next competitor in Morrison's 15 Minutes of Fame Challenge, in which Punk won. Punk was able to defeat Morrison a week later for an ECW Championship title match at SummerSlam. Morrison defeated Punk at SummerSlam when Morrison used the ropes for a leverage pin.\n\nDuring the September 1, 2007 (aired September 4) ECW taping, Punk was able to defeat Morrison in a \"last chance\" title match to win the ECW Championship. Punk successfully defended his championship against Elijah Burke at Unforgiven, Big Daddy V via disqualification at No Mercy, The Miz at Cyber Sunday, John Morrison on the November 6, 2007 episode of ECW, and in a triple threat match against The Miz and John Morrison at Survivor Series. On the January 22, 2008 episode of ECW, Punk was defeated by Chavo Guerrero for the ECW Championship in a No Disqualification match after Edge ran in and speared Punk. At WrestleMania XXIV, he competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match and defeated Chris Jericho, Montel Vontavious Porter, Shelton Benjamin, John Morrison, Mr. Kennedy and Carlito.\n\nOn the June 23, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was drafted to the Raw brand during the 2008 WWE Draft. During his first night on \"Raw\", Batista beat down the World Heavyweight Champion Edge and left him lying in the ring. Punk then ran down the ramp to the ring with referee Mike Chioda. He then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract, hit Edge with the Go to Sleep and pinned him to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. Punk defended the title for the first time later in the night against JBL. Punk was able to hold the championship until Unforgiven on September 7, 2008. Before Punk was able to compete in the Championship Scramble match, he was attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase with Manu). Orton ended the attack by punting Punk in the head. This led to Punk being unable to compete in the match and having to forfeit the title. In the match, Punk was replaced by Chris Jericho, who was able to win the match and the title. Punk had a rematch against Jericho eight days later on the September 15 episode of \"Raw\" but he was unable to regain the title in a steel cage match.\n\nOn the October 27, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Punk and Kofi Kingston were able to defeat Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase to win the World Tag Team Championship. Punk and Kofi were also members of Team Batista at Survivor Series where they lost to Team Orton. After Survivor Series, Punk entered the number one contender Intercontinental Championship Tournament. Punk was able to defeat Snitsky and John Morrison in the first two rounds. On December 13, 2008, John Morrison and The Miz defeated Punk and Kingston for the World Tag Team Championship at a live event. Punk defeated Rey Mysterio the next day at Armageddon to win the tournament.\n\nOn the January 5 episode of \"Raw\", he received an Intercontinental Championship title match against William Regal. The match ended in a disqualification, when Regal grabbed the referee's shirt. Due to this, Stephanie McMahon gave Punk a rematch the next week. The rematch ended in a disqualification but this time it was Punk that got disqualified. He was awarded another rematch on the January 19 episode of \"Raw\" but this time it was a No Disqualification match. Punk was able to win the match and the championship. When he won the championship, Punk became the nineteenth Triple Crown Champion. He also became the person to accomplish the Triple Crown in the fastest amount of time, which broke Kevin Nash's old record. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated for the championship by John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. Punk was able to win the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXV and became the first person to win the match twice. At the 2009 WWE Draft on April 13, 2009, he was drafted from \"Raw\" to \"SmackDown\". He began a feud with Umaga because of Umaga's multiple surprise attacks when Punk was attempting to cash in his Money in the Bank Contract. The feud resulted in a Samoan strap match at Extreme Rules. The match was won by Punk.\n\nWhen the pay-per-view was about to end, Punk ran down to the ring, cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Jeff Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the June 15 episode of \"Raw\", Punk defended his championship in a Triple Threat match against Edge and Hardy. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification when Punk kicked the referee after he was affected with a storyline eye injury and claimed that he could not see the referee, but because the titles do not change hands from disqualification, Punk retained the championship. When Hardy believed that Punk was faking his eye injury, he called him out on it. This led Punk to turn heel and said that he was the moral superior to fans of Hardy because of his drug-free lifestyle. Punk lost the championship to Hardy at Night of Champions. Punk and Hardy had a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match at SummerSlam where Punk won the championship back. After the match, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. Punk's feud with Hardy ended on the August 28 episode of \"Friday Night SmackDown\" when Punk defeated Hardy in a steel cage match where the loser of the match would have to leave the company. The match earned a Slammy Award for \"Shocker of the Year\" in 2009.\n\nAt Breaking Point in Montreal, Punk competed in a submission match against The Undertaker. Punk defeated The Undertaker in the match to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. The Undertaker originally won the match with his Hell's Gate submission hold. The SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after announcing that the ban that the former general manager Vickie Guerrero set on his move was still in effect. Punk won the match with the Anaconda Vise when the referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell even though the Undertaker did not submit (similar to the Montreal Screwjob which happened in the same arena in 1997). Punk was defeated by The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Hell in a Cell. Punk had a rematch against The Undertaker on \"Smackdown\" and had another rematch at Bragging Rights in a Fatal Four Way match which also involved Batista and Rey Mysterio but he lost both matches.\n\nHe changed his character in a more menacing direction on the November 27 episode of \"SmackDown\" when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had the former gimmick of the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had got rid of his mental problems. He continued to support his straight-edge philosophy, he began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd. He also grew out the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through the month of January, he began to convert planted members of the audience to the straight-edge lifestyle by making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and then shaving their head as a sign of renewal and devotion. After he converted multiple people who were not seen again, one of the converts Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows and they later formed the Straight Edge Society. While leading the stable, he was also the mentor of \"WWE NXT\" rookie Darren Young. At one point, Young was going to join the Straight Edge Society but he chose not to join before he was about to have his head shaved.\n\nPunk would occasionally give sermons and even gave sermon while competing in both the Royal Rumble and Elimination Chamber matches. During the Chamber match, Punk was eliminated by Rey Mysterio, who he was feuding with going into the PPV. This raised tensions between the two as Mysterio prevented him from winning a Money in the Bank qualifying match which then lead to Punk interrupting Mysterio's celebration of his daughter's ninth birthday and singing his own version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" to her. Mysterio challenged Punk to a Street Fight at WrestleMania XXVI but he lost to Gallows. A stipulation was added by Punk that if Mysterio lost, he would have to join the Society. Mysterio defeated Punk at WrestleMania and a rematch took place at Extreme Rules where if Punk lost, he would have to have his head shaved like his disciples. Punk was able to win the match after outside interference from a fourth member of the Society who kept his face covered. A third and final match was held at Over The Limit with both of the previous stipulations put on. At the event, Punk was defeated by Mysterio and had his head shaved bald.\n\nPunk felt embarrassed by having his head shaved and he considered himself to be always pure unlike his followers, Punk appeared under a mask to cover his bald head on the May 29 episode of \"SmackDown\". At Fatal 4-Way, Punk challenged for the World Heavyweight Championship against Mysterio, The Big Show and the champion Jack Swagger but lost when Kane attacked Punk after Kane accused Punk of being the person who attacked The Undertaker. Punk was unmasked by Big Show on the July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\" while Punk was healing from an arm injury. On the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", Big Show unmasked the fourth member of the Straight Edge Society and it was revealed to be Joey Mercury. This incident led to a handicap match at SummerSlam. In the match, Big Show defeated the Straight Edge Society when Punk abandoned them. Punk was defeated in a singles match against Big Show at Night of Champions. A little while after, Serena was released from her WWE contract after she reportedly did not \"live out\" her straight edge persona in public. Mercury had also suffered an injury which caused the group to shorten. Gallows showed signs of dissent and Punk defeated Gallows in a match on the September 24 episode of \"SmackDown\". The ended the group.\nPunk was traded back to \"Raw\" when he was swapped with Edge. Punk competed in an interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after he injured Evan Bourne to take his place, but the team lost. It was later reported that Punk had been suffering from a hip injury and he would need to stop competing for a while. To stay on television, Punk appeared and began commentating on \"Raw\" starting on November 22. During his commentary time, Punk showed favor toward heels and criticized John Cena because of his actions with The Nexus. Punk left commentary after he attacked John Cena with a chair on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". Punk revealed that he had joined The Nexus and this was the reason that he had attacked Cena. Punk would command the group to attack Randy Orton and blamed him for Punk's first World Heavyweight Championship reign in 2008 ending. The incident led to a match at WrestleMania XXVII where Orton defeated Punk. They also had a Last Man Standing match with The New Nexus barred from ringside at Extreme Rules which Punk also lost.\n\nWithin a week, Punk went on to defeat John Cena on \"Raw\", Rey Mysterio at Capitol Punishment and Alberto Del Rio in a number one contendership match. Punk would then reveal that his contract with the WWE would expire at Money in the Bank and promised that he would leave the company with the WWE Championship; some of his speeches and mannerisms were very similar to his final months with Ring of Honor. After Punk made a scathing on-air speech about the way that the WWE is run and about its owner Vince McMahon, he was suspended (storyline) from televised WWE events but he was brought back the following week after John Cena insisted. When Punk returned, he didn't appear with the other members of Nexus and the stable was quietly dissolved. This helped Punk turn back into a fan-favorite. Punk would go on to defeat John Cena at Money in the Bank to become the WWE Champion during his final night under a WWE contract.\n\nOn July 21, he made a surprise appearance at a joint WWE-Mattel panel at the San Diego Comic Con. During his appearance, Punk mocked the Chief Operating Officer Triple H and also offered a match to the WWE Championship tournament finalist Rey Mysterio as long as the match took place in Punk's hometown of Chicago. The WWE Championship tournament was won by Mysterio on the July 25 episode of \"Raw\" but he lost to Cena later in the night. When Cena won, Punk returned to upstage Cena's WWE Championship victory celebration which lead to a title dispute. Triple H later supported the fact that both Punk and Cena's claims as the WWE Championship as legitimate and he scheduled a match between the two at SummerSlam to decide who would become the undisputed WWE Champion. At SummerSlam, Punk was able to win the match but he lost the championship shortly after when Kevin Nash attacked Punk and Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. On \"Raw\" the next night, Punk accused Nash of working with Triple H to try and keep Punk away from the WWE Championship. After many confrontations between the two, Punk and Nash demanded that they face each other at Night of Champions and Triple H agreed. Triple H would later change the match and would book himself to replace Nash instead after Punk continued to verbally attack him and his wife Stephanie McMahon.\n\nPunk was defeated by Triple H in a No Disqualification match after The Miz, and R-Truth attacked both of them. At Hell in a Cell, Punk competed in a Triple threat Hell in a Cell match against Alberto Del Rio and John Cena but he was defeated. After the match, Punk was again attacked by The Miz and R-Truth. At Vengeance, Punk teamed up with Triple H in a match against The Miz and R-Truth but they lost after Nash attacked Triple H. The loss helped switch Punk's anti-establishment voice from Triple H over to John Laurinaitis, who became the interim Raw general manager. Punk didn't like the promotion that Laurinaitis received and called him a boring yes man.\n\nOn October 31, Punk forced his way into a match against Del Rio at Survivor Series. In the match, Punk defeated Del Rio to win back the WWE Championship. He defended the championship throughout the year, defeating Del Rio in a rematch on the November 28 episode of \"Raw\" as well as defeating both Del Rio and The Miz in a triple threat TLC match at . On the December 26 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated in a gauntlet match by Dolph Ziggler which made Ziggler become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. If Punk was able to win the gauntlet match, he would have earned the right to face Laurinaitis in a match. On the January 2 episode of \"Raw\", Punk was defeated by Ziggler via countout after Laurinaitis interfered in the match. Throughout January, Laurinaitis would continue to mess up Punk's matches and cause him to lose to Ziggler. This eventually led to Punk attacking Laurinaitis. Punk defeated Ziggler in a match at Royal Rumble to retain his championship even with Laurinaitis acting as the outside enforcer.\n\nOn the January 30 episode of \"Raw\", entered a feud with Chris Jericho after Jericho attacked Punk and Daniel Bryan during their Champion vs. Champion match which helped Bryan gain the win. On the February 6 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho explained why he attacked Punk, saying that the WWE roster were imitations of himself and he singled out Punk for claiming that he was the best in the world, a moniker that Jericho had used during the last time that he was in WWE. Punk competed in an Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber. The match also featured Jericho who Punk kicked out of the chamber and suffered a short lasting injury. Punk was able to win the match and retain his championship. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho won a 10-Man No. 1 Contender's Battle Royal and earned a match against Punk for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. To try and gain a psychological edge, Jericho revealed that Punk's father was an alcoholic and also alleged that Punk's sister was a drug addict. Jericho said that Punk's straight edge philosophy was so that he would not end up falling into the same vices and promised that he would make Punk turn to alcohol by defeating him and winning the championship from him. A stipulation was added to the match by John Laurinaitis that if Punk was disqualified, he would have lost the championship. Jericho would then try to get Punk to use a weapon which Punk refused to do. Punk was able to defeat Jericho and retain his championship at WrestleMania XXVIII. On both the April 2 and 9 episodes of \"Raw SuperShow\", Punk was able to retain his championship against Mark Henry after he lost to him via count-out and disqualification. After both of the matches, Jericho would attack Punk and pour alcohol on him. On the April 16 episode of \"Raw SuperShow\", Punk was able to pin Henry in a no disqualification, no countout match to retain his title. The feud ended at Extreme Rules when Punk was able to retain his championship by defeating Jericho in a Chicago Street Fight.\n\nPunk would go to feud with Daniel Bryan starting at Over the Limit when Punk was able to retain his championship after he reversed Bryan's finishing submission hold, the \"Yes!\" Lock, into a pinning combination. The replay, however, would show that Punk had visibly tapped out moments after the match finished. On the \"SmackDown\" before the pay-per-view, Bryan would interfere in the non-title match between Punk and Kane to attempt to frame Punk for attacking Kane with a steel chair, which started a three-way rivalry. On the June 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", a match between Punk and Kane took place for the WWE Championship but it ended in a double disqualification after Bryan ran in and attacked both men. Bryan's ex-girlfriend AJ would turn her affections towards both Punk and Kane. The feud ended when Punk was able to defeat Bryan and Kane in a triple threat match at No Way Out after AJ distracted Kane. Punk was able to defeat Bryan to retain the championship in a No Disqualification match with AJ as the special guest referee at Money in the Bank.\n\nOn July 23 episode of \"Raw\" named \"Raw 1000\", Punk faced the Money in the Bank winner John Cena and was able to defend his WWE championship but lost the match after Big Show interfered and attack Cena. After the night's special guest The Rock tried to help Cena, Punk would attack him and turn heel. On the next \"Raw\", Punk would explain that he attacked The Rock because he was tired of being overshadowed by people like Cena and Rock when the main focus of the company should be on the WWE Champion. Punk would attack both Cena and Big Show during their number one contender's match later on in the night. As a result of this, both Cena and Show were put into a title match against Punk at SummerSlam. At SummerSlam, Punk successfully defended his championship against them in a triple threat match. During the following weeks, Punk would demand respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart. He would eventually be managed by Paul Heyman during Punk's feud with Cena. Punk would face Cena to a draw at Night of Champions. Even though Cena was suffering from an arm injury, they continued to feud. Punk would reject Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell in a Cell opponent and lead to Punk fighting with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. After Cena's injury made him unable to wrestle at Hell in a Cell, he was replaced by Ryback. At Hell in a Cell, Punk was able to defeat Ryback and retain his championship after referee Brad Maddox hit Ryback with a low-blow.\n\nOn \"Raw\" the next night, an angry Mick Foley confronted Punk for not picking John Cena as his Hell in a Cell opponent. Foley and Punk then agreed to face each other in the traditional five-on-five elimination tag team at Survivor Series. Punk would chose Alberto Del Rio, Cody Rhodes, Damien Sandow, and The Miz to be on his team but Punk was later replaced as team captain by Dolph Ziggler after Mr. McMahon booked him in a Triple Threat WWE Championship match against John Cena and Ryback instead. At the pay-per-view, Punk defeated Cena and Ryback after interference from the debuting stable called The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns) which allowed him to retain his WWE Championship. He would hold the championship for a full year. On December 4, Punk underwent surgery for a partially torn meniscus which removed him from his title match against Ryback at . Even though Punk was injured, he became the longest reigning WWE Champion in the past 25 years on December 5, after he reached 381 days which passed John Cena's 380-day reign. Punk returned to in-ring action on the January 7, 2013 episode of \"Raw\" where he defeated Ryback in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, following interference from The Shield to retain his championship.\n\nPunk defended his WWE Championship against The Rock at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2013. A stipulation was added to the match where if The Shield interfered, then Punk would be stripped of the title. Punk had originally pinned The Rock to retain his championship after The Shield attacked and put The Rock through a table while the arena lights were out. Vince McMahon came out to the entrance ramp and started to announce that Punk would be stripped of the championship, but he instead restarted the match at The Rock's request. Punk ended up losing the match, ending his record-setting reign at 434 days. Punk would receive a rematch for the championship on February 17 at the Elimination Chamber, with the stipulation that if The Rock was disqualified or counted out, he would lose the WWE Championship. Rock was able to pin and defeat Punk in the match to retain the championship. On the February 25 episode of \"Raw\", Punk faced off against Royal Rumble winner John Cena for his number one contendership to the WWE Championship, but was defeated.\n\nOn January 26, 2014, Punk was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match. After he was able to last in the match until the final four, Kane, who was already eliminated earlier in by Punk, eliminated Punk from the outside and then chokeslammed him through the announcer's table.\n\nThe night after the Royal Rumble, Punk did not show up \"Raw\" or on the \"SmackDown\" tapings on Tuesday in Toledo, Ohio even though he was advertised. It was reported by the Wrestling Observer that, on Monday before Raw, Punk legitimately walked out of the company after he told both Vince McMahon and Triple H that he was \"going home\". On February 20, McMahon said that Punk was \"taking a sabbatical\" during a conference call to investors. After weeks of hearing the crowd chant for CM Punk at various WWE events, the company decided to make its first comments on the status of Punk on the March 3, 2014 episode of \"Raw\" in Punk's hometown of Chicago. When the show started, they played Punk's entrance music \"Cult of Personality\" and his old manager Paul Heyman came out instead. Heyman said that Punk was not at \"Raw\" and blamed the crowd. He also blamed the Undertaker for Punk's split from Heyman. On July 15, 2014, WWE moved Punk's profile from the active roster to their alumni page without them releasing a statement. On the same day, Punk thanked his fans without mentioning WWE on Twitter. In late July, Punk said that he was \"never ever\" going to return to wrestling.\n\nOn November 26, 2014, Punk appeared on his friend Colt Cabana's \"Art of Wrestling\" podcast. During the podcast, Punk decided to break his silence on his decision on leaving the WWE. Punk said the WWE had suspended him for two months after he walked out in January, and that he was fired by the company months later on his wedding day in June 2014. He said that them firing him on his wedding day was the last straw and he said that he would never return to the WWE. He also said that after a legal settlement with WWE, there would not be a further working relationship between them. The settlement that was reached included Punk giving the company permission to sell the rest of his remaining merchandise. Punk said that the main reason he left the WWE was because of his health problems. Punk said that during his last months with the company, he was working through an untreated and possibly fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, multiple concussions which included one at the Royal Rumble when Kofi Kingston kicked him, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. He felt that the company had been pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he was fully healed. Punk also noted that he was unhappy with his failure to main event a WrestleMania (saying that his entire career was a failure as a result), him being paid less than the other top wrestlers on the card for WrestleMania 29, being \"creatively stifled\" and him having the feeling that there were no long-term plans for wrestlers other than John Cena, as well as receiving smaller paychecks and not getting answers as to how the WWE Network would effect the salaries of the wrestlers. Punk ended with saying that he has \"zero passion\" left for wrestling.\n\nNot even a week later, Vince McMahon appeared on Stone Cold Steve Austin's podcast \"The Steve Austin Show\". During the podcast, Stone Cold asked McMahon if he wanted to speak about CM Punk. McMahon apologized to Punk for the way that his firing happened, which he claimed was a \"coincidence\" while he blaming the lack of communication in the organization. McMahon also said that he would like to work with Punk again. Punk would appear on Cabana's \"Art of Wrestling\" podcast again. During the podcast, Punk said that he did not accept McMahon's apology, saying that it was insincere and a \"publicity stunt\" as McMahon had not contacted him directly to apologize and that he could have apologized earlier.\n\nOn December 6, 2014, during UFC 181, Punk along with Joe Rogan announced that he had signed a multi-fight deal with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to fight in either their middleweight or welterweight division. UFC President Dana White said that Punk would most likely debut against another fighter at or near his experience level. His first fight is expected to be sometime in 2016\n\nCM Punk is married to AJ Lee. They were married on June 13, 2014. He has previously dated professional wrestlers Shannon Spruill, Tracy Brookshaw, Maria Kanellis, and Amy Dumas.\n\nPunk is a fan of the Chicago Blackhawks and the Chicago Cubs. He wore a Blackhawks jersey and cut a promo during his return to Chicago. He also attended Blackhawks playoff games.\n\nHe is a fan of comics which he collects and reads. He wrote the introduction to Marvel Comics' \"Avengers vs. X-Men\". Punk wrote the Marvel comic \"Thor Annual #1\", which is set to be released sometime in February 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "134378", "title": "CM Punk"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134389", "text": "Impossible object\n\nAn impossible object is a kind of optical illusion. Impossible objects are also known as undecidable figures. In this kind of illusion, a person looks at a two-dimensional picture. The vision center of the brain does much of its work subconsciously and automatically. It interprets the figure as a three-dimensional object. \n\nThe viewer usually knows such an object is impossible soon after looking at the figure. However, the impression of a 3D figure may still remain even when the viewer knows it is impossible in reality.\n\nSome of these figures are more subtle. In these cases it is not obvious that they are impossible right away. The viewer carefully needs to look at the geometry of the object ot find out that it is indeed impossible.\n\n\"Impossible objects\" are of interest to psychologists, mathematicians and artists. \n\nSwedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd was the first person to draw many impossible objects. He has been called \"the father of impossible figures\". In 1934, he drew the Penrose triangle, some years before the Penroses. The way Reutersvärd drew it, the sides of the triangle are broken up into cubes.\n\nIn 1956, British psychiatrist Lionel Penrose and his son, mathematician Roger Penrose, submitted a short article to the British Journal of Psychology titled \"Impossible objects: a special type of visual illusion\". This was illustrated with the Penrose Triangle and Penrose stairs. The article referenced Escher, whose work had sparked their interest in the subject, but not Reutersvärd, whom they were unaware of. The article was only published in 1958.\n\nFrom the 1930s onwards Dutch artist M.C. Escher produced many drawings with paradoxes of perspective. In 1957 he produced his first drawing containing a true impossible object: \"Cube with Magic Ribbons\". He produced many other drawings of impossible objects, sometimes with the entire drawing being an undecidable figure. His work did much to draw the attention of the public to impossible objects. Some artists of the time are also experimenting with impossible figures, for example, Jos de Mey, Shigeo Fukuda, Sandro del Prete, István Orosz (Utisz), Guido Moretti, Tamás F. Farkas and Mathieu Hamaekers.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "134389", "title": "Impossible object"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134406", "text": "Alliance for the Future of Austria\n\nThe Alliance for the Future of Austria (, shortenend to BZÖ) is a political party in Austria that was led by Jörg Haider until he died in October 2008. The current leader is Josef Bucher.\n\nThe BZÖ describes itself as \"ideologiefrei, aber zukunftsorientiert und wertebewusst\" (free from ideology, but forward-looking and conscious of traditional values). Some of its policies, however, are quite different from those of the Freedom Party.\nThey include:\n\nAlthough the party was often designated as a far-right like the Freedom Party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria differs somewhat. Justic Minster Karin Gastinger a former party member of the Alliance for the Future of Austria, wanted gay and lesbian couples to be able to sign a registry and get rights to partners' estates and medical care as she told the Austrian Press Agency in 2005.\n\nFPÖ and BZÖ are both Eurosceptic parties and in the 2006 general election, the Freedom Party as well as the Alliance for the Future of Austria both claimed they would decrease immigration and opposed Turkish membership in the European Union.\n\nIn the Austrian legislative election 2008 campaign, the ÖVP saw the lowering of brokerage commissions and the charges for arrears letters of debt collection agencies and winter fuel payments for lower-income households as appropriate economic recovery measures and the Greens sought to facilitate the changeover to renewable energy in order to reduce energy prices.\n\nThe SPÖ proposes a stricter controlling of prices in addition to the reduction of brokerage commissions. Both the Alliance for the Future of Austria and the Freedom Party see the main problem in the rising fuel prices; the FPÖ demands a ceiling price for fuel, while the BZÖ in addition wants to reduce taxes on fuels. \nHowever the Alliace for the Future of Austria even announced the people's initiative \"Preisstop jetzt!\" calling for a stop to rising prices to be held; however, due to the necessary timeframe, the period during which people will be able to sign for the initiative will only start after the election, thus limiting its potential impact.\n\nSPÖ, ÖVP and the Greens ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in parliament without a referendum, and only FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria did not sign. But afterwards the SPÖ stated that for future treaties of the European Union referendums should be held to let the people decide like in Ireland (where they had a referendum). Due to SPÖ's position change on the EU not only the two opposition parties are using the possibility of EU-referendums before a ratification as subject now. The ÖVP and the Greens are against any referendums on the Lisbon Treaty, SPÖ demands there should be referendums on future treaties of the European Union, the FPÖ is for a referendum for the Lisbon Treaty, and even want a referendum for EU-Withdrawal. However the BZÖ differs a bit in comparison to the Freedom Party, as they are for a referendum about the Lisbon Treaty but not, for an EU-Withdrawal.\n\nDue to help of the former FPÖ and till then BZÖ party-leader and Carinthian LH (LH stands for \"Landeshauptmann\", simply like Gov. for Governor) Dr. Jörg Haider the party achieved 10.7% in the 2008 elections and gained 21 representatives, so that the BZÖ is currently the 4th strongest Party in the Austrian Parliament just after SPÖ,ÖVP and FPÖ\nand before \"Die Grünen\" (the Greens).\n\nIt currently holds 16 seats.\nOn 2 May 2010 the party became a new programm, and the rectlange orange colored logo was first used on the annual hold new year's convention, which took place in Velden in Carinthia of the year 2011.\n\nIn December 2009 the Carinthian BZÖ branch which was Haiders stronghold lost about 5000 members and the governor of Carinthia (although the party won the state election in 2009)to the split of party FPK (The Freedomites in Carinthia).\nIt now has 800 party members and 4 MPs (Members of parliament) in Carinthia.\nAlso a new website for the BZÖ Kärnten was set up and is available prior too March 2012.\n\nHowever opinion polls (polling between 2 and 23 per cent) have shown good chances for a return of the Carinthian branch of the Alliance for the Future of Austria into Carinthian State Diet.\nIn 2011 the party began an autumn posting campaign and quoted the bible \"Denn sie wissen nicht was sie tun.\",\neng.: \"They know not what they do!\" (Lukas 23,34),\nfor criticising SPÖ, ÖVP and the EU \"bosses\".\nThis caused a little scandal whether politics and religion should be separated or not.\nIn total the party has 8000 members therefore having more than the Greens and less than the Freedom Party.\n", "id": "134406", "title": "Alliance for the Future of Austria"}
