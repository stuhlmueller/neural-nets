It is saltier than fresh water, but not as salty as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. \n\nSome human activities can produce brackish water, mostly certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish pools for freshwater prawns. \n\nTechnically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or ‰). Thus, \"brackish\" covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.\n\nThe term brackish water comes from the Low German word \"Brack\", which is a small lake made when a storm tide breaks a dike and floods land behind the dike.\n\nThe most important brackish water habitats are estuaries, where a river meets the sea, mixing salt and fresh water. The River Thames flowing through London is one of the most familiar of river estuaries.\n\nAnother important brackish water habitat is the mangrove swamp or mangal. .\n\nSome seas and lakes are brackish. The Baltic Sea is a brackish sea adjoining the North Sea. .\n\nThe Caspian Sea is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal seawater. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the Caspian seal) and the great sturgeons, the source of caviar.\n\nBrackish seas\n\nBrackish water lakes\n\nCoastal lagoons, marshes, and deltas\n\nEstuaries\n\n", "id": "67115", "title": "Brackish water"}

Both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. \n\nEfficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel burning. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target.

The study of water flow in aquifers and the characterization of aquifers is called hydrogeology.\n\nGroundwater may exist in underground rivers (e.g., caves where water flows freely underground). This may occur in eroded limestone areas known as karst topography, which make up only a small percentage of Earth's area. More usual is that the pore spaces of rocks in the subsurface are simply saturated with water — like a kitchen sponge — which can be pumped out for agricultural, industrial, or municipal uses.\n\nIf a rock unit of low porosity is highly fractured, it can make a good aquifer (via fissure flow), if the water can get though it. Porosity is important, but, \"alone\", it does make an aquifer. The Deccan Traps (a flood basaltic lava) in west central India are good examples of rock with high porosity but low permeability, so they are poor aquifers. The (Upper Cretaceous) Chalk of south east England has a reasonably high porosity, but low grain-to-grain permeability. Much of its good water-yielding characteristics being due to micro-fracturing and fissuring.\n\n\nAquifers can occur at various depths. Those closer to the surface are not only more likely to be exploited for water supply and irrigation, but are also more likely to be topped up by the local rainfall. Many desert areas have limestone hills or mountains within them or close to them which can be exploited as groundwater resources. If more water is taken out than get in again one speaks of over-harvesting. Along the coastlines of certain countries, such as Libya and Israel, population growth has led to over-population which has caused the lowering of water table and the subsequent contamination of the groundwater with saltwater from the sea (saline intrusions). In these cases the aquifer contains brackish water.\n\nWhen water seeps (comes slowly) out of the ground, it is called a seep or \"spring (water)\". It usually means there is an aquifer under the ground.\n", "id": "67145", "title": "Aquifer"}

He is known for his swashbuckler roles in movies like \"Adventures of Don Juan\" and \"The Sea Hawk\".\n\nErrol Flynn was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. His father Theodore Thomson Flynn, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania. Flynn was born at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point. His mother was born Lily Mary Young. She dropped the first names Lily Mary shortly after she was married and changed her name to Marelle. Flynn described his mother's family as \"\"seafaring folk\"\". This may account for his lifelong love of the sea and boats.\n\nHe became a naturalized American citizen in 1942. He is remembered for his successful on-screen partnership with Olivia de Havilland. They appeared together in eight movies: \"Captain Blood\" (1935, his first great success), \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" (1936), \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938), \"Four's a Crowd\" (1938), \"Dodge City\" (1939), \"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex\" (1939), \"Santa Fe Trail\" (1940), and \"They Died with Their Boots On\" (1941). This partnership started rumors of romance. De Havilland denied these rumors. She said her relationship with Flynn was one of friendship only.\n\nFlynn tried to enlist in every branch of the United States Armed Services during WWII. He was classified 4F because of numerous health issues. Hollywood executives kept his health issues a secret to protect his screen image. He never served and was criticized for this. As the years passed, Flynn's manly image diminished. He became an alcoholic, gained weight, and had a seedy appearance. Flynn wrote his autobiography \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\" in 1959. He died of a heart attack at age 50. His last words were reportedly, \"I've had a hell of a lot of fun and I've enjoyed every minute of it\".\n\nFlynn was married three times: first to actress Lili Damita from 1935 until 1942 (one son, Sean Flynn, 1941–70?); to Nora Eddington from 1943 until 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre born 1945 and Rory born 1947); and to actress Patrice Wymore from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma, 1953–1998).\n\nFlynn had a reputation for womanizing and freewheeling fun. His hedonistic lifestyle caught up with him in 1942 when two under-age girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, accused him of statutory rape. The two girls said that the event occurred at the Bel Air home of Flynn's friend Frederick McEvoy. A group was organized to support Flynn. It was called the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF). Its members included William F. Buckley, Jr. The trial took place in January and February 1943.

It is a group of organisms which a taxonomist decides belong together in biological classification.\n\nTaxa can be big or small, a fairly small taxon is the giraffes, a very big one is the beetles.\nA taxonomist can assign a scientific name and rank to a taxon; this places it at a particular level in a hierarchy. It is not strictly necessary to assign either a name or a rank to a taxon, but doing so makes it much easier to refer to the taxon. However, many taxa have to wait for years before getting a name.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of ranks that may exist, but the most important ranks are, in hierarchical order:\n\nNote: \"Phylum\" applies formally to any biologial domain but traditionally it was always used of animals whereas \"Division\" was traditionally often used of plants, fungi etc.\n\nA simple phrase to remember the order is\n\"Dignified Kings Play Chess On Fine Green Silk\" (there are many other such phrases).\n\nA distinction is made between taxonomy and systematics. Systematics deals with how groups relate to each other. Taxonomy deals with making groups (taxa), deciding what belongs together. Taxonomy is also known as classification.\n\nA special part of taxonomy is nomenclature. This consists of rules on what names to use. So a taxonomist first decides what does and does not belongs in a group, and then uses nomenclature to decide what name this group should have. If a group is made larger or bigger it may get a different name. On the other hand, the same name may refer to a bigger taxon (according to one particular taxonomist) or a smaller taxon (according to some other taxonomist). This means that scientific names are not guaranteed to be stable. Most names are stable, but for some taxa there is no agreement on its name, because taxonomists do not agree what does belong together and what does not belong together.\n\nA taxonomist can decide for himself what scientific reasons he adopts for making a group (a taxon). If he is not convincing in his choice, other taxonomists will not agree with him, and they will then make other arrangements.

The sakura parties are enjoyed by younger people and can be very crowded and noisy. The older people like best the viewing of plum blossoms. They are more calm than the sakura parties. \n\nThe practice of hanami is many centuries old. It is said to have started during the Nara Period (710–784) when the Chinese Tang Dynasty influenced Japan in many ways; one of which was the custom of enjoying flowers. Though it was ume blossoms that people admired in the beginning, by the Heian Period (794–1185), sakura began to attract more attention. The sakura were considered sacred by the Japanese, and they were so important that they still are a cultural symbol of Japan. People believed in gods' existence inside the trees, and the hanami party was used in the beginning to divine that year's harvest and to announce the season of planting rice. Those who went to the hanami made offerings at the root of sakura trees, and after the ceremony, they took part in the offering drinking sake.\n\nEmperor Saga of the Heian Period adopted this custom, and celebrated parties to view the flowers with sake and feasts under the blossoming branches of sakura trees in the Imperial Court in Kyoto. This was said to be the origin of hanami in Japan. Poems were written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself; beautiful, but lasting for a very short time. This 'temporary' view of life is very popular in Japanese culture and is usually considered as an admirable form of existence; for example, in the samurai's principle of life ending when it's still beautiful and strong, instead of slowly getting old and weak. The Heian era poets used to write poems about how much easier things would be in Spring without the sakura blossoms, because their existence reminded us that life is very short:\n\nHanami was used as a term that meant \"cherry blossom viewing\" for the first time in the Heian era novel \"Tale of Genji\" (chapter 8, 花宴 \"Hana no En, \"Under the Cherry Blossoms\"\"). From then on, in \"tanka\" and in \"haiku\" poetry, \"flowers\" meant \"sakura\", and the terms \"hanami\" and \"flower party\" were only used to mean sakura blossom viewing.\nAt the beginning, the custom was followed only by the Imperial Court, but the samurai nobility also began celebrating it during the Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1568–1600). In those years, Toyotomi Hideyoshi gave great hanami parties in Yoshino and Daigo, and the festivity became very popular through all the Japanese society. Shortly after that, farmers began their own custom of climbing nearby mountains in the springtime and having lunch under the blooming cherry trees. This practice, called then as the \"spring mountain trip\", combined itself with that of the nobles' to form the urban culture of hanami. By the Edo Period (1600–1867), all the common people took part in the celebrations, in part because Tokugawa Yoshimune planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts. \n\nThe Japanese people continue the tradition of hanami, gathering in great numbers wherever the flowering trees are found. Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees, and sometimes these parties go on until late at night. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming days come at the same time of the beginning of school and work after vacation, and so welcoming parties are often opened with hanami. Usually, people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate hanami with friends, family, and company co-workers many hours or even days before. In cities like Tokyo, it's also common to have celebrations under the sakura at night. In many places such as Ueno Park, temporary paper lanterns are hung to have yozakura.\n\nThe blossom forecast or is announced each year by the Japan Meteorological Agency, and is watched with attention by those who plan to celebrate hanami because the blossoms last for very little time, usually no more than two weeks. The first cherry blossoms happen in the subtropical southern islands of Okinawa, while on the northern island of Hokkaido, they bloom much later. In most large cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April. The television and newspapers closely follow this \"cherry blossom front\", as it slowly moves from South to North.\n\nThe hanami celebrations usually involve eating and drinking, and playing and listening music. Some special dishes are prepared and eaten at the occasion, like \"dango\" and \"bento\", and it's common for sake to be drunk as part of the festivity. The proverb \"\"dumplings rather than flowers\"\" makes fun of people who prefer to eat and drink instead of admiring the blossoms.\n\nRecently, hanami festivities have also become popular outside of Japan. Smaller hanami celebrations in Korea, Philippines and China (where the custom was first created) also take place traditionally.\n\nIn the United States, hanami has also become popular. In 1912, Japan gave 3,000 sakura trees as a gift to the United States to celebrate the nations' friendship. These trees were planted in Washington, D.C., and another 3,800 gifted trees were also taken there in 1956. These sakura trees continue to be a popular tourist attraction, and every year, the \"National Cherry Blossom Festival\" takes place when they bloom in early Spring.\n\nIn Macon, Georgia, another cherry blossom festival called the \"International Cherry Blossom Festival\" is celebrated every spring. Macon is known as the \"Cherry Blossom Capital of the World\" because 300,000 sakura trees grow there.\n\nIn Brooklyn, New York, the \"Annual Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival\" takes place in May at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. This festivity has been celebrated since 1981, and is one of the Garden's most famous attractions. Similar celebrations are also done in Philadelphia and other places through the United States.\n\n\n", "id": "67224", "title": "Hanami"}

Neighbourhoods are often social communities because the people that live in them commonly talk with each other. Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition.\n\nAccording to urban scholar Lewis Mumford, Neighbourhoods have always exist where humans live. Many of the functions of the city are usually distributed into neighbourhoods. Archaeologists have found evidence of neighbourhoods in the ruins of most of the earliest cities around the world. Historical documents give information about neighbourhood life in many historical preindustrial or nonwestern cities.\n\nNeighbourhoods are usually created by social interaction between people living near each another. They are local social groups larger than households that are not under the control of city or state officials. In some early urban traditions, basic municipal functions such as protection, marriages, cleaning and repairs are done by neighbourhoods. This is shown to have happened in historical Islamic cities.\n\nMost ancient and historical cities also had administrative districts. These were used by the government for taxation and social control. Administrative districts are usually larger than neighbourhoods. They often cover areas that are larger than just one neighbourhood. Sometimes, administrative districts are just one neighbourhood. This leads to a lot of control of social life by officials. For example, in the T’ang period Chinese capital city Chang’an, neighbourhoods were districts. There were state officials who controlled life and activity at the neighbourhood level.\n\nNeighbourhoods in very old cities often grouped certain people together. Ethnic neighbourhoods were important in many old cities. They are still common in cities today. Economic specialists, including craft makers, merchants, and others, could be grouped together in neighbourhoods. There were also neighbourhoods based around certain religions. One important part to neighbourhood being different from each other and their people getting along well was how people moved from rural areas to the cities. This was always happening in old cities. The people moving to the cities often moved in with relatives and people they knew from before moving to the city.\n\nIn the mainland of the People's Republic of China, the term is usually used for the urban administrative division. These divisions are found below the district level. A subdistrict level may exists in some cities. They are also called streets. The naming may be different from one city to another. Neighbourhoods usually have 2,000 to 10,000 families. Within neighbourhoods, families are grouped into smaller groups of 100 to 600 families. These smaller groups are supervised by a residents' committee. These groups are often broken down into even smaller groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighbourhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning.\n\nNeighbourhood () in Turkey is an administrative unit within municipalities. It has an official status but no governmental powers. Neighbourhoods are administered by the Mukhtar and the \"Neighbourhood Seniors Council\". This is a group of 4 people. The mukhtar is elected by the people living in the neighbourhood. He is an administrator of the district governor. Mukhtar also has a seat at the City Assembly. This is an organization for the coordination of the public institutions in the city. Neighbourhood administrators get a salary from the Central Government. They also get money from the fees paid for dealing with certain documents.\n\nThe term has no official use in the United Kingdom. It is often used by local boroughs for sub-divisions of their area for the delivery of certain services and functions. It is also used as a term to refer to a small area within a town or city. The term is commonly used to refer to organisations which deal with such a very local issues, such as neighbourhood policing or Neighbourhood watches. Government statistics for local areas are often called neighbourhood statistics even though the data is usually broken down into districts and wards.\n\nIn Canada and the United States, neighborhoods often have official or semi-official status. This is commonly done using neighbourhood associations, neighbourhood watches, or block watches. These may deal with such things as lawn care and fence height. They may provide such things as block parties, neighbourhood parks, and community security. In some other places the organisation is the parish.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67271", "text": "Order of the Thistle\n\nThe Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle is an order of chivalry, associated with Scotland. Whilst it's first date of being made is unknown, James VII (also King of England as James II) created the modern Order in 1687. The Order is the Sovereign and sixteen Knights and Ladies, as well as certain \"extra\" knights (members of the British and foreign royal families). The Sovereign decides who is to be a member. He or she is not advised by the Government, as occurs with most other Orders. The sixteen members are required to be Scottish-born, but the \"extra\" knights and ladies are not.\n\nThe Order's main emblems are the thistle, the national flower of Scotland, and Saint Andrew holding a saltire (X shaped cross). The motto is \"Nemo me impune lacessit\" (Latin for \"No one provokes me with impunity\"); the same motto is also on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and on some pound coins. St Andrew is also the patron saint of the Order.\n\nMost British orders of chivalry cover all of the United Kingdom, but the three most most senior ones each cover only one constituent country . The Order of the Thistle, which covers to Scotland, is the second-most senior in precedence. Its equivalent in England, The Most Noble Order of the Garter, is the oldest order of chivalry in the United Kingdom, dating to the middle fourteenth century. In 1783 an Irish order, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, was founded; but since the independence of the Republic of Ireland the Order has fallen dormant. The last new knight was made in 1927, and the last surviving Knight of St Patrick died in 1974. \n\nThe first date of the Order's creation is not known. One story says that Achaius, King of Scots, was fighting King Aethelstan of East Anglia and he saw cross of St Andrew in the sky. After he won the battle, Achaius established the Order of the Thistle. Even though Achaius and Aethelstan never fought, this story of the foundation, is given in the Royal Warrant 'reviving' the Order in 1687. Another story says that the Order was instituted, or re-instituted by Robert I at the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nKing James II and VII issued letters patent \"reviving and restoring the Order of the Thistle to its full glory, lustre and magnificency\" in 1687. Only 12 knights were allowed, and he appointed eight before the King was deposed in 1688. His successors, the William and Mary, did not make any more appointments to the Order. In 1703 however, Anne once again revived the Order of the Thistle.\n\nThe Kings of Scotland–later the Kings of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom–have served as Sovereigns of the Order.\n\nWhen James VII revived the Order, the statutes said that the Order would continue the ancient number of Knights, which was described in the preceding warrant as \"the Sovereign and twelve Knights-Brethren in allusion to the Blessed Saviour and his Twelve Apostles.\n\nIn 1827, George IV increased the Order to sixteen members. Women were excluded from the Order. George VI created his wife Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon a Lady of the Thistle in 1937, and in 1987 Elizabeth II allowed the regular admission of women to both the Order of the Thistle and the Order of the Garter.\n\nFrom time to time, individuals joined the Order by special permission. These members are known as \"Extra Knights\" and do not count towards the sixteen-member limit. Members of the British Royal Family are normally admitted by special permission; the first was Prince Albert. King Olav V of Norway, was the first foreigner to be admitted to the Order, was also admitted by special permission in 1962.\n\nThe Sovereign has historically had the power to choose Knights of the Order. From the eighteenth century onwards, the Sovereign made his or her choices upon the advice of the Government. George VI felt that the Orders of the Garter and the Thistle had been used only for political patronage, rather than to reward actual merit. Therefore in 1946, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) and the Leader of the Opposition (Winston Churchill), both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.\n\nKnights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be admitted to the Order of the Garter. \n\nKnights and Ladies of the Thistle may also have their knighthoods taken away. But this has happened only once, to John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who was \"deprived\" of both the knighthood and the earldom after taking part in the Jacobite rising of 1715.\n\nThe Order has five officers: \n\nFor the Order's great occasions, such as its annual service each June or July, as well for coronations, the Knights and Ladies wear an elaborate costume:\n\n\nAside from these special occasions, however, much simpler badges are used whenever a member of the Order attends an event at which decorations are worn.\n\n\nWhen James VII revived the Order in 1687, he wanted the Abbey Church at the Palace of Holyroodhouse to be the Chapel for the Order of the Thistle, perhaps copying the idea from the Order of the Garter (whose chapel is located in Windsor Castle). \n\nJames VII was deposed by 1688 and the Order did not have a Chapel until 1911, when one was added onto St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh. Each year, the Sovereign stays at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in June or July; during the visit, a service for the Order is held. Any new Knights or Ladies are installed at annual services. \n\nEach member of the Order, including the Sovereign, is allotted a seat in the Chapel. Their coat of arms is above their seat.\n\n\nThere is one vacancy\n\n\n", "id": "67271", "title": "Order of the Thistle"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67302", "text": "Arturo Toscanini\n\nArturo Toscanini (25 March 1867 – 16 January 1957) was an Italian conductor. Most musicians think he was the greatest conductor of his time. His fame was legendary: he was probably the first conductor to become a world superstar. He had an incredibly good memory and could remember every single note of the large number of works he conducted. He had a photographic memory so that he could remember what the pages looked like. Sometimes he found little mistakes in the scores which no one else had ever noticed. He had a very keen sense of hearing and knew exactly what each instrument was doing. He also had a fiery temperament and there are movies of him shouting angrily at his orchestra in rehearsals. In the early days of gramophone recordings he made some of the first recordings of famous orchestral works.\n\nToscanini was born in Parma in Italy. He won a scholarship to the local music conservatory, where he learned to play the cello. He joined the orchestra of an opera company and he toured South America with them in 1886. While performing Verdi’s opera \"Aida\" in Rio de Janeiro the audience did not like the conductor and they booed him so that he had to leave the stage. No one knew what to do at first, but then they persuaded Toscanini, who was only 19 years old, to put down his cello and conduct the orchestra. He did this brilliantly from memory (without looking at the music) and that night he became famous.\n\nWhen he got back to Italy Toscanini returned to his chair in the cello section, and took part as cellist in the first performance of Verdi's \"Otello\" (La Scala, 1887). Verdi was there and was very impressed when Toscanini asked him about a mistake he noticed in the score. \n\nSoon the young musician's reputation as a brilliant conductor of opera grew. He conducted the first performances of Puccini's \"La Bohème\" and Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\". In 1896 he conducted his first symphonic concert (works by Schubert, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner), in Turin. By 1898 he was conductor at La Scala, Milan and he stayed there until 1908, but returned during the 1920s. He took the Scala Orchestra to the United States on a concert tour in 1920-21; it was during that tour that Toscanini made his first recordings (for the Victor Talking Machine Company).\n\nToscanini started conducting outside Europe: at the Metropolitan Opera in New York (1908–1915) as well as the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1926–1936). He toured Europe with the New York Philharmonic in 1930 and always had great success. Toscanini was the first non-German conductor to conduct at Bayreuth (1930–1931). In the 1930s he conducted at the Salzburg Festival (1934–1937) and the first concert in 1936 of the newly formed Palestine Symphony Orchestra (now the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra) in Tel Aviv, and later performed with them in Jerusalem, Haifa, Cairo and Alexandria. \n\nAt first Toscanini agreed with Fascism but later, when the dictator Mussolini came to power, he became against it. He refused to perform an opera at La Scala and was beaten up, so he left Italy and went to the United States.\n\nThere was no orchestra for him in the USA so they made a new orchestra for him to conduct. This was the NBC Symphony Orchestra, created for him in 1937. He conducted the first broadcast concert on December 25, 1937, in NBC Studio 8-H in New York City's Rockefeller Center.\n\nToscanini was often criticized for not performing much American music and contemporary music (music by living composers). However, in 1938, he conducted the world premieres of two orchestral works by Samuel Barber, \"Adagio for Strings\" and \"Essay for Orchestra (Barber)|Essay for Orchestra\". In 1945, he led the orchestra in Carnegie Hall recording sessions of American music including \"An American in Paris\" by George Gershwin. He also conducted broadcast performances of Copland's \"El Salon Mexico\" and Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\" with soloists Earl Wild and Benny Goodman and \"Concerto in F\" with pianist Oscar Levant, as well as music by other American composers, including two marches of John Philip Sousa.\n\nIn 1940, Toscanini had a disagreement with the NBC and he threatened to move to CBS. Although they agreed in the end it was this time that Leopold Stokowski began conducting some of the concerts and continued to appear sometimes as a guest conductor of the orchestra.\n\nIn July 1942 Toscanini conducted the American premiere of Dmitri Shostakovich's \"Symphony no 7\". Due to World War II, the score was microfilmed in the Soviet Union and brought by courier to the United States. At first Stokowski wanted to conduct it but then he agreed that Toscanini would. Unfortunately for New York listeners, a big thunderstorm made it difficult to hear the music on the radio. Later the performance was reissued.\n\nThe orchestra went all over the world with Toscanini. In 1950 the NBC concerts moved to Carnegie Hall. In a programme of music by Richard Wagner in 1954 Toscanini was not well and forgot how the music went. He never conducted in public again after that.\n\nToscanini married Carla De Martini on June 21, 1897, when she was not yet 20 years old. They had four children although one died. He worked with many great singers and musicians, including the pianist Vladimir Horowitz who was a great friend. Horowitz married one of Toscanini’s daughters.\n\nWhen he died of a stroke in New York at the age of 89, his body was returned to Italy and was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale in Milan.\n\nMany years after his death, in 1987, Toscanini was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n", "id": "67302", "title": "Arturo Toscanini"}

He is mostly known for his works of science fiction. In addition to his published novels, Dick wrote \"approximately 121 short stories. He wrote most of them for science fiction magazines.\" At least eight of his stories have been adapted into movies. \n\nPhilip K. Dick developed what would later be called cyberpunk. Many of his works are about themes from sociology. Often, politics also play an important role. Very often there are Authoritarian Governments, and very powerful companies in his books. In his later books, Dick writes about drug use. He writes about characters that have paranoia or schizophrenia. In novels such as \"A Scanner Darkly\" or \"VALIS\" he uses his own experiences.\n\nHe was awarded the Hugo Award for his novel, \"The Man in the High Castle\", in 1963. \"I want to write about people I love, and put them into a fictional world spun out of my own mind, not the world we actually have, because the world we actually have does not meet my standards,\" Dick wrote of these stories. \"In my writing I even question the universe; I wonder out loud if it is real, and I wonder out loud if all of us are real.\" Dick spent most of his career as a writer. He did not have much money.\n\nDick died of a stroke. In 2007, he became the first science fiction writer to be included in The Library of America series (#173).\n\n\"The Man in the High Castle\" (1962) takes place in an different universe. There the United States is ruled by the Axis powers, who have won the Second World War. Many people consider it to be one of the important novels about a different view on history. It is the only Dick novel to win a Hugo Award. Philipkdickfans.com recommends this novel, along with \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and \"Ubik\" as an introductory novel to readers new to the writing of Philip K. Dick.\n\n\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" (1965) uses many concepts from science fiction. It has several layers of reality and unreality. It is also one of Dick’s first works to explore religious themes.\n\n\"The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch\" takes place in the twenty-first century. Under the supervision of the United Nations authority, mankind has colonized the solar system's every habitable planet and moon. Life is physically daunting and psychologically monotonous for most colonists, so the UN must draft people to go to the colonies. Most entertain themselves using \"Perky Pat\" dolls and accessories manufactured by Earth-based \"P.P. Layouts\". The company also secretly creates \"Can-D\", an illegal but widely available hallucinogenic drug allowing the user to \"translate\" into Perky Pat (if the drug user is a woman) or Pat's boyfriend, Walt (if the drug user is a man). This recreational use of Can-D allows colonists to experience a few minutes of an idealized life on Earth by participating in a collective hallucination.\n\n\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" is the story of a bounty hunter policing the local android population. It occurs on a dying, poisoned Earth. All \"successful\" humans have left, the only remaining inhabitants of the planet are people with no prospects off-world. Androids, also known as andys, all have a preset \"death\" date. However, a few andys seek to escape this fate and supplant the humans on Earth.\n\n\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (1968) is well known as the literary source of the influential 1982 movie \"Blade Runner.\" It is about the question \"What is real, what is fake? Are the human-looking and human-acting androids fake or real humans? Should we treat them as machines or as people? What important factor defines humanity as distinctly 'alive', versus those merely alive only in their outward appearance?\n\n\"Ubik\" (1969) uses big networks of psychics and a suspended state after death in creating a state of eroding reality. In 2005, \"Time Magazine\" listed it among the All-TIME 100 Greatest Novels.\n\n\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\" (1974) is about Jason Taverner, a television star living in a dystopic near-future police state. After being attacked by an angry ex-girlfriend, Taverner awakens in a dingy hotel room. He still has his money in his wallet, but his identification cards are missing. This is no minor inconvenience, as security checkpoints (manned by 'pols' and 'Nats', the police and National Guard) are set up throughout the city to stop and arrest anyone without valid ID.\n\nJason at first thinks that he was robbed, but soon discovers that his entire identity has been erased. There is no record of him in any official database, and even his closest associates do not recognize or remember him. For the first time in many years, Jason has no fame or reputation to rely on. He has only his charisma to help him when he tries to find out what happened to his past and avoid the attention of the pols.\n\n\"Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said\" was Dick's first published novel after years of silence. In these years, his critical reputation had grown, and this novel was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. It is the only Philip K. Dick novel nominated both for a Hugo and for a Nebula Award. \n\nIn an essay written two years before dying, Dick described how he learned from his Episcopalian priest that an important scene in the novel was very similar to a scene in the Book of Acts. Richard Linklater talks about this novel in his movie Waking Life, which begins with a scene reminiscent of another Dick novel, Time out of Joint.\n\n\"A Scanner Darkly\" (1977) is a bleak mixture of science fiction and police procedural novels. In its story, an undercover narcotics police detective begins to lose touch with reality. This is because he becomes a victim of the drug he should have fought against. This drug is called \"SubstanceD\". It permanently changes the mind of the people who take it. SubstanceD is instantly addictive. It starts with a pleasant euphoria. This feeling is quickly replaced with increasing confusion, hallucinations and eventually total psychosis. It was adapted to movie by Richard Linklater.\n\n\"VALIS,\" (1980) is perhaps Dick’s most postmodern and autobiographical novel. It looks at his own unexplained experiences. Some people also see it as his most academic work. It was made into an opera by Tod Machover. \"VALIS\" was voted Philip K. Dick‘s best novel at the website philipkdickfans.com.\n\nHis later works, especially the \"VALIS trilogy\", were heavily autobiographical.\n\nThe word \"VALIS\" is the acronym for \"Vast Active Living Intelligence System\"; it is the title of a novel. The theme can be found in at least three more novels. Later, PKD thought that VALIS was both a \"reality generator\" and a means of extraterrestrial communication.\n\nDick has had a big impact on modern philosophy. The things he wrote about postmodernity have been noted by many philosophers. Among them were Jean Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek. Žižek is especially fond of using Dick's short stories to articulate the ideas of Jacques Lacan.\nFor Baudrillard, Dick is the ultimate articulation of hyperreality:\n\"It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move \"through the mirror\" to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.\"\n\n", "id": "67314", "title": "Philip K. Dick"}

Each is at a different stage of development, yet the market is growing for many renewables. \n\nRenewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Both, modern renewables, such as hydro, wind, solar and biofuels, as well as traditional biomass, contributed in about equal parts to the global energy supply. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than US$ 214 billion in 2013, with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. \n\nRenewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits. In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.\n\nWhile many renewable energy projects are large-scale, renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas, where energy is often crucial in human development. Globally, an estimated 3 million households get power from small solar PV systems. Micro-hydro systems configured into village-scale or county-scale mini-grids serve many areas. More than 30 million rural households get lighting and cooking from biogas made in household-scale digesters. Biomass cookstoves are used by 160 million households. \n\nClimate change, pollution, and energy insecurity are significant problems and addressing them requires major changes to energy supply and use. Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio, as they contribute to world energy security, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and help to reduce greenhouse gases. Climate-disrupting fossil fuels are being replaced by clean, climate-stabilizing, non-depletable sources of energy:\nIn global public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies.\n\nEU member countries have ambitious renewable energy goals. In 2010, Eurobarometer polled the twenty-seven EU member states about the target \"to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020\". Most people in all twenty-seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further.\n\nAs of 2011, new evidence has shown that there are large risks associated with traditional energy sources, and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed. Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain. New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics, coal ash, and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies. Events at the Fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate many nuclear plants safely over the long term. Cost estimates for “next generation” nuclear units continue to climb, and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees.\n\n", "id": "67325", "title": "Renewable energy commercialization"}

It is best known for being where the Promenade Concerts were started by Robert Newman in 1895.\n\nThe Queen's Hall was built because London needed a new concert hall in the centre of the town. It stood in Langham Place, just next to where BBC Broadcasting House stands today. The Queen's Hall had seating for up to 3,000 people (including the orchestra). The arena (downstairs) had removable seating. The polished floor could be used for dancing. The acoustics of the hall were excellent. There was also a smaller hall, The Queen's Small Hall, which seated 500 people. This was used for chamber music. In later years it was used as a recording studio. The architect who designed the hall was Thomas Edward Knightley.\n\nThe first time The Queen's Hall was used was on 25 November 1893 when Newman gave a children's party in the afternoon. In the evening about 2000 ladies and gentlemen came to a concert given by the Band of the Coldstream Guards, which included vocal music, piano and organ solos. At 11.00pm the seats in the arena were removed and the dancing began. The official opening of the hall took place on 2 December. On 10 August 1895 the first Promenade concert was given with Henry Wood conducting.\n\nOn January 14, 1896, the first public movie show was given at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nThe seats were uncomfortable because there was not enough leg room, so in 1913 and 1919 some changes were made, after which the hall could seat 2400 people. \n\nFrom 1930 to 1941, the BBC Symphony Orchestra regularly gave broadcast concerts in the hall. Arturo Toscanini, who guest conducted the orchestra during the 1930s, made some famous recordings in the Queen's Hall in the late 1930s.\n\nOn 10 May 1941 (during the World War II) the Royal Choral Society gave a concert in the Queen's Hall with the London Symphony Orchestra. They performed Elgar's oratorio \"Dream of Gerontius\" under the conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent. It was the last concert ever given there because, later that night, the hall was completely destroyed by bombs. \n\nAfter the destruction of Queen's Hall, the BBC Symphony Orchestra moved its broadcast concerts and recording sessions to Bedford School. Among the great recordings made at the school was Sir Adrian Boult's recording of Elgar's second symphony. The Proms continued in the Royal Albert Hall. They also took place in Bristol and Bedford, but after the war they settled in the Royal Albert Hall where they continue today.\n", "id": "67333", "title": "Queen's Hall"}

It argued for the sovereignty of the individual states under the United States Constitution and against the Alien and Sedition Acts. The Virginia General Assembly adopted the Report in January 1800. The document primarily subtly amends arguments from the 1798 Virginia Resolutions. The main reason for making the Report was to answer criticisms that had been leveled at the Resolutions. The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the 1817 Bonus Bill Veto Message.\n\nThe arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832, when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state. Madison, however, rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice. Whether Madison's theory of republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.\n\nMadison, a member of the Republican Party, was elected to the Republican-dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799. A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually discussed together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials. Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.\n\nThe Virginia Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures, including those of New York, Delaware, and the five New England states. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, leading Virginia Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Sen. John Taylor of Caroline (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.\n\nJefferson, the leader of the Republican Party and then–Vice President, wrote to Madison in August 1799 outlining a campaign to strengthen public support for the principles expressed in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 (commonly referred to as \"the principles of '98\"):\n\nThat the principles already advanced by Virginia & Kentucky are not to be yielded in silence, I presume we all agree. I should propose a declaration of Resolution by their legislatures on this plan. 1st. Answer the reasonings of such of the states as have ventured in the field of reason, & that of the Committee of Congress. ... 2. Make a firm protestation against the principle & the precedent; and a reservation of the rights resulting to us from these palpable violations of the constitutional compact by the Federal government, ... 3. Express in affectionate and conciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister-states, and to the instrument & principles by which we are united; … fully confident that the good sense of the American people and their attachment to rally with us round the true principle of our federal compact. But determined, were we to be disappointed in this, to sever ourselves from that union we so much value, rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved, & in which alone we see liberty, safety & happiness.\nIn response to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello during the first week of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: \"From [this position] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [Madison's] judgment but because as we should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves.\" Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role \"in softening Jefferson's more extreme views.\"\n\nJefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at Montpelier on his way to Philadelphia, the national capital, for the winter session of the United States Congress. However, James Monroe, who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year, visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison, since another meeting between two of the most important Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment. The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison. Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified \"protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution\" as one of the four primary elements of the Republican Party plan.\n\nThe Assembly session began in early December. Once at Richmond, Madison began drafting the Report, though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery. On December 23, Madison moved for the creation of a special seven-member committee with himself as chairman to respond to \"certain answers from several of the states, relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session.\" The committee members were Madison, John Taylor, William Branch Giles, George Keith Taylor, John Wise, John Mercer, and William Daniel. The next day, Christmas Eve, the committee produced a first version of the Report. The measure came before the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, on January 2.\n\nThough certain to pass due to the Republican majority, which had recently been solidified by the election of a Republican clerk and speaker of the House, the Report was debated for five days. The main point of contention was the meaning of the third of the Virginia Resolutions:\n…this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it views the powers of the federal government, as resulting from the compact to which the states are parties; … and that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by said compact, the states who are parties thereto have the right … to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil…the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them.\nThis resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions. Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact. The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that it was the people themselves, acting through the states in their sovereign capacity, who were parties to the Constitution. The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40. At some point in the next two weeks, it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6.\n\nThe Report was received warmly by Virginia Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state, but there was not much public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.\n\nThe general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles in the Virginia Resolutions. The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures. Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution. Laying into the Acts in his Report, Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits. The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens. Contrary to the Sedition Act, the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack, beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen; indeed, such special intervention against the press was \"expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution.\" As well, Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional.\n\nTo remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to \"a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it.\" Freedom of the press was necessary, because \"chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.\" The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.\n\nMore generally, the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. This doctrine is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.\n\nIn defense of Virginia Republicans and the Resolutions, Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory, the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests, which states were surely entitled to produce. They were \"expressions of opinion, unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection.\" By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion, Madison tried to make clear that the Republicans were not moving toward disunion.\n\nThe Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Republican principles. Spencer Roane described it as \"the \"Magna Charta\" on which the republicans settled down, after the great struggle in the year 1799.\" Henry Clay said on the floor of the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800, above other documents, that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation. H. Jefferson Powell, a modern jurist, identifies three persistent themes of Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report: (1) a textual approach to the Constitution, (2) the compact theory, and (3) that caution, not trust, should characterize our approach to those who hold political power.\n\nIn more recent years, the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment. Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers' ideas on free speech. In the 1957 \"Roth v. United States\" opinion by William Brennan, Madison's Report is cited as evidence that \"the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well-being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth.\" Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include \"Thornhill v. Alabama\" (1940) and \"Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC\" (2000).\n\nIn modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights with regard to federalism and republicanism. According to Kevin Gutzman, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the \"radical southern states' rights tradition.\" However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-nullification Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of \"the people in each of the States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity.\" The state governments themselves, no less than the federal judiciary, possess only delegated power and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not.\n\nGutzman rejects Madison's gloss of the Report as a \"specious distinction,\" saying it is reasonable to read into the Resolutions and the Report an \"ominous challenge to federal supremacy.\" Drew McCoy, however, has argued that Madison indeed developed a moderate stance which stood between the nationalists and the pro-nullification camp. Koch and Ammon agree, stating that \"Nowhere in American political literature does there exist a more careful, precise and mature reiteration of the principles of republican self-government; and nowhere is it clearer that the intermediate existence of state governments between the people and the 'General Government' should function to prevent a totalitarian imbalance in any one center of authority.\"\n\n\n", "id": "67354", "title": "Report of 1800"}

One of the main streams is the Kinder River, which drops off the Western edge at Kinder Downfall. Plants on the plateau are mainly heather, with some mosses and bilberry. Bracken grows on the slopes around the plateau. The highest point is Kinder Low at .\n\nIt can be approached from the southeast up a steep track called Jacobs Ladder. It is crossed by the Pennine Way long-distance footpath which starts in nearby Edale. Several sections of the path have been surfaced with large stone slabs in this area, to try to minimise environmental damage to the delicate moorland ecosystem by the large number of hikers it attracts all year round.\n\nIn the 1930s, Kinder Scout was the scene of the first mass trespasses by ramblers (Sunday, 24 April 1932) protesting at the lack of public access to the open moorland in many parts of northern England, which were then kept for grouse shooting by the estates of a number of stately homes. Public rights of way were established later, and the 2000 Countryside and Rights of Way Act set a new legal framework in which the bulk of Kinder Scout is now \"Access Land\" where the public has a right to roam freely.\n", "id": "67378", "title": "Kinder Scout"}

Its size and unusually bright surface makes Vesta the brightest asteroid, and the only one ever visible to the naked eye from Earth. Vesta's astronomical symbol is .\n\nVesta was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers on March 29, 1807. He allowed the prominent mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to name the asteroid after the Roman virgin goddess of home and hearth, Vesta.\n\nAfter the discovery of Vesta in 1807, no asteroids were discovered for the next 38 years. During this time the four known asteroids were counted among the planets, and each had its own planetary symbol. Vesta was normally represented by a stylized hearth (). Other symbols are and . All are simplifications of the original .\nVesta is the second-most massive body in the asteroid belt. Vesta does have a different interior compared to its surface. It is in the Inner Main Belt, at a distance of about 2.50 AU. It is similar to 2 Pallas in volume (although it is not confirmed), but somewhat more massive.\n\nVesta's shape is close to the shape of a sphere by its own gravity, but the large concavity and lump at the pole (see 'Surface Features' below) did not fit the criteria from being considered a planet under the IAU. In any case, this resolution was rejected by the IAU membership and Vesta will continue to be called an asteroid. However, it is possible that Vesta may be listed as a dwarf planet in the future, if it is convincingly determined that its shape is from hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nIts rotation is actually fast for an asteroid (5.342 h) and prograde, with the north pole pointing in the direction of right ascension 20 h 32 min, declination +48° with an uncertainty of about 10°. This gives an axial tilt of 29°.\n\nTemperatures on the surface have been thought to be between about -20°C with the Sun overhead, dropping to about -190°C at the winter pole. Typical day-time and night-time temperatures are -60°C and -130°C, respectively. This estimate is for May 6, 1996, very close to perihelion, while details vary somewhat with the seasons.\n\nFor Vesta, there is a large collection of possible samples available to scientists, in the form of over 200 HED meteorites, giving insight into Vesta's geologic history and structure.\n\nVesta is thought to consist of a metallic iron-nickel core, above with a rocky olivine mantle, and a surface crust. From the first appearance of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (the first solid matter in the Solar System, forming about 4567 million years ago), a likely timeline is as follows:\n\nVesta is the only known intact asteroid that has been resurfaced in this procedure. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that there once were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been broken by impacts.\n\nSome Vestian surface features have been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and ground based telescopes, e.g. the Keck Telescope.\n\nThe most notable surface feature is a very large crater that is 460 km in diameter centered near the south pole. Its width is about 80% of the entire diameter of Vesta. The floor of this crater is about 13 km below, and its rim rises 4–12 km above the surrounding area, with total surface relief of about 25 km. A central peak rises 18 km above the crater floor. It is thought that the impact responsible blew up about 1% of the entire volume of Vesta, and it is likely that a group of smaller asteroids known as the \"Vesta family\" are the remains of this collision. If this is the case, then the fact that 10 km fragments of the Vesta family have survived bombardment until the present indicates that the crater is only about 1 billion years old or younger. It would also be the original site of origin of the HED meteorites. In fact, all the known V-type asteroids taken together account for only about 6% of the ejected volume, with the rest presumably either in small fragments, ejected by approaching the 3:1 Kirkwood gap, or perturbed away by radiation pressure. Spectroscopic analyses of the Hubble images have shown that this crater has penetrated deep through several distinct layers of the crust, and possibly into the mantle which is indicated by spectral signatures of olivine. Interestingly Vesta was not disrupted nor resurfaced by an impact of this magnitude.\n\nSeveral other large craters about 150 km wide and 7 km deep are also present. A dark feature about 200 km across has been named \"Olbers\" in honour of Vesta's discoverer, but it does not appear in elevation maps as a fresh crater would, and its nature is presently unknown, perhaps an old basaltic surface. It serves as a reference point with the 0° longitude prime meridian defined to pass through its center.\n\nThe eastern and western hemispheres show markedly different terrains. From preliminary spectral analyses of the Hubble Space Telescope images, the eastern hemisphere appears to be have a highly reflective, heavily cratered \"highland\" terrain with old, dusty rocks, and craters probing into deeper plutonic layers of the crust. On the other hand, large regions of the western hemisphere are taken up by dark geologic units thought to be surface basalts.\n\nVarious small solar system objects are believed to be fragments of Vesta caused by collisions. The Vestoid asteroids and HED meteorites are examples. The V-type asteroid 1929 Kollaa has been determined to have a composition akin to cumulate eucrite meteorites, indicating its origin deep within Vesta's crust.\n\nBecause a number of meteorites are believed to be Vestian fragments, Vesta is currently one of only five identified Solar system bodies for which we have physical samples, the others being Mars, the Moon, comet Wild 2, and Earth itself.\n\nThis is based on data from the Dawn probe which orbited Vesta in the asteroid belt for 10 months.\n\nVesta is the source of the HED meteorites, which are about 6% of all the meteorites which fall to Earth. These meteorites have pyroxene, which is a mineral rich in iron and magnesium. This has been matched exactly to the mineral signatures on Vesta's surface captured by Dawn's instruments.\n\nIts size and unusually bright surface make Vesta the brightest asteroid, and it is occasionally visible to the naked eye from dark (non-light polluted) skies. Recently, in May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989.\n\nAt that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It was visible in the constellations Ophiuchus and Scorpius.\n\nLess favourable oppositions during late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere still have Vesta at a magnitude of around +7.0. Even when in conjunction with the Sun, Vesta will have a magnitude around +8.5; thus from a pollution-free sky it can be observed with binoculars even at elongations much smaller than near opposition.\n\n", "id": "67404", "title": "4 Vesta"}

Guillaume Apollinaire wrote the program notes for the ballet \"Parade\", which was created for the Ballets Russes of Serge Diaghilev. This was a collaborative work by Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso and Léonide Massine. The program notes ran:\n\nThe movement grew out of Dadaism. This was, amid the horrors of World War I, a protest at the meaningless of civilised life.\n\nAt the same time the work of Sigmund Freud began to filter through, and affect the literary and art worlds. André Breton was trained in psychiatry, and during the war he worked in a hospital where he used Freud's methods on shell-shock patients. Not surprisingly, Breton influenced many writers and artists after the war.\n\nFreud's work placed emphasis on the subconscious mind, and its role in steering behaviour and emotion. His way of using free association, and dream analysis to get a clue to the subconscious was picked up by the surrealists. They painted dreamlike fantasies, and practised automatic drawing without sight: 'automatism'.\n\nIn 1924, Breton wrote a \"Surrealist Manifesto\", which defined surrealism as:\n\nBreton discussed his first encounter with the surreal, in a description of a hypnagogic state, in which a strange phrase inexplicably appeared in his mind: \"There is a man cut in two by the window\". This phrase illustrates Breton's view of Surrealism as two distant realities brought together to create a new, uncanny union.\n\nSurrealist works have an element of surprise: unexpected items are placed next to each other for no clear reason. Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost. The works are an artifact, and André Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. From the 1920s in Paris it spread around the globe. It influenced films such as the \"Angel's Egg\" and \"El Topo\".\n\nMax Ernst, Salvador Dali, Man Ray, André Masson, Joan Miró and Marcel Duchamp were some of the best-known surrealist artists.\n\nMan Ray made the first surrealist film: \"Return to reason\" (1923). Luis Buñuel and Dali made two well-known surrealist films: \"Un chien andalou\" (1929) and \"L'Âge d'or\" (1930). Jean Cocteau made three films, known as the \"Orphic Trilogy\": \"Le Sang d'un poète\" (1930), \"Orphée\" (1950) and \"Testament of Orpheus\" (1960), which includes a cameo appearance by Pablo Picasso.\n", "id": "67444", "title": "Surrealism"}

The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot. People with hemophilia lack proteins in the blood that make scabs and blood clots. A person with a small cut or internal bleed (bruise) could bleed to death. They do not bleed more than a normal person, but they bleed for much longer. The word comes from the Greek words \"haima\" (\"blood\") and \"philia\" (\"to love\"). To treat this, an affected person can get a blood donation from someone without hemophilia. The donor’s blood has the clotting proteins and can temporarily make a normal scab. 30% of hemophilia A and B cases are the first person in their family to have hemophilia which is the result of an unexpected mutation (this means that there is an unexpected change in the body).\n\nIt usually affects males. It is passed from mother to child through genes.\n\nThere are 3 types of haemophilia:\n\nHaemophilia A happens in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 male births. Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 20,000–34,000 male births.\n\nGenetic defects on the X chromosome affect males because they have only one X chromosome. In females, a recessive gene is usually masked by a normal gene on the other X chromosome. The Y chromosome does carry some genes, but far fewer than the X chromosome. Defects of this type are called \"sex-linked\" in genetics. There is no cure for this disease but there are different treatments available around the world.\n\nA person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac.\n\n", "id": "67488", "title": "Haemophilia"}

But it can also mean the scanning of books and making digital versions. A transcriber is a person who performs transcriptions.\n\nTranscription as going from sound to script must be distinguished from transliteration, which creates a mapping from one script to another that is designed to match the original script as directly as possible. \n\nStandard transcription schemes for linguistic purposes include the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and its ASCII equivalent, SAMPA. See also phonetic transcription\n\nIn this table IPA is an example of phonetic transcription of the name of the former Russian president known in English as Boris Yeltsin, followed by accepted hybrid forms in various languages. Note that 'Boris' is a transliteration rather than transcription in strict sense. \n\nThe same words are likely to be transcribed differently under different systems. For example, the Mandarin Chinese name for the capital of China is \"Beijing\" in the commonly-used contemporary system Hanyu Pinyin, and in the historically significant Wade Giles system, it is written \"Pei-Ching\".\n\nPractical transcription can be done into a non-alphabetic language too. For example, in a Hong Kong Newspaper, George Bush's name is transliterated into two Chinese characters that sounds like \"Bou-sū\" (布殊) by using the characters that mean \"cloth\" and \"special\". Similarly, many words from English and other Western European languages are borrowed in Japanese and are transcribed using Katakana, one of the Japanese syllabaries.\n\nAfter transcribing a word from one language to the script of another language:\n\nThis is especially evident for Greek loan words and proper names. Greek words are normally first transcribed to Latin (according to their old pronunciations), and then loaned into other languages, and finally the loan word has developed according to the rules of the goal language. For example, \"Aristotle\" is the currently used English form of the name of the philosopher\nwhose name in Greek is spelled (\"Aristotélēs\"),\nwhich was transcribed to Latin \"Aristóteles\", from where it was loaned into other languages\nand followed their linguistic development.(In \"classical\" Greek of Aristotle's time, lower-case letters were not used, and the name was spelled .)\n\nWhen this process continues over several languages, it may fail miserably in conveying the original pronunciation.\nOne ancient example is the Sanskrit word \"dhyāna\" which transcribed into the Chinese word \"Ch'an\" through Buddhist scriptures. \"Ch'an\" (禪 Zen Buddhism) was transcribed from Japanese (ゼン \"zen\") to \"Zen\" in English. \"dhyāna\" to \"Zen\" is quite a change.\n\nAnother complex problem is the subsequent change in \"preferred\" transcription.\nFor instance, the word describing a philosophy or religion in China was popularized in English as Tao and given the termination -ism to produce an English word Taoism.\nThat transcription reflects the Wade-Giles system.\nMore recent Pinyin transliterations produce Dao and Daoism.\n\n\n", "id": "67527", "title": "Transcription (linguistics)"}

The broad scope and geographical extent of wind farms in Texas is considerable:\n\n\"Wind resource areas in the Texas Panhandle, along the Gulf Coast south of Galveston, and in the mountain passes and ridge tops of the Trans-Pecos offer Texas some of the greatest wind power potential in the United States. Currently there are over 2,000 wind turbines in West Texas alone. Most of the new wind capacity added in the last two years has been in the Abilene-Sweetwater area. The Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center is the largest wind power facility in the nation with a total capacity of 735 MW. It is spread across approximately 47,000 acres in Taylor and Nolan County near Abilene.\"\nWind is a highly variable resource, but with proper understanding it can be readily incorporated into an electric utility's generation mix. Many areas contain areas with winds presently suitable for electric power generation. The number of commercially attractive sites will expand as wind turbine technology improves and development costs continue to drop.\n\nTexas farmers may lease their land to wind developers for either a set rental per turbine or for a small percentage of gross annual revenue from the project. This offers farmers a fresh revenue stream without impacting traditional farming and grazing practices. Although leasing arrangements vary widely, the U. S. Government Accountability Office reported in 2004 that a farmer who leases land to a wind project developer can generally obtain royalties of $3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year in lease payments. These figures are rising as larger wind turbines are being produced and installed.\n\nThe wind power industry is also creating thousands of jobs for communities and for the state. Wind technology and the various aspects of producing electricity from wind power can help to keep employment in Texas after the rigs stop producing oil.\n\nTerrorism and industrial accidents can be potential threats to the large, centrally located, power plants that provide most of Texas’ electricity. Should one of these plants be damaged, repairs could take more than a year, possibly creating power shortages on a scale that Texans have never experienced before. Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected.\n", "id": "67634", "title": "Wind power in Texas"}

He had married Neeltje Huisman, a fisherman's widow who already had 6 children. Shortly after the marriage, the oldest of Neeltje's daughters had a child of her own, and so at only 23 years old Dorus became known as \"Opa\" in Den Helder where he lived. Although the nickname began as a joke, Dorus soon started acting and looking like a grandpa, and from that time on he became primarily known by his nickname.\n\nDorus gained most of his fame as a result of his service to the Noord- en zuid-Hollandsche Redding Maatschappij (NZHRM), one of the two main Dutch lifeboat-societies at the time. The NZHRM would later become the Koninklijke Nederlandse Redding Maatschappij (KNRM).\n\nHowever his life-saving career began in 1872 before he joined the NZHRM, while acting as captain of his own boat. While at sea, he saved all 25 crew members of the barque \"Australia\" from drowning at sea. Because of this incident, Dorus gained a reputation as a rescuer, which preceded his joining the NZHRM as a volunteer. On the basis of his reputation, he was granted the position of coxswain upon joining the NZHRM without having to prove his qualifications. His rank of coxswain entitled him to immediately command his own boat and crew.\n\nAlthough Dorus joined the NZHRM as a volunteer, he worked so many hours that it precluded him from taking on other paid work. Dorus and all of his crew members received a sum for each trial and each service.\n\nDuring his nearly 30 years service with the NZHRM, Dorus saved hundreds of people from drowning at sea, becoming legendary long before his retirement. In the waters where he served, he saved such large number of people with such effectiveness that the survival statistics increased dramatically. At the end of his career, although he remained active, his role became more symbolic in nature. \n\nIn 1888, Dorus Rijkers met King William III of the Netherlands after rescuing sailors from the German barque \"Renown\". The King gave Dorus a gold medal of honor and smoked a pipe with him.\n\nIn 1911, Dorus retired at age 64, after which he received only a very small pension. He struggled to make ends meet by eating simple food and living plainly.\n\nDuring an October 1922 interview with Dr. L.A. Rademaker, editor of the Hague newspaper 'Het Vaderland', Dorus complained about his situation. He claimed that he had been forced to sell the gold medal of honour in order to buy himself a bicycle. The Helden der Zee Fonds 'Dorus Rijkers' (Dorus Rijkers Fund for the Heroes of the Sea) was created after Dorus' plight and that of other retired life-savers were chronicled in 'Het Vaderland'.\n\nIn April 1928, Dorus Rijkers died at the age of 81. He was given a funeral that was so grand that it resembled a state funeral in size and style. There was music, a big parade, thousands who came to pay their last respects including a large number of Marine Officers, also high ranking government officials, among them representatives of the Ministry of the Marine. The grandeur of his funeral showed the great public esteem in which Dorus was held at the time. Dorus Rijkers had become a national hero and was by far the most popular Dutchman of those years (according to a poll that surveyed many people in the Netherlands during the 1920s).\n\nThere is a very large statue in honor of all the Netherlands sea-rescuers, opened in 1935. This statue is sometimes mistakenly assumed to be in honor of Dorus. In fact, a separate, smaller statue of Dorus was erected in 1939 One of the rescue boats of the KNRM still carries his name with pride. Dorus is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest rescuers of all time.\n\n\n\n", "id": "67668", "title": "Dorus Rijkers"}

It was directed, co-produced, and co-written by James Cameron, and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Robert Patrick. It is the second movie of the series, the 1984 movie \"The Terminator\" was the first, and picks up ten years after the events of the first movie. It follows Sarah Connor, her 10-year-old son John, and a helper from the future (as in the first movie), as they try to stop Judgment Day, a day in the future when machines will start to kill all humans.\n\n\"T2\" was a good movie as audience and critics say. It had an impact on people, and is known by many to have had power in the genres of action and science fiction. The movie's visual effects include many discoveries in computer made special effects, marking the first use of natural human movement for a CG character and the first computer made main character.\n\nIn 1995, eleven years after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) killed the original Terminator that was sent to kill her with the help of kyle reese, two men arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029. The first is a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) identical to the one that Sarah first met, while the second is an unknown man (Robert Patrick).\n\nJohn Connor (Edward Furlong) is now living with foster parents. He has grown up being told by his mother that he would someday lead the human race to beat the machines. Sarah has changed a lot because since the first movie - being stronger in mind and body - making people think she is crazy, and so she is sent to a mental hospital - Pescadero State Hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, the Terminator and the unknown man both find John Connor in a shopping mall. Then, there is a twist: the unknown man is not the one who is ment to stop John getting killed, as the people watching thought so based on the first movie. The killing machine from the first movie is now the one ment to stop John getting killed, and the other man is another Terminator trying to kill John. When the good Terminator rescues John, he tells him what is happening. He is a Model 101, made by the future John Connor to act as the one to keep him from harm. The other Terminator is a T-1000, sent to kill him. It is made of mimetic polyalloy, or liquid metal, making it able to morph anyone or anything of equal size, except \"complex machines\" like \"guns and explosives\" because they \"have chemicals, moving parts.\" It can however form \"knives and stabbing weapons.\"\n\nWhen John learns that the T-1000 will copy Sarah and then kill her, he and the Terminator go to rescue her. Sarah is very afraid by it, but after seeing it fight off the T-1000, she accepts that they need its help. As they escape the city, the Terminator tells her about the future of Skynet, the supercomputer that will get rid of humans. He tells her about its maker, Miles Bennet Dyson (Joe Morton), who makes a learning computer that suddenly becomes self-aware on August 4, 1997. It begins learning very quickly, and on August 29, 1997, it launches nuclear missiles that kills most humans.\n\nSarah, John, and the Terminator arrive in the desert at her friend Enrique Salceda’s camp, who has kept an underground weapons stash in the event that the war does happen. Sarah plans to take John and flee over the line that is between the US and Mexico. While at the camp, she finds out that by killing Dyson, she can stop Skynet from being made, stopping the war with the machines. After she leaves, John and the Terminator figure out what she is going to do and take off after her. At Dyson's home, Sarah tries to shoot him with sniper rifle, but when she misses, she finds that she can not kill him up close in front of his family. When John and the Terminator arrive, they tell Dyson of the bad things that will happen of his research. They make sure he knows why they must break all the things to do with his chip idea, including the CPU and arm from the first Terminator.\n\nSarah, John, the Terminator, and Dyson break into the Cyberdyne building and find the parts from the first Terminator. While make bombs to blow up the rest, security tells the police who show up in force. When the SWAT team enters the building, they shoot Dyson quite a few times which really hurts him, he stays behind to press the button to blow the place up.\n\nThey leave in a SWAT van, with the T-1000 chasing them, first in a helicopter, then a liquid nitrogen truck. The truck crashes into a steel mill, this makes the tank to open and liquid nitrogen to spill all over the place, freezing the T-1000. Even though the Terminator breaks him into many small pieces by shooting him, they thaw and come back together. The T-1000 and Model 101 begin to fight hand to hand, with the T-1000 stabbing him through the power cell with a metal pole, switching him off.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67763", "text": "Geisha\n\nAnother common word to call geisha is Geiko (). This word was made in Kyoto, and it is what they are called there. Kyoto is the city where the geisha tradition is older and stronger. Becoming a professional geisha (geiko) in Kyoto usually takes five years of training.\n\nApprentice geisha are called \"\"maiko\"\" (). This name is made of the Japanese words (\"mai\") meaning \"\"dancing\"\" and (\"ko\") meaning \"\"child\"\". Maiko wear white make-up and kimono of many bright colors. Full geisha wear simpler kimonos, and only use white make-up at special times.\n\nThere are also geisha in other cities, but they are different. In Tokyo, becoming a full geisha takes from six months to a year. The Tokyo geisha apprentice is called \"\"han'gyoku\"\" () \"\"half-jewel\"\", or \"\"o-shaku\"\" (), \"\"one who serves (alcohol)\"\". Tokyo geisha are normally older than Kyoto geiko.\n\nModern geisha still live in traditional geisha houses called \"\"okiya\"\" (置屋) in neighborhoods named \"\"hanamachi\"\" ( \"\"flower towns\"\"). However, most older geisha who are successful have their own home. The elegant world that geisha are a part of is called \"\"karyūkai\"\" ( \"\"the flower and willow world\"\"). A famous geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, said this is because \"\"geisha is like a flower, beautiful in her own way, and like a willow tree, gracious, flexible, and strong.\"\"\n\nThe geisha are considered cultural icons of Japan.\n\nGeisha are more modern than many people think. There were some women who worked as artists before geisha appeared, since the Heian Period (794-1185); but the true geishas appeared much later. In 1589, Toyotomi Hideyoshi authorized the building of a neighborhood in Kyoto, closed from the outside with walls. It was called \"Shimabara\", and it was dedicated to pleasure. This included enjoying arts, drinking, and luxury prostitution. Courtesans (called \"oiran\" ) worked as expensive prostitutes, and attracted rich clients. Many artists also worked at the same houses, to entertain the clients with music, dancing and poetry. For a long time, these artists were men, and they called themselves \"\"geisha\"\" (\"artists\"), \"\"hōkan\"\" (\"jesters\") or \"\"taikomochi\"\" (\"drummers\", because they played the \"taiko\", a Japanese drum).\n\nLike many things in Japanese culture, the world of courtesans became very complicated. Every man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette, and only the very rich and noble could. For this reason, many tea houses (\"ochaya\") appeared outside Shimabara. At some of them, some women practiced cheaper prostitution, the \"\"sancha-joro\"\". However other women, who were called \"\"odoroki\"\" (\"dancing girls\"), acted as dancers and musicians. These women soon became very popular. They started calling themselves \"\"geisha\"\", like the male artists who worked at Shimabara. By about the year 1700, the female geisha became much more popular than the male ones. A few years later, almost all geisha were women.\n\nThe government made laws that geisha to work as prostitutes, and only gave them permission to act as entertainers. One of these laws said that they had to tie their \"obi\" ( sash) in the back, to make it harder for them to take their kimono off. Their hairstyle, make-up and kimono also had to be simpler than the oirans', because their beauty had to be in their art, not their bodies. Soon, the geisha became so much more popular than the oiran, that by the year 1750 all oiran had disappeared. Other new geisha neighborhoods (\"hanamachi\") were created in Kyoto and other cities.\n\nIn the 19th century, the geisha were in better position than common women, but they also had problems in Japanese society. Sometimes, poor people sold their daughters to the hanamachi tea houses. Some rich men, called \"danna\" (patrons) paid a lot of money to get personal attention from a geisha. Geisha could not marry anymore, so they could have a danna to pay for her expenses. Other men paid a lot of money to take the new girls' virginity (\"mizuage\"). But the reputation and respect for the geisha grew again in the Meiji Restoration, and even more after World War II. Important laws that protect them were created. Young girls could not be sold to the tea houses anymore, and the virginity of young geisha could not be bought. Since then, women only become geisha by their free will.\n\nMost of the activity of geisha today is located at the hanamachis of Kyoto (especially the Gion hanamachi) and Tokyo. In modern Japan, they are almost never seen outside of them. In the 1920s there were over 80,000 geisha in Japan, but today there are far fewer. The main reason is the introduction of Western culture. The exact number of geisha today is not known, but is estimated to be from 1,000 to 2,000. Most women who appear as geisha for tourists are in fact actresses dressed as maikos.\n\nYoung women who wish to become geisha now usually begin their training after finishing junior high school or even high school or college. Many women begin their careers as adults. Geisha still study traditional musical instruments like the shamisen, shakuhachi (bamboo flute), and drums, as well as traditional songs, Japanese traditional dance, tea ceremony, literature and poetry. By watching other geisha, apprentices also become skilled in the difficult traditions of dressing, make-up, and in dealing with clients.\n\nGeisha are often hired to go to parties and , normally at tea houses or at traditional Japanese restaurants (\"ryōtei\"). Their time is measured by the time it takes an incense stick to burn, and is called \"\"senkōdai\"\" (線香代, \"\"incense stick fee\"\") or \"\"gyokudai\"\" (玉代 \"\"jewel fee\"\"). In Kyoto the terms \"\"ohana\"\" (お花）) and \"\"hanadai\"\" (花代), meaning \"\"flower fees\"\", are used instead. The clients hire the service of geisha through the Geisha Union Office (検番 \"kenban\"), which takes care of the geisha's schedule and makes her appointments both for entertaining and for training.\n\nTraditionally, geisha began their training at a very young age. Although some girls were sold to become geisha as children, this was not normal practice in hanamachi with good reputation. Daughters of geisha were often educated as geisha themselves.\n\nThe first part of training is called \"\"shikomi\"\". In the past, when girls first arrived at the okiya (\"tea house\"), they were put to work as maids, or do everything they were told. The work was difficult, to \"make\" and \"break\" the new girls. The most shikomi of the house had to wait late into the night for the senior geisha to return from work, sometimes as late as two or three in the morning. During this stage of training, the shikomi went to classes at the hanamachi's geisha school. In modern times, this stage still exists, but it is not as hard as it was in the past. Now, shikomis become used to the traditions and dress of the \"\"karyūkai\"\" (\"\"flower and willow world\"\").\n\nWhen the apprentice became skilled in the geisha arts, and passed a final and difficult dance test, she was promoted to the second stage of training: \"\"minarai\"\". Minarai did not do the housework anymore. This stage also exists today, but is much shorter than in the past (only a month). The minarai learn in the field. They go to banquets and dance with the geishas, but they do not participate: they just sit, watch and learn from their \"onee-san\" (\"older sisters\"). Their kimono are more than even a maiko's, to do the talking for them.\n\nAfter a short time, the third (and most famous) stage of training begins, called \"\"maiko\"\". Maiko are apprentice geisha, and this stage can last for years. Maiko learn from their senior geisha and follow them around to every she does. The \"\"onee-san/imoto-san\"\" (\"\"older sister/younger sister\"\") relationship is very important. The onee-san teaches her maiko everything about \"working\" in the hanamachi. She will teach her the right ways of serving tea, playing the shamisen, and dancing, and everything about the art of \"Iki\" (see below). Maikos have to wear heavy white make-up, elaborate hairstyle, and have her lips painted almost all the time. Their kimonos and obi have more vibrant colors and richer embroidery than those of full geisha. Like the minarai, maikos do not charge as much money to go to parties or gatherings as a full geisha.\n\nAfter a period of only six months (in Tokyo) or five years (in Kyoto), the maiko is promoted to a full geisha and charges full price for her time. Geisha use kimono of fewer colors and only use make-up for work or dance, because she is more than a maiko, and the simpler style shows her own natural beauty. Geisha remain as such until they retire.\n\nGeisha must be very skilled at traditional Japanese music, dance, and poetry, because they use all these arts when they work. The art of make-up, hairstyles, and clothing are very important too.\n\nHowever, the most important principle of a geisha is called Iki. Iki started in the 18th century as a reply to the extravagant ways of the courtesans (\"oirans\") and those who liked their style. Oirans wore very elaborate clothes, make-up, and jewelry. Geisha preferred to be , and more intelligent. They created iki as a style that gave more importance to conversation and wit. Instead of working with sex, like oirans did and simple prostitutes do today, geisha try to be sexy. A geisha will flirt, , and joke with men, but always with art and elegance. Japanese clients know that nothing more can be expected. Men enjoy the illusion of that which is never to be. Geisha do not have sex with clients for money.\nGeisha give more importance to their reputation than prostitutes do, and they almost never enter a relationship with a client. Those that do generally act with care usually get married. Normally, when a geisha marries, she retires from the profession. The most important quality of a geisha is her trustworthiness, especially to Japanese clients. Anything that her clients do, or tell her, must remain a secret. Anything said or done at a tea house will remain anonymous.\n\nBecoming a geisha needs much discipline. A geisha believes she must be a work of art in herself. They work every day to improve, in everything they do. A geisha's movements, her way of walking, sitting, and talking are very important. Geisha are geisha all the time, even when they are not working, or at home. An example of this is the old custom of \"kangeiko\" (\"\"lessons in the cold\"\"). Until the early 1920s, apprentice geisha used to put their hands in icy water, and then go outside in cold weather to practice playing the shamisen until their fingers bled.\n\n\n", "id": "67763", "title": "Geisha"}

At first he thought of writing \"The Apostles\", but then he realized he would need more than a year to write it, so he composed an oratorio called \"The Dream of Gerontius\". When it was first performed it was not a success. This was because the orchestra and choir had only had two weeks to learn it and also because the conductor did not like Elgar's music anyway. Then it was performed in Düsseldorf in Germany and shortly afterwards in Westminster Cathedral, London. Both these performances were greeted with lots of applause. Elgar was given a doctorate (title of Dr) by the University of Cambridge and he was becoming famous. He started to work on \"The Apostles\", and it was performed in Birmingham in 1903.\n\nOriginally Elgar wanted to write three oratorios which would belong together. \"The Apostles\" is the first one, the second one became \"The Kingdom\" but the third one, which would have been about the Last Judgement, was never written.\n\nThe oratorio is about the disciples of Jesus and the way they react to the amazing things that Jesus does. There are six soloists: the narrator (who tells the story)- he has a tenor voice and also does the part of St John, St Peter (bass), Jesus (bass) and Judas (bass) and the two female singers: the soprano who is both the Blessed Virgin and the angel Gabriel, and the mezzo-soprano who is Mary Magdalene.\n\nSometimes \"The Apostles\" is criticized for not being a carefully thought out dramatic story. Elgar was more interested in what makes people behave in the way they do. He was particularly interested in the two sinners Mary Magdalene and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThe orchestra is very big. The music includes the call of the shofar. Often this is played on a brass instrument. There is a double choir and a small choir (semichorus).\n\nThe work is in two parts and seven sections, each played without a break. Elgar chose the words himself. He spent a lot of time looking at different translations of the Bible and combining sentences from several of the versions.\n\n\nUnlike \"The Dream of Gerontius\" which people did not like the first time they heard it, \"The Apostles\" was an immediate success with audience and critics. People were getting used to the kind of big oratorio that Elgar was writing. However, today \"The Dream of Gerontius\" is the most popular of Elgar's oratorios. \"The Apostles\" is a strange mixture of words from different parts of the bible, but it has some very beautiful music. Elgar often wrote the music first and then added the words afterwards.\n\nElgar uses leitmotifs in this work: melodies that are associated with particular people or ideas. He got this idea from Wagner. Some of the leitmotifs heard in \"The Apostles\" can also be heard in \"The Kingdom\".\n", "id": "67795", "title": "The Apostles (Elgar)"}

It is abbreviated kt or kn. It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI. It is used around the world in meteorology and for maritime and aviation purposes.\n\n1 international knot = 1 nautical mile per hour = 1.852 kilometres per hour exactly. This is based on the internationally agreed length of the nautical mile, as adopted by the US in 1954 (which previously used the US nautical mile of 1853.248 m), the UK in 1970 (which previously used the UK or Admiralty nautical mile of 1853.184 m) and other countries. This is the definition used in most, if not all, modern circumstances. Knot is sometimes used for the nautical mile itself, but this is incorrect.\n\nThe speed of a vessel relative to the fluid in which it travels is usually measured in knots. This may be referred to as 'boat speed', 'vessel speed' and, for aircraft, 'air speed'. The speeds of relevant fluids, such as tidal streams, river currents and wind speeds, are also usually specified in knots. Knots are then also used to describe the actual speed of a vessel over the ground (SOG) and for its rate of progress toward a distant point ('velocity made good' or VMG).\n\nOne (international) knot is the same as 1.852 kilometres per hour (km·h), and is approximately equal to the following:\n\n\nAlthough knots do not fit within the primary SI system, they are used for nautical and aviation use for navigational reasons, because the length of a nautical mile is almost identical to a minute of latitude. As a result, distance in nautical miles on a navigational chart can easily be measured by using and the latitude indicators on the side of the chart.\n\n\n", "id": "67804", "title": "Knot (speed)"}

It travels around to give concerts in many places.\n\nThe RPO was started just after World War II, in 1946, by the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. Beecham did not start to get his players together until three weeks before the first concert which took place in Croydon on September 15, 1946. Beecham was principal conductor until his death in 1961.\n\nWhen the orchestra toured the United States in 1950 they were the first British orchestra to visit America since the London Symphony Orchestra in 1912.\n\nBeecham controlled all the organization of the orchestra. After Beecham’s death, the orchestra was made into a self-governing group, like the other London orchestras. They went through some difficult years. In 1963 the Royal Philharmonic Society decided they would stop asking the RPO to play for their concerts, and in Glyndebourne, where the RPO had played for the opera since 1948, the London Philharmonic Orchestra became the resident orchestra instead. Sir Malcolm Sargent helped the orchestra to put on its own concerts at a cinema in north London.\n\nThe orchestra had made an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society about the concerts it would play. This meant it could call itself “Royal”. In the 1960s the work they were doing no longer allowed them to call themselves “Royal”, so in 1966 the Queen officially gave them the title “Royal”.\n\nIn 1992 the orchestra appointed Peter Maxwell Davies as associate conductor and composer of the RPO.\n\nOn April 7, 1994, the Royal Philharmonic had the honour of performing at the Vatican in the historic \"Papal Concert to Commemorate the Holocaust\" with Sir Gilbert Levine.\n\nThe RPO give a series of concerts in the Cadogan Hall, London, and in the Royal Albert Hall. They tour all over Britain and also abroad. In the period 2002-2007 they played in 30 different countries.\n\nThe orchestra made many recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1964 Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera \"The Rake's Progress\" with the RPO. From 1964 to 1979 they recorded many Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company.\n\nThe Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra is part of the same organization.

He went to school in Westminster School and studied at Christ Church, Oxford. He then went to the Leipzig Conservatory where he learnt to conduct by watching the great Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch. He sang in choral festivals and at the Leeds Festival of 1913, where he went to watch Nikisch conduct.\n\nDuring World War I he worked for the War Office, and while he was there in 1918 he planned a series of concerts with the London Symphony Orchestra, which included several important new British works including Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", \"A London Symphony\" by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Elgar's \"Symphony No. 2\". When Boult was a boy he had already met Elgar. Elgar now wrote to him and said he felt sure the future of his music was safe in Boult's hands. Boult was at the start of a great career in which he conducted a lot of 20th century British music.\n\nIn 1924 Boult became conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra—now the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra — and in 1930 he was made Director of Music at the BBC. When the BBC formed the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Boult also became its chief conductor, combining both jobs.\n\nBoult became famous for conducting a wide repertoire, including the very modern-sounding music of Arnold Schoenberg. In 1933 he married Ann Wilson, the ex-wife of the singer and administrator Steuart Wilson. The marriage lasted until Boult's death. Boult was knighted in 1937.\n\nDuring World War II the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated to Bristol. Even there it was not safe from the bombing and they moved again to Bedford.\nAfter the war the BBC started the BBC Third Programme and Boult was involved in many new plans for concerts and recordings.\n\nIn 1948, Steuart Wilson became Director of Music at the BBC. Some people were saying that the music on the BBC was not so good and that Boult ought to retire when he became 60 in 1949. He then became conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra with whom he made many recordings.\n\nBoult continued to conduct until he was very old. His many recordings, including music he had heard Nikisch conduct many years before. His last public performance was conducting Elgar's ballet \"The Sanguine Fan\" for London Festival Ballet at the Coliseum, in London on 24 June 1978. \n\nBoult was made a Companion of Honour in 1969.\n\nBoult wrote two books about conducting, \"Thoughts on Conducting\" and \"A handbook on the technique of conducting.\" He also wrote an autobiography: \"My Own Trumpet\" (the expression “to blow one’s own trumpet” means: “to boast about oneself). He also gave talks on the radio. He spoke in a very polite, formal style.\n\nBoult always conducted with a baton (conductor’s stick).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67821", "text": "Rings of Neptune\n\nThe planet Neptune has a dim planetary ring system which is made up of several separate rings and some \"ring arcs\". The \"rings arcs\" are part of the outer ring called the Adams ring and are not to be seen anywhere else. The ring \"particles\" (small parts) are unusually dark colored, and have large amounts of microscopic dust. Neptune has thirteen known moons. Four of them orbit the planet inside the outermost rings. \n\nThe rings around Neptune could not be seen from Earth with strong telescopes. The evidence that they were there was first seen when scientists were watching the planet as it passed between the Earth and a star. (When this happens, the light of the star is blocked. This is called \"stellar occulation\".) Scientists watched this happen 50 times, and on five of those times in the early 1980s they saw the star give a little \"blink\" just before or after the planet covered it. This meant that rings around the planet were blocking the light, but the rings were not complete.\n\nIn 1989 the unmanned spacecraft \"Voyager 2\" flew by Neptune. \"Voyager 2\" sent back pictures that gave most of the information that scientists now have about the rings of Neptune. The pictures also help scientists to know why the rings looked incomplete. Not only did the pictures give a closer view, but they also showed the rings in a way that cannot ever be seen from earth. From earth the rings are always seen with the light of the sun shining \"towards\" them. When the spacecraft went past the planet, it took pictures with the sun shining \"behind\" the rings, as well. Big \"particles\" in the rings looked dark against the sunlight, but all tiny dust \"particles\" (microscopic dust) shone brightly when the sun was behind it. This allowed the scientists to work out what the rings were made of, and how all the particles were arranged.\n\nAs better types of telescopes have been developed, scientists can now see some of the rings from earth. The brightness of Neptune makes it hard to see the rings, which are much dimmer and the faintest rings still cannot be seen, even with vey powerful telescopes.\n\nThe most famous of Neptune's rings is the thin outer Adams ring, although by comparison with the rings of the planets Saturn or Uranus, it is very hard to see. It was originally named as \"1989 N1R\". The reason that the Adams ring is famous is that it has a feature that has not been seen on any other planetary rings. These are three long narrow \"\"arcs\"\" which are much brighter and look more solid than the rest of the ring system. Each one spans from 4-10° of the whole ring. All the arcs are close to each other, spanning under 40° of longitude, only about 1/8th of the edge of the ring. It has been a puzzle to understand why the stuff in these arcs does not spread out evenly through the whole ring.\n\nThe three arcs have been named with French names \"Liberté\", \"Égalité\", and \"Fraternité\". These names came from the famous saying of the French Revolution, which translates into English as \"Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood!\". These names were suggested by the scientists who discovered them during \"stellar occultations\" in 1984 and 1985. \n\nFour of Neptune's 13 moons are inside the ring system. The one that is nearest to the Adam's ring is called Galatea. It is a lumpy mass of rock that orbits around the planet at about the same speed as the planet is rotating. It is about 1000 kilometers inside the ring. \n\nMany scientists now think that it is the effect of the moon Galatea that is causing the three arcs in the Adam's ring. The ring also has 42 wiggles, which are like waves 30 kilometers high. Scientists are able to use this information to work out the mass of the moon Galatea. . \n\nThe best photos that came back from Voyager 2 showed that there are clumps of particles in the rings, but no-one can tell whether they are made of fine dust, or if there may be bigger particles in the clumps as well. All of Neptune's rings have a lot of \"microscopic dust\" but particularly the arcs of the Adam's ring. Scientists know this because they looked very bright in the photos that Voyager 2 took with the sun shining behind them.\n\nThe Adams ring is very red. The background particles that make up the ring look twice as bright near the three arcs as they do on the side of the ring that is opposite the arcs.\n\nWith the arrival of the Hubble Space Telescope and adaptive optics ground-based telescopes the ring arcs have been re-examined several times, starting in July 1998.\n\nIn addition to the outer Adams Ring, the other ring arrangements in the direction of Neptune's surface are:\n\n\n\n\n\nVoyager pictures appear to also suggest a wide disc of scattered material extending inside of the 50,000 km radius which surrounds the Galle ring, but is difficult to tell apart from Neptune's brightness, and for this reason its existence is uncertain.\n\nThe rings are named after astronomers who made important discoveries to the study of Neptune.\n\nFour of Neptune's moons: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, and Galatea orbit inside the ring system.\n\n", "id": "67821", "title": "Rings of Neptune"}

These dates usually mark the beginning an the end of the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season went past these actual limits slightly. For example, Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December. The season was above average in activity. It had fifteen named storms and one of the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever recorded. The most season included storms called: Hurricane Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.\n\nHurricane Alex formed on July 31 off the coast of South Carolina. Alex quickly strengthened into a category 2. On August 3, Hurricane Alex came within 10 miles of North Carolina. Hurricane Alex turned northeast and dissipated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Because Hurricane Alex did not make landfall it only caused $2.4 million in damage and only 1 person was killed as a result of the hurricane.\n\nBonnie started as Tropical Depression Two while east of Barbados. Tropical Depression Two crossed the Windward Islands and died out shortly after. It became Tropical Depression Two again while it was south of Cuba. Tropical Storm Bonnie made landfall in the Florida Panhandle. Bonnie died out again after that. Bonnie left only about $1 million in damage and 4 deaths. \nFor the official forecasts, see:\nHurricane Charley was a strong hurricane that strengthened very fast. Charley also made landfall further south then he was supposed to. Charley left $16.5 billion in damage and 35 deaths. The damage caused by Charley made it the second costliest storm in U.S. history, only to Hurricane Andrew. This beaten by four other storms within 4 years, it was beaten by Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Wilma, then Hurricane Ike. That makes Charley the fifth costliest storm in U.S. history. \nFor the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Charley.\n\nDanielle was a category 2 hurricane of 2004. It started on August 13 in the far east Atlantic Ocean. The path took it over cooler waters, which caused Danielle to die on August 21.\nFor the official forecasts, see the NHC's archive on Hurricane Danielle.\n\nOn August 13 Tropical Depression Five formed. On August 14 it became Tropical Storm Earl. Tropical Storm Earl passed south of Grenada and became a tropical wave. It was no longer a tropical storm. Later on the remains became Hurricane Frank in the Pacific Ocean. See also 2004 Pacific hurricane season for information on Earl after it crossed oceans.\nFrances was one of the four hurricanes to have a major impact of the U.S. state of Florida. Frances made landfall near the same location Hurricane Jeanne would make landfall in about two weeks later. Frances caused about 101 tornadoes from Florida to Virginia. Frances killed 49 people and $12 billion in damage.\n\nGaston started as Tropical Depression Seven on August 27. It strengthened into a tropical storm. Later on it strengthened into a hurricane very shortly before landfall in South Carolina on August 29. On August 30 it moved back into the Atlantic Ocean. Gaston died on September 1, after killing 9 people and causing $120 million in damage. \n\nHermine started about 360 miles south of Bermuda. It moved west and became a tropical storm. Hermine moved quickly north and on August 31 made landfall in New Bedford, Massachusetts as a weak tropical storm. Hermine died on the same day after killing no one and causing little damage. \nHurricane Ivan was the strongest hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm formed as a Cape Verde-type hurricane in early September, and became the ninth named storm, the sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the year. Ivan reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the highest possible category and the only one of the season. At the time it was sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record.\n\nFor official forecasts see:\n\nTropical Depression Ten was the only depression of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Ten formed in the northeast Atlantic on September 7 and dissipated two days later, Tropical Depression Ten caused no affects to land.\n\nFor official forecasts, see the NHC's advisory archive on Tropical Depression Ten\nHurricane Jeanne was a deadly storm, especially to Haiti. The storm cause 3,035 deaths, about 3,006 were in Haiti alone. Hurricane Jeanne was also a costly hurricane. With $7 billion in damage makes it the 13th costliest hurricane in U.S. History. In Florida the hurricane made landfall in the same area as Hurricane Frances only two weeks before.\n\nFor official forecasts see:\n\nHurricane Karl was a strong category 4 that only affected the Faroe Islands. Karl formed in the middle of the Atlantic on September 16 as Tropical Depression Twelve. It became a tropical storm that same day. Two days later it became a hurricane and by September 21 it became a category 4 and soon reached it highest winds of 145 mph. It continued north weakening and then becoming extratropical on September 24.\n\nFor official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on Hurricane Karl.\n\nLisa was a category 1 hurricane, it remained weak for much of its early life. After almost 14 days it finally became a hurricane. Hurricane Lisa started on September 19 and died on October 3. \nFor official forecasts see the NHC's public advisory archive on Hurricane Lisa.\n\nMatthew was a weak tropical storm. It started in the Gulf of Mexico on October 8. Tropical Storm Matthew made landfall in Louisiana on October 10, and died on the same day. The storm caused $300,000 in damage.\nFor official forecasts see: \nSubtropical Storm Nicole was the only subtropical storm in 2004. Nicole formed on October 10 southwest of Bermuda. Subtropical Storm Nicole dissipated the next day.

It is an important part of the nitrogen cycle.\n\nNitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways:\n\nCyanobacteria are in most environments on Earth. They play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. Cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids. \n\nSeveral cyanobacterial strains are also capable of diazotrophic growth. Diazotrophs fix nitrogen from the air, an ability that may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archaean. \nCyanobacteria in coral reefs can fix twice the amount of nitrogen than on land—around 1.8 kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day. The colonial marine cyanobacterium \"Trichodesmium\" may fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen-fixation in marine systems on a global scale.\n\nPlants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae – with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They have symbiotic bacteria called \"Rhizobia\" in nodules in their root systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed \nnitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil. Most legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., \"Styphnolobium\") do not. In traditional farming practice, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or buckwheat (non-legume family \"Polygonaceae\"), which are often referred to as \"green manure\".\n\nAlthough most plants able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family Fabaceae, there are a few exceptions:\n\n\n\nAll these families belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a clade. In this clade, Fabales were the first lineage to branch off; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen was lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant. \n\nBiological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Hermann Hellnegel (18311895) and Martinus Beijerinck (18511931).\n\n", "id": "67960", "title": "Nitrogen fixation"}

Nitrogen is needed for life. It is an important part of proteins, DNA, and RNA. In plants, nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth. Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air (N) into forms that can be used by life. Most nitrogen fixation is done by microorganisms called bacteria. These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N with hydrogen gas (H) to make ammonia (NH). \n\nSome of these bacteria live in the roots of plants (mostly legumes). In these roots, they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates. Other plants take nitrogen compounds out of the soil through their roots. All nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants.\n\nAmmonium (NH) in soil is made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and decomposers, bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts. This process is called \"ammonification\". Ammonium has a positive charge. It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil. Ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals. Sewage and other waste-water is regularly measured because of this. If ammonia levels are too high, \"nitrification\" must happen. \n\nNitrification is the change of ammonia and ammonium to nitrite (NO) and then to nitrate ( NO) by bacteria. Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation. High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for babies and can cause blue-baby syndrome. High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools. This can be harmful to fish and other water animals because the algae uses oxygen that the animals need. The use of fertilizers is controlled more and more because of this. \n\nWhere there is no oxygen, some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas (N). This starts the nitrogen cycle over again. This process is called \"denitrification\".\n", "id": "67971", "title": "Nitrogen cycle"}

Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nIn the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies.\n\nIn 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the \"New Philharmonia Orchestra\". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\", conducted by Klemperer.\n\nThe orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since.\n\nKlemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008.\n\nToday, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nThe Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", and David Lean's film version of \"Oliver Twist\" (1948).\n\n\n\n", "id": "68002", "title": "Philharmonia"}

Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Judæo-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet.\n\nIn retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script).\n\nThis phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).\n\nSome of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary.

According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies.\n\nThe word \"pygmy\" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call \"all\" African Midgets.\n\nThe name \"pygmy\" comes from the Greek word (\"pygmaios\"). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. \"pygmaei\") came from this older Greek word.\n\nThe word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called \"Pygmies\" who lived in India and Ethiopia. \n\nThere are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons.\n\nThere are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are: \nSome research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall. \n\nPygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest.\n\nThere are a number of Pygmy groups living in Africa. The three best-known groups are the Mbenga, Mbuti, and Twa groups. Each big group includes several tribes that have their own language. \n\nThe Mbenga people, sometimes called the \"Ba-Mbenga\", live in the western Congo basin. The Mbenga include the Aka people, who speak the Aka language. The Aka live in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. The M-Benzélé people, or \"western Aka\", and the Ba-Sese people, \"eastern Aka\", are also related. \n\nOther Mbenga pygmies are the Baka people of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo. They speak three very similar languages: Baka language, Ganzi language, and Gundi language. Another group of Mbenga pygmies are the Gyele people. The Gyele live in Cameroon and speak Gyele language.\n\nThe Mbuti people, sometimes called the \"Bambuti\", live in the Ituri rainforest in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. They include the Efé people, Asua people, and the Kango people. The Efé speak the Efé language. The Asua speak the Asoa language. The Kango speak the Kango language.\n\nThe Twa people, or \"Ba-Twa\", live in Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda.

For Hindus, an Itihasa is a religious story that tells about what happened in the past. Itihasas are usually epic poems. The important itihasas to Hindus are the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. \n\nThe original meaning of Itiihaasa had a more precise connotation than the word History. The etymology attested to by Panini indicates itiha to mean ‘thus indeed, in this tradition’ . \nOne of the earliest references to Itihaasa in the literature of antiquity is in Chanakyas’s Arthashastra. Our investigations lead us to believe that the Maurya empire for which he was the preceptor began in 1534 BCE. He defines Itihaasa, in the context of the syllabus prescribed for training of a Prince, with the following words;\n\nपुराणमितिव्रुत्तमाख्यायिकोदाहरणं धर्मशास्त्रं चेतीतिहासः\nPuraana (the chronicles of the ancients), Itivrtta (history), Akhyayika (tales), Udaaharana (illustrative stories), Dharmashastra (the canon of Righteous conduct), and Arthashastra (the science of Government) are known by (comprise the corpus of Itihaasah, ) History\nKautilya’s Arthashastra, Book 1, Chapter 5\nThus, History in this definition takes on the meaning more akin to the sense of Historiography and is perhaps even more eclectic and appears to indicate a superset of political science and History as we use them today. We feel vindicated therefore in calling our forthcoming conference a conference on Indian History ( http://www.india-forum.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=2088), since we seem to ascribe the same broad meaning that Kautilya did 3 millennia ago.\n\nThe quintessential quote is that of Kalhana in the Rajatarangini,12th century CE (1147 to 1149 CE) who is regarded as a modern in Indian parlance\nधर्मार्थ काममोक्षाणामुपदेश समान्वितं ।\nपुरावृत्तं कथायुत्तरूपमितिहासं प्रचक्षते ।।\n“Dharmaartha-kaama-moskshanaam upadesa-samanvitam | \nPuraa-vrttam, kathaa-yuttarupam Ithihaasah prachakshate ||” \n\nHistory will be the narration of events as they happened, in the form of a story, which will be an advice to the reader to be followed in life, to gain the purusaarthas namely Kama the satiation of desires through Artha the tool, by following the path of Dharma the human code of conduct to gain Moksha or liberation. \nClearly there is an emphasis on the traditions and on the utilitarian aspect of History, embedded in the etymology of Itihaasa. The reason we draw emphasis to the ambiguity in the use of the word History is that, in our usage, while we adhere to the broader usage of the word History, it makes for clarity in usage if the Civilizational aspects are distinguished into distinct categories\n", "id": "68227", "title": "Itihasa"}

Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick are her cousins.\n\nWhitney began singing at a young age in gospel music at church, being influenced by her mother. She was described as having an impressive ranging mezzo-soprano voice. In 1983, she was discovered by an Arista Records representative and signed to the label.\n\nHouston released her first album, \"Whitney Houston\", in 1985. It featured the number-one singles \"Saving All My Love for You\", \"Greatest Love of All\", and \"How Will I Know\". Her second album, \"Whitney\", was released in 1987 and featured the number-one hits \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\" and \"So Emotional\". In 1990, her album \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" was released, and the song of the same name also reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, as did the single \"All the Man That I Need\". She sang the National Anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl and earned widespread praise for the performance. She starred in the film \"The Bodyguard\" in 1992 and performed several songs on its soundtrack, one of which was a cover of country singer-songwriter Dolly Parton's song, \"I Will Always Love You\". The song became Houston's biggest hit of her career and reached number one in countries around the world. Houston sat throughout much of the music video for \"I Will Always Love You\" because she was pregnant with her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. \"I Will Always Love You\" became the bestselling song by a female artist, with the soundtrack for \"The Bodyguard\" becoming the bestselling film soundtrack ever. She performed with singer-songwriter Mariah Carey on the song \"When You Believe\" for the film \"The Prince of Egypt\".\n\nHouston released albums \"My Love Is Your Love\", \"Just Whitney...\", and \"I Look to You\" in 1998, 2002, and 2009, respectively.

She is the most-awarded female artist of all time.\n\nHouston married Bobby Brown in 1992. In 1993, they had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. In a 2009 interview, Houston indicated the marriage was both passionate and turbulent. Their marital relationship was marred by drug use and by Brown's professional jealousy, psychological abuse, and physical confrontations. The couple divorced in 2007.\n\nOn the night of February 11, 2012, at the age of 48, Houston was found dead in her guest room at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The official coroner's report stated that she had accidentally drowned in the bath. Atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use were listed as contributing factors. Her funeral was televised.\n\n", "id": "68246", "title": "Whitney Houston"}

Scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the Moksha of Vedanta Hinduism and the Nirvana of Buddhism, but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically.

In the Otogizoshi, a collection of Japanese prose written in the Muromachi period, Tamamo-no-Mae was a courtesan under the Japanese Emperor Konoe. She was said to be the most beautiful and intelligent woman in Japan. Tamamo-no-Mae's body mysteriously always smelled wonderful, and her clothes never became dirty. Tamamo-no-Mae was not only beautiful, but she was very wise in all subjects. Although she appeared to be only twenty years old, there was no question that she could not answer. She answered every question posed to her, whether about music, religion, or astronomy. Because of her beauty and intelligence, everyone in the Imperial Court adored her, and Emperor Konoe fell deeply in love with her. \n\nAfter some time had passed, the Emperor suddenly and mysteriously fell ill. He went to many priests and fortune-tellers for answers, but they had none to offer. Finally, an astrologer told the Emperor that Tamamo-no-Mae was the cause of his illness. The astrologer explained that the beautiful young woman was in fact an evil fox with nine tails (kitsune), who was making the Emperor ill in a evil plan to take the throne. Following this, Tamamo-no-Mae disappeared from the court.\n\nThe Emperor ordered Kazusa-no-suke and Miura-no-suke, the most powerful warriors of the day, to hunt and kill the fox. After escaping from the hunters for some time, the fox appeared to Miura-no-suke in a dream. Once again in the form of the beautiful Tamamo-no-Mae, the fox told Miura-nosuke would kill it the next day, and begged for its life. Miura-no-suke refused.\n\nEarly the next day, the hunters found the fox on the Plain of Nasu, and Miura-no-suke shot and killed the magical creature with an arrow. The body of the fox became the Sessho-seki, or Killing Stone, which kills anyone that comes in contact with it. Tamamo-no-Mae's spirit became Hoji and haunted the stone.\n\nHoji is said to have haunted this stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu until a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by Hoji. Genno did a certain spiritual ritual, and begged the spirit to consider her spiritual salvation, until finally Hoji surrendered and swore to never haunt the stone again.\n\nIn Matsuo Bashō's famous book, \"The Narrow Road to the Deep North\" (Oku no Hosomichi), Bashō tells of visiting the stone in the Japanese prefecture of Nasu. \n\nTamamo-no-Mae's legend served as base for the noh drama \"Sesshoseki\" (\"\"The Killing Stone\"\") and the kabuki play \"Tamamonomae\" (or \"The Beautiful Fox Witch\").\n\n", "id": "68294", "title": "Tamamo-no-Mae"}

Sometimes people play the game by changing the way the imaginary robot is set up at the start to watch what happens. The Game of Life is a zero-player game because it changes without anybody playing (after the starting position is chosen). A different type of game lets two players set up imaginary robots to see which one is better.\n\nThe game is played on a grid of squares called \"cells\", each cell is black (alive) or white (dead). When people are playing the game, they start by making some dead cells alive. Then the alive cells can make other cells alive or dead because of the rules of the game. The rules are:\n\n\nThe way a player sets up the first alive cells starts the game. The first level (generation) is made by using the 4 rules. After the player is done changing the cells, they do the same thing all over again to make the next level. The game is over when all the cells are dead or all the cells are alive or the game is doing the same thing over and over. The Game of Life is Turing-complete.\n\nJohn Horton Conway made the Game of Life because he wanted to know if he could make an imaginary robot out of cells that would be able to get bigger. He combined lots of ideas in math to make the rules for the game. It is one of the first ever 'simulation games' which are games that represent things that happen in real life. It is important because when used in complicated math, it can look at many things like physics, biology, economics, and philosophy.\n\nPatterns are special things that happen in the game. Many different types of patterns happen, including static patterns where nothing changes between levels, repeating patterns where the cells that are alive and dead repeat, and patterns that move themselves across the board (\"spaceships\").

Pelagius believed that because people \"choose\" to sin, they are like criminals who need to be pardoned, \"not\" victims of an inherited sinful nature.\n\nPelagianism was condemned as heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 431.

It officially began as a church in 1954 in Seoul, South Korea. On October 12, 2009, it was announced that Sun Myung Moon was given the church to his sons, Moon Hyung-jin, Moon Kook-jin, and Moon Hyun-jin.\n\nThe Unification Church is a controversial organisation. Some people say it is a cult with bizarre features. For example, Sun Myung Moon's says he is the \"Savior, Messiah, Returning Lord\" and using a Senate office building for a coronation ceremony. He also said that his teachings have helped Hitler and Stalin be \"reborn as new persons\". Many countries have recognized the organisation as a religion for legal purposes. This means the Unification Church has to pay less taxes, or no taxes at all. \nSome doubt the organization's religious origins. Frederick Sontag, a professor of philosophy whose view of the church is no longer favorable has studied the Unification Church for 11 months. He concluded that \"one thing is sure: the church has a genuine spiritual basis.\" A German court made a similar finding.\n\nSome detractors have said that the church's main purpose is to advance Moon's political aspirations, such as the formation of a one world government.\n\nB. A. Robinson wrote:\n\nCritics point to irregularities in the use of money. They highlight the church's role in enriching Moon personally. The Moon family situation is described as one of \"luxury and privilege\" and as \"lavish\".\n\nNansook Hong lived with the Moon family for 14 years. She describes the Unification Church as \"a cash operation\". She also pointed out there have been questionable movements of money, for example: \"The Japanese had no trouble bringing the cash into the United States; they would tell customs agents that they were in America to gamble at Atlantic City. In addition, many businesses run by the church were cash operations, including several Japanese restaurants in New York City. I saw deliveries of cash from church headquarters that went directly into the wall safe in Mrs. Moon's closet.\"\nIn the 1990s, thousands of Japanese elderly people claimed to have been defrauded of their life savings by Moon followers' spiritual sales. Moon's church was the subject of the largest consumer fraud investigation in Japan's history in 1997 and number of subsequent court decisions awarded hundreds of millions of yen in judgments, including 37.6 million yen ($300,000) to pay two women coerced into donating their assets to the Unification Church.\n\nIn the United States in the 1970s, the media reported on the high-pressure recruitment methods of Unificationists and said that the church separated vulnerable college students from their families through the use of brainwashing or mind control.\n\nMoon dismissed these criticisms, stating in 1976 that he had received many thank-you letters from parents whose children became closer to them after joining the movement. (In 1977, Moon had a notice posted in all Unification Churches in America, mandating that all members write to their families no less than once every 10 days.)\n\nMoon and his wife were banned from entry into Germany and the other 14 Schengen treaty countries, on the grounds that they are leaders of a sect that endangered the personal and social development of young people. The Netherlands and a few other Schengen states let Moon and his wife enter their countries in 2005. In 2006 the German Supreme Court overturned the ban.\n\nCritics of the Unification Church have accused the organization of being closely involved with covert CIA-authored operations against communism in Korea during the 1960s. The Church is known to have been involved with weapon and munitions manufacturing in Korea since the 1960s, as documented in a 1978 United States Congressional Report on the Unification Church. The explanation given by Korean Unification Church members is that all manufacturers seeking to do business in South Korea were required to supply the military.\n\nSun Myung Moon's controversial religious and political Unification Movement, which includes not only the Unification Church but an enormous constellation of civic organizations, including the Washington Times Foundation, is allied politically with evangelical Christians such as Jerry Falwell and Tim LaHaye. Advocates adhering to this point of view have challenged the church's tax-exempt status in the US, arguing that the political activities of church-related groups comprise an impermissible intrusion of the church into political areas.\n\nIn her 1998 book \"In the Shadow of the Moons: My Life in the Reverend Sun Myung Moon's Family\", Nansook Hong, ex-wife of Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han's eldest son Hyo Jin Moon said that both Sun Myung Moon and Hak Ja Han told her about Sun Myung Moon's extramarital affairs (which she said he called \"providential affairs\"), including one which resulted in the birth of a boy raised by a church leader, named by Sun Myung Moon's daughter Un Jin Moon on the news show \"60 Minutes\". \n\nIn 1993, Chung Hwa Pak released the book \"Roku Maria no Higeki\" (\"Tragedy of the Six Marys\") through the Koyu Publishing Co. of Japan. The book contained allegations that Moon conducted sex rituals amongst six married female disciples (\"The Six Marys\") who were to have prepared the way for the virgin who would marry Moon and become the True Mother. Chung Hwa Pak had left the movement when the book was published and later withdrew the book from print when he rejoined the Unification Church. Before his death Chung Hwa Pak published a second book, \"The Apostate\", and recanted all allegations made in \"Roku Maria no Higeki\".\n\nAuthorities in Brazil and Paraguay have expressed concerns over the Church's purchases in recent years of large tracts of land in South America, ranging in the hundreds of thousands of acres.\n\nIn May 2002, federal police in Brazil conducted a number of raids on organizations linked to Sun Myung Moon. In a statement, the police stated that the raids were part of a broad investigation into allegations of tax evasion and immigration violations by Moon's organization. The Association of Families for Unification and World Peace was the target of the raids, which took place in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, and the personal residence of Moon's primary representative in Brazil, Reverend Kim Yoon-sang. As of 2008 no legal action has been taken by the Brazilian government resulting from their investigations.\n\nMoon has spoken vehemently against homosexual activity. In talks to church members he compared homosexuals to \"dirty dung-eating dogs\" and prophesied that \"gays will be eliminated\" in a \"purge on God's orders\". These statements were criticized by gay rights groups.\n\nB. A. Robinson of the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance wrote:\n\n", "id": "68388", "title": "Unification Church"}

The music got the label of 'salsa'. No-one really knows how this happened, but everyone recognised how good it was to have a label for it. Over time, salsa bands worked in other influences. For example, in the late 60s Willie Colon developed numbers that made use of Brazilian rhythms. N.Y. radio programmes offered 'salsarengue' as a further combination.\n\nThe question of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be heard. Later it became clear that salsa in New York was a bit different from popular music in Cuba. Also, Miami, Venezuela, Colombia and other places all had their own ideas. It now seems clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s, at any rate in New York. The reasons for this are also much disputed. It is difficult for any music which uses a foreign language to succeed in the biggest English-speaking market-place.\nSalsa as a dance can be seen in all the places mentioned.

The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son.

All three were created from Izanagi, when he washed his face to clean the dirtiness of Yomi, the underworld. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed out his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born from the washing of the right eye, and Susano'o from the washing of the nose.\n\nThe tales tell of great between Susano'o and his sister. When he was to leave Heaven forever because Izanagi ordered him to, he went to say goodbye to his sister. Amaterasu, suspicious, proposed him a challenge: each of them was to turn an object of the other's into people. Amaterasu created three women from Susano'o's sword while he created five men from her necklace. Amaterasu said the men were hers because they were born of her necklace. Susano'o destroyed her rice fields, threw a dead pony into her loom, and killed one of her assistants in anger. For this, Amaterasu, sad, angry and scared, went to hide inside Ama-no-Iwato, the \"\"heavenly rock cave\"\", so the Sun was hidden and the world became dark for along time.\n\nAmaterasu later was made to come out of the cave, but Susano'o was punished by being banished from Heaven. He came down to the province of Izumo, where he met an old couple. Seven of their eight daughters had been eaten by the eight-headed serpent Yamata-no-Orochi and it was about to come for the eighth, Kushi-inada-hime. After the couple promised their daughter's hand in marriage to Susano'o, he agreed to kill Orochi. With the help of eight bowls of \"sake\" (one for each head), Susano'o cut the head off the monster when it was sleeping.\n\nFrom one of Orochi's tails, Susano'o took out a sword, which he called \"Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi\" (\"Heaven's Cloud-Gathering Sword\"), later known as the \"Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi\". The sword was given to Amaterasu as a gift and was later given to her descendant Ninigi (the great-grandfather of Emperor Jimmu), with the \"Yata-no-Kagami\" (a mirror) and \"magatama\" (sacred jewels) as proof of his divine right to rule on Earth (the three Imperial Regalia of Japan).\n\nAmaterasu's shrine is at Ise Shrine, and Susano'o's is in Izumo, where he came down to Earth when banished from heaven.

Many historians thought that Lord Stanhope himself might have been from the house of Baden and that was why he was interested in Kaspar.\n\nOn 14 December 1833, Hauser was told to go to a garden where he would find out about the family he came from. When he got there he was attacked by a stranger who stabbed him in the chest. He managed to get home but died three days later.

Diocletian ended the period known as the Crisis of the Third Century (235–284). He worked to return Rome to its former glory by making changes in key areas.\n\nReligion: He persecuted Christians, crucifying more than any other emperor. He imposed the traditional polytheistic religion of the Romans.\n\nEconomy: Recognizing a gold drain from the western Mediterranean to the east, he tried to stop the inflation of the region by legislation. This did not work. He decreed that coins could only be made of gold or silver, stopping the trend of using lead in their creation. He made the tax system work better.\n\nMilitary: Diocletian changed the army from the traditional garrison defense. He put small outposts of soldiers on the border. He got local soldiers from the border regions along the Rhine and Danube rivers. These soldiers farmed and lived with their families in a village atmosphere. They lit signal fires on signal towers to warn other outposts of possible invasion by Germans from across the border. These outpost soldiers got regular pay from Rome for their services. He allowed soldiers to move up through the ranks by \"military credits\" earned by years of loyal service and by actions on the field of battle.\n\nDiocletian established a form of government known as the tetrarchy. In this, the Empire was organised into four parts, each ruled by a co-emperor. Diocletian took charge of the eastern empire. The senior co-emperor was Maximian Augustus, a fellow officer. He took charge of the western empire. Later, two junior co-emperors were added: Galerius and Constantius Chlorus.\n\nFinally, in 305, the two senior emperors abdicated and retired, and the two juniors rose to the rank of \"Augustus\". They in turn were supported by two juniors: Severus II in the west under Constantius, and Maximinus in the east under Galerius. In this way, the Tetrarchy showed how it could reproduce itself.\n\nThese men were from the Roman province of Illyria, several in the city of Sirmium, which would become one of the four capitals under this system. From the time of Domitian (81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian provinces had been the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.\n\nIn the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians came to dominate the army's senior officer echelons. Ultimately, the Illyrian officer class seized control of the state itself.\n\nThe four Tetrarchs based themselves not at Rome but in other cities closer to the frontiers, mainly intended as headquarters for the defence of the empire. They faced Persia and the Germanic tribes. Also, there were many tribes from the eastern steppe which presented at the Rhine and Danube.\n\nThe four centres are known as the 'Tetrarchic capitals'. Although Rome ceased to be the operational capital, it was still the nominal capital of the entire empire. It had its own Prefect of the City, an idea later copied in Constantinople. The four Tetrarchic capitals were:\n\n\n\n\n\nAquileia, a port on the Adriatic coast, and Eboracum (modern York, in northern England near the Scottish tribes), were also significant centres for Maximian and Constantius respectively.\n\nIn terms of regional jurisdiction there was no precise division between the four Tetrarchs, and this period did not see the Roman state actually split up into four distinct sub-empires. Each emperor had his zone of influence within the Roman Empire, but little more, mainly high command in a 'war theatre'. Each Tetrarch was himself often in the field, while delegating most of the administration to the hierarchic bureaucracy headed by his respective Praetorian Prefect, each supervising several Vicarii, the governors-general in charge of another new administrative level, the civil diocese. \nFor a listing of the provinces, now known as eparchy, within each quarter (known as a praetorian prefecture), see Roman province.\n\nIn the West, the \"Augustus\" Maximian controlled the provinces west of the Adriatic Sea and the Syrtis, and within that region his \"Caesar\", Constantius, controlled Gaul and Britain. In the East, the arrangements between the \"Augustus\" Diocletian and his \"Caesar\", Galerius, were much more flexible.\n\nDiocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government, and stabilized the empire economically and militarily. This helped the empire to remain intact for another hundred years, despite having seemed near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth.\n\nWeakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate the position. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split.\n\nMaximian attempted to return to power. Diocletian ordered him to step down permanently. Finally, Maximian was forced to commit suicide, and the tetrarchy began to unravel. Diocletian died in despair.\n\n", "id": "68686", "title": "Diocletian"}

After a brief and tumultuous year in power, a revolt by members of the Praetorian Guard compelled him to adopt the more popular Trajan as his heir and successor. Nerva died on 27 January 98, and was succeeded by Trajan without incident.\n\nAs a civilian administrator, Trajan is best known for his extensive public building program which reshaped the city of Rome and left multiple enduring landmarks such as Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column. \n\nEarly in his reign he annexed Nabataea (between the Arabian and Sinai peninsulas), creating the province of Arabia Petraea. His conquest of Dacia enriched the empire greatly - the new province possessed many valuable gold mines. His war against the Parthian Empire ended with the sack of its capital Ctesiphon and the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia. His campaigns expanded the Roman Empire to its greatest territorial extent. \n\nIn late 117, while sailing back to Rome, Trajan fell ill and died of a stroke in the city of Selinus.

When Endemol USA and NBC changed it to be shown in America in 2001, they changed the name to \"Fear Factor\". \"Fear Factor\" has many different versions which are shown in different countries. \n\nThe program has contestants compete against each other in a series of stunts. The person who finishes better and/or quicker than all the other contestants gets a prize of US$50,000. For the first five years the program was made, the contestants were usually three men and three women. Each person played for themselves. In the sixth year, the show changed. They started using four teams of two people. The members of each team had some relationship with one another, for example Father-daughter, Husband-wife, or friends. Each team played for a shared prize of the same amount. \"Fear Factor\" is hosted by comedian Joe Rogan and executive produced by Matt Kunitz. The main music for the program is composed and written by Russ Landau. Other music used on the show is made from rhythmic themes most notably taken from the popular game \"Half-Life\".\n\n\"Fear Factor\" was an attempt by NBC to compete with the successful series, \"Survivor\". The program was very popular for the network in the summer of 2001. It had strong ratings for the next couple of years, but in later years, the ratings were not as good.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68758", "text": "Fluorescent lamp\n\nA fluorescent lamp, is a type of electric light (lamp) that uses ultraviolet emitted by mercury vapor to excite a phosphor, which emits visible light. There are two general types, traditional fluorescent and compact fluorescent. This article is about traditional fluorescent lamps.\n\nThe purchase price of a fluorescent lamp is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output, and the light from fluorescent lamps looks different to light from incandescent lamps. Fluorescent lamps have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness. A fluorescent lamp can save over US$30 in electricity costs over the lamp’s lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp.\n\nAn electric current is applied to mercury vapor inside the tube, causing it to emit ultraviolet (UV) light. A phosphor on the walls of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light. This causes an electron to jump up to an orbital with a higher energy. When the electron drops back down to its normal orbital, the phosphor re-emits its energy as visible light.\n\nThe ballast prevents too much electricity from flowing through the tube. It also starts the lamp with a high voltage for a split second when it is switched on. The ballast is located inside the fixture in traditional fluorescent fixtures (in compact fluorescent bulbs is often in the base of the bulb). There are two types of ballasts, magnetic and electronic. Magnetic ballasts have mostly fallen out of use, as they are less efficient than electronic ballasts, they cause the bulb to flicker, and they do not start instantly. Electronic ballasts were at one time more expensive than magnetic ballasts, but now the price is about the same.\nThe average rated life of a fluorescent light bulb is 8 to 15 times longer that of incandescents. Fluorescent light bulbs typically have a rated lifespan of 7,000 to 15,000 hours, whereas incandescent lamps are usually manufactured to have a lifespan of 750 hours or 1,000 hours.\n\nThe lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors, including operating voltage, manufacturing defects, exposure to voltage spikes, mechanical shock, frequency of cycling on and off, lamp orientation, and ambient operating temperature. The life of a fluorescent lamp is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently. In the case of a 5-minute on/off cycle the lifespan of a fluorescent lamp can be reduced to \"close to that of incandescent light bulbs\". The U.S. Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes to avoid this problem. If the light must be switched on and off frequently, Cold cathode fluorescent lamps can be used. Cold cathode fluorescent lamps are designed for many more on/off cycles than standard lamps.\n\nThe mercury inside the tube is toxic and makes these bulbs hazardous waste. The bulbs must be taken to a recycling center after they stop working. During normal use, the mercury cannot escape, although it will escape if the bulb is broken. If a single bulb breaks, it is not usually a cause for concern. It is recommended to open windows to air out the room, and to clean up broken glass with duct tape instead of a vacuum cleaner.\n\nMany people and businesses do not want to use fluorescent lamps due to their mercury content. Halogen, LED, and traditional incandescent bulbs are possible alternatives.\n\n", "id": "68758", "title": "Fluorescent lamp"}

It was also the third named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. The stormed formed from a non-tropical system between Bermuda on Cape Cod, Massachusetts that developed on July 31 with good conditions for further development. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) and began to move quickly northeastwards into colder water temperatures. When convection began to decrease, the National Hurricane Center stopped sending out advisories on August 1 when Chantal began to turn into an extratropical cyclone. Later, the remnants moved over southeast Newfoundland, before moving into the Arctic Ocean.\n\nAn area of thunderstorm activity developed on July 28 about 100 miles (160 km) east of the Bahamas which was associated with a weak low pressure system. It moved north-northeastward, into poor environmental conditions which left the system disorganized. However, conditions then were forecasted to become better for development, and by July 29 the National Hurricane Center stated that it had \"potential for tropical or subtropical development.\" On July 30, the low passed to the west of Bermuda as it continued moving northeastward, under the effects of a large mid-latitude trough. The system contained an exposed low-level circulation, which from time to time passed under a thick area of convection to its northeast. By early on July 31, ship reports and QuikSCAT observations detected winds of 35 mph (55 km/h), and the center was well-involved enough with the convection for the National Hurricane Center to name it as \"Tropical Depression Three\" while it was located about 270 miles (435 km) north-northwest of Bermuda, or about 445 miles (710 km) south-southeast of Chatham, Massachusetts.\n\nBy six hours after development, the depression had of a somewhat exposed low-level center with deep convection taking up most of the northeastern semicircle. Located over sea surface temperatures of about 80º F (27º C), one forecaster said the depression had \"a small window of opportunity... for it to reach tropical storm strength before transitioning to an extratropical cyclone.\" The system organized further, and based on satellite pictures and QuikSCAT data, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chantal at 1215 UTC on July 31 while located about 330 miles (530 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. By three hours later the system formed a well-defined curved banding features, and Chantal reached maximum systained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) at 40.2º N. The storm speed up northeastward into an area of cold waters and cooler air, and early on August 1 the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on Chantal as it began extratropical transition.\n\nAfter becoming an extratropical cyclone, Chantal managed to keep scattered convection near its center, though its main area of convection and clouds moved to its north. On August 1, the cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland along the Avalon Peninsula, and by late in the day the extratropical remnants of Chantal were about 265 miles (425 km) northeast of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and moving northeastward at 44 mph (70 km/h).\n\nThe weather system that would later become Chantal began to affect Bermuda on July 30. It caused some thunderstorms. The next day, it caused heavy rainfall that reached r2.12 inches (53.8 mm) at the Bermuda International Airport. Winds on the island reached 45 mph (72 km/h) because of the weather system. After Chantal passed Bermuda, a ship with the call sign of \"C60Y4\" recorded winds of 37 mph (59 km/h).\n\nShortly after the system became a tropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Center of Canada sent out gale warnings for the waters off of Newfoundland. The Newfoundland Labrador Weather Office also issued warnings for heavy rain. \n\nIn the open ocean, waves from Chantal reached 20 feet (6 m) high. The storm also had effects on land. A wind gust of 54 mph (88 km/h) was reported. What was left of Chantal caused heavy rainfall in a short time in Newfoundland. In the province, rainfall peaked at 5.9 inches (150 mm) at Whitbourne. The rainfall caused flooding and also caused streets to wash out in several cities on the Avalon Peninsula. Several towns declared states of emergencies along the Avalon Peninsula.\n\n\n", "id": "68764", "title": "Tropical Storm Chantal (2007)"}

It is on the corner of Flinders and Swanston Streets next to the Yarra River in the middle of the city, stretching from Swanston Street to Queen Street and covering two city blocks. Each weekday, about 105,000 people and 1,500 trains use the station.\n\nIt is serviced by Metro's suburban and city loop services, and V/Line's regional services.\n\nThe first railway station in the Flinders Street site was called Melbourne or City Terminus, and was a collection of sheds. It was completed in 1854 and was officially opened on 12 September by Sir Charles Hotham. The terminus was the first city railway station in Australia, and the opening day saw the first steam train trip in the country. It travelled to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), over the Sandridge Bridge (which has now been redeveloped in 2006 as a pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Yarra River), travelling along the now light rail Port Melbourne line.\n\nMelbourne's two other early central-city stations, Spencer Street Station (now Southern Cross Station) and Princes Bridge, opened in 1859. Princes Bridge was originally separated from Flinders Street, even though it was only on the opposite side of Swanston Street. Once the railway line was extended under the street to join the two, Princes Bridge slowly became amalgamated into Flinders Street. Federation Square now occupies its site.\n\nIn 1882 the government decided to build a new central passenger station to replace the existing construction. A worldwide design competition was held in 1899, with 17 entries received. The £500 first prize went to railway employees J. W. Fawcett and H. P. C. Ashworth, whose design included a giant dome and clock tower. Work began in 1901 and ended in 1910.\n\nFlinders Street Station's platforms are numbered from north to south, with Platform No. 1 being the farthest north, and generally serve specific lines as follows.\n\nPlatform 1: Epping and Hurstbridge\n\nPlatforms 2 & 3: Belgrave, Glen Waverley and Lilydale\n\nPlatforms 4 & 5: Alamein, Blackburn trains on the Belgrave and Lilydale lines (both platform 4 only), Cragieburn, Sydenham, Upfield and Werribee\n\nPlatforms 6 & 7: Cranbourne, Frankston and Pakenham \n\nPlatforms 8 & 9: Sandringham and Williamstown (Peak Only)\n\nPlatforms 10 & 12–14: Various services, depending on day and time.\n\n\"Note that the eastern end of Platform No. 1 is designated as Platform No. 14, past the Platform 1 escalators.

At first there were 4 members, Hayley Williams, Josh and Zac Farro and Jeremy Davis. In 2009, Taylor York joined the band. Now there are 3 members - singer Hayley Williams, bassist Jeremy Davis, and guitarist Taylor York. They have released four studio albums: \"All We Know Is Falling\", \"RIOT!,\" \"Brand New Eyes\", and \"Paramore,\" and a live album: 'The Final Riot!' Their most successful album is \"RIOT!\". Their song \"Monster\" was used in 2011 for the 3rd \"Transformers\" movie. Paramore also released an EP called \"The Summer Tic\".\n\nParamore was originally formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee, United States. The members then were vocalist Hayley Williams, lead guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, and bassist Jeremy Davis. Later rhythm guitarist Jason Bynum joined. The name \"Paramore\" came from the name of their first bassist's mother. When they learned the meaning of the word \"paramour\" (it means \"secret lover\"), they decided to use the name under \"Paramore\" spelling.\n\nParamore went to Orlando, Florida to start working on their first album. Shortly after, Jeremy Davis left the band for personal reasons. Hayley Williams then wrote the song \"All We Know\" about his leaving. The band later decided to work the album around that idea, about someone that left something. The album artwork also describes that concept. Hayley Williams explains, \"The couch on the cover of \"All We Know is Falling\" with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space.\" Recording took three weeks, and promotional material for the album only used the four remaining members.\n\nBefore starting on tour, the band added bassist John Hembree. But soon, Jeremy Davis returned to Paramore after being asked by the band to replace Hembree.\n\n\"All We Know Is Falling\" released on July 24, 2005. Paramore also released \"Pressure\" as their first single. The music video for that song was directed by Shane Drake. The song had failed to get into the charts. In July, they released the second single, called \"Emergency\". In the music video, Hunter Lamb was their new rhythm guitarist, replacing Jason Bynum. The music video was directed by Shane Drake again. The third single, \"All We Know\", was released with the video made with live performances and backstage footage. The album reached #30 on the \"\" Heatseekers Chart. In 2007, Hunter Lamb left the band to get married.\n\nParamore started recording their second album, called \"Riot!\" in January 2007. In the recording process, guitarist Josh Farro played all guitar parts because Hunter Lamb's had left. Then Farro's asked their old friend, Taylor York, to joined the band as rhythm guitarist for touring. They released \"Riot!\" on June 12, 2007. \"Riot!\" entered the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 20 and the UK charts at number 24. The album sold 44,000 copies in its first week in the United States.\n\nThey called the album \"\"Riot\"\" because it meant \"a sudden outburst of uncontrolled emotion\". The first single from the album, \"Misery Business\", was released on June 21, 2007. Williams said, \"[the song was] more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically.\"\n\nThe second single from \"Riot!\" is called \"Hallelujah\". It was released on July 30, 2007. The single is only available on UK television and online. The music video features live performances and backstage footage, just like \"All We Know\". In August, Paramore was in New Found Glory's music video for their cover of Sixpence None the Richer's song \"Kiss Me\".\n\nThe music video for \"Crushcrushcrush\" was released on October 11, 2007, as the third single from Riot!. The music video of \"Crushcrushcrush\" featured Paramore playing the song in a desert being spied on by some people, and later crushed their equipment. The single was released in the United States on November 19. It was available in the United Kingdom on November 12, 2007. Hayley Williams did guest vocals for the songs \"The Church Channel\" and \"Plea\" for the Say Anything's album \"In Defense of the Genre\" that released on October 23, 2007.\n\nEarly in February 2008, Paramore started their Europe tour. However on February 21, 2008, they said that they had canceled some shows to fix their personal issues. Williams wrote on the band's website that \"the break will give that band a chance to get away and work out our personal issues\". MTV.com reported rumors of problems had started earlier in the month when Josh Farro expressed his anger against the media's focus on Hayley Williams. In the middle of those problems, Paramore recorded the music video for \"That's What You Get\", the album's fourth single. That was released on March 24, 2008.\n\nOn May 19, 2008, Paramore posted on their website to say they would be going on tour named \"The Final Riot!\" from July 25 to September 1.\n\nThe band had 2 songs in the soundtrack of the movie \"Twilight\".

The video premiered on November 3, 2008.\n\nOn November 25, 2008, Paramore released a live album named \"The Final Riot!\". The album has a bonus DVD with a full concert recorded in Chicago, and a behind the scenes documentary. On 9 of April 2009, \"The Final Riot!\" was certified gold in the US.\n\nParamore released their third studio album called \"Brand New Eyes\" on September 29, 2009. In this album Taylor York was already a member of Paramore. Paramore decided to named the album \"\"Brand New Eyes\"\" because it means \"seeing things from a whole new perspective\" after all the personal problems in the band. Williams said, \"Just trying to let go of whatever we might have struggled with the past and just see each other in a new way.\" They released 5 singles from this album. They are \"Ignorance\", \"Brick By Boring Brick\", \"The Only Exception\", \"Careful\", and \"Playing God\".\n\nOn December 18, 2010, Paramore posted on their official website that Josh Farro and Zac Farro had officially left the band. The post stated, \"...A couple of months ago, Josh and Zac let us know they would be leaving the band after our show in Orlando last Sunday. None of us were really shocked. For the last year it hasn't seemed as if they wanted to be around anymore. We want Josh and Zac to do something that makes them happy and if that isn't here with us, then we support them finding happiness elsewhere. But we never for a second thought about leaving any of this behind...\"\n\nOn December 22, 2010, Josh Farro post a response on his Blogger account, telling his version about his departure. The post that Josh wrote was entirely different from the band's post. He said that the band was no more than \"a manufactured product of a major-label.\" He also blame Hayley Williams for treating the rest of the group members as her solo project.\n\nOn February 2, 2011, Josh Farro confirmed that he is now in the new band called Novel American.\n\nOn March 21, 2011, Paramore said that they were about to entering a studio in Los Angeles with producer Rob Cavallo to record their next studio-album.\n\nIn January 2013, Paramore came back with a new album called \"Paramore\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "68777", "title": "Paramore"}

The singers stopped and the curtain came down. Hitler was very angry and said that Karajan would never conduct at Bayreuth again. This event may actually have helped his career after World War II. Many people who had worked for the Nazis and for Hitler were not allowed to work.\n\nDuring the war, in 1942, Karajan married Anita Gütermann. She was the daughter of a rich man who had a business making sewing machines. His wife was partly Jewish. This caused the Nazi’s to talk about whether Karajan should still be allowed to conduct. By 1944, he was not in favour with the Nazis, but he was still conducting in Berlin. He left Berlin and went to Milan, Italy with his wife in February 1945. Karajan divorced Anita in 1958.\n\nAlthough he was after the war because of his Nazi connections, he started to conduct again in 1946.\n\nKarajan gave his first concert after the war in 1946 in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic. He was banned again by the occupying Russians, but started conducting again the next year. \n\nKarajan gave many concerts with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna. He conducted at La Scala in Milan for the 1948-49 season. From 1947, he made many recordings with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London and the Vienna Philharmonic in Vienna.\n\nIn 1951 and 1952, he conducted again at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus where he changed the seating plan for the orchestra that had been since Wagner made it in 1876.\n\nIn 1955, after the death of Wilhelm Furtwängler, he was made artistic director (conductor) for life of the Berlin Philharmonic. From 1957 to 1964 he was artistic director of the Vienna State Opera.\n\nHe very often conducted the Vienna Philharmonic and gave many concerts at the Salzburg Festival. He continued to work very hard performing, conducting, and recording until his death in 1989. In Karajan's last years he left the Berlin Philharmonic after arguments with them, and concentrated on working again with the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic.\n\nHerbert von Karajan had very good musicianship and memory. He conducted without a score in front of him, very often with his eyes closed. He is remembered for being very strict (like a dictator) and always insisting on having things the way he wanted. There are many stories about him that show this. He insisted on being paid very high fees. When he was being filmed conducting an orchestra, he wanted the cameras to show him all the time. When he conducted Wagner at the Metropolitan Opera, he made the stand for the conductor higher so that the audience could see him.\n", "id": "68827", "title": "Herbert von Karajan"}

Many concerts are given in the Maltings. Every year the Aldeburgh Festival has many of its concerts there. The composer Benjamin Britten used to live in Aldeburgh with the singer Peter Pears. They started a music school for young people. The Britten-Pears Foundation still continues today, with many concerts based in the Maltings. This foundation gives young musicians a chance to learn from famous music teachers and perform at concerts. Many of them have recently graduated from a music college.\n\nThe buildings on the site are mostly from the 19th century. They are built on the banks of the River Ore. Originally they were built to make barley and beer. When the barley had been malted it used to be sent to London and exported to Europe. The Maltings closed during the 1960s. Since then the buildings have been restored and rebuilt to include the famous concert hall. It was opened in 1967, burnt down in 1969, and rebuilt in 1970. \n\nThe Holst Library is connected to the Maltings and is named in honour of Imogen Holst, the daughter of Gustav Holst, who was a close friend of Benjamin Britten and an artistic director of the Aldeburgh Festival from 1956 to 1977.\n\nThe concert hall is a place for concerts and many other community activities during the year. Aldeburgh Music have concerts in June, and in August the Snape Proms take place. These are concerts at which some audience can by cheap tickets and sit on the floor at the front.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68833", "text": "Ohm's law\n\nOhm's law says that in an electrical circuit, the current passing through a resistor between two points, is related to the voltage difference between the two points, and inversely related to the electrical resistance between the two points. This relation is shown in the following \nWhere I is the current in amperes, \"V\" is the potential difference in volts, and \"R\" is a constant, measured in ohms, called the resistance.\n\nCurrent is directly proportional to voltage loss through a resistor. That is, if the current doubles, then so does the voltage.\nTo make a current flow through a resistance there must be a voltage across that resistance. Ohm's Law shows the relationship between the voltage (V), current (I) and resistance (R). It can be written in three ways: \n\nVoltage is how much energy is between two points on a circuit. These two points have different charges, one is higher and the other is lower. The difference between these two points of the charge is how we measure the voltage.  The unit of “volt” is the name of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta who created the first chemical battery.  The letter “V” represents voltage.\n\nCurrent is how fast the charge is flowing. The higher the charge, the faster the current. Current has to do with electrons flowing in a circuit. Current measures how fast the electrons go. The unit of the current is “ampere,” and usually, a person writes it as “amps”. The letter “I” can represent as current.\n\nResistance is something to resist the flow of the charge, to make sure they not flow too fast and break the circuit. In a circuit, a light bulb can be a resistor. If electrons flow through the light bulb, then the light bulb will light up. If the resistance is high, then the light will be darker. The unit of resistance is “Ω”,  which is called omega, and pronounced “ohm”, it is the name of the inventor of Ohm’s law.\n\nCurrent, Voltage, and Resistance are related, which is call it “Ohm’s law”. Ohm defines the unit of resistance of “1 Ohm” as the resistance between two points in a conductor where the application of 1 volt will push 1 ampere, or 6.241×10^18 electrons. \n\nFor example, a scientist knows that the value of the voltage is 20V. He also knows the resistance, which is in the light bulb, is 10 Ω. He needs to find the other unknown variable, which is current. She can use the ohm’s law formula to solve it. With the two known variables, V(voltage) and R(resistance), the only variable left to find is I(current).\n\n20V= 10Ω * I\n\nI = 2A\n\nIn a problem, a scientist always gets enough information to solve the others values, the only thing a scientist has to memorize is the Ohm’s law formula. Then she uses it with what is given and solves for the unknown part. In the example above, the current is 2 amps. \n\n", "id": "68833", "title": "Ohm's law"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68838", "text": "Kamikaze\n\nKamikaze (Japanese: 神風; literally: \"\"god-wind\"\"; usual translation: \"\"divine wind\"\") is a word of Japanese origin. It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol ships in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion. In Western culture, the word \"kamikaze\" is used to mean the suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan, and their attacks on the ships of the Allied Powers in the final years of World War II, during which they flew their planes into enemy ships. It has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attack.\n\nMost people in Western culture believe the word \"kamikaze\" was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots, but that is not true. Their correct name was \"tokubetsu kōgeki tai\" (特別攻撃隊), which literally means \"\"special attack unit.\"\" This is usually abbreviated \"tokkōtai\" (特攻隊) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were called \"shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai\" (神風特別攻撃隊, \"\"divine wind special attack units\"\"). The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by mistake, and read the word \"shinpū\" (\"\"divine wind\"\") as \"kamikaze\", as those Japanese characters can be read both ways. The name became well known so, after the war, the Japanese also started using it.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Navy and Air force were defeated in several important battles, like Midway and the Philippine Sea. They lost many ships (including nearly all the Japanese aircraft carriers), hundreds of fighter aircraft, and many of their best pilots. The Japanese industry had little resources and was very poor compared to the American industry. For this reason, the United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly; but Japan could only make few, and of poor quality. During 1943-44, the Allied forces were moving towards Japan. At the Battle of the Philippine Sea, on June 19-20, 1944, the Japanese forces were pushed back to the Philippines.\n\nOn July 15, Saipan (in the Northern Mariana Islands) was captured by Allied forces. The capture of Saipan made it possible for the US Air force to attack Japan itself, using B-29 Superfortress bombers. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese commanders knew that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines next. The Philippines were very important because they were located between the oil fields of Southeast Asia and Japan. If Japan lost control over the Philippines, they would have little fuel left for their ships. On October 17, the Allies started the attack on the Philippines in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\nVice Admiral Takijiro Onishi was in charge of the Japanese Air Force in Manila. He understood that it was impossible to win the battle with so few aircraft and trained pilots. For this reason, he decided to form a suicide attack force, the Special Attack Unit. A group of 24 student pilots volunteered for the mission. The Special Attack force was organized into 4 groups, \"Unit Shikishima\", \"Unit Yamato\", \"Unit Asahi\", and \"Unit Yamazakura\". These names were taken from a patriotic poem (\"waka\" or \"tanka\"), written by the Japanese classical poet, Motoori Norinaga: \"\"Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana\"\" (敷島の 大和心を 人問はば 朝日に匂ふ 山桜花). The poem reads:\n\nThe Japanese were defeated at the battle of Leyte Gulf, but the Special Attack force had great success. The first \"kamikaze\" attack took place on October 21, 1944, against the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy, HMAS \"Australia\". 30 sailors died in the attack, including its Captain Emile Dechaineux, and many more were wounded. By October 26, 47 more Allied ships had been attacked. Most of them were badly damaged or sunk, like the United States aircraft carrier USS \"St. Lo\".\n\nThis early success convinced the Japanese commanders to continue the \"kamikaze\" attacks. Many more pilots were recruited to act as \"kamikaze\". Over the next few months, more than 2,000 planes made such attacks. When the Japanese stock of airplanes began to run low, new models of low quality were built for these missions. Some of them, like the Nakajima Ki-115 \"Tsurugi\", were made mostly of wood and used stocks of older engines. The plane's landing gear was usually dropped by the pilot after takeoff so it could be used by other aircraft, because he would not be landing again. Similar suicide attack programs were planned, including rocket bombs with pilots (called \"Ohka\") and submarine torpedoes (\"Kaiten\").\n\nThe high point of \"kamikaze\" attacks came from April 6 to May 25, 1945 during the Battle of Okinawa, in \"Operation Kikusui\" (\"\"floating chrysanthemums\"\"). In that time, seven important waves of attacks took place, with more than 1,500 \"kamikaze\" planes. Because their training had been too short and their airplanes were poorly made, \"kamikaze\" pilots were easy targets for the experienced Allied pilots, who also had much better planes. But still, the \"kamikaze\" who escaped the anti-aircraft fire and the enemy fighter airplanes did great damage to the Allied fleet. The Allies won the battle, but they lost many ships and men because of \"kamikaze\" attacks. By the end of the battle, at least 21 American ships had been sunk by \"kamikazes\". Some ships from other Allied navies were also sunk, and dozens more were damaged.\n\nHundreds of extra \"kamikaze\" planes were ready to defend Japan from invasion. However, with Japan's surrender on August 15 after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the declaration of war by the Soviet Union, they were never used again.\n\nThe most important effect of the attacks was creating fear among the Allied troops. When the American ships went to the last battles, the crews were very afraid of \"kamikaze\" pilots. By the end of World War II, the Japanese Navy had sacrificed 2,525 \"kamikaze\" pilots, and the Air force had lost 1,387. The Japanese government said, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195. They also claimed that the \"kamikaze\" attacks were the cause of 80% of Allied deaths in the last years of the War.\n\nThe American sources claim that \"kamikaze\" sunk less ships than the Japanese say. But still, they agree that they did very important damage. According to a U.S. Air Force source, the \"kamikaze\" attackers sunk 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. In a 2010 book, the historian Robin Rielly said that about 60 U.S. ships were sunk by kamikazes, and over 400 were damaged by them.\n\nMany \"kamikaze\" pilots offered themselves as volunteers for the mission. They were usually very young, between 18 and 24 years old. Their belief was that dying when striking the enemies of Japan and the Emperor down was a very honorable death. This principle was traditional since the days of the samurai, and gave great importance to the sense of duty and obedience. This idea was called \"Giri\" (\"\"Obligation\"\"), and was part of the code of conduct of the Japanese warriors since the Middle Ages, the \"Bushido\". Many young men sacrificed themselves by their free will because these beliefs and their love for the home land were the most important things for them. The \"tokkōtai\" pilot's manual told pilots to never close their eyes. This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would miss his target. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to shout \"\"Hissatsu!\"\" (\"\"Critical Strike!\"\") as loud as he could.\n\nHowever, many others did so because of social pressure. Not offering oneself as a volunteer was a sign of cowardice and dishonor. Several professional pilots who were ordered to do suicide attacks did it because of military obedience, not because of honor. One of the first \"kamikaze\" pilots, Lieutenant Yukio Seki, wrote after nearly being forced to volunteer:\n\nA special ceremony before going to combat usually took place. Pilots drank sake and ate a ball of rice. They were given medals, and a katana sword. They put on a headband with the rising sun, and a \"sennibari\", a \"\"belt of a thousand stitches\"\" made by a thousand women, who made one stitch each. Many times, they took prayers written by their families with them. According to legend, young pilots on \"kamikaze\" missions many times flew southwest from Japan over the 922 metre (~3000 ft) Mount Kaimon. Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see this, and said farewell to their country. Another legend says that \"kamikaze\" pilots dropped flowers from the air, as they departed on their final missions. Some places, like the hills near Kikajima airport, are said to have beds of cornflower that bloom in early May from those days.\n\nSome important military men who survived the war criticized the \"kamikaze\" plan years after. Saburo Sakai, a war time ace pilot said:\n\n\n", "id": "68838", "title": "Kamikaze"}

It was most popular in France, where its leaders included philosophers like Voltaire and Denis Diderot. Diderot helped spread the Enlightenment's ideas by writing the \"Encyclopédie\", the first big encyclopedia that was available to everyone. The Enlightenment grew partly out of the earlier scientific revolution and the ideas of René Descartes.\n\nThe Enlightenment's most important idea was that all people can reason and think for themselves. Because of this, people should not automatically believe what an authority says. People do not even have to believe what churches teach or what priests say. This was a very new idea at the time.\n\nAnother important idea was that a society is best when everyone works together to create it. Even people with very little power or money should have the same rights as the rich and powerful to help create the society they live in. The nobility should not have special rights or privileges any more. \n\nThese were very new ideas at the time. They were also dangerous thoughts for the people in power. Many Enlightenment philosophers were put in prison or were forced to leave their home countries.\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers of the United States believed the Enlightenment's ideas. For example, the idea that a government's job is to benefit all of a country's people - not just the people in power - was very important to them. They made this idea about a government \"for the people\" one of the most important parts of the new United States Constitution and the new American government they created.\n\nThe Enlightenment's ideas were also important to the people who fought in the French Revolution of 1789. \n\nIn some countries, kings and queens took some of the Enlightenment's ideas and made changes to their governments. However, they still kept power for themselves. These kings and queens were called \"enlightened despots.\" Examples include Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Gustav III of Sweden.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, as more and more people began to use reason, some began to disagree with the idea that God created the world. This caused conflicts - and, later, war. \n\nMany ideas that are important today were created during the Enlightenment. Examples of these ideas include: \nThe Enlightenment's ideas about thinking with reason, having personal freedoms, and not having to follow the Catholic Church were important in creating capitalism and socialism. \n\nImportant people in the Enlightenment came from many different countries and shared ideas in many different ways.

Finally, the Empire of Japan won the war. They signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895.\n\nThere were totally 65 warships in China before the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War. They were divided into four fleets (Beiyang Fleet, the Nanyang Fleet, the Guangdong Fleet and the Fujian Fleet). However, the Beiyang Fleet was the only fleet participated in the war. In order to save their ships, the other fleets' commanders were opposed to join the war.\n\nIn the Beiyang Fleet, there were 25 warships. Dingyuan and Zhenyuan were the most powerful warships in the fleet. Dingyuan had 6,000 horsepower and displaced 7,670 tons loaded. Nevertheless, as Empress Dowager Cixi wanted to build a grand garden she embezzled the money originally allocated for expanding the Beiyang Fleet, the commanders did not have enough money to buy the latest weapons for the fleet. Most of the warships in the fleet were not well equipped before joining the war.\n\nThere were totally 240,616 soldiers could be mobilized in Japan before the outbreak of the war. Also, there were 32 battleships and 24 torpedo boats in the Imperial Japanese Navy. All of them had the latest, and newest weapons.\n\n1. Battle of the Yalu River\n\nOn 17 September 1894, the Beiyang Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy fought at the Yalu River, the border between China and Korea. In this battle, the commander of the Beiyang Fleet was Ding Ruchang, originally a cavalryman, and Sukeyuki Ito was the commander of Japanese fleet. The battle lasted 5 hours. Finally, 4 battleships of the Beiyang Fleet was destroyed and 1,000 soldiers were killed. Only 1 battleship was lost in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The commander of the Beiyang Fleet retreated to the port of Lushun.\n\n2. Battle of Lushunkou\n\nOn 17 September 1894, the Japanese armies occupied the fortresses with powerful cannons and cities in Lushun and Dalian. The Japanese troops entered the cities and killed 20,000 Chinese civilians within 4 days. This incident was historically called Port Arthur massacre.\n\n3. Battle of Weihaiwei\n\nIn January 1895, the Japanese armies invaded Weihaiwei.

The next season was the Olympic season. Asada would be too young to compete at the 2006 Olympics. But the Japanese skating federation thought there was not a good reason to keep her at the Junior level when she had already won everything. Asada was old enough for the Grand Prix, but not for senior level ISU championships. Asada went into the Grand Prix without any of the pressure that was on the other skaters who were old enough to go the Olympics and were trying to qualify for spots on their country's Olympic team. Able to compete without pressure, Asada won the Grand Prix Final in December 2005.\n\nFollowing her win, the Japanese skating federation petitioned the International Olympic Committee to make an exception to the age rule for Asada, claiming that depriving her of a chance to compete at the 2006 Olympics would be denying a medal contender a chance to compete. However, this petition, even if it had worked, would have been too late. Other skaters had been effected by the age rule. The South Korean skating federation, for example, held Kim Yu-Na back in juniors for the 2005-2006 season, even though she could have competed successfully on the Grand Prix, because she also was not old enough for the Olympics, and because of it did not earn a spot to the Olympics at the Olympic Qualifying Competition in the fall of 2005. Asada had been a force in Japanese skating for many years, so the federation could have petitioned for an exception years earlier. There had previously been a loophole in eligibility rules regarding the World Championships and medalling at the World Junior Championships, but that loophole had been closed years earlier, and it had never applied to the Olympics.\n\nInstead, Asada went to the World Junior Championships again, where she lost to Kim Yu-Na.\n\nIn 2006-2007, Asada's first season being old enough for senior Worlds, she won the silver medal at the World Championships behind fellow Japanese skater Miki Ando.\n\nMao Asada is known for her amazing flexibility.

Originally, it meant speaking in a public place for or against a person or a proposal. In ancient Greek, Latin, French and English, an orator spoke for and against the accused in courts, and for or against big political decisions, such as whether to go to war. Gradually, it came to mean someone who spoke in public on formal occasions. \n\nOratory, or rhetoric, is the skill of argument or persuasion used by orators. The invention of printing allowed books to be multiplied and produced cheaply. This has made it possible for orators to do their persuasion in print as well as speaking. Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill are good examples of how orators in the 20th century used media such as radio and film where once they could only use speech. Both wrote books which sold in large numbers, though Churchill's books were about more than politics. Today television and newspapers play a vital role in deciding elections; the web less so.\n\nOther types of orator are those who wish to change beliefs. Religious preachers like Martin Luther and John Knox changed religion in western Europe; William Wilberforce and Sojourner Truth led the fight against the evil of slavery. Emmeline Pankhurst, Martin Luther King Jr and others fought to get equal rights for all citizens.\n\nWe have orators today as much as the ancient Greeks did. The main difference is that the Greeks could see and listen to them face to face, but we rarely do today. \n\nThe study of how persuasion is done by orators is called rhetoric. It has been studied for 2,500 years at least, and there are a huge number of books about it. \n\n", "id": "68985", "title": "Orator"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68988", "text": "Parsifal\n\nParsifal is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner. Wagner took most of the story from a medieval poem \"Parzival\" by the German poet Wolfram von Eschenbach. It was the last opera that Wagner completed. He started thinking about it in 1857 but did not do much work to it until after he had finished the cycle of four operas known as the Ring Cycle which was produced complete in 1876 in the special theatre (Festspielhaus) he had built in Bayreuth. Wagner composed his opera \"Parsifal\" so that it would suit the sound of this new theatre. It was first produced in 1882. The story is related to the Arthurian legends.\n\nWagner did more than any other composer in the 19th century to change the way that people listened to opera. In the 18th century people went to the opera house and sat in their boxes to chat to other people and be seen. Composers wrote operas with big arias which allowed the singers to show off their skills and make the audience applaud. \n\nWagner changed all this. He soon developed operas in which there is no difference between recitative (where the story is told) and arias (big songs for the soloists). The music of his later operas, especially \"Parsifal\", is like a long, continuous line with rich, Romantic harmony. The music develops logically, with leitmotifs (musical ideas which represent particular people or ideas) which help the music and the story to develop.\n\nThe story of Parsifal and the Holy Grail has survived in several forms that date from between 1170 and 1220. Wagner, who always wrote the words of his operas himself, used a mixture of several of these versions of the story to fit his ideas for the opera. Parsifal is a young man who is a “pure fool”, which means that he is an innocent, good man who slowly starts to understand the world. The Holy Grail is the cup from which Jesus Christ is supposed to have drunk at the Last Supper. The Holy Spear is the spear which is supposed to have been the one with which the Roman soldier pierced Jesus’ side when he was put on the cross. The Holy Grail and the Holy Spear are sacred relics (things from the past) which have been given to Titurel and his band of Christian knights to look after. Titurel has built a castle, Montsalvat, high up on the forest rocks, to guard them. In particular, he has to watch out for Klingsor who lives nearby. Klingsor is a magician who has a garden full of beautiful flower-maidens. These maidens are in his power. One of them is Kundry. She has already been made to several young knights to Klingsor’s power. Even Titurel’s son, Amfortas, could not resist the lure of Kundry. His spear was taken from him and he was badly wounded before being rescued. At the beginning of the opera he is lying in pain. The only thing that could heal the wound would be the touch of the Holy Spear which Klingsor now has, and the only person who could get that spear back again is a “pure fool”, a young man who knows nothing about the evil of the world and who can resist the beauty of the flower-maidens.\n\nThe opera starts with an orchestral prelude (Wagner does not call it an “overture”). When the curtain rises Gurnemanz, one of the senior knights, wakes up two sleeping servants. They kneel and pray as King Amfortas is brought down on his bed to the forest lake to bathe his wound. Kundry arrives, dashing in on her horse, looking for something to heal the wound (when Kundry is away from Klingsor she is not in his power. She feels that it was her fault that Amfortas was wounded. When Kundry is not in Klingsor’s power she is actually a faithful messenger of the Grail).\n\nSuddenly a wounded swan (a bird that is sacred to the knights of the Grail) falls dead at Gurnemanz’s feet. The swan had been killed by Parsifal. He did not know that it was a wrong thing to do, but when the knights capture him he realizes his and he breaks the arrow. The knights ask him his name, but Parsifal says he does not know his name or where he comes from. Suddenly the knights realize that Parsifal is the pure fool they need who can capture the Holy Spear.\n\nThe scene changes. The knights take communion. Amfortas is in terrible pain but has to do his duty in the ceremony. When the Holy Grail is shown it sparkles brightly in the hall. The knights sink to their knees. Only Parsifal does not seem to understand the meaning of it all.\n\nThe scene is Klingsor’s magic garden by his castle. Kundry has been summoned by him is now quite different: she has no power of her own, and is controlled and tormented by Klingsor. Klingsor notices Parsifal, whom he is expecting, approach from the distance, and sends his magical knights to fight him, expecting them to be defeated by Parsifal. The flower-maidens, the wives of the knights, see Parsifal and call him by his name. No one has ever called him by his name before. When one of them kisses his lips he suddenly realizes what it is he has to do. He now remembers everything that has happened in Act I and understands its meaning. He throws the maiden to one side. Klingsor appears and throws the spear at Parsifal, but magically it stops over Parsifal’s head. Parsifal grabs it and makes the sign of the cross. The castle is destroyed, the gardens disappear, and he goes off back to the Grail.\n\nAfter a journey which takes him many years Parsifal comes back to the Grail forest. Gurnemanz is now very old. Kundry works for the knights. Parsifal himself is dressed as a black knight. Kundry recognizes him, but Gurnemanz does not. He is annoyed that an armed stranger should come on this holy day (it is Good Friday). Parsifal throws the spear into the ground, puts down his weapons and takes off his helmet. Gurnemanz realizes who it is. He helps him to dress like a knight of the Grail. Kundry washes his feet and dries them with her long hair. Gurnemanz blesses Parsifal’s head. Parsifal is now a knight of the Grail, and he baptizes Kundry. Titurel has just died, and Amfortas, still in terrible pain, comes out to uncover the Grail. Parsifal enters and touches the wound with the point of the spear. Amfortas’s pain changes to happiness, the shrine is opened, the Grail is surrounded by light. The knights kneel down, Kundry dies peacefully. All is forgiven. The music finishes with a climax based on the leitmotifs of the Holy Grail and the Sacrament.\n\nUntil 1903, the Bayreuth Festspielhaus was the only place where Wagner’s opera \"Parsifal\" was allowed to be performed. In 1903, the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. Soon, it was being performed in other places as well. \n\nWagner like to describe \"Parsifal\" as \"ein Bühnenweihfestspiel\" (\"A Festival Play for the Consecration of the Stage\"). At Bayreuth, it has become tradition that there is to be no applause after the first act of the opera.\n\nThe conductor of the first performance was Hermann Levi, the court conductor at the Munich Opera. Wagner objected to Parsifal being conducted by a Jew (Levi's father was in fact a rabbi). Wagner first suggested that Levi should convert to Christianity, which Levi declined to do. Wagner then wrote to King Ludwig that he had decided to accept Levi. This despite the fact that (he alleged) he had received complaints that \"of all pieces, this most Christian of works\" should be conducted by a Jew. The King expressed his satisfaction at this. He said that \"human beings are basically all brothers\". Wagner wrote to the King that he \"regard[ed] the Jewish race as the born enemy of pure humanity and everything noble about it\".\n\n", "id": "68988", "title": "Parsifal"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68991", "text": "Tropical Storm Erin (2007)\n\nTropical Storm Erin was the second tropical cyclone to make landfall on the United States in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. It was also the fifth named storm of the season. Erin formed in the Gulf of Mexico on August 14 from an area of convection which was becoming stronger. It became stronger and changed into a tropical storm the next day, and on August 16 Erin made landfall near Lamar, Texas and was able to not die as it moved over land across Texas before moving towards the north into Oklahoma. The storm killed at least 17 people and made an already-severe flooding problem in Texas even worse. Another different storm that Erin went into killed at least 18 people.\n\nOn August 9, an area of convection formed just south of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure. The system moved west-northwestward, and by August 10, the system had a broad surface trough with a little shower activity. Convection increased on August 11, and by August 12 the contact between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the area resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas. Upper-level winds slowly became more helpful for development, and on August 13 a large low pressure area formed about 90 miles (145 km) north-northeast of Cancún, Quintana Roo. Late on August 14, a NOAA Hurricane Hunters plane that flew into the system reported a small circulation center, but at the time was not well-defined enough to begin tropical cyclone advisories. However, deep convection was kept near the increasingly organizaing center, and at 0300 UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center named it as Tropical Depression Five about 425 miles (685 km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.\n\nIn the overnight hours after formation, the storm was disorganized with a shabby and abstracted center of circulation. Located to the south of a mid to upper-level ridge over the southern United States, the system moved to the west-northwest into an area ideal for further strengthening; an upper-level anticyclone formed over the central Gulf of Mexico, and sea surface temperatures along its track were warm. The cloud pattern became better organized, keeping a large area of convection with curved rainbands and well-established outflow. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Erin at 1530 UTC on August 13 about 250 miles (400 km) east of Brownsville, Texas. As it continued northwestward, Erin remained disorganized and was not able to strengthen above minimal tropical storm status. At 1200 UTC on August 16 the cyclone made landfall near Lamar, Texas as it weakened to tropical depression status. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center stopped giving out advisories on Erin as warning responsibility was switched to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.\nSlowly moving northwestward through Texas, Tropical Depression Erin managed to keep an area of convection near the center, with its widespread, but scattered rainbands dropping moderate to heavy precipitation. By August 17, the winds decreased to 20 mph (30 km/h), with higher gusts. The system turned to the north-northeast on August 18, while heavy bands of thunderstorms continued to spin around the center of Erin. Early on August 19 after entering Oklahoma, Erin suddenly re-intensified to maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) a short distance west of Oklahoma City. The Norman, Oklahoma National Weather Service remarked the intensification \"[resulted] in what amounts to an inland tropical storm;\" at 0930 UTC the system showed an eye-like feature and a spiral rainband, and produced wind gusts of over 80 mph (130 km/h). However, a few hours later, the system began weakening again, and late on August 19 Erin degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as the circulation dissipated over northeastern Oklahoma. The low continued into southeastern Kansas before dissipating, feeding moisture northward toward a frontal system extending from the Midwestern United States through the Mid-Atlantic States. Its remnant mid-level circulation then moved eastward across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia before losing identity as it moved out into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nInstantly after Erin become a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center gave out a tropical storm watch from Freeport, Texas to the United States/Mexico border; at the same time, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch southward to Rio San Fernando. Shortly before achieving tropical storm status, the watch in Texas was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Late on August 15, the warning was extended to San Luis Pass, while the watch in Mexico was cancelled. As Erin made landfall, the warnings was cancelled, and several flood watches and warnings were given out for counties across southeastern Texas. Upon moving into Oklahoma, flood and flash flood warnings were issued for several counties.\n\nGovernor of Texas, Rick Perry activated the National Guard and moved emergency personnel to the areas expected to be affected by the storm. Erin is expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 from widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), because of fears of Erin disturbing oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil supplies.<ref name=\"oil futures 8/15\"></ref> As a result of the threat from the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188 workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.\nBy midday on August 15, rainbands with gusty winds began affecting the Texas coastline. As it made landfall, the storm created heavy rainfall near and to the or northeast of its path, reaching 11.02 inches (280 mm) at a station in Lockwood. The passage of the storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or go beyond flood levels. Across southeastern Texas, the cyclone generated several funnel clouds, and near Iah a EF0 tornado was reported. Wind gusts from Erin were fairly weak across the state, peaking at 35 mph (55 km/h) at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39 mph (63 km/h) at Jamaica Beach. While moving onto land, the storm produced a small storm surge peaking at 3.22 feet (0.98 m) at Pleasure Pier, which caused minor beach erosion.\n\nIn Clear Lake City, heavy rainfall broke down a part of a grocery store roof, killing two workers. The precipitation caused moderate flooding across eastern parts of Harris County; over 400 homes and 40 businesses were flooded. Flooding across the Greater Houston area briefly stopped the METRORail and closed several state roads. One person drowned after driving into a retention pond. Several people needed rescue assistance, and in Comal County a car accident killed three people. The movement of the storm temporarily left about 20,000 electrical customers without power, though most outages were quickly restored. In San Antonio, one body was found from a creek and another died after driving into a flooded road and was swept into a drainage ditch in which four others survived. In Sisterdale, two people were killed when they were swept away stalled over Sister Creek In Taylor County, near Abilene, flooding killed one person and forced the evacuation of about 2,000 people.\n\nAfter its unexpected redevelopment over Oklahoma, heavy damages were also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded from the effects of heavy rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were flooded. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82 mph (131 km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, also with about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.\n\nOne person was found to have drowned in a cellar in Fort Cobb, and another drowned in Kingfisher. Another storm-related death took place in Seminole. Three others were found dead after a weather-related automobile accident also near Carnegie. Another automobile accident-related death took place in Okmulgee County but it is not sure if Erin is to blame there.\n\nAlthough its surface circulation had dissipated, its upper circulation remained unbroken and created a burst of rainfall early on August 20. The 11.94 inches/303.3 mm that fell at Miller became the wettest Missouri rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone, or its remains, since at least 1976. One person died in Sleeper when he drove into flood waters which had swept away a bridge he was trying to navigate onto. Nine water rescues happened along the Interstate 44 passageway, which was most effected by Erin's rainfall.\n\n\n", "id": "68991", "title": "Tropical Storm Erin (2007)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69032", "text": "Biellmann spin\n\nThe Biellmann spin is a spin in figure skating. It is performed on one foot. The free leg (the leg not on the ice) is pulled up from behind and pulled above the head. The knee is bent slightly and the back is bent backwards into the spin. This forms a teardrop position with the body. In the classic version of the spin, both arms are used to hold up the leg. A slightly changed version has one hand on the skate and the other hand on the arm holding up the skate. A change can be made in that one hand can be dropped. If the hand holding up the spin is on the same side of the body as the leg, the spin is referred to as a \"one-hand Biellmann spin\", because the spin is being performed with one hand. If the hand holding up the spin is on the opposite side of the body as the leg, the spin is referred to as a \"cross-grab Biellmann spin\", because that hand has to \"cross\" the body to \"grab\" the skate.\n\nThe spin has also been said to look like a \"tulip on a turntable\". It is one of the most iconic figure skating moves. Along with the layback spin, the Biellmann is used in advertisements and icons representing figure skating. The position is also used in spiral sequences.\n\nNo one knows who invented the spin. Cecilia Colledge of Great Britain performed a one-handed Biellmann spin in 1937. There is a famous photograph of her doing the spin at the 1937 World Figure Skating Championships. Tamara Moskvina of the Soviet Union performed the spin at the 1965 European Championships and there is a famous photo of her doing it as well. Both Janet Champion and Slavka Kohout of the United States performed this spin early on.\n\nThe spin is named after Swiss skater Denise Biellmann, who popularized the move. Biellmann performed the spin beginning in the 1970s, having learned it from her teammate, fellow Swiss skater Karin Iten. Biellmann performed the spin on her way to becoming World Champion and the spin was officially named for her. It is the only figure skating spin officially named after a skater in International Skating Union regulations.\n\nThe classic positions is explained above. This position is often entered into through a layback spin. The free leg of the layback is grasped by one or both hands and brought up above the head.\n\nIrina Slutskaya of Russia is officially credited with inventing the \"change foot Biellmann spin\". She performs the Biellmann on one foot, then drops her free leg and performs the spin on her other leg.\n\nA \"half-Biellmann spin\", also called the \"catch-foot camel spin\", is a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is grasped in a camel spin position and brought up above the head, but the upper body is not lifted into the teardrop position.\n\nMany skaters have performed a Biellmann variation in which the free leg is brought down towards the face, with the knee bent inwards. This spin has mostly been performed by Junior-level or Junior-age skaters, because this is easiest to perform before puberty. It is unknown who invented this variation. It was performed by Naomi Nari Nam at the United States nationals in 1999. More recently it has been brought back by Junior level skaters including Caroline Zhang of the United States who performed the spin on her way to winning the 2007 World Junior title.\n\nAs well, Zhang and other Junior skaters are known for doing a \"hyper-extended\" Biellmann spin in which the leg is pulled straight up in the air and the back bent as far into the spin as possible. Zhang is able to perform the spin with her free leg pulled straight up into the air, making the spin look like a capital-I. This position is not original to Zhang, but she has been the one to popularize it.\n\nBecause of Code of Points, the Biellmann spin has been used too much in competitions. Many skaters would perform the spin even if they were not flexible enough because it was a good way of getting a lot of points. The International Skating Union has limited the number of Biellmann spins that can be performed in a single program.\n\nThe spin is almost entirely performed by women, and it is a common feature in most Junior and Senior level ladies programs, as well as being a position for ice dancing lifts. It is generally not performed by men because most male skaters are not flexible enough to perform the spin. The most famous male skater to perform the spin is Evgeni Plushenko. However, he has not done it in competition since 2003. Shawn Sawyer has also performed the spin at the Junior level. Recently, the spin has been performed in competition by Ryo Shibata of Japan and Eliot Halverson of the United States.\n\n", "id": "69032", "title": "Biellmann spin"}

It is also referred to as sponging, spanging (short for \"spare-changing\") or (in American English) panhandling.\n\nIn larger cities, it is common to see beggars who ask for money, food, or other items. Typically, beggars often beg for spare change using coffee cups, mugs, small boxes, hats, or other items into which monies can be placed and sometimes display signs with messages such as \"Help me. I'm homeless.\"\n\nA 2002 study of 54 panhandlers in Toronto reported that of a median monthly income of $638 CAD, those interviewed spent a median of $200 CAD on food and $192 CAD on alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs. The Fraser Institute, however, criticized this study. They said there were many forms of begging including ones in which good money can be earned. They also said that panhandlers' reports were not reliable \n\nBecause of this, some people say that it would be better to give the beggars gift cards or food/service vouchers, instead of money.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69099", "text": "College of Arms\n\nThe College of Arms, in London is one of the few remaining government heraldic authorities in Europe. It was founded in 1484 by King Richard III, and its job is to control heraldry and grant new \"armorial bearings\", sometime called coats of arms.\n\nThe college is run by the Kings of Arms, heralds and pursuivants who handle heraldic affairs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on behalf of the Queen. (Scotland has its own heraldic authority: Lord Lyon King of Arms and his office.) \n\nThe college also grants arms to citizens of other Commonwealth countries that do not have their own heralds. (Canadians use Canadian Heraldic Authority and South Africans have the Bureau of Heraldry)\n\nAs well as designing and granting new arms, the College tries to answer many requests from people trying to prove that they are descended from an \"armigerous\" (arms-bearing) person; a person descended in the male line (or through heraldic heiresses) from an armiger may be reissued that ancestor's arms. Special marks called difference marks can be added make the coat of arms different from the arms of their cousins. The college is involved in genealogy and have many pedigrees (family trees) in their records. Anyone may register a pedigree with the college, where they are carefully checked and need official proofs before being altered.\n\nHeralds were originally messengers. Officers of the College of Arms still sometimes read Royal proclamations in public, for example at the accession of a new sovereign. \n\nThey also help plan state ceremonies, such as coronations, the introduction of new peers into the House of Lords, and the ceremonies of orders of chivalry. \n\nFor these public appearances, the officers of the college wear costume showing their place in the Royal Household, either simple red livery or the herald's traditional colourful outfit of a tabard emblazoned with his master's arms (in this case the royal arms).\n\nThe College of Arms is on Queen Victoria Street in the City of London, not far to the south of St. Paul's Cathedral. The site was given to the college when it was re-formed by Philip and Mary I in 1555, and the present 17th century building dates from after the Great Fire of London in 1666.\n\nThe College of Arms was featured in the 1969 James Bond movie \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" where James Bond visits his friend Sir Hillary Bray who permits Bond to impersonate him so he can spy on Blofeld's base. Bray gives Bond information on Blofeld's ancestor Count Balthazzar de Bleuchamp. Bond is shown his own coat of arms with the family motto: \"the world is not enough\" (this was used for the title of the 19th Bond movie \"The World Is Not Enough\").\n\nThe Earl Marshal, a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk, oversees the College, but he is not a member. He must give his written consent, called a warrant, before any new coat of arms can be issued. The Earl Marshal's court (called the Court of Chivalry) can hear cases about using coats arms, but the court has not sat since 1954. Usually the Earl Marshal usually leaves affairs to the professional heralds of the College.\n\nThere are, three levels of officers of arms: Kings of Arms, Heralds, and Pursuivants. The officers of arms occupy posts bearing traditional titles:\n\nThe officers of arms earn money from their own private practices in heraldry and genealogy. They get only nominal salaries as officers of the College. These salaries were set centuries ago and reflect the living costs of the day. William IV reduced them to the old level in the 1830s. The amounts are listed below, and is not taxed:\n\nAny letters, telephone calls or visitors to the college not for a specific officer of arms are seen by the \"officer in waiting\". All members of the college serve as officer in waiting on rotation.\n\n\"Heralds Extraordinary\" are appointed to take part in special ceremonial occasions or to help the Earl Marshal personally; they are not members of the college. Among the extraordinary heralds have been — \n\nThe New Zealand Herald Extraordinary is not a member of the college but it is a permanent post created to oversee heraldry in New Zealand; he works together with the college to grant new arms for people and bodies in that country (where he himself lives and works).\n\nThe Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent. Before they can even consider the granting of arms, an application, (called a \"memorial\") must be made to the Earl Marshal, and a fee paid.\n\nThe Kings of Arms are authorised in their \"patents of appointment\" (the letter giving them their job) to grant coats of arms to \"eminent men\". Originally this meant someone who was rich or had social status. By 1530, the heralds wanted successful candidates for a grant of arms to have £300 or rent from land of £10 a year. Since the heralds get fees for granting arms, they have always been generous when deciding who should be allowed a coat of arms. In 1616, Ralphe Brooke, York Herald, tricked the Garter King of Arms into granting a coat of arms to the common hangman for a fee of 22 shillings (£1-20p).\n\nThis is why the Earl Marshal's permission to grant a coat of arms is needed. \n\nThere are no fixed rules about granting modern coats of arms. If a herald is approached and does not consider that the application has merit, he may tactfully suggest to the applicant that he or she should not proceed. If it does proceed, its success or otherwise will depend on the approval of the Earl Marshal, who may apply his own standards. Peter Gwynn-Jones has recently written that\nThe coat of arms, or a differenced version of them using marks of cadency, can be used by \"all\" of the legitimate children of an individual and such children and their descendants may bear the arms (or a differenced version of them) from the moment of birth: they do not have to wait for the death of the previous generation. The College of Arms does not need to approve the use of the arms in each generation: the original grant of arms is the only authority required. Although daughters and sons inherit the right to bear arms for themselves personally, the right passes only through the male line: hence, a son transmits the arms to his children, but a daughter, can use them herself, but her children cannot. A partial exception to this rule is the case of a woman who has no brothers, or whose brothers have no children; such a woman is called a heraldic heiress and may transmit the arms to her children as a quartering with their father's arms, and to their descendents.\n\nThe costs involved are quite substantial. The applicant does not buy a coat of arms: the arms themselves are freely given, but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists involved as professionals, and to support the buildings and other running costs of the College. Aside from the heralds' traditional nominal salaries, given above, the College of Arms is not financed by the taxpayer.\n\nThe College of Arms is also responsible for recording the changes of names. In order to change one's name, one must apply for a deed poll to be entered on the College's registers and published in the London Gazette. \n\nWhen a Royal Licence is granted for a transfer of arms, the change of the surname may be permitted by the Licence itself, so there is no need of a deed poll.\n\n\n", "id": "69099", "title": "College of Arms"}

It is when the two or yet many solutions are being compared is not of equal amount. Solving an inequality means finding its solutions. When you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is true, then it is a solution. When you substitute a number to a variable and the statement is not true then, the number is not a solution to the statement.\n\nInequality is finding a solution to a given variable. It is finding a relative order of a set. Inequality have many solutions but you need to find the real solutions. Inequality is solving real numbers. The proper way to read inequality is from left to right, just like the other equations, but the only difference is they have different rules for every equation.\n\nFor example, x+4>12, where x is a real number. First, a person needs to find the x and he/she need to know if it is a solution. The answer will be x>8 and it is a true statement. This expression is about the location of x within the set of real numbers. A number line is one way to show the location relative to all other real numbers.(See figure Inequality 1)\n\nThere are five different kinds of inequalities:\n\nThere are four ways to solve quadratic equations:\nFurthermore, it will take two steps to solve an inequality. The first one is to simplify using the reciprocal of addition or subtraction. The second one is to simplify more by using the reciprocal of multiplication or division. When you are multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, remember to turn the inequality symbol.\n\nInequality is a mathematical statement that explains that the two values are not equal and different. The equation ab means a is not equal to b. Inequality is the same with any equation but the only difference is that inequality does not use an equal sign instead it uses symbols. The inequality b>a represents that b is greater than a. Speed limits,mark, and others use inequality to express them.\n\nWhen solving an inequality a person need to have a true statement. When you divide or multiply an inequality with a negative number on both sides the statement is false.In order to make the statement correct with a negative number, you need to reverse the symbol to make that statement correct. When a number is a positive number you don’t need to reverse the symbol. Inequality is about making a true statement.\n\nFor example, start with a true statement -6y<-12. When both sides are divided by -6 the result will become y<2. In this statement the symbol need to be reversed in order to have a true statement, y>2 is the correct answer. In the number line (see figure Inequality 2), a closed shaded circle points out that it is included in the solution set.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69124", "text": "Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel\n\nHilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel is a mathematical paradox named after the German mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert used it as an example to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do.\n\nNormal hotels have a set number of rooms. This number is finite. Once every room has been assigned to a guest, any new guest that wants a room and does not have one yet cannot be served - in other words, the hotel is fully booked.\n\nNow suppose that there is a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms. As a convenience, the rooms have numbers, the first room has the number 1, the second has number 2, and so on. If all the rooms are filled, it might appear that no more guests can be taken in, as in a hotel with a finite number of rooms. This is wrong, though. A room can be provided for another guest. This can be done by moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on. In the general case, the guest in room \"n\" will be moved to room \"n+1\". After all guests have moved, room 1 is empty, and the new guest now has a room to occupy. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.\n\nAnother thing that can be done with this imaginary hotel is to double the number of people inside, again when all the rooms are already full. This is done by asking each guest to multiply their room number by two and move to that room. (If their previous room number was \"n\", this time they would move to room number \"2n\".) This would send the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, the guest in room 4 to room 8, and so on. After finishing, we find that all the rooms with the odd numbers are empty. Then we can put an infinite number of guests into these empty rooms. Now the number of guests in the hotel has been doubled without making the hotel bigger.\n\nThe guest at room 11 would move to room 101.\nThe second person of group 5 (Address 5-2) would go to room 25.\n\nThis is not really a paradox, it is only counterintuitive. In a normal hotel, with a finite number of rooms, the number of \"odd-numbered\" rooms, is smaller than the total number of rooms. In Hilbert's Hotel this does not seem to be the case. \n\nThe guest 1 of group 2 of vehicle 1 (1-2-1) goes to room 121.\n\nAddress 4-7-7-4 goes to room 4774.\n\nAddress 0-1 (hotel dweller) stays because 1-0-0-0-1 moves to room 10,001.\n\nand so on.\n\nEach pod holds 10 people.\n\nEach megapod holds 10 pods. (100 people)\n\nEach supermegapod holds 10 megapods. (1,000 people)\n\nEach superdupermegapod holds 10 supermegapods.\n\nEach ultrasuperdupermegapod holds 10 superdupermegapod.\n\nEach ultrasuperduperubermegapod holds 10 ultrasuperdupermegapods. (1,000,000 people)\n\nAnd so on.\nThis assumes that there is never an infinitieth layer. (The main ship)\nHilbert's paradox is a veridical paradox: it leads to a counter-intuitive result that is provably true. The statements \"there is a guest to every room\" and \"no more guests can be accommodated\" are not equivalent when there are infinitely many rooms. An analogous situation is presented in Cantor's diagonal proof.\n\nAt first, this state of affairs might seem to be counter-intuitive. The properties of \"infinite collections of things\" are quite different from those of \"finite collections of things\". The paradox of Hilbert's Grand Hotel can be understood by using Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers. In an ordinary (finite) hotel with more than one room, the number of odd-numbered rooms is obviously smaller than the total number of rooms. However, in Hilbert's aptly named Grand Hotel, the quantity of odd-numbered rooms is not smaller than the total \"number\" of rooms. In mathematical terms, the cardinality of the subset containing the odd-numbered rooms is the same as the cardinality of the set of all rooms. Indeed, infinite sets are characterized as sets that have proper subsets of the same cardinality. For countable sets (sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers) this cardinality is formula_1.\n\nPut differently, for any countably infinite set, there exists a bijective function which maps the countably infinite set to the set of natural numbers, even if the countably infinite set contains the natural numbers. For example, the set of rational numbers—those numbers which can be written as a quotient of integers—contains the natural numbers as a subset, but is no bigger than the set of natural numbers since the rationals are countable: there is a bijection from the naturals to the rationals.\n\n", "id": "69124", "title": "Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel"}

There were also female demons, called succubi. They lay on sleeping people, to have sexual intercourse with them. They would also do this to make other incubi. While they had sex with their victim, they drained its energy to sustain themselves. Sometimes, having sex with an incubus may result in a child, as in the legend of Merlin. Some sources say that the incubus may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis. Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with such a spirit by either males or females may result in bad health, or even death.\n\nPeople have come up with different explanations for the incubus legends. In the Middle Ages, people worried a lot about sin, especially sexual sins of women. Victims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis. Also, nocturnal arousal, orgasm or nocturnal emission could be explained by the idea of creatures causing an otherwise guilt-producing and self-conscious behavior. The influence of incubi could also have been used to explain how pregnancies happen outside marriage; such pregnancies were often \"unexplainable\". \n\nVictims who claimed to have fallen prey to the influence of incubi, could in reality have been victims of sexual assault by a real person. Rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. A friend or relative may have assaulted the victim in her sleep. The victims and, in some cases the clergy, may have found it easier to explain the attack as supernatural rather than confront the idea that the attack came from a trusted person.\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian kings' list, ca. 2400, where the hero Gilgamesh's father is listed as Lilu (Lila). It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while Lilitu, a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams. Two other demons appear as well: Ardat lili visits men by night and bears ghostly children from them. Irdu lili, is the male counterpart to Ardat lili. He visits women by night. These demons were originally storm demons. Because the etymology was interpreted wrongly, they were later seen as night demons. Also considered to be vampires which is another form of a demon that is said to drink blood from its victims.\n\nIncubi and succubi were said by some not to be different sexes, but the same demon able to change its sex. A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm, and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Their offspring were thought to be supernatural in many cases, even if the actual genetic material originally came from humans. \n\nMany tales claim that the incubus is bisexual, but some indicate that it is strictly heterosexual and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental. There are also many stories involving the attempted exorcism of incubi or succubi who have taken refuge in the bodies of men or women.\n\nIncubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion. The most famous legend of such a case includes that of Merlin, the famous wizard from Arthurian legend. \n\nAccording to the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of Incubi, the others being Sacramental Confession, the Sign of the Cross (or recital of the Angelic Salutation), moving the afflicted to another location, and by excommunication of the attacking entity, \"which is perhaps the same as exorcism.\" On the other hand, the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi \"do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed.\"\n", "id": "69174", "title": "Incubus"}

It took place from June 4, 1942 to June 7, 1942. This was about a month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, and six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\nThe United States Navy defeated a Japanese attack against Midway Atoll (northwest of Hawaii) and destroyed four Japanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser.\n\nThe battle was a decisive victory for the Americans. It was the most important naval battle of the Pacific area in World War II. The battle weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy for the rest of the war. Japan could not build up its forces again. The United States replaced their lost ships and planes with better ones very quickly. Japan could only make a few poor quality replacements. \n\nThe Japanese planned to bring America's carriers into a trap and sink them. The Japanese also tried to take Midway Atoll to build defenses far from their homeland and prepare to invade Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii.\n\nThe Midway operation, like the attack on Pearl Harbor, was made to destroy the American strength in the Pacific Ocean. This way, Japan could become the biggest power in the area and unify Asia under its control. It was also hoped that another defeat would force the U.S. to ask for peace soon.\n\nAfter the defeat, Imperial Japanese Navy forces retired. Japan's loss of four out of their six carriers, and of hundreds of their best air pilots stopped the expansion of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, and the Americans began to slowly advance towards Japan.\n\nJapan had reached its first goals quickly, taking the Philippines, Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). The Dutch East Indies had important oil resources, which made it important to Japan. Planning for a second part of the operations started in January 1942. However, there were disagreements between the Imperial Army and Imperial Navy, and disagreements between the Navy's GHQ and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Combined Fleet. This meant that a plan was not made until April 1942. Admiral Yamamoto said he would quit if his plan for the Central Pacific was not accepted. This led to his plan being accepted.\n\nYamamoto's main goal was to destroy America's carrier forces, which he saw as the main threat to the Pacific campaign. This concern was increased by the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. In this raid, 16 US Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched from bombed targets in Tokyo and several other Japanese cities. The raid, while militarily unimportant, was a shock to the Japanese. It showed there was a gap in the defenses around the Japanese home island. It also showed that American bombers could reach Japanese territory. This and other successful raids by American carriers showed that they were still a threat.\n\nYamamoto thought that another attack on the U.S Naval base at Pearl Harbor would make all of the American fleet to sail out to fight, including the carriers. however, given the strength of American land-based airplanes on Hawaii, he thought that it was too risky to attack Pearl Harbor directly. Instead, he decided to attack Midway, a tiny atoll at the northwest end of the Hawaiian Island chain, approximately from Oahu. Midway was not important in Japan's larger plans. But the Japanese felt the Americans would try hard to defend Midway.\n\nThe U.S. did consider Midway to be important. After the battle, the set up a U.S. submarine base on Midway. It meant submarines operating from Pearl Harbor could refuel and get new supplies, extending their range of operations by . In addition to serving as a seaplane base, Midway's airstrips were used for bomber attacks on Wake Island.\n\nLike most Japanese naval planning during World War II, Yamamoto's battle plan was very complex. He thought that and were the only carriers available to the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In May 1942, during the Battle of the Coral Sea, had been sunk and so badly damaged that the Japanese thought she had been sunk. The Japanese also knew that was being repaired on the US West Coast after getting torpedo damage from a submarine. Although the Japanese did not know the locations of and , they thought that both were in the Atlantic.\n\nYamamoto thought that the Americans had been demoralized by their defeats in the last six months. Yamamoto thought a trick would be needed to lure the U.S. fleet into a dangerous situation. He spread out his ships, especially his battleships, so that they would be hard to find. Yamamoto's battleships and cruisers went behind Vice-Admiral Chūichi Nagumo's carrier force by several hundred miles. Japan's heavy surface forces were intended to destroy the U.S. ships that would come to defend Midway.\n\nThe plan was for Nagumo's carriers to cause so much harm to US ships that the Japanese could fire on them by daylight.\n\nYamamoto did not know that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code. Yamamoto's choice to spread out his ships meant that none of his groups of ships could support each other. The only warships larger than the 12 destroyers that protected Nagumo's fleet were two battleships, two heavy cruisers, and one light cruiser.\n\nThe Japanese attacks in the Aleutian Islands (Operation AL) took away yet more ships that could have attacked Midway. Many earlier histories saw the Aleutians attack as a feint to draw American forces away, Early twenty-first century research shows that AL was supposed to be launched at the same time as the attack on Midway. However, a one-day delay in the sailing of Nagumo's ships resulted in Operation AL beginning a day before the Midway attack.\n\nTo battle with an enemy expected to have four or five carriers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, needed every U.S. carrier he could get. He already had Vice Admiral William Halsey's two-carrier (\"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\") force. Halsey was sick with psoriasis and had to be replaced by Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Nimitz also called back Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's force, including the carrier \"Yorktown\" (which had major damage at Coral Sea), from the South West Pacific Area. It reached Pearl Harbor just in time to sail.\n\nThe damaged \"Yorktown\" however, was not completely crippled. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked all day and all night, and in 72 hours she was ready to battle for two or three weeks. Her flight deck was patched, sections of internal frames were replaced, and several squadrons of aircraft were taken from \"Saratoga\". The pilots did not get time to train. Repairs on Yorktown continued even as she sailed out.\n\nOn Midway, by 4 June the USN had stationed four groups of PBYs—31 aircraft in total—for long-range reconnaissance duties, and six new Grumman TBF-1 Avengers. The Avengers were taken from \"Hornet\"s VT-8. The Marine Corps had 19 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses, seven Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats, 17 Vought SB2U-3 Vindicators, and 21 Brewster F2A-3s. The USAAF sent a group of 17 B-17 Flying Fortresses and eight B-26 Marauders with torpedoes: in total 126 aircraft.\n\nDuring the Battle of the Coral Sea one month earlier, the Japanese light carrier \"Shōhō\" had been sunk and the fleet carrier had three bomb hits, and was in drydock undergoing repairs. Although the carrier was undamaged, she had lost almost half her airplanes and was in port in Kure awaiting new planes and pilots. No new pilots were available because none had been trained. Instructors from the Yokosuka Air Corps were used in an effort to make up the missing aircrew.\n\nHistorians Parshall and Tully think that if the aircraft and pilots from \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\", were combined \"Zuikaku\" could have had a full air group. This would be against Japanese carrier rules, which said that carriers and their pilots must train together. The Japanese made no attempt to get \"Zuikaku\" ready for the battle. Carrier Division 5 had the two most advanced aircraft carriers but they would not be available and Admiral Nagumo would therefore have only four fleet carriers: and forming Carrier Division 1; and as Carrier Division 2. At least part of this was due to overwork; Japanese carriers had been constantly operating since 7 December 1941, including raids on Darwin and Colombo.\n\nThe main Japanese carrier-based aircraft were the Aichi D3A1 dive bomber and the Nakajima B5N2, which was used either as a torpedo bomber or as a bomber. However, production of the D3A had been reduced, while production of the B5N had been stopped. As a consequence, there were none available to replace losses. In addition many of the aircraft being used during the June 1942 operations had been operating since late November 1941; although well-maintained, many were almost worn out and had become increasingly unreliable. These factors meant that all carriers of the \"Kido Butai\" had fewer aircraft than normal and there were not enough spare aircraft or parts. I\nJapan's main carrier fighter was the fast Mitsubishi A6M2 \"Zero\".\n\nJapanese scouting before the battle was disorganized. A line of Japanese submarines was late getting into position. This let the American carriers reach their meeting point northeast of Midway (known as \"Point Luck\") without being found by the subs. A second attempt at scouting, using four-engine Kawanishi H8K flying boats to fly to Pearl Harbor prior to the battle and see whether the American carriers were there did not work out because Japanese subs could not refuel the planes. Japan did not know where the American carriers were before the battle.\n\nJapanese radios did pick up more American submarine activity and messages. Yamamoto knew this before the battle, but Japanese plans were not changed. Yamamoto, at sea on , assumed that Nagumo had received the same message from Tokyo, and he did not send the message, because he did not want the US to hear the message. Nagumo's radio antennas could not get the message from Tokyo.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz had one advantage: code experts had broken the Japanese Navy's JN-25b code. Since the early spring of 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective \"AF\". It was not known where \"AF\" was, but Commander Joseph J. Rochefort and his team at Station were able to figure out it was Midway. The code breakers then picked up a Japanese message that \"AF was short on water.\" was also able to determine the date of the attack as either 4 or 5 June, and to give Nimitz with a complete IJN order of battle. Japan had a new codebook, but it was not used for several days. This allowed HYPO to read messages for several days; the new code, which had not yet been figured out, was used shortly before the attack began, but the important information had already been figured out.\n\nAmericans knew where, when, and in what strength the Japanese would arrive at Midway. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had ruined their advantage in number of ships by dividing their ships into four groups, all too separated to be able to support each other. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained almost totally unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.\n\nAt about 09:00 on 3 June, a US Navy patrol plane spotted the Japanese Occupation Force to the west-southwest of Midway. Three hours later, the Americans found the Japanese transport group to the west. They attacked, but none of the bombs hit and no major damage resulted. Early the following morning the Japanese oil tanker \"Akebono Maru\" was hit by a torpedo from an attacking PBY. This was the only successful air-launched torpedo attack by the U.S. during the entire battle.\nAt 04:30 on 4 June, Nagumo launched his attack on Midway. It consisted of 36 dive bombers 36 torpedo bombers, escorted by 36 Mitsubishi Zero fighters. At the same time he launched a defensive combat air patrol. His eight search planes launched 30 minutes late.\n\nJapanese reconnaissance plans were poor, with too few aircraft to cover the search areas. Yamamoto's decisions had now become a serious problem.\n\nAs Nagumo's bombers and fighters were taking off, 11 PBYs were leaving Midway to search for Japanese ships. They reported sighting two Japanese carriers with empty decks, which meant an air strike was on its way. American radar picked up the enemy at a distance of several miles, and planes were sent off to defend Midway. Bombers headed off to attack the Japanese carrier fleet. US fighters remained behind to defend Midway. At 06:20 Japanese carrier aircraft bombed and heavily damaged the U.S. base. Midway-based Marine fighter pilots, flying F4Fs and obsolescent F2As, intercepted the Japanese and had many losses. Most of the U.S. planes were shot down in the first few minutes; several were damaged, and only two could fly. In all, 3 F4Fs and 13 F2As were shot down. American anti-aircraft fire was accurate damaging many Japanese aircraft and destroying four.\n\nOf the 108 Japanese aircraft involved in this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged. The initial Japanese attack did not destroy Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase to refuel and attack the Japanese invasion force. Most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Another air attack to destroy Midway's defences would be necessary if troops were to be able to go ashore by 7 June.\n\nAmerican bombers based on Midway made several attacks on the Japanese carrier fleet. These included six Grumman Avengers from the s VT-8 (Midway was the first combat mission for the VT-8 airmen, and it was the first combat of the TBF), Marine Scout-Bombing Squadron 241 (VMSB-241), consisting of eleven SB2U-3s and sixteen SBDs, plus four USAAF B-26s, armed with torpedoes, and fifteen B-17s. The Japanese fought off these attacks. The US lost two fighters, five TBFs, two SB2Us, eight SBDs and two B-26s.\n\nOne B-26, after being seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, dove straight toward the \"Akagi\". The plane just missed the carrier's bridge, which could have killed Nagumo and his command staff. This may have made Nagumo decide to launch another attack on Midway, against Yamamoto's order to keep the reserve force for anti-ship operations.\n\nAdmiral Nagumo had kept half of his aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. At 07:15 Nagumo ordered his reserve planes to be re-armed with bombs for use against land targets. At 07:40 a scout plane from \"Tone\" saw a big American naval force to the east. It seems that Nagumo did not receive the report until 08:00. Nagumo reversed his order, but it took 40 minutes before \"Tone\"'s scout finally radioed that there was a carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from TF 16; the other carrier was not sighted.\n\nNagumo was now unsure of what to do. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (\"Hiryū\" and \"Sōryū\"), recommended that Nagumo strike with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on \"Sōryū\" and \"Hiryū\", and half the cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships, however, was now limited. The Midway strike force would be returning shortly and needed to land or crash into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity, the Japanese did not get their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch. The few aircraft on the Japanese flight decks at the time of the attack were filled with defensive fighters. Launching aircraft would have required at least 30 to 45 minutes. By launching right away, Nagumo would be using some of his reserve without proper anti-ship weapons. He had just seen how easily unescorted American bombers had been shot down. Poor discipline caused many of the Japanese bombers to get rid of their bombs and attempt to fight intercepting F4Fs. Japanese carrier rules preferred full strikes, and since Nagumo did not know if the American force included a carrier, his response followed Japanese rules. In addition, the arrival of another American air strike at 07:53 made Nagumo want attack the island again. Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be armed and ready.\n\nFletcher's carriers had launched their planes beginning at 07:00, so the aircraft that attack Nagumo were already on their way. There was nothing Nagumo could do about it. This was the flaw with Yamamoto's plans.\n\nThe Americans had already launched their carrier aircraft against the Japanese. Admiral Fletcher, in command aboard \"Yorktown\", and having PBY sighting reports from the early morning, ordered An attack on the Japanese as soon as possible. He held \"Yorktown\" in reserve in case any other Japanese carriers were found. (Fletcher's directions to Spruance were sent by Nimitz who, unlike Yamamoto, had remained ashore.)\n\nSpruance thought that even though the range was far, an attack could succeed. He gave the order to launch the attack at around 06:00. Fletcher, upon completing his own scouting flights, followed at 08:00 from \"Yorktown\".\n\nAdmiral Fletcher, commanding the \"Yorktown\" task force, along with Captain Elliott Buckmaster,\"Yorktown\"s commanding officer, and their staffs had experience in doing a full strike against an enemy force in the Coral Sea. But they could not pass on what they had learned to \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\" which were ordered to launch the first strike. Spruance ordered the aircraft to go to the target right away, since destroying enemy carriers was important to the safety of his ships. Spruance decided it was more important to attack as soon as possible, rather than coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). American squadrons went to the target in several different groups. He hoped that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks full of planes.\n\nAmerican carrier aircraft had difficulty locating the target. The strike from \"Hornet\", led by Commander Stanhope C. Ring, did not fly in the right direction. Air Group Eight's dive bombers missed the Japanese carriers. Torpedo Squadron 8 flew in the correct direction. However, the 10 F4Fs from \"Hornet\" had run out of fuel and had to crash into the ocean. Waldron's squadron saw the enemy carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from \"Enterprise\") whose Wildcat fighter escorts also ran low on fuel and had to turn back at 09:40. Without fighter escort, all fifteen TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down without being able to do any damage, with Ensign George Gay the only survivor. VT-6 lost 10 of their 14 Devastators, and 10 of \"Yorktown's\" VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits. Part of the problem was the poor performance of the Mark 13 torpedoes. Senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never asked why six torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no hits. The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros shot down the unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs managed to get close enough to drop their torpedoes and shoot their machine guns at the enemy ships. This made the Japanese carriers to make sharp turns. The TBD Devastator was never again used in combat.\n\nDespite their failure to get any hits, the American torpedo attacks made the Japanese carriers unable to prepare and launch their own strike. They also pulled the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) out of position. As well, many Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by Torpedo Squadron 3 (VT-3 from \"Yorktown\") at 10:00 made the Japanese CAP fly to the southeast corner of the fleet. Better discipline and using more Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent the damage caused by the coming American attacks.\n\nThree squadrons of SBDs from \"Enterprise\" and \"Yorktown\" (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3, respectively) were approaching from the southwest and northeast. The two squadrons from \"Enterprise\" were running low on fuel because of the time spent looking for the enemy. However, the squadron commander decided to continue the search. He spotted the Japanese destroyer \"Arashi\". It was moving ti rejoin Nagumo's carriers after having unsuccessfully depth-charged U.S. submarine . Nautilus had earlier unsuccessfully attacked the battleship . Some bombers were lost from lack of fuel before the attack started.\n\nMcClusky's decision to continue the search was a great help to the US carrier task force and the forces at Midway. All three American dive-bombers squadrons (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3) arrived at the right time to attack. Most of the Japanese CAP were looking for the torpedo planes. Armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, fuel hoses lay on the decks and bombs and torpedoes were near the hangars, making the Japanese carriers very at risk of being damaged.\n\nBeginning at 10:22, the two squadrons of \"Enterprise\"s air group split up and attacked two targets. By accident, both groups attacked the \"Kaga\". Lieutenant Commander Richard Halsey Best and two other planes headed north to attack \"Akagi\". Coming under an attack from almost two full squadrons, \"Kaga\" was hit by four or five bombs, which caused heavy damage and starting fires that could not be put out. One of the bombs landed near the bridge, killing most of the senior officers.\n\nSeveral minutes later, Best and two planes dove on the \"Akagi\". Although \"Akagi\" getting one direct hit (dropped by Lieutenant Commander Best). It struck the deck elevator and went all the way through to the upper hangar deck. It exploded among the armed and fueled aircraft. Another bomb exploded underwater which bent the flight deck and caused rudder damage.\n\n\"Yorktown\"s VB-3, commanded by Max Leslie, attacked \"Sōryū\". They got at least three hits and caused a lot of damage. VT-3 targeted \"Hiryū\", but got no hits.\n\nWithin six minutes, \"Sōryū\" and \"Kaga\" were on fire. \"Akagi\" was also seriously damaged. The Japanese hoped that \"Akagi\" could be saved or towed back to Japan. Eventually, all three carriers were eventually abandoned and sunk.\n\n\"Hiryū\", the sole surviving Japanese aircraft carrier attacked. \"Hiryū\"'s first attack consisted of 18 dive bombers and six fighter escorts. They followed the retreating American aircraft and attacked the \"Yorktown\", hitting her with three bombs, which blew a hole in the deck, put out her boilers, and destroyed several anti-aircraft guns. Despite the damage, repair teams were able to fix the flight deck and fix several boilers in an hour. Twelve Japanese dive bombers and four escorting fighters were lost in this attack.\n\nApproximately one hour later, \"Hiryū\"'s second attack was made. It consisted of ten torpedo bombers and six escorting A6Ms. The US repair efforts had been so well done that the Japanese assumed she must be a different, undamaged carrier. In the attack, \"Yorktown\" was struck by two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a tilt to port, which put her out of action. Admiral Fletcher moved his command staff to the heavy cruiser . Neither of the carriers of Spruance's Task Force 16 was damaged.\n\nNews of the two strikes, with the reports each had sunk an American carrier (actually \"Yorktown\" in both cases), greatly improved morale in the \"Kido Butai\". Its few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard \"Hiryū\" where they were prepared for an attack against what was believed to be the only remaining American carrier.\n\nLate in the afternoon, a \"Yorktown\" scout aircraft located \"Hiryū\". \"Enterprise\" launched a strike of dive bombers (including 10 SBDs from \"Yorktown\"). Despite \"Hiryū\" being defended by more than a dozen Zero fighters, the attack by \"Enterprise\" was successful: four, possibly five bombs hit \"Hiryū\", leaving her on fire and unable to operate aircraft. (\"Hornet\"s strike aimed at the escort ships but it did not get any hits.) After hopeless attempts to control the fire, most of the crew remaining on \"Hiryū\" were taken off the ship. The rest of the fleet continued sailing northeast to catch the American carriers. \"Hiryū\" stayed afloat for several more hours. She was discovered by an aircraft from the light carrier \"Hōshō\". This led to hopes she could be saved or towed back to Japan. However, soon after being spotted, \"Hiryū\" sank. Rear Admiral Yamaguchi chose to go down with his ship, costing Japan her best carrier officer.\nAs darkness fell, both sides thought about the situation and made plans for action. Admiral Fletcher had to abandon the \"Yorktown\". He felt he could not command from a cruiser. He gave command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, but he was still unsure of what Japanese forces remained. He wanted to protect Midway and his carriers. He followed Nagumo during the day and continued to follow as night fell. Finally, fearing a possible night battle with Japanese ships and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade, Spruance pulled back to the east. He turned back west towards the enemy at midnight. Yamamoto decided to continue the attacks and sent his remaining ships searching eastward for the American carriers. He also sent a cruiser raiding force to bomb the island. The Japanese ships failed to make contact with the Americans due to Spruance's decision to pull back eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a withdrawal to the west. \n\nSpruance failed to regain contact with Yamamoto's forces on 5 June even though he made many searches. Towards the end of the day he launched an attack on any ships from Nagumo's carrier force. This strike missed Yamamoto's main group of ships. It did not hit a Japanese destroyer. The strike planes returned to the carriers after nightfall. Spruance to ordered \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\" to turn on their lights to aid the landings.\n\nAt 02:15 on the night of 5/6 June, Commander John Murphy's ,in the water west of Midway, made the second of the submarine force's major contributions to the battle's outcome. Sighting several ships, neither Murphy nor his executive officer, Ray Spruance, Jr., could identify them. Considering that they might be US ships, Murphy did not fire, but reported the ships to Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC). This report was sent to Nimitz, who then sent it to Spruance. Spruance assumed this was the invasion force and moved to block it while staying northeast of Midway.\n\nThe ships sighted by \"Tambor\" were the four cruisers and two destroyers Yamamoto had sent to bomb Midway. At 02:55 these ships received Yamamoto's order to pull back and changed course. At about the same time as the course change, \"Tambor\" was sighted, and to avoid a submarine attack and hit into each other, causing serious damage to \"Mogami\"s bow. The less severely damaged \"Mikuma\" slowed to . This was the most damage any of the 18 submarines deployed for the battle achieved. Only at 04:12 did the sky brighten enough for Murphy to be certain the ships were Japanese, by which time staying surfaced was hazardous, and he dived to approach for an attack. The attack was unsuccessful, and at around 06:00 he finally reported two westbound \"Mogami\"-class cruisers.\n\nOver the following two days, first Midway and then Spruance's carriers launched several attacks. \"Mikuma\" was sunk by Dauntlesses, while \"Mogami\" survived damage and returned home for repairs. The destroyers \"Arashio\" and \"Asashio\" were also bombed and machine-gunned during the last of these attacks.\n\nThe \"Yorktown\" was towed by USS \"Vireo\". In the late afternoon of 6 June, however, fired torpedoes; two struck \"Yorktown\", but a third struck and sank destroyer , which had been providing power to \"Yorktown\". \"Hammann\" broke in two with the loss of 80 lives. \"Yorktown\" sank just after 05:00 on 7 June.\n\nBy the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. Casualties aboard the four carriers were:\n\"Akagi\": 267; \"Kaga\": 811; \"Hiryu\": 392; \"Soryu\": 711; a total of 2,181. The heavy cruisers \"Mikuma\" (sunk; 700 casualties) and \"Mogami\" (badly damaged; 92) accounted for another 792 deaths.\n\nIn addition, the destroyers \"Arashio\" (bombed; 35) and \"Asashio\" (strafed by aircraft; 21) were both damaged during the air attacks which sank \"Mikuma\" and caused further damage to \"Mogami\". Floatplanes were lost from the cruisers \"Chikuma\" (3) and \"Tone\" (2). Dead aboard the destroyers \"Tanikaze\" (11), \"Arashi\" (1), \"Kazagumo\" (1) and the fleet oiler \"Akebono Maru\" (10) made up the remaining 23 casualties.\n\nAfter winning a victory, and as pursuing the Japanese ships became too dangerous near Wake, American forces pulled back. Spruance pulled back to the east to refuel his destroyers and meet with the carrier \"Saratoga\", which was carrying replacement aircraft. The American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor. Historian Samuel E. Morison wrote in 1949 that Spruance was criticized for not pursuing the retreating Japanese, allowing their fleet to escape. Clay Blair argued in 1975 that had Spruance followed Yamamoto, he would have been unable to launch his aircraft after nightfall, and his cruiser escorts would have been destroyed by Yamamoto's larger and more powerful ships, including the battleship , with 18-inch guns.\nOn 10 June, the Japanese Navy gave an account of the results of the battle that did not tell the whole story. Nagumo's battle report was given to the high command on 15 June. It was intended only for the highest officers in the Japanese Navy and government. It was guarded closely throughout the war. Nagumo stated that the enemy was not aware of our plans. The Japanese public, and much of the military, were not told about the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy officers were told about the carrier and pilot losses. Army planners continued to believe that the fleet was in good condition.\n\nOn the return of the Japanese fleet to Hashirajima on 14 June the wounded were transferred to naval hospitals. Most were called \"secret patients\" and kept away from other patients and their families. The Navy did this to keep this major defeat secret. The remaining officers and men were quickly spread out to other units of the fleet and sent to the South Pacific, where the majority were killed. None of the flag officers or staff of the Combined Fleet was penalized, with Nagumo later being placed in command of the rebuilt carrier force.\n\nThe Japanese Navy learned some lessons from Midway. Aircraft were refueled and re-armed on the flight deck, rather than in the hangars. All unused fuel lines were drained. The new carriers being built with only two flight deck elevators and new firefighting equipment. More carrier crew members were trained in damage-control and firefighting techniques. The losses later in the war of , ', and ' showed that there were still problems in this area. Replacement pilots went through a short training program, meeting the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a decline in the quality of training. These inexperienced pilots were sent into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were kept flying continually. As a result, Japanese naval air groups declined in quality during the war.\n\nThree U.S. airmen, Ensign Wesley Osmus (pilot, \"Yorktown\"), Ensign Frank O'Flaherty (pilot, \"Enterprise\") and Aviation Machinist's Mate B. F. (or B. P.) Bruno Gaido (radioman-gunner of O'Flaherty's SBD) were captured by the Japanese during the battle. Osmus was held on the \"Arashi\", with O'Flaherty and Gaido on the cruiser \"Nagara\" (or destroyer \"Makigumo\", sources vary), and later killed. O'Flaherty and Gaido were tied to five-gallon kerosene cans filled with water and dumped overboard several days after the battle.\n\nThe Battle of Midway has been called \"the turning point of the Pacific\". However, even after Midway, the Japanese continued to try to get more territory in the South Pacific. The U.S. did not become the more powerful navy until after several more months of hard combat. Midway was the Allies' first major victory against the Japanese.\n\nHowever, it did not change the course of the war by itself. It was the combined effects of the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway that reduced Japan's ability to do major attacks. In addition Midway helped make US landings on Guadalcanal possible. The prolonged attrition warfare (a type of battle in which each side tries to wear down the other side) of the Solomon Islands campaign allowed the Allies to take an offensive stance for the rest of the Pacific War. Finally, Midway bought the United States time until the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942.\n\nThe battle also showed the worth of pre-war naval code breaking and intelligence-gathering. These efforts continued in both the Pacific and Atlantic areas of war. There were many successes. Navy code breaking made possible the shooting down of Admiral Yamamoto's airplane.\n\nSome authors have stated heavy losses in carriers and veteran aircrews at Midway permanently weakened the Imperial Japanese Navy. Parshall and Tully, however, have stated that the losses in veteran aircrew, while heavy (110, just under 25% of the aircrew embarked on the four carriers), were not as bad for the Japanese naval air-corps as a whole. The Japanese navy had 2,000 carrier-qualified aircrew at the start of the Pacific war. A few months after Midway, the JNAF sustained similar casualty rates at both the Battle of the Eastern Solomons and Battle of Santa Cruz. It was these battles, combined with the constant death of veterans during the Solomons campaign, which weakened Japan. However, the loss of four large fleet carriers, and over 40% of the carriers' aircraft mechanics and technicians, plus the flight-deck crews were very damaging to the Japanese carrier fleet. After the battle and were the only large carriers of the original Pearl Harbor strike-force left for offensive actions. Of Japan's other carriers, was the only Fleet carrier that could be used with \"Shōkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\", while , , and , were second-rate ships. By the time of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, while the Japanese had somewhat rebuilt their carrier forces, the planes were flown by inexperienced pilots. \n\nIn the time it took Japan to build three carriers, the U.S. Navy commissioned more than two dozen fleet and light fleet carriers, and numerous escort carriers. By 1942 the United States was already three years into a shipbuilding plan which aimed make the navy larger than Japan's. The greater number of USN aviators survived the Battle of Midway and subsequent battles of 1942, and combined with growing pilot training programs, the US had many skilled pilots.\n\nYamamoto did not know that the U.S. had broken the main Japanese naval code (JN-25). This let the U.S. fleet go to the right place at the right time.\n\nYamamoto scattered his forces to keep the attack secret, but that meant his formations could not help each other. For instance, Nagumo's fleet had few big ships. When the carrier planes were carrying out the strikes, the carriers were relatively undefended. By contrast, the flotillas of Yamamoto and Kondo had more big ships, \"none of which saw any action at Midway\". Their distance from Nagumo's carriers also meant he could not use their reconnaissance planes, so he knew little of what was happening. \n\n", "id": "69189", "title": "Battle of Midway"}

At first it was made up of two conflicts. One was mainly between Britain and France. The other was between Prussia and its enemies: France, Austria, Russia and Sweden. Its roots are in an earlier conflict, the War of the Austrian Succession. The war was known by different names in different places. In the United States it is called the French and Indian War. In French Canada is is called the War of the Conquest. In both Sweden and Prussia it was called the Pomeranian War. In India is is known as the Third Carnatic War. When it regards the conflict between Prussia and Austria, it is called the Third Silesian War.\n\nColonialism was common at the time. In the war, the trade interests of the British Empire were opposed to that of the Bourbons (in France and Spain). The Hohenzollerns (in Prussia) and Habsburgs (Holy Roman Emperors and archdukes in Austria) confronted each other. There were also conflicts about who controlled what parts of Silesia. A \"diplomatic revolution\" established an Anglo-Prussian camp, allied with some smaller German states and later Portugal, as well as an Austro-French camp, allied with Sweden, Saxony and later Spain. The Russian Empire left its offensive alliance with the Habsburgs on the death of Empress Elizabeth and the succession of Peter III. Sweden also concluded a separate peace with Prussia in 1762.\n\nThe war ended with the peace treaties of Paris (Bourbon France and Spain, Great Britain) and of Hubertusburg (Hohenzollerns, Habsburgs, Saxon elector) in 1763. The war was characterized by sieges and arson of towns as well as open battles involving extremely heavy losses; overall, some 900,000 to 1,400,000 people died.\n\nGreat Britain succeeded in the contested overseas territories, gaining the bulk of New France, Spanish Florida, some Caribbean islands, Senegal and superiority over the French outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The native American tribes were excluded from the peace settlement, and were unable to return to their former status after the resulting Pontiac's rebellion. \n\nIn Europe, Frederick II of Prussia failed to complete a preemptive strike against Austria, and his opponents repulsed and at Kunersdorf nearly destroyed his forces. Frederick however recovered, regained ground and managed to avoid any concessions in Hubertusburg, where the status quo ante bellum was restored. William Pitt's saying that \"America was won in Germany\" referred to the Prussian war effort, which enabled Great Britain to limit her continental commitments and focus on her \"blue water policy,\" successfully establishing naval supremacy. While French and allied forces were able to occupy Prussian and Hanoverian territories up to East Frisia, French ambitions to invade Britain and to continue with their guerre de course were thwarted by a British naval blockade, which also impaired French supply routes to the colonies. \n\nThe involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. Spain's short intervention resulted in the loss of Florida, though it gained French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River in exchange and Britain returned Cuba as well as the Philippines. \n\nThe Treaty of Paris (1763) ended the war for Britain and France. \n\n", "id": "69227", "title": "Seven Years' War"}

It took place on Okinawa Island in the Ryukyu Islands (south of the four big islands of Japan). The battle was between the military forces of the Empire of Japan and the Allies. It was the second biggest amphibious battle (from sea to land) of World War II, after the Battle of Normandy. It was also one of the longest battles in history, from April to June 1945. The Allies won the battle and occupied Okinawa. Today, Okinawa is Japanese territory, but there are still American military bases there.\n\nNobody thought it was to be the last great battle of the war, but it was. The Americans were planning Operation Downfall, the invasion of the four great islands of Japan. This never happened, because the Japanese surrendered after the American use of the atomic bomb in August 1945 (first in Hiroshima, and a second time in Nagasaki) and the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan.\n\nThe battle has been called \"\"Typhoon of Steel\"\" in English, and \"\"tetsu no ame,\" \"tetsu no bōfū\"\" by the people of Okinawa, which mean \"\"rain of steel\"\" and \"\"violent wind of steel\"\", because of the very heavy firing of guns and bombs at this battle.\n\nAt some battles, such as Battle of Iwo Jima, there had been no civilians, but Okinawa had a large civilian population. The civilians dead or injured in the battle were at least 150,000. American deaths were 18,900 killed or missing and 53,000 injured, more than double of the soldiers killed at Iwo Jima and Guadalcanal put together. Several thousand soldiers who died from wounds and other causes, after the battle had finished, are not included. About a third of the civilian population of the island were killed. \n\nThere were about 100,000 Japanese soldiers killed and 7,000 captured. Some of the soldiers committed seppuku or simply blew themselves up with grenades. Some of the civilians, convinced by Japanese propaganda that the Americans were barbarians who did terrible things to prisoners, killed their families and themselves to avoid capture.\n\nIn 1945, Winston Churchill called the battle \"\"among the most intense and famous in military history.\"\"'\n\nOverall Allied command authority for battle was Fifth Fleet (under Admiral Raymond A. Spruance). Fifth Fleet was divided into several task forces and groups. \n\nTF 56 was the largest force within TF 50 and was built around the 10th Army. The army had two corps under its command. In all, the Army had over 102,000 Army (of these 38,000+ were artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops), over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly Seabees and medical personnel). \n\nAt the start of the Battle of Okinawa the 10th Army had 182,821 men under its command. The U.S. Navy had greater casualties in this operation than in any other battle of the war.\n\nThe Japanese land campaign (mainly defensive) was had 67,000 men (77,000 according to some sources). As well, there were 9,000 Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) troops at Oroku naval base. There were also 39,000 local Ryukyuan people who were forced to fight.\nThe United States Navy's Task Force 58 was east of Okinawa. It had 6 to 8 destroyers and 13 carriers. Admiral Chester W. Nimitz gave his naval commanders time to rest. \n\nJapanese air attacks had been light during the first few days after the landings. However, on 6 April, there was an attack by 400 planes from Kyushu. From 26 March-30 April, 20 American ships were sunk and 157 damaged. \n\nThe Japanese had lost up to more than 1,100 planes in the battle.\n\nBetween 6 April and 22 June, the Japanese flew 1,465 \"kamikaze\" aircraft attacks. Several fleet carriers were severely damaged. \n\nOperation \"Ten-Go\" (\"Ten-gō sakusen\") was the attack by ten Japanese ships. In all, the Imperial Japanese Navy lost 3,700 sailors, including Admiral Itō. The US lost just 10 U.S. aircraft and 12 airmen.\n\nThe British Pacific Fleet was ordered to attack Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands.\n\nThe land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on 1 April 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, who landed west of Okinawa on 26 March. \n\nOn 31 March, Marines of the Fleet Marine Force Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion landed without opposition on Keise Shima.\n\nThe main landing was made by XXIV Corps and III Amphibious Corps on the western coast of Okinawa on 1 April. \n\nThe 10th Army moved across the south-central part of the island. They captured the Kadena and the Yomitan airbases. \n\nSix days later on 13 April, the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marine Regiment reached Hedo Point (Hedo-misaki) at the northern part of the island. Japanese forces in the north were on the Motobu Peninsula. \n\nThe 77th Infantry Division attacked Ie Island (Ie Shima) on 16 April. \n\nThe U.S. Army 96th Infantry division and 7th Infantry Division went south across Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division had violent fights with Japanese troops in fortified positions.\nThey had 1,500 battle casualties, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese.\n\nThe next American goal was Kakazu Ridge. The Japanese soldiers hid in caves. There were many casualties on both sides.\n\nOn the evening of 12 April, the 32nd Army attacked U.S. positions. The attackers retreated. A final attack on 14 April was again stopped. \n\nThe launched a new attack on 19 April with 324 guns, the largest ever in the Pacific Ocean war. Then 650 Navy and Marine planes attacked with napalm, rockets, bombs, and machine guns. \n\nA tank attack failed with the loss of 22 tanks. XXIV Corps lost 720 men KIA, WIA and MIA. \n\nOn 4 May, the 32nd Army launched another attack. This time, Ushijima tried to land troops on the coasts behind American lines. Japanese artillery fired 13,000 rounds. The attack failed.\n\nBuckner launched another American attack on 11 May. By the end of May, monsoon rains turned hills and roads into mud.\n\nOn 29 May, Maj. Gen. Pedro del Valle ordered Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines to capture Shuri Castle. \n\nThe Japanese retreat moved nearly 30,000 men into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors — including Admiral Minoru Ota — all committed suicide. \n\nOn 18 June, Gen. Buckner was killed by enemy artillery fire. The last Japanese stopped fighting on 21 June, although some Japanese stayed hidden.\n\n", "id": "69319", "title": "Battle of Okinawa"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69332", "text": "Bald eagle\n\nThe bald eagle (\"Latin name: Haliaeetus leucocephalus\") is a bird of prey that lives in North America. It is the national bird of the United States of America. The bald eagle is a kind of sea eagle. It can be found in most of Canada, all of the United States, and the northern part of Mexico. It lives near big areas of water, where there are trees to nest in and there is much food to eat. It is called \"bald\" because of its white head and neck. (There is more information on the bald eagle's name in the section below called \"Name.\")\n\nThe species almost died in the United States (while its numbers were growing in Alaska and Canada) late in the 20th century. Now it has a more stable population.\n\nThe bald eagle is a large bird. It is usually as tall as and its wingspan is . Female eagles are about 25 percent larger than males. Adult females weigh , while males weigh . The adult bald eagle has a brown body, and its head and tail are white. It also has yellow feet with large talons, and a hooked yellow beak. The males and the females' wings have the same colors.\n\nBefore bald eagles become adults, their wings are brown. Their wings are usually speckled with white dots until the fifth year.\nThe size of the bird depends on where it lives. The smallest birds are in Florida, where an adult male is only about . The largest Bald Eagles are in Alaska, where large females may be as much as .\n\nThe bald eagle is closely related to a species called the golden eagle. The bald eagle is physically different from the golden eagle. The bald eagle has a bigger head and a bigger beak, and its legs do not have feathers. \n\nWhen bald eagles \"call,\" (make sounds), they chirp weakly and whistle. The young birds whistle more shrilly than adults.\n\nBald eagles usually live for around 20 years if they live in nature. The oldest ones sometimes live for 30 years. When bald eagles live in captivity, such as in zoos, they can live much longer.\n\nThis sea eagle gets both its common and scientific names from its head. \"Bald\" in the English name is from the word \"piebald\", which means, \"one with a white head\". The scientific name is from \"Haliaeetus\", which is Latin for \"sea eagle\".\n\nThe bald eagle was one of the many species written in Carolus Linnaeus's 18th century book \"Systema Naturae\". Linnaeus was a Swedish botanist, physician and zoologist who made the binomial nomenclature system.\n\nThere are two main subspecies of the bald eagle:\n\nThe bald eagle's natural home is in most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the United States, and northern Mexico.\n\nThe most bald eagles live near seas, rivers, large lakes, oceans, and other large places with open water and a lot of fish.\n\nBald eagles need old trees with hard wood to live, sleep, and make nests. They like trees that have holes and are safe from predators. However, the height or kind of tree is not as important as its distance from a body of water. Bald eagles need to live near water.\n\nThe bald eagle does not like to be near humans. It is are found mostly in places where there are no humans, or very few of them. However, a few bald eagles live in places with trees inside of big cities. They may live in city parks. Bald eagles live in a city in Oregon. A family of bald eagles recently moved into Harlem, which is a place in the middle of New York city.\n\nThe bald eagle flies very fast. It can move at speeds of 56–70 kilometers per hour (35–43 mph) when gliding or flapping its wings. However, when it is carrying fish, it flies about 48 kilometers each hour. Its dive speed is , though it does not dive a lot. The bald eagle is usually migratory, which means that it travels (migrates) between homes which are very far away from each other. In some places, bald eagles are not migratory. If a bald eagle's territory has water near by, it will remain there all year. But if the water where it lives freezes in the winter, it must migrate to the south or to the coast to find something to eat.\n\nThe bald eagle eats mostly fish. In the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon are the main food of the Bald Eagle.\n\nSometimes, eagles may eat a lot of carrion, especially in winter. They will also scavenge dead bodies up to the size of whales. However, eagles eat more large dead fish than whales. They also sometimes eat the leftover food from campsites or garbage dumps. The mammals they eat include rabbits, hares, raccoons, muskrats, beavers, and deer fawns. Some of the birds they eat include grebes, ducks, gulls, and geese. Reptiles, amphibians and crustaceans (especially crabs) are also eaten.\n\nTo hunt fish the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have special things on their toes called \"spiricules\" that help them hold the fish more easily. Bald eagles have powerful talons. They have been seen flying with a 7 kg fawn. Sometimes, when the fish is too heavy, the eagle will be dragged into the water with it. Sometimes, eagles swim back to the shore and live, but sometimes they may drown or die because of hypothermia (a condition when one’s body gets so cold the body temperature drops below normal). Other times, bald eagles steal fish and other kinds of food away from other animals. Healthy adult bald eagles are not eaten anywhere in the wild. This makes them thought as one of the top animals of the food chain.\n\nBald eagles become adults when they are four or five years old. When they are old enough to mate, they usually come back to the place where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles mate for life. However, if one of the pair dies or disappears, the other will choose a new mate. A pair which can not get a chick after trying for a long time, may split up and look for new mates. When bald eagles court, they call and show their flying skills. When they do so, two mates may fly high, and then lock their talons together, and fall, parting again right before hitting the ground.\nThe nest of the bald eagle is larger than any other nest in North America. This is because it is used again and again, and every year more is added to the nest until it may soon become as large as deep, across and weigh 1 tonne. One nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees near water. If there are no trees, the bald eagle will make its nest on the ground. Eagles have between one and three eggs per year. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs. The other parent will hunt for food or look for more to add onto the nest. The eggs are about long.\n\nOnce easily seen on the continental United States, the bald eagle was close to becoming extinct because of the use of the pesticide DDT. The DDT destroyed an adult bird's calcium, and it would become unable to lay more healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too weak to withstand the weight of its parents. In the early 1700s, the number of bald eagles were 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the United States.\nOther things that stopped bald eagles from producing well was the loss of habitat and illegal hunting of bald eagles. Also, oil and lead were other big reasons why bald eagles began to die out.\nThe species was first protected in the United States and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty. The 1940 Bald Eagle Protection Act in the United States also tried to stop the killing of the bald eagle and the golden eagle. The bald eagle was an endangered species in 1967, and the penalties for people who killed the species grew more and more. Also, in 1972, DDT was banned in the United States. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989.\n\nBecause of all this hard work, the bald eagle's population began to rise again. It was officially taken out from the United States list of endangered species on July 12, 1995.\n\nTo keep bald eagles in captivity, the workers had to be experienced in caring for eagles. The bald eagle can live a long time in captivity if well cared for, but does not mate well, even under the best care.\n\nThe bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. It appears on most of its seals, including the Seal of the President of the United States. The Continental Congress made the design for the Great Seal of the United States with a bald eagle holding thirteen arrows and an olive branch with thirteen leaves in its talons on June 20, 1782.\n\nThe bald eagle can be found on both national seals and on the back of several coins (including the quarter dollar coin until 1999). Between 1916 and 1945, the Flag of the President of the United States showed an eagle facing to its left.\n\nThere is a popular legend that Benjamin Franklin once supported the wild turkey as a symbol of the United States instead of the bald eagle. However, there is no evidence that this is true. The legend comes from the letter Franklin wrote to his daughter in 1784 from Paris. However, this letter was about the Society of the Cincinnati, and it did not say anything about the bald eagle or the wild turkey.\n\nThe Bald Eagle is a holy bird in some North American cultures. Its feathers are thought to be special. They are used very much in spiritual customs among the Native Americans. Eagles are thought as messengers between gods and humans. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional things, especially in fans. The Lakota people, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to a person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee people thought eagles as symbols of nature and fertility. This is because their nests are built high off the ground, and because they protect their young very bravely. The Choctaw explained that the bald eagle, who can see the sun more directly, is a symbol of peace.\n\nDuring the Sun Dance, which is danced by a lot of Native American tribes, the eagle is included in many different ways. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who need healing. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may send all the sick prayers to the god.\n\nHowever, Native American tribes cannot use bald or golden eagle feathers for their religious or spiritual use anymore. This is because of a law called the eagle feather law. The eagle feather law usually defends Native Americans by providing many exceptions to wildlife laws, but it presently does not yet allow Native American tribes to use them yet. This made the Native American groups angry because they insisted that it was stopping their ability to use their religion freely.\n\n\n\n", "id": "69332", "title": "Bald eagle"}

Some blankets are knitted or crocheted while others are made of two layers of cloth sewn together with stuffing in the middle. Blankets can be made with hollow fibre or feathers.\n\nOther names for blankets are quilts, duvets, and comforters, depending on their thickness, construction and/or stuffing.\n\nThe word blanket probably came from the 14th century. A special kind of fabric called Blanket fabric was created by a Flemish weaver who lived in Bristol, England.\n\nBlankets may also be used on the ground for a picnic or other places where people want to sit without their clothing getting dirty or wet.\n\nFirefighters use a special fire blanket to protect household items such as chairs from water damage.\n\nElectric blankets are heated by electricity. Blankets were traditionally made of wool because it is warm, naturally fire-retardant, and allows air to circulate well, while today synthetic fibers are frequently used. Throw blankets are smaller blankets, often in decorative colors and patterns, that can be used for extra warmth outside of bed.\n\nOther kinds are horse blankets, used to keep horses warm, and saddle blankets, used to prevent the horse's saddle from rubbing on its skin.\n\nBlanket terminology is also used in the printing industry. A blanket is a rubber coating over different layer of compressible material. It wraps around a cylinder and insures transfer of ink form the printed material (where the image is ink defined) to the paper.

Crochet uses more yarn than knitting but is faster to make by hand.\n\nCrochet is used to make clothing, household items like tablecloths, blankets and potholders, and toys. Lace is often made by crocheting, though it can be made by knitting and weaving as well.\n\nCrocheting is also a great craft for younger children. The stitches are easy and their small hands are able to hold the crochet hook. They are also able to see progress very quickly and that motivates them to continue.

It is directed by Julie Taymor and written by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement. The main characters are played by Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess. There are also other famous actors and singers who appear in the movie: Bono, who plays \"Dr. Robert\", Eddie Izzard as \"Mr. Kite\", Dana Fuchs as a musician called \"Sexy Sadie\", and Salma Hayek as a nurse.\n\nThe movie was released in North America on 12 October in 2007.\n\nThe story starts in the early 1960s. A young ship builder from Liverpool named Jude (played by Jim Sturgess) travels by ship to the United States in search of his American G.I. father called Wes (Played by Robert Clohessy). They have never met and his father does not know Jude exists. While looking for his father at Princeton, Jude makes friends with somebody called Max (Played by Joe Anderson), a rebellious young man from a rich background, and Max's sister Lucy (Played by Evan Rachel Wood). When Max drops out of college and moves to New York City, Jude goes with him. Max works as a taxi driver, while Jude tries to find work as an independent artist. They become roommates in a bohemian area of the city where they share an apartment with other people, including a woman called Sadie (Played by Dana Fuchs) who is their landlady and who is also trying to become singer. Other people who live in the same house include Jojo (Played by Martin Luther McCoy), a guitarist who arrives from Detroit after the death of his younger brother; and Prudence (Played by T.V. Carpio), a young lesbian who hitchhikes to New York City from Dayton, Ohio. Lucy joins them in the New York flat after her boyfriend is killed in the Vietnam War.\n\nLucy and Jude begin dating, as well as Sadie and Jojo, which leaves Prudence depressed. When Max is sent to Vietnam, Lucy becomes involved in an extreme anti-war group, which leads to tension with the non-political Jude. He is unhappy with the amount of time she spends with the political group, suspecting that its leader, Paco (Logan Marshall-Green), is a man who obsessively seduces and deceives women. Jude's art and his relationship with Lucy both start to break down. Meanwhile, Sadie has formed a band called Sadie and the Po Boys, with Jojo as her lead guitarist. She gains the attention of a manager (James Urbaniak) who signs her to a record label, but he wants her to drop her backing band. This leads to a break up between Sadie and Jojo, both musically and romantically.\n\nThe differences between Jude and Lucy grow. One day, Jude goes into the offices of the political group where Lucy works and is kicked out after punching Paco. This causes a fight between the couple, resulting in Lucy leaving Jude. Jude finds her at an anti-war demonstration at Columbia University during which many protesters, including Lucy, are arrested. When trying to help her, Jude is also arrested. Though Wes (Jude's Father) persuades the police not to take further action for activity at the protest, he cannot prove that Jude is his son, and Jude is sent back to England.\n\nMax is wounded in Vietnam and is emotionally and mentally troubled by his war experience, while Lucy remains involved in her anti-war group that is becoming more and more violent. After Lucy goes to the old headquarters of her anti-war group, she discovers Paco and some of his followers making bombs. She then decides to leave the group. One of Paco's bombs explodes, destroying the building. Jude reads about the explosion in a Liverpool newspaper and is concerned that Lucy has died. He then hears from Max that she is alive, and he arranges to return to the United States properly and without breaking the law. He meets Max, who drives him to Sadie's music headquarters where a Beatles-style rooftop concert is being held by Jojo, Sadie, and their band singing an anti-war song (Don't let me down). Lucy is supposed to be there to meet Jude again, but no one can find her, and the group is forced to leave when the police arrive. But Jude manages to sneak back onto the roof and begins to sing \"All you need is Love\", his eyes searching the crowd for Lucy. The rest of the band sneaks back onto the roof, too and they join him with their voices and instruments. Jude smiles sadly and turns to leave the roof, but Max suddenly points as they sing, and Jude turns to see Lucy standing on the roof across the street, singing along. They smile at one another with tears in their eyes, and the screen fades out to white clouds and blue sky.\n\n\n\nThe movie's end credits show that a total of thirty-three separate Beatles songs featured in the movie, either in full or in part. All of these songs were written between 1963 and 1970 by the members of The Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) and recorded by The Beatles. Thirty of them are songs that are officially credited to the songwriting partnership of Lennon-McCartney. Three are credited to George Harrison. One title (\"Flying\") is a 1967 song credited to all four members of the Beatles (Lennon-McCartney-Harrison-Starkey).\n\nThirty-one of the soundtrack's songs feature vocals. Two of them (\"And I Love Her\" and \"A Day in the Life\") are brief instrumental versions of songs that were originally written with lyrics. One song (\"Flying\") was originally written as an instrumental.\n\nTwenty-five of the vocal tracks are performed by one or more of the six lead cast members. Four of the songs are sung by stars with cameo roles (Bono, Eddie Izzard, Salma Hayek and Joe Cocker). One song (\"Let It Be\") is sung by supporting members of the cast. One song (\"Blue Jay Way\") is sung by indie Texan trio The Secret Machines. In twenty-nine of the vocal tracks, the vocalists are singing on-screen. Two of the vocal tracks (\"Blue Jay Way\" and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\") are sung by off-screen vocalists.\n\nThe remaining three of the thirty-four songs are rendered instrumentally. \"Flying\" is performed by The Secret Machines, \"And I Love Her\" is heard briefly as part of the orchestral score, and \"A Day in the Life\" is performed on guitar by Jeff Beck in a version recorded for Sir George Martin's 1998 album \"In My Life\".\n\nIn addition to the thirty-four Beatles songs, the soundtrack features an original score written by Elliot Goldenthal. Goldenthal worked on Taymor's previous movies \"Titus\" and \"Frida\". (Goldenthal and director Taymor have also been partners since 1982.)\n\nThis is a listing of the thirty-four songs written by members of The Beatles that are heard on the soundtrack, in the order featured in the movie. This listing includes notation of three songs that are heard twice in the course of the movie, so there are a total of thirty-seven individual music cues.\n\n\nIn March 2007, the media reported a dispute over the final cut of the movie. Concerned with the length of director Julie Taymor's cut of the movie, Revolution Studios (production studio) chairman Joe Roth tested a sneak preview of a shortened version without first informing Taymor. The incident caused a quarrel between the two, later involving Sony Pictures (distributor) Amy Pascal urging Taymor to agree to the shorter version. After several months of dispute, Taymor's version was eventually reinstated as the theatrically released version.\n\nThe movie received mixed reviews from critics. As of January 6, 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 52% of critics gave the movie positive reviews, based on 130 reviews. However, the movie is currently at 80% with the Rotten Tomatoes community. Metacritic reported the movie had an average score of 56 out of 100, based on 29 reviews.\n\nThe movie appeared on a few critics' top ten lists of the best movies of 2007.\n\n\n", "id": "69354", "title": "Across the Universe (movie)"}

The Tour of Britain is part of the UCI's European Tour.\n\nThe race includes teams from Scotland and Wales, as well as a Great Britain team. In recent years, no English team has been entered. Teams from outside the UK compete too, for example in 2007 Team T-Mobile will take part.\n\nThe latest version, a professional stage race, was first run in 2004.\n\nThe Tour of Britain has had different names. This is because many different companies or groups of people have provided the money needed to have the event happen (\"sponsors\"). \n\n\nThe first edition of the latest version of the Tour of Britain took place over five days in early September 2004. It was organised by SweetSpot along with British Cycling. The race was sponsored by the organisers of London's 2012 Olympics bid. It was well-promoted and many well-known teams were a part of the race. Such teams included T-Mobile (Germany) and U.S. Postal Service (USA). This was partly due to it being a 2.3 category race on the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) calendar.\n\nThe 2004 route ended with a 45 mile (72 km) criterium in London, where tens of thousands of people watching saw a long break by Londoner Bradley Wiggins last until the final lap. Enrico Degano of Team Barloworld passed him on the final lap to win that stage of the race. The Colombian Mauricio Ardila, of Chocolade Jacques, won the Tour overall.\n\nThe 2005 race was run as a UCI 2.1 category in six stages starting in Glasgow on 30 August and finishing in London on 4 September:\n\nThe Tour of Britain 2006 took place from the 29 August to 3 September as a UCI category 2.1 event. Martin Pedersen and Andy Schleck of Team CSC won the overall and King of the Mountains classification, respectively. Mark Cavendish (T-Mobile Team) won the points classification and Johan Van Summeren (Davitamon-Lotto) captured the sprints classification.\n\nThe Tour of Britain is being changed to seven days for 2007. The extra day is being used to run a stage in Somerset for the first time. Instead of finishing in London, the 2007 race will start in London and finish in Glasgow. Glasgow is using the event to increase the chance of it becoming the host of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\n", "id": "69369", "title": "Tour of Britain"}

She has received seven Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Writers Guild of America Awards. She was called the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008 by the Associated Press. They gave her their AP Entertainer of the Year award.\n\nFey graduated from the University of Virginia in 1992. She then moved to Chicago to take classes at the improvisational comedy group The Second City. She became a featured player there in 1994. Three years later, Fey became a writer for the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). She was promoted to the position of head writer in 1999. The following year, Fey was added to the cast of \"SNL\". During her time there, she was co-anchor of the show's \"Weekend Update\". After leaving \"SNL\" in 2006, she created her own television series called \"30 Rock\". The show is a situation comedy somewhat based on her experiences at \"SNL\". In the show, Fey plays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy show.\n\nIn 2004, Fey made her movie debut as writer and co-star of the teen comedy \"Mean Girls\". In 2008, she starred in the comedy movie \"Baby Mama\", with Amy Poehler. In 2009, Fey won an Emmy Award for her satirical portrayal of Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in a guest appearance on \"SNL\".\n\nFey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a township just outside of Philadelphia. Her mother is Zenovia \"Jeanne\" (née Xenakes), a brokerage employee of Greek ancestry. Her father is Donald Fey, a university grant proposal-writer of German and Scottish ancestry. She has a brother, who is eight years older, named Peter.\n\nFey was exposed to comedy early. She recalls:\nShe also grew up watching \"Second City Television\" (\"SCTV\") and says Catherine O'Hara is one of her role models.\n\nFey attended Cardington Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School in Upper Darby. By middle school, she knew she was interested in comedy. She did an independent-study project on the subject in eighth grade. Fey attended Upper Darby High School. There she was an honor student, a member of the choir, drama club, and tennis team. She was also co-editor of the school's newspaper. After her graduation in 1988, Fey enrolled at the University of Virginia. She studied playwriting and acting there. She graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama.\n\nAfter graduating, Fey first had plans to do graduate work in drama at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois. But \"I just got this feeling like it wasn't going to work out ... [that] they were going to take my money and then cut me from the program.\" She moved to Chicago anyway, knowing about the improvisational comedy group, The Second City. She took night classes at Second City. She had a day job working at the front desk of a YMCA in Evanston to pay for her classes. Once her Second City training began, she became highly involved in the \"cult of improvisation\". She became, as she called it later, \"like one of those athletes trying to get into the Olympics. It was all about blind focus. I was so sure that I was doing exactly what I'd been put on this earth to do, and I would have done anything to make it onto that stage. Not because of \"SNL\", but because I wanted to devote my life to improv. I would have been perfectly happy to stay at Second City forever.\"\n\nIn 1994, she joined the cast of The Second City. She performed eight shows a week, for two years. She was also in the revues \"Citizen Gates\" (1996) and \"Paradigm Lost\" (1997., She performed with Scott Adsit, Kevin Dorff, Rachel Dratch, Jenna Jolovitz, and Jim Zulevic. Improvisation became an important part of her understanding of what it means to be an actress, as she noted in an interview for \"The Believer\" in November 2003:\nWhile in Chicago, Fey also made what she later called an \"amateurish\" try at stand-up comedy. She also performed at the ImprovOlympic theater.\n\nWhile performing shows with the Second City in 1997, Fey sent several scripts to NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\"). She had been asked to send them by \"SNL\"'s head writer Adam McKay. McKay was a former performer at Second City. She was hired as a writer for \"SNL\" following a meeting with \"SNL\" creator Lorne Michaels. Fey moved to New York. She told \"The New Yorker\", \"I’d had my eye on the show forever, the way other kids have their eye on Derek Jeter.\" At first, Fey \"struggled\" at \"SNL\". Her first sketch to air starred Chris Farley in a Sally Jessy Raphael satire. Fey went on to write a series of parodies. This included one of ABC's morning talk show \"The View\". She co-wrote the \"Sully and Denise\" sketches with Rachel Dratch, who plays one of the teens.\n\nFey played an extra in one of the episodes in 1998. After watching herself, she decided to diet. By dieting she lost 30 pounds. She told \"The New York Times\", \"I was a completely normal weight. But I was here in New York City, I had money and I couldn't buy any clothes. After I lost weight, there was interest in putting me on camera.\" In 1999, McKay quit as head writer. Michaels asked Fey to replace McKay. She became \"SNL\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first female head writer. Fey does not make a big deal about this accomplishment because there have not been very many head writers.\n\nIn 2000, Fey began performing in sketches. She and Jimmy Fallon became co-anchors of \"SNL's Weekend Update\" segment. Fey admitted she did not ask to audition, but that Michaels asked her to do it. Michaels explained that there was \"chemistry\" (connection) between Fey and Fallon. Michaels, however, said that choosing Fey was \"kind of risky\" at the time. Her role in \"Weekend Update\" was well received by critics. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote: \"...Fey delivers such blow darts – poison filled jokes written in long, precisely parsed sentences unprecedented in \"Update\" history – with such a bright, sunny countenance makes her all the more devilishly delightful.\" Dennis Miller, a former cast member of \"SNL\" and anchor of \"Weekend Update\", was pleased with Fey as one of the anchors for the segment: \"...Fey might be the best \"Weekend Update\" anchor who ever did it. She writes the funniest jokes\". Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\", however, commented that he was \"not enamored\" with the pairing.\n\nIn 2001, Fey and the writing staff won a Writers Guild of America Award for \"SNL\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 25th anniversary special. The following year at the 2002 Emmy Awards ceremony, she and the writing team won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program.\n\nThe pairing of Fey and Fallon ended in May 2004. Fallon left the show at the end of that season. He was replaced by Amy Poehler. It was the first time that two women co-anchored \"Weekend Update\". Fey revealed that she \"hired\" Poehler as her co-host for the segment. The reception to the teaming of Fey and Poehler was positive. Rachel Sklar of the \"Chicago Tribune\" noting that the pairing \"has been a hilarious, pitch-perfect success as they play off each other with quick one-liners and deadpan delivery\".\n\nThe 2005-2006 season was Fey's last. After it she left to make \"30 Rock\".\n\nIn 2002, Fey suggested a pilot episode for a situation comedy about a cable news network to NBC, who rejected it. The pilot was written again to focus on an \"SNL\" style series. It was accepted by NBC. She signed a contract with NBC in May 2003. It allowed her to remain in her \"SNL\" head writer position at least through the 2004–2005 television season. As part of the contract, Fey was to develop a primetime project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal. She began developing the pilot project under the working title \"Untitled Tina Fey Project\". The pilot, directed by Adam Bernstein, centered on the head writer of a variety show and how she managed her relationships with the show's star and its executive producer. In October 2006, the pilot aired on NBC as \"30 Rock\". Although the episode received generally good reviews, it finished third in its timeslot.\n\nThe network gave the series a second season, which began in October 2007. The show's third season premiered on October 30, 2008. The premiere episode set records for the highest ratings of the series. In January 2009, NBC renewed \"30 Rock\" for the 2009–2010 season.\n\nIn 2007, Fey received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series. The show itself won the 2007 Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series. In 2008, she won the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild, and Emmy awards all in the category for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. The following year, Fey again won the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award in the same categories. She was also nominated for an Emmy Award. In early 2010, Fey received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. She won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Lead Actress.\n\nIn September and October 2008 Fey was a guest on \"SNL\" to perform a series of parodies of Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. On the 34th season premiere episode, aired September 13, 2008, Fey imitated Palin in a sketch, alongside Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton. Their act included Clinton making fun of Palin about her \"Tina Fey glasses\". The sketch quickly became NBC.com's most-watched viral video ever. It had 5.7 million views by the following Wednesday. Fey acted in the role again on the October 4 show. She also acted as Palin on the October 18 show where she was joined by the real Sarah Palin. The October 18 show had the best ratings of any \"SNL\" show since 1994. The following year Fey won an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her acting as Palin.\n\nIn December 2009, \"Entertainment Weekly\" put her impersonation on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, writing, \"Fey's freakishly spot-on \"SNL\" impersonation of the wannabe VP (and her ability to strike a balance between comedy and cruelty) made for truly transcendent television.\"\n\nIn 2000, Fey worked with fellow \"SNL\" cast member Rachel Dratch in the Off Broadway two-woman show \"Dratch & Fey\" at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City. The show was well received by critics. Tim Townsend of \"The Wall Street Journal\" in review of \"Dratch & Fey\", wrote that the fun part of watching them perform was \"seeing how comfortable they are with each other\". He said that the show \"isn't about two women being funny. [...] Dratch and Fey are just funny. Period.\" One of the \"SNL\" sketches, \"Sully and Denise\", originated at Second City in Chicago.\n\nOn August 13, 2007, Fey was a guest on the children's television series \"Sesame Street\", in the episode, \"The Bookaneers\". She appeared as a guest judge on the November 25, 2007 episode of the Food Network program \"Iron Chef America\".

For this appearance, she was nominated for an Emmy in the category of Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.\n\nIn 2002, Fey appeared in the comedy \"Martin & Orloff\". She made her debut as writer and co-star of the 2004 teen comedy \"Mean Girls\". Characters and behaviors in the movie are based on Fey's high school life at Upper Darby High School. It is also based on the non-fiction book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" by Rosalind Wiseman. The cast includes other past cast members of \"SNL\" including Tim Meadows, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. The movie received favorable reviews. It was a box office success, grossing $129 million worldwide.\nIn a 2004 interview, Fey said that she would like to write and direct movies in which she has small parts. As of April 2006, Fey has been working on a movie script for Paramount Pictures, which will feature Sacha Baron Cohen, by the name of \"Curly Oxide and Vic Thrill\". It is based loosely on the true story of a Hasidic rock musician. In 2007, she was cast in the animated comedy movie \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters\" as the teens' mother, a giant burrito.\n\nFey and former \"SNL\" castmate Amy Poehler starred in the 2008 comedy \"Baby Mama\". The movie was written and directed by Michael McCullers. The movie is about Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of getting pregnant, decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer. \"Baby Mama\" received mixed reviews, but many critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" wrote: \"Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing.\" The movie grossed over $64 million at the box office.\n\nFey's projects after 2008 include her giving her voice to the character Lisa in the English language version of the Japanese animated movie \"Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea\" (titled \"Ponyo\" for its U.S. release). In 2009, she appeared in \"The Invention of Lying\", alongside Ricky Gervais, Jennifer Garner, Rob Lowe, and Christopher Guest. Her next movie role was in Shawn Levy's comedy \"Date Night\". The movie focuses on a married couple, played by Fey and Steve Carell, who go on a date. However, the night goes wrong for the two. In addition, she has agreed to do voice work for the DreamWorks animated movie \"MegaMind\".\n\nFey was ranked in the Hot 100 List at number 80 on \"Maxim\" magazine in 2002.

In 2009, Fey was named as \"Entertainment Weekly\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fifth individual in their 15 Entertainers of the 2000s list. The newspaper editors and broadcast producers of the Associated Press voted Fey the AP Entertainer of the Year as the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008. They cited her impression of Sarah Palin on \"SNL\". She has appeared on the annual Celebrity 100 list by \"Forbes\" in 2008 and 2009 at No. 99 and No. 86.\n\nIn 2007, the \"New York Post\" included Fey in New York's 50 Most Powerful Women, ranking her at number 33. Fey was among the Time 100, a list of the 100 most influential people in the world, in 2007 and 2009, as selected annually by \"Time\" magazine.

They have a daughter, Alice Zenobia Richmond, who was born on September 10, 2005, while Fey was still working at \"SNL\". Fey returned to the show on October 22, saying \"I had to get back to work. NBC has me under contract; the baby and I have only a verbal agreement.\" In April 2009, Fey and Richmond bought a $3.4 million apartment in the Upper West Side in New York City.\n\nFey has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek. Fey was quoted in the November 25, 2001, \"New York Times\" article as saying about it: \"It's a childhood injury that was kind of grim. And it kind of bums my parents out for me to talk about it\". But in an interview with Fey and Richmond in the January 2009 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", Richmond said the scar comes from a slashing incident, which happened when she was five. Richmond said: \"It was in, like, the front yard of her house, and somebody just came up, and she just thought somebody marked her with a pen.\" She has said she was unsure about talking about it because \"It's impossible to talk about it without somehow seemingly exploiting it.\" Fey shows her right (non-scar) side of her face more often when acting as her character Liz Lemon.\n\nHer charity work includes support of Autism Speaks. It is a group that sponsors autism research. It hosts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families, governments, and the public.

It starts with the skater going forward. It is the only jump that does and that helps people know that the jump is an Axel jump. Because all skating jumps are landed going backwards, the Axel jump has an extra half rotation (full circle) in the air than all other skating jumps.\n\nThe jump was named after Axel Paulsen of Norway, who invented the jump.\n\nThe first skater to do a double Axel in competition was Dick Button and Carol Heiss Jenkins was the first woman to do it. The first skater to do a triple Axel in competition was Vern Taylor. The first woman to do it was Midori Ito.\n\nThe first pairs skater to do a \"throw triple Axel\" (he helps her with the jump) were Rena Inoue & John Baldwin. It is not known who did the first \"throw double Axel\".\n\nThe Axel can be a single Axel (1 and a half rotations in the air), a double Axel (two and a half rotations in the air), or a triple Axel (three and a half rotations in the air). Most junior and senior skaters do a double Axel. \n\nMany senior-level male skaters do a triple Axel. \n\nOnly eight female figure skaters have done a triple Axel in competition: Midori Ito (the first one to do it), Tonya Harding, Yukari Nakano, Ludmila Nelidina, Mao Asada (the first one to land three triple Axels in one competition), Kimmie Meissner, Elizaveta Tuktamysheva and Rika Kihira.\n\nAccording to the International Judging System, the base value of a triple Axel jump is 8.5, and that of a double Axel is 3.3. \n\nBecause the Axel is the most famous skating jump, many people make a mistake and call all skating jumps as \"Axel jumps\". This has led to many mistakes in sports reporting of figure skating, for example a report in 2006 saying that Miki Ando was the first female skater to land a quad Salchow in an international competition, which is a different jump.\n\n", "id": "69476", "title": "Axel jump"}

He was still only 19 years old when he died. Like Mozart, he was a child prodigy and he might have become one of the world’s most famous composers if he had lived.\n\nJuan Crisóstomo Arriaga was born in Bilbao, in the Basque Country in Spain. His father and older brother first taught him music. He started to compose when he was 11 and had already written 20 works by the time he was 15. Many of these are now lost. He may have thrown them away later thinking that they were not very good. In 1921 he went to Paris where he studied the violin with Pierre Baillot, and counterpoint and harmony with François-Joseph Fétis at the Paris Conservatoire. He was so good that by 1824 he had become a teaching assistant in Fétis's class. \n\nArriaga died in Paris at the age of nineteen, probably of a lung disease and exhaustion.\n\nArriaga has been called “The Spanish Mozart”. His music, however, does not sound particularly Spanish. It has a more general European character, based on the style of Mozart and Beethoven. He wrote a symphony which sounds at times like Schubert. He also wrote an opera \"Los esclavos felices\" (\"The Happy Slaves\"), and three string quartets.

If the new word has two s's together they cannot be written as ß. For example, Voßstraße is two words joined together (Voß and straße).

They tended the garden and could eat from any tree except the Tree of Knowledge. After they ate from the Tree of Knowledge, God punished Adam and Eve by making them leave the Garden of Eden forever.\n\nThe story is told in Book of Genesis 1-3 (in the old Testament of the Bible and the Tanakh. The Tanakh translates the Garden of Eden as Paradise. \n\nIn Sumerian, \"Eden\" is a name for the Steppe. \"Heavenly Eden\" is also mentioned. It refers to a place that appears to be fertile at first, but later changes to become infertile. Climatologists have said this is a good description of the climate change that happened in The Levant after the last ice age. The green steppe became dry. This meant that food was no longer available all year round, but only at certain times. This forced the people living at the time to start agriculture and to keep some of their food for the periods where there was none. Scientists have referred to this change as the Neolithic Revolution. This change of food is also mentioned in the story.\n\nBabylonian mythology sees the main reason for the creation of man to grow food for the gods. This is different in the Bible. There, god created plants as food for humans, and animals to keep them company.\n\nThe beginning of the Book of Genesis has been seen as describing the state before a climate change in a certain region. >Because of this change, humans were \"condemned\" to growing crops and keeping some food in stock, to be able to eat it, during the times it did not grow. Genesis has been seen to only start when this region converted to agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution, mentioned above). This means that Genesis roughly covers the time from about 8000 - 6000 BC to about 2000 BC.\n\nJudaism teaches that sin cannot be passed on from the parents to their children. There is a free will, everyone is responsible for their own sins only. Humans can do bad things and good things. God's commandments help them do good things. What exactly makes up the Commandments of God is not written down, but needs to developed by tradition. Sins are forgiven once a year (at Jom Kippur). Unlike Christianity, Judaism has no personified evil.\n\nChristianity believes that sin can be passed on from the parents to their children. This is known as original sin. Without Jesus, humans must live in sin. Augustine of Hippo formalized this belief, which is now a dogma in the Western Christian denominations (Catholicism and Protestantism).\n\nIslam sees Adam and Eve being chased away as a chance for a new start. Islam says the Christian concept of original sin is false. This means that them being chased away does not change the relationship between men and God. According to Islamic tradition, Adam and Eve were placed in different parts of the world. They first had to wander around before they found each other.\n\n", "id": "69704", "title": "Garden of Eden"}

It is called a “recital hall” because it is designed for recitals: concerts given by one soloist, or sometimes a small group of musicians (chamber music). It is in Wigmore Street in the centre of London, just north of Oxford Street.\n\nThe Wigmore Hall was built in 1901 by the German firm Bechstein who made pianos. Originally it was called Bechstein Hall. Bechstein’s showrooms were next door. The hall was built in a Renaissance style, with alabaster and marble walls and a rectangular hall with a small, raised stage. Above the stage the ceiling is in the form of a cupola which has a painting which shows the Soul of Music looking up at the Genius of Harmony: a ball of eternal fire whose rays are reflected across the world. These are separated by thorns from the rest of the picture which includes a musician and, on the other side, Psyche inspiring a composer to write music.\n\nThe \"Bechstein Hall\" opened on 31 May 1901 with a concert given by the virtuoso pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni and violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. During its early period many famous musicians played there, including Artur Schnabel, Pablo Sarasate, Percy Grainger, Myra Hess, Arthur Rubinstein and Camille Saint-Saëns.\n\nBecause it was owned by a German firm, the hall was seized as \"enemy property\" during World War I. The hall with over 130 pianos was sold at an auction to Debenhams for a very small amount of money, and was re-opened as Wigmore Hall in 1917. Musicians who have performed there since include Sviatoslav Richter, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los Ángeles, Sergei Prokofiev, Shura Cherkassky, Paul Hindemith, Andrés Segovia, Benjamin Britten and Francis Poulenc. \n\nToday the Wigmore Hall seats 540 people. Many concerts are broadcast on BBC Radio 3. Famous musicians perform there, as well as young musicians who are just starting their career.\n\nThe Wigmore Hall publishes on its own record label \"Wigmore Hall live\" recordings of concerts that were given by famous musicians.

The organisation is based in London, but they arrange examinations in places all over the world. Many people, especially children, who learn instruments take examinations of the ABRSM as it helps them to become better players because it gives them something to work for. People of any age can take the exams. Those who pass an exam get a certificate. Over 620,000 candidates take the ABRSM examinations every year in over ninety countries.\n\nThe organisation is called “Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music” because it is organised by a group of four music conservatoires: \n\nExams can be taken on many different instruments. In nearly each case there are eight grades, numbered from 1 to 8. For example, someone who has learned the piano for a short while may take Grade 1 once he or she can play pieces such as a simple minuet, and play a few scales with separate hands. By the time they take Grade 8 they will need to be able to play movements from sonatas by composers such as Beethoven, play all 24 scales in various ways very fluently and be good at sight-reading.\n\nThe marks are given out of 150. The pass mark is 100. Below 100 marks is a “Fail”. 120 marks and above is called a “Merit” and 130 and above is a “Distinction”.\n\nAlthough some students take each of the grades as they get better at their instrument, it is not necessary to have passed earlier grades in order to take a higher grade. For grades 6 and above it is necessary to have passed Grade 5 Theory or Practical Musicianship or Jazz. This is to make sure that students have a good knowledge of music.\n\nThe examiners are people who are professional musicians. Many of them are music teachers. They have a wide experience of music and they are trained by the ABRSM so that they all mark in the same way.\n\nThe ABRSM also publish a lot of music, including the music set for their exams.\n\nThere are four kinds of exams:\nThese are by far the most commonly taken exams. Available for over 35 instruments, these exams consist of 4 different sections:\n\n\n\n\nEach section has a certain number of marks and all the marks add up to 150. 100 is a pass, 120 a merit and 130 a distinction.\n\nThere is also a Prep Test for those who are not yet ready to take Grade 1 but would like to have the experience of taking an exam. Students who take a Prep Test are not given a mark. It is a way to encourage young people and make them relaxed about the idea of taking exams.\n\nThese are written papers about musical theory. They are marked out of 100: 66 or more is a pass; 80 or more is a merit; 90 or more is a distinction.\n\nThese exams will test a student’s understanding of rhythm, melody, key and notation together with the ability to sing and play from memory, and improvise and to recognise changes to and answer questions about a score.\n\nThese are the newest types of exams. Jazz piano was first offered in 1999. At the moment they are only available for flute, piano, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet and trombone. They are also only available from Grades 1-5. They are marked in the same way as practical exams. However many of the pieces include large sections where they have to improvise (make something up) using particular chords.\n\nThe ABRSM offer diplomas in three disciplines:\nFor each discipline there are three levels of award:\nThese are professional qualifications which allow a person to put the letters after his or her name.\n\n", "id": "69719", "title": "Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music"}

It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial uses and, is nowadays much less common in printmaking, where it has been almost completely replaced by etching and other techniques.\n\nEngravers use a steel tool called a burin to cut the picture or pattern into the surface, mostly a copper plate. Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that give different line types when used. The burin gives us a line that is unique because of its steady appearance and smooth edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines on them, used to do work on larger areas. Flat gravers are used for doing work on letters, as well as most musical instrument engraving work. Round gravers are commonly used on silver as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. \n\nIn ancient history, the only engraving that could be made were the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after 1000 B.C. \n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate metal. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to make artistic images on paper in Germany in the 1430s. The first and greatest period of engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden. \n\nThereafter engraving tended to lose popularity to etching, which was a much easier technique for an artist to learn. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial picture-making. \n\nBefore the invention of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, because they were cheap to use in printing.\n\nBecause of the high level of detail that can be done by a master engraver, faking engraved designs is almost impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other papers that should not be faked. Engraving is so fine that a normal printer can not make the detail of hand engraved images properly. In the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one engraver will work on the same printing plate, making it nearly impossible for any person to duplicate all the engraving on almost any banknote or document. \n\nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited amount of different colours is acceptable.\n\nEngraving machines such as the K500 or K6 by \"Hell Gravure Systems\" use a diamond \"pen\" to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8,000 cells per second to an accuracy of 0.1 µm and below. They are of course fully computer controlled and the whole process of cylinder making is fully automatic.\n\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state of the art since the 1960s. \n\nNow, laser engraving machines are being made and even today the mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make about 8 million printing cylinders worldwide per year.\n\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judah’s seal ring. (Genesis 38:18), followed by (Exodus 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jeremiah 17:1). \n\nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder pieces of the high priest’s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest’s turban, was engraved with the words: “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.” Bezalel, along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30-35; 28:9-12; 39:6-14, 30.\n\n\n", "id": "69735", "title": "Engraving"}

The first skateboards were a piece of wood with rollerskates attached to it. This became popular and by 1960, skateboards were made in production. As more skateboards were made, more people liked the new sport. However, it was dangerous and people started to fall off. As a result, skateboard parks started to close down. With less places to skate, skateboarders had no where to go. A small group of skateboarders carried on skateboarding in the street and around cities. After 20 years, the sport began to grow into what we know now. Skateboarding is a popular sport with many younger riders. Young people sometimes skateboard on the street. There are many different types of skateboards like stunt skateboards, penny skateboards, longboards, shortboards and more. \n\nThe normal parts to made a complete skateboard are the deck, trucks, wheels, bearings, hardware, and griptape.\n\nMost decks are made with six to nine-plywood layers. Other materials used in making decks fiberglass, bamboo, resin, Kevlar, carbon fiber, aluminum, and plastic. All these make the board more light. Some decks made from maple plywood are dyed to make many different colored plywood. Modern decks are different in size. Most are 7 to 10.5 inches wide. Wider decks can be used for greater stability when transition or ramp skating. Skateboard decks are normally between 28 and 33 inches long. The bottom of the deck can be printed with a design by the maker. Or it can be blank.\n\nThe longboard, a common different kind of skateboard, has a longer deck. This is mostly ridden down hills or by the beach. The longboard was made by two surfers; Ben Whatson and Jonny Drapper. One of the first deck companies was called \"Drapped\" taken from Jonny's second name. \"Old school\" boards (those made in the 1970s–80s) are mostly wider and often have only one kicktail. Different kinds of the 1970s often have little or no concavity, whereas 1980s models have deeper concavities and steeper kicktails.\n\nGrip tape, when put on to the top of a skateboard, gives a skater's feet grip on the deck. It is most often black. However, it can come in many different colors like clear. Clear allows the top of the deck to be decorated. It has an adhesive back and a sandpaper like top.\n", "id": "69753", "title": "Skateboard"}

It is about long. Its southern end is at U.S. Route 1 in Miami, Florida and its northern end is at the Canadian border in Maine. It connects many major cities in the eastern half of the United States.\n\nPortions of the highway have or used to have tolls. Many parts of I-95 were made up of various toll roads that had already been constructed or planned, particularly in the northeast. Many of these routes still exist today, but some have removed their tolls.\n\nMany notable bridges and tunnels along I-95 were also tolled. The Fuller Warren Bridge, spanning the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, was tolled until the 1980s and was replaced in 2002. The Fort McHenry Tunnel is underneath the harbor of Baltimore, Maryland and was opened in 1985. The George Washington Bridge, opened in 1931, carries I-95, US 1, US 9, and US 46 (latter is officially considered to end at the NY state line) across the Hudson River between New Jersey and Upper Manhattan.\n\nA study that could lead to the imposition of tolls on I-95 in North Carolina is under way as of March 2010.\n\nFederal legislation has identified I-95 through Connecticut as High Priority Corridor 65. A long-term multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the entire length of I-95 through Connecticut has been underway since the mid-1990s and is expected to continue through at least 2020. Several miles of the Connecticut Turnpike through Bridgeport were recently widened and brought up to Interstate standards. Work has shifted to reconstructing and widening of I-95 through New Haven, which includes replacing the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. Environmental studies for reconstructing and widening of I-95 from New Haven to the Rhode Island state line are also progressing.\n\nThere are plans to expand the I-95 corridor from Petersburg, Virginia, to Florida through a U.S. multi-state agreement to study how to improve the corridor through widening and reconstruction, with the goal of reducing congestion and improving overall safety for years to come.\n\nFlorida continues to complete widening projects. As of December 2010, I-95 from the South Carolina–Georgia line south to Jacksonville, Florida has been upgraded to six lanes. The section from Jacksonville to the I-4 junction in Daytona Beach was expanded to six lanes in 2005. As of 2009, widening projects continue in Brevard County from the SR 528 junction in Cocoa to Palm Bay, as well as in northern Palm Beach County.\n\nIn 2009, state legislators representing Maine's Aroostook County proposed using federal economic stimulus funds to extend I-95 north to Maine's northernmost border community of Fort Kent via Caribou and Presque Isle. The proposed route would parallel New Brunswick's four-lane, limited access Trans-Canada Highway on the U.S. side of the Canada–United States border. Legislators argued that extension of the Interstate would promote economic growth in the region.\n\nI-95 connects to an unsigned portion of the New Jersey Turnpike via I-295 near Wilmington, DE where drivers can bypass Philadelphia through South Jersey between exits 1 and 6, whereas, I-95, itself, passes through Philadelphia only to end at a notable gap in Lawrence Township, NJ where drivers can reconnect with the New Jersey Turnpike at exit 7A (I-195). A project will fill this gap using the easternmost portion of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the New Jersey Turnpike north of exit 6. I-95 connects to New York via the George Washington Bridge.\n\n\n", "id": "69757", "title": "Interstate 95"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69767", "text": "Let It Be\n\nLet It Be was a 1970 album and movie, by rock band The Beatles. It was the last Beatles project finished before the band broke up.\n\nAfter the \"White Album\" (\"The Beatles\") was released in late 1968, the Beatles talked about making a television special, where they would play songs from the album for an audience. It would be the band's first live public performance since 1966.\n\nAs 1969 began, the band decided instead to begin work on a new set of songs, and film the process of rehearsing and recording all the songs, then performing them live. The project was titled \"Get Back\", and a song by that name was worked up during rehearsals. The band agreed to perform all the songs without studio or , as they had long used.\n\nThe Beatles rented a at Twickenham Film Studios, where their instruments and equipment were set up. They were used to working from afternoons until late at night on music, but had to arrive between eight and ten o'clock in the morning, to meet the filming schedule. The band did not use this setup for long. The early hours and the cold, huge soundstage made them uncomfortable.\n\nThere was also between the Beatles, and it showed. The Beatles could not agree on where to perform the show, and for how large an audience. The suggested locations ranged from Los Angeles, California to Tunisia, and the size of the audience from a few dozen to thousands of people. Nobody had a location in mind that the rest liked, and George Harrison decided he did not want to perform a public concert at all.\n\nPaul McCartney took charge of the rehearsals, and drove the band hard to play his new songs just the way he imagined them. The other Beatles became tired of this, because it did not give them much chance to , the way they were used to doing. George Harrison got especially tired of McCartney telling him what to play, and his own songs not getting the attention they deserved. John Lennon also had new songs, but was more interested in spending time with Yoko Ono than in making another Beatles record. He was also of Harrison's new songs. Yoko Ono gave her opinions on the band's music, which they were not used to hearing from anyone but their producer, George Martin. McCartney and Harrison Ono's being at Lennon's side constantly. Ringo Starr tried to play the peacemaker, but did not always succeed. Harrison walked out during one lunch break, saying he had had enough. The band stopped work on the production, and decided to find a new location to work.\n\nHarrison went to a Beatles business meeting, a few days after he left the rehearsal. McCartney agreed to mend his ways, and let Harrison have more input. Lennon and Harrison also made up. The idea of finishing \"Get Back\" with a public show was dropped. Nobody wanted to return to the movie studio, and they began to look for another place to work on their new songs.\n\n\"Magic Alex\", a Greek-born inventor, had been hired by the Beatles to build them a new recording studio, in the basement of the which was the home of their company, Apple Corps. Alex spent a great deal of money over many months, trying to make a first-rate facility. He did not understand recording or studio technology well, though, and the studio he made had many technical problems. The Beatles only found this out when they tried to use the place to record. Things did not work, and this added to the tension felt by the band, and the people who worked for them.\n\nGeorge Martin was able to help the Beatles, by working around the problems in the basement studio. He borrowed recording equipment so the band could finish their project. The movie cameras were also set up in the basement, and the Beatles went back to work on their music. This time things were as crowded as the first location was cavernous, and again the band and their crew were uncomfortable.\n\nThe Beatles usually \"warmed up\" by playing old songs they had learned growing up. Many of these were captured on camera or tape during the sessions. Not all the songs were complete, or true to their original versions. When the band went from playing old songs to trying out new ones, problems came up. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison each wanted certain things for their music, and enough time to make the records the best they could be. This did not always work out, and they sometimes insulted each other for trying to outdo the others, or for letting their musical influences show. It made the sessions unpleasant.\n\nGeorge Harrison helped the of the band, when he brought a guest musician, Billy Preston, to the sessions. All of the Beatles liked Preston, and got along while he was there. He played keyboards along with the band, and gave the records a fuller sound. McCartney's girlfriend Linda brought her daughter Heather to the studio, and they helped cheer things up. Linda sang background vocals on \"Let It Be\", a gospel-like song by McCartney.\n\nThe question of where and when to finally perform the new songs was settled, when the Beatles decided to give a show on the roof of Apple headquarters. This happened on January 30, 1969, early in the afternoon. The Beatles performed for the movie cameras, and for anyone who could hear them outside.\n\nAs it happened, the music coming from the rooftop caused a traffic jam along Savile Row, where the building was located. Local police came to Apple, and tried to stop the show. Mal Evans, one of the Beatles's most trusted helpers, went downstairs and talked to the police, to stall them until the band could finish playing. After performing \"Get Back\", \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"I've Got A Feeling\", \"One After 909\", \"Dig A Pony\", and another version of \"Get Back\", the band went inside.\n\nThe next day, the Beatles gave another show, back in the Apple basement. This show was for the cameras, though, and not a live audience. They performed \"Two of Us\", \"Don't Let Me Down\", \"Let it Be\", \"Get Back\", and \"The Long and Winding Road\". Some of these songs were too hard to record outdoors, with their keyboard parts.\n\nThe movie crew shot more than a hundred hours of movie footage, which was more than enough to make a television special. The Beatles worked a little longer on the recordings of the \"Get Back\" songs, ending up with over twenty-nine hours of session tapes. The problem was, nobody was happy with the music that had come from the sessions. The band members had argued and disagreed on camera, and did not always make their best efforts on each other's songs, or to get along. This was plain to anyone who saw the footage, or listened to the dialogue between songs.\n\nGeorge Martin tried to remix the recordings, and make an album from the songs, while the Beatles' movie personnel tried to edit the movie footage into the TV special the band wanted. The band's problems were only magnified by the results, and they blamed each other, and the people who worked for them, for what showed. The Beatles decided to abandon the project, and work on other things. Only one single was released from the sessions, with the songs \"Get Back\" and \"Don't Let Me Down\". Billy Preston's name appeared underneath the band's, and stories started that Preston might join the Beatles. He never did, but he signed a recording contract with Apple Records, their record label. The other songs stayed \"in the can\".\n\nThe \"Get Back\" project became another problem that was dividing the Beatles. There was also trouble with Apple Corps, and personal issues between the band members. They had begun to make music apart the year before, and this increased as they stopped getting along as people. McCartney and Lennon both married their girlfriends, and lost control of their publishing company, Northern Songs. George Harrison began to play with musicians outside the Beatles. Ringo Starr started a new career as an actor in movies. The Beatles issued a new single, with the songs \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Old Brown Shoe\". John and Paul played on the first song, and George and Ringo on the second. They had stopped working as a unit, and George Martin stopped coming to recording sessions, which he had never done before.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, the Beatles felt sorry for the way the \"Get Back\" sessions had gone. They wanted to forget that time, and make another new album of songs, back at Abbey Road Studios. George Martin decided to come back, on the band's promise that they really would work together \"like the old days\", with Martin taking charge. The band kept their promise. \"Abbey Road\" was the result, and was issued in the early fall. As the record was being released, the Beatles met to discuss future projects. John Lennon, freshly back from his first non-Beatles concert, playing in Toronto, surprised everyone by announcing that he was quitting the band. He agreed to not make a public announcement, because this would have hurt the band's chance to their recording contract. Lennon instead focused on his and Yoko Ono's new group, the Plastic Ono Band.\n\nAt the end of the year, Apple's accountants told the Beatles that they would have to release some kind of album and program from the \"Get Back\" sessions. They had spent too much money on the project to just forget about it. Glyn Johns, a young music producer, tried to assemble an album from the session tapes, but he also could not please the Beatles. Anxious fans and insiders worked together and released a album from Johns's mix. Even though it was an album, it sold many copies and received radio airplay. The public wanted to hear the songs, good or bad.\n\nPhil Spector, a legendary producer who predated the Beatles, had always wanted to work with them. Allen Klein brought Spector to England early in 1970 to meet them. John Lennon and George Harrison got along well with Spector, who produced a record of Lennon's song \"Instant Karma!\" the same day he wrote it. Lennon and Harrison gave their OK for Spector to work on the recordings, and Ringo Starr played along with the musicians Spector hired, to make overdubs. This went against the original plan to present the songs live, but was accepted to \"sweeten\" – and finish – the recordings.\n\nAn eighty-minute program was edited together from the movie footage, and the band decided it would make a better movie than a television show. The Beatles had a contract with United Artists, who agreed to distribute the movie, which was titled \"Let it Be\". (The \"Get Back\" title was dropped, since \"Get Back\" had already appeared as a single almost a year earlier.)\n\nSome of the new songs that appeared in the movie, including \"Across the Universe\" and \"I Me Mine\", were not finished on record. A session was scheduled in January 1970 to record full versions of some songs, but John Lennon refused to attend. George Harrison made a joke about this, during a take of \"I Me Mine\", referring to Lennon as \"Dave Dee\", another British musician.\n\nSpector applied his \"Wall of Sound\" style to the Beatles recordings, including an old tape of \"Across the Universe\", so it could appear on record. His finished album was listenable, and showed none of the troubles that affected the band during the sessions, but it did not sound the same as other Beatles albums. Paul McCartney hated the changes Spector made to his songs on the album, especially \"The Long and Winding Road\", but he could not stop the album from being issued.\n\nAnother problem was the timing of the record's release. Allen Klein had succeeded in remaking the Beatles's recording deal, and McCartney was not bound by the same promise Lennon had been, to not say he was leaving the band. His first solo album, finished early in 1970, included a press release stating that he had no further plans to work with the Beatles. This effectively broke up the band. He also wanted the album released ahead of \"Let it Be\". \n\nRingo Starr, who also had a solo record (\"Sentimental Journey\"), due to appear, was sent to ask McCartney to change his release date. The two argued, and McCartney threw Starr out of his house. The release schedule was changed, so McCartney could have his wish. Starr's album appeared earlier than planned, and \"Let it Be\" was pushed back from April to May.\n\n\"Let it Be\" was both a hit movie and a hit album, and won a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack. Paul McCartney accepted the award. The news that the Beatles were breaking up was very sad to their fans, however, and the knowledge made watching the movie a experience. Many fans and critics did not like Spector's changes to the Beatles style on record, and said so publicly.\n\nA souvenir book was also issued, but instead of being a real document of the sessions, the book was and heavily edited, and reflected little of what was intended. It never appeared in the United States.\n\nLate in 1970, John Lennon issued a solo album, \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", which made his feelings plain in its last song, \"God\": Lennon sang \"I don't believe in Beatles.\" He gave a long interview to \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, which was later published as a book, \"Lennon Remembers\". He told his side of the \"Let it Be\" story, declared \"That movie was set up by Paul, for Paul\", and said he regretted not announcing that he quit the Beatles first.\n\nWhen home video came along in the 1970s, \"Let it Be\" became a popular rental and sales title. Over time, the Beatles asserted their copyright control over the movie, and copies were withdrawn. The movie has been planned as a reissue many times, but has yet to be officially released on DVD.\n\nIn 2003, recording engineers went back to the old session tapes, and used to make a new version of the familiar \"Let it Be\" songs. The new version was close to what the Beatles had wanted to make in the first place, and had none of Spector's post-production work. The album was issued as \"Let it Be... Naked\", and was praised as a \"real\"-sounding recording.\n\n", "id": "69767", "title": "Let It Be"}

A healthy person's gut can easily take riboflavin from food and pass it on to the blood for the body to use. The body needs the B vitamins to get energy from food. Without riboflavin and the other B vitamins people's bodies cannot use fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.\n\nThese foods have a lot of riboflavin. We say that they are rich in riboflavin or good sources of riboflavin:\n\n\nLight can break down riboflavin molecules into other molecules that the body cannot use.\n\nIf anyone eats too much riboflavin, the gut does not take up enough\nto make a person sick, but an injection with too much riboflavin can make one sick.\nThe kidneys pass riboflavin out in the urine, so when there is too much riboflavin in the body, the part that one does not want will not stay in the blood for long. If there is much riboflavin in the urine, the urine becomes bright, fluorescent yellow. Vitamin pills, or a meal with a lot of liver or egg white turns the urine yellow because such foods put so much riboflavin into the blood.\n\nTo make Vitamin B2 for vitamin pills or to add to foods, industrial companies grow special yeasts, other fungi, or bacteria that make a lot of riboflavin.\n\nRiboflavin is yellow or orange-yellow, so it can be useful as a food coloring. People get some very bad kinds of sickness (deficiency diseases) when their food has too little riboflavin. Adding extra riboflavin can stop people from getting such sicknesses. To prevent riboflavin deficiency, people may add riboflavin to baby foods, breakfast cereals, pasta, sauces, fruit drinks, and foods such as cheese that are made from milk (dairy products). People call it fortification with riboflavin when they add riboflavin to food. A lot of the riboflavin that people make, they use in vitamin pills.\n\nWhen there is too little riboflavin in the food, it causes what people call a primary riboflavin deficiency. Some people who have something wrong with their guts get what people call a secondary riboflavin deficiency: even if there is plenty of riboflavin in the food, the sick gut cannot get it out of the food and pass it on to the blood.\n\nRiboflavin deficiency can cause sores in the mouth (mouth ulcers), cracked red lips, cracks at the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis), and a sore throat. The eyes may become yellow, stinky and watery, and bright light might hurt the eyes easily so that it is hard to open the eyes in strong daylight (photophobia). A riboflavin deficiency also can cause dry, scaly skin that cracks easily, and itchy, painful private parts.\n\nWhen all these three things go wrong, angular cheilitis, photophobia, and sore, itchy skin on the private parts, doctors call it the oral-ocular-genital syndrome. The syndrome shows that there may be riboflavin deficiency.\n\nIf riboflavin deficiency gets bad enough in animals, they grow too little, become unhealthy, and they may die. Dogs with bad riboflavin deficiency do not grow well, their skins become sore and their hair may fall out. Their eyes become cloudy, their insides may bleed, they become weak, they cannot move or even stand properly. In the end they lie down and die. All this is very much like what one might see in humans with riboflavin deficiency, but we seldom see such things except where people are very poor and starving. Still, millions of people in rich countries do not understand the need to eat the right foods or are too poor. They might have quite such bad signs of riboflavin deficiency, but still have what we call \"sub-clinical\" symptoms, not bad enough to send them to hospital, but bad enough to make them unhealthy and to stop children from growing properly and becoming healthy.\n\nSubclinical riboflavin deficiency also happens more easily in women taking the contraceptive pill. It also may happen when people get old, or cannot eat properly, or who have sicknesses such as AIDS, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes and chronic heart disease. We can tell that the body does not lose all its riboflavin easily because riboflavin deficiency does not cause illness all at once.\n", "id": "69779", "title": "Riboflavin"}

In humans and animals, fertility means that the parent can produce babies.\n\nMore precisely, fertility is the capacity of an individual or population to produce viable offspring. By 'viable' is meant 'able to live and reproduce'.\n\nIn agriculture fertility means that a soil can support the growth of plants because it contains the right minerals and nutrients.\n\nFertility can also be used as a metaphor: having a \"fertile imagination\" means being able to think of many new and interesting things.\n\nAs a measure, fertility rate is the number of children born per couple, person or population. This is different to fecundity. This is defined the \"potential\" for reproduction (influenced by gamete production, fertilisation and carrying a pregnancy to term). In the English language, the term was originally applied only to females, but increasingly is applied to males as well, as common understanding of reproductive mechanisms increases and the importance of the male role is better known. Infertility is a deficient fertility.\n\nHuman fertility depends on factors of nutrition, sexual behavior, culture, instinct, endocrinology, timing, economics, way of life, and emotions. Animal fertility is no less complex, and may display astounding mechanisms.\n\nIn the United States the average age of menarche (first period) is about 12.5 years., However, in most girls, menarche does not signal that ovulation has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. \nWomen's fertility peaks between ages 22–26, and after 35 it starts to sharply decline.\n\nAccording to Henri Leridon, PhD, an epidemiologist with the French Institute of Health and Medical Research,\nof women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization:\n\n\nThe use of fertility drugs and/or in vitro fertilization can increase the chances of becoming pregnant at a later age.\n\nThere is evidence that males reproduction abilities are reduced with higher age.\nSperm count is becoming smaller with age, with men aged 50–80 years producing 75% of sperm compared with 20–50 years old males.\nIf the sperm count is to low, man can increase it with herbal and chemical supplements.\nEven larger change can be seen in number of seminiferous tubules produced by males on different age stages:\n\n\nInfertility is a state where at least one of the partners cannot have children. Infertility can be also refereed to women unable to carry children for full pregnancy period due to health related issues. there are many causes of infertility - many of them can be treated.\n\n", "id": "69794", "title": "Fertility"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69799", "text": "Postmodernism\n\nPostmodernism is a way of thinking about culture, philosophy, art and many other things. The term has been used in many different ways at different times, but there are some things in common.\n\nPostmodernism says that there is no real truth. It says that knowledge is always made or invented and not discovered. Because knowledge is made by people, a person cannot know something with certainty - all ideas and facts are 'believed' instead of 'known'. People believe that they know what the truth is, but they will think that the truth is something different later. This is the opposite of 'objectivity', which says that the one truth is always there and people have to discover it.\n\nSince postmodernism says that the truth is just a thing that people invent, people can believe different things and think it is the truth and all be right. Postmodernism says that one person should not try to make another person believe what he believes, because it means nothing to say that one belief is right and the other is wrong. Postmodernism says that if somebody has a belief and tries to make somebody else believe it also, it means that they are just trying to gain power over them.\n\nStarting with the 18th century Enlightenment and into the early 20th century, many people believed that science and new knowledge would make the world better. They believed that whenever scientists or philosophers discovered something new, it would inevitably make society a little bit better. This seemed obvious with all of the new technology that had come about in the Industrial Revolution, allowing people to have things from cars to washing machines. Many thought that this social progress could not be stopped. Those that believed this believed in Modernism. Postmodernism holds that there is no real \"social progress\", because different people have different ideas about what social progress is. The Industrial Revolution helped many, but harmed many too. Postmodernism holds that while some things about the world change, people only want to believe that the world is better than it was. It changes but does not get better, because there is no 'better'.\n\nPostmodernism says that since peoples' opinions change, and since one person's opinion cannot be more right than another, it means nothing to say that (for example) one work of art is better than any other. Postmodernism says that art, music, and literature, for example, can be anything that its maker says that it is. Postmodern art and literature commonly talks about itself and makes fun of itself. It makes fun of 'serious' art and even the very idea of art. Postmodernism has influenced many cultural fields, including literary criticism, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, architecture, visual arts, and music.\n\nThe term postmodernism was first commonly used in the 1949 to talk about modern architecture. Many people did not like modern architecture because it had too many box-like shapes and people did not think it was pretty. Some of them started the postmodern architecture movement. Postmodern architecture uses surface ornamentation, often based on historical styles, and less box-like shapes.\n\nPostmodernist ideas can be seen in philosophy, the study of culture and society, literature, architecture, design, as well as in history and law. Postmodernism also led people to think differently about love, marriage, popular culture, and the change in much of the Western world from an industrial to service economy. \n\nThe term \"postmodernity\" usually means the period of time when postmodern ideas became common (the second half of the 20th century). Some experts think that postmodernism is now over, especially in literature. \n\nThe term \"Postmodernism\" is often used to refer to different, sometimes contradictory (they cannot both be right) concepts. Common definitions are:\n\n\nBecause the term postmodernism can be used to talk about so many different things and can mean many different things, some people say that it is only a buzzword that means nothing. Dick Hebdige, in his book ‘Hiding in the Light’, writes:\n\"When it becomes possible for a people to describe as ‘postmodern’ the décor of a room, the design of a building, the diegesis of a film, the construction of a record, or a ‘scratch’ video, a television commercial, or an arts documentary, or the ‘intertextual’ relations between them, the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal, an anti-teleological tendency within epistemology, the attack on the ‘metaphysics of presence’, a general attenuation of feeling, the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post-War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle-age, the ‘predicament’ of reflexivity, a group of rhetorical tropes, a proliferation of surfaces, a new phase in commodity fetishism, a fascination for images, codes and styles, a process of cultural, political or existential fragmentation and/or crisis, the ‘de-centring’ of the subject, an ‘incredulity towards metanarratives’, the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of power/discourse formations, the ‘implosion of meaning’, the collapse of cultural hierarchies, the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self-destruction, the decline of the university, the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies, broad societal and economic shifts into a ‘media’, ‘consumer’ or ‘multinational’ phase, a sense (depending on who you read) of ‘placelessness’ or the abandonment of placelessness (‘critical regionalism’) or (even) a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates - when it becomes possible to describe all these things as ‘Postmodern’ (or more simply using a current abbreviation as ‘post’ or ‘very post’) then it’s clear we are in the presence of a buzzword\".\n\nBritish historian Perry Anderson says that postmodernism is an important concept and is important for the study of contemporary (current) culture.\n\n\n", "id": "69799", "title": "Postmodernism"}

She was the mother of artists Heather McCartney and Mary McCartney, fashion designer Stella McCartney, and musician James McCartney. Her father was attorney Lee Eastman, whose law partner was his son (Linda's brother) John Eastman. Her mother was Louise Linder, who was an heiress to a department store fortune.\n\nLinda grew up in Scarsdale, New York, and attended Sarah Lawrence College. She enjoyed music, and sang girl group songs with friends. When The Beatles became famous in America, she attended one of their concerts. She never considered a musical career.\n\nLinda married a geologist, John See, and they had a daughter, named Heather. See wanted to move to Africa to work, and take his wife and daughter. Linda did not want to go, and they were divorced. She became a photographer, and took pictures for magazines and the press.\n\nBefore long, she began to photograph rock bands and singers. She became well known for this. The Rolling Stones once made her the exclusive photographer for one of their public appearances. In time, she visited England, to photograph the pop stars there.\n\nLinda had been attracted most of all to John Lennon of the Beatles when she first saw them. In person, though, she was charmed more by another Beatle, Paul McCartney, when they met. McCartney was engaged to actress Jane Asher, but she wanted to wait to have children, and McCartney did not. Their engagement ended. McCartney loved to spend time with Linda's daughter Heather, and the three of them seemed to make a family. Linda and Heather moved into McCartney's home during 1968.\n\nLate, in 1968, Linda became pregnant. She and McCartney were married, and had a baby (named Mary after McCartney's own mother) the next year. During this same time, the Beatles were growing apart. They had business problems, and no longer had the same kinds of plans or hopes. Linda hoped her father and brother, whose clients were mostly entertainment personalities, could help solve the business problems. The fact that they were her family (and now McCartney's, by marriage) did not put the other Beatles at ease. They chose Allen Klein to represent them instead. Klein and the Eastmans did not get along, and this caused further problems. The Beatles began to break up late in 1969.\n\nBesides the band's problems, Paul McCartney and John Lennon had grown apart personally. Lennon divorced his first wife Cynthia in 1968, and started a relationship with Japanese artist Yoko Ono. They were also married in 1969. Lennon and Ono spent as much time as possible together, and McCartney often felt out of place. McCartney and Linda also spent a lot of time together, but separated to work on their own projects. Linda and Yoko did not get along well, but each supported their men, and encouraged them to believe in themselves. Later, some fans blamed one or both women for breaking up the Beatles, but their role was not crucial to that. It was one of many factors that drove the band apart.\n\nPaul McCartney suffered from depression for a time, when the Beatles ended. It had been his longtime band, made up of good friends, and he had lost both. He turned to his family for comfort. Linda and their children were always there. McCartney and Lennon argued in the media, and Linda also took verbal jabs at Lennon and Yoko Ono. Surprisingly, when they met in person, everyone usually acted in a completely different way, and were kind to each other.\n\nLinda began to sing with her husband, and to help him to write new songs. He wanted her to do this, and liked her input. He also wanted to perform again for small audiences, as the Beatles had done in their early days. He taught Linda to play piano, so she could share in the experience. Linda did not become a virtuoso musician or singer, but she added to the sound of McCartney's new band, which he called Wings. The couple enjoyed performing together, as part of a band.\n\nAdding other musicians, Wings began to play small shows, sometimes turning up at a school or club in the morning and asking to play, for no charge. As they played more, they began to give regular concerts, and to go on tours. The McCartneys would bring their children along during their school vacations. The McCartney children did not realise their parents were celebrities, and the family atmosphere between all of them was strong.\n\nAlthough now a musician, Linda continued her photography, and published books of her works. She and McCartney also became vegetarians, out of their love of animals. Linda became a for animal rights and related causes. She learned and made recipes for vegetarian meals, and began to write cookbooks.\n\nAfter Wings ended, Linda still recorded and performed with her husband, but she was now recognized as an activist for social causes, and for charity work. She launched a line of vegetarian frozen dinners. They became popular, and in time made Linda wealthy on her own. Paul McCartney was knighted in 1997, and Linda was named Lady McCartney.\n\nIn 1995, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which McCartney's mother died of in 1956. Medicine had advanced since that time, but Linda died of breast cancer in 1998, at the Arizona ranch she owned with her husband. A memorial service was held in London, England, and former Beatles George Harrison and Ringo Starr attended, marking the last time they and Paul McCartney appeared and performed together in public.\n", "id": "69814", "title": "Linda McCartney"}

He is also the founder of the band, \"Peroxwhy?gen\".\n\nHardy says that Sting, The Ultimate Warrior, and Shawn Michaels were the reasons why he wanted to get into wrestling as a child. Jeff had been seen on WWF television as early as age 16. His first WWF match was against The 1-2-3 Kid and came on May 25, 1994 in Erie, Pennsylvania. Early on, Jeff, along with his brother Matt and friends, started their own wrestling organization, the TWF (Trampoline Wrestling Federation). In it they would perform many of the moves they saw on TV. The federation eventually became a part of a county fair in North Carolina, U.S.. Jeff, Matt, and friends then began to work for other independent wrestling companies. They drove all over the East Coast of the United States, working for companies many small companies.\n\nThe Hardy brothers eventually caught the eyes of the World Wrestling Federation. Jeff was only 16 at the time. After being signed to a contract in 1998, they were trained by Dory Funk, Jr. in his Funkin' Dojo. They were trained with other notable wrestlers such as Kurt Angle, Christian, Test, and A-Train. When the team was finally brought up to WWF TV, they formed the tag team called The Hardy Boys. During this time, they were managed by Michael Hayes. In 1999, they fought mainly with Edge and Christian.\n\nThe team of Matt and Jeff won the WWE Tag Team Championship six times. Because of this, they would be known as one of the most successful tag teams in WWE history. In 2000, Matt and Jeff found a new manager in their real-life friend Lita. Together, the three became known as \"Team Extreme\".\n\nJeff was well known for his high risk stunts in many of the Hardy Boys' matches. He made a name for himself because of the risks he took during this time. In 2001, Jeff would also hold the WWE Intercontinental, Light Heavyweight and Hardcore Championships.\n\nAfter years in the tag team division, Jeff fought The Undertaker in a Ladder match for the Championship. Jeff did not win, but earned the Undertaker's respect. Jeff competed for singles titles several times, but did not win.\n\nJeff was released from WWE on April 22, 2003. The reasons given for the release were Jeff's strange behavior, drug use, and not showing up for matches. Hardy also said \"burn out\" and the need for time off were reasons for leaving WWE.\n\nHardy started wrestling in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on June 23, 2004 at the TNA pay-per-view, the \"Second Anniversary Show\". He was in a match against A.J. Styles for the X - Division title. The match ended in a no-contest when Kid Kash and Dallas interfered. Hardy returned to TNA on July 21 and was given a chance to fight for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy challenged for the title on September 8 but lost to NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett.\n\nOn August 4 2006, WWE announced that Hardy was working with the company again. He returned on the August 21 episode of \"RAW\". On the day of his return, Hardy defeated Edge by disqualification when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring. After failing to win the Intercontinental Championship from John Morrison over the next few weeks, Hardy finally defeated Morrison to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 edition of \"RAW\". On the November 6 episode of \"RAW\", Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to John Morrison. Just a week after he lost the title to Morrison, Hardy won it again on the November 13 edition of \"RAW\". This was Hardy's third time as Intercontinental Champion.\n\nOn the November 21 episode of \"Extreme Championship Wrestling\" Jeff teamed with his brother Matt for the first time in almost five years to defeat the Full Blooded Italians.\n\nWith Jeff Hardy still feuding with John Morrison in 2007, Jeff was challenged once again by John Morrison at New Year's Revolution 2007 for the Intercontinental Championship. Hardy once again defeated Morrison. Hardy later lost the title to Umaga. On the September 3 edition of \"RAW\", Jeff successfully captured his 4th WWE Intercontinental Championship by defeating Umaga for the title. At Armageddon 2007, Hardy will fight Triple H, with the winner getting a WWE Championship match at the Royal Rumble. This match was seen to many as the most important match of Hardy's career, as his win against Triple H has finally moved Hardy into the top level of the roster and the race for the WWE Championship. However, he lost to Randy Orton at the Royal Rumble. He will fight in the Elimination Chamber at No Way Out on February 17th for a place in the main event at Wrestlemania.\n\nJeff Hardy came second in the Elimation Chamber match, being beaten by Triple H. He has competed in various matches and was going to WrestleMania XXIV to fight in the Money in the Bank ladder match. Jeff lost the Intercontinental Championship to Chris Jericho on the March 10 edition of \"RAW\". The next day, it was confirmed that Jeff Hardy had been put on 60-day suspension, as he failed his second drug test. This meant that he did not compete at WrestleMania.\n\nJeff Hardy returned in the May 12, 2008 edition of \"RAW\", when General Manager William Regal told him he was to pay for his \"sins\" (read the paragraph before) by fighting Umaga. Jeff Hardy won with a \"\"Whisper in the Wind\"\".\n\nOn December 14, 2008 at Armageddon, he won the WWE Championship, his first world championship. During the next month, Hardy had several accidents, including a car accident and a pyrotechnics accident. Hardy's brother, Matt was revealed as the person behind the accidents, and interfered in his match at the Royal Rumble, causing Hardy to lose the WWE Championship to Edge. Matt defeated Hardy in an Extreme Rules match at WrestleMania XXV, but Hardy defeated Matt in an \"I Quit\" match at Backlash. At WWE Extreme Rules, Hardy defeated Edge in a ladder match to win the World Heavyweight Championship, but lost the championship immediately after wards to CM Punk, who cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase.\nHe then was in a two month feud with CM Punk. Ultimately, he lost when he entered a Loser Leaves Town Match in a steel cage.\n\nHardy returns to TNA on January 4, 2010. On March 8th, he saves Hulk Hogan And the pope D'anglo Dinero. He returns when he defeats then TNA World Heavyweight Champion AJ Styles in a non-title match. On April 4th, he was revealed as part of Hulk Hogan's team for Lockdown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "69877", "title": "Jeff Hardy"}

Ever since the Soviet Union was founded in 1917, it imprisoned people who spoke out against it. This was in fact no different from what Imperial Russia did in previous decades, with its katorga camps. But the Soviet Union camp system eventually grew to be one of the biggest prison systems in existence.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the Soviet Union imprisoned more and more people that disagreed with it. Its leaders believed it was better to put these people to work and make their labor and goods part of the national economy. In fact, two out of every hundred workers in the Soviet Union were gulag prisoners.\n\nThe Gulag system was officially created in 1930. During the 1930s there was a lot of fear of the Soviet government. Police officials were encouraged to round up and imprison many citizens for the most trivial offenses, even if they were innocent, and this caused the Gulag system to swell. By 1936, there were 5,000,000 prisoners in the gulags.\n\nEven though the Gulag is often associated with Siberia, labor camps were located across the Soviet Union. Siberian camps greatly simplified the problem of keeping prisoners from running away, though it was harder to feed these camps and move goods in and out because the camps were so far away.\n\nThe Gulag system died during the 1950s after the death of Joseph Stalin, and many people were released starting in 1954. The Gulag program was ended with a government decree in 1960.\n\nAccording to the Gulag administration, 10 million people were sent to the gulags between 1934 and 1947.

He not only sang in opera but also in other kinds of music. Known for his televised concerts, media appearances, and as one of the \"Three Tenors\" (the other two were Plácido Domingo and José Carreras). Pavarotti became enormously popular after a performance of the aria \"Nessun Dorma\" from Puccini’s opera \" Turandot \" for the opening ceremony of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. \n\nPavarotti was also well known for his award-winning charity work for raising money on behalf of refugees and the Red Cross.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti was born in Modena in north-central Italy. His father was a baker who also liked to sing, his mother worked in a cigar factory. The family did not have much money. During World War II they lived in the countryside on a farm. \n\nPavarotti started to listen to his father’s recordings of famous tenors of the day such as Beniamino Gigli, Giovanni Martinelli, Tito Schipa and Enrico Caruso. At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir. He was a normal boy who liked playing football and even thought of being a professional soccer goalkeeper, but his mother said he should be a teacher. His father said he would continue to support him, but once he was 30 years old he would have to earn money to support himself.\n\nPavarotti began singing lessons seriously in 1954 at the age of 19. He met a singer called Adua Veroni. He married her in 1961. Pavarotti had to earn money, so he became a teacher, and then an insurance salesman. For several years he just gave a few recitals without being paid for them. Then he had problems with his throat and stopped singing for a short time, and, surprisingly, this helped his voice to become really good.\n\nPavarotti made his opera début in the role of Rodolfo in \"La bohème\" by Puccini on April 29, 1961 in the town of Reggio Emilia. Soon he was singing in: the Vienna State Opera. He sang in the United States with Joan Sutherland. In 1965 he sang at La Scala, probably the most famous of all opera houses. He was singing in the famous Franco Zeffirelli production of \"La Bohème\", with Mirella Freni singing Mimi and Herbert von Karajan conducting. . His first appearance as Tonio in Donizetti's \"La fille du régiment\" took place at Covent Garden on June 2 of that year. It was his performances of this role that made people call him the \"King of the High Cs\" (The note C above Middle C is a very high note for a tenor to sing). \n\nPavarotti learned many more operatic roles and sang all over the world. In 1972, he sang in a production of \"La fille du régiment\" by Donizetti at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The audience were amazed when he sang nine high Cs. They applauded so much that he had 17 curtain calls. He sang the role of Rodolfo in (\"La bohème\") in the first \"Live From The Met\" telecast in March of 1977, which attracted one of the largest audiences ever for a televised opera. He won many Grammy awards and platinum and gold discs for his performances. \n\nIn 1976 Pavarotti sang at the Salzburg Festival appearing in a solo recital. He returned to the festival in 1978 with a recital and as the Italian singer in \"Der Rosenkavalier\", in 1983 with \"Idomeneo\", and both in 1985 and 1988 with solo recitals.\n\nIn 1977 there was a cover story in Time Magazine about him . That same year saw Pavarotti's return to the Vienna State Opera where he had not been for 14 years. With Herbert von Karajan conducting Pavarotti sang Manrico in \"Il trovatore\". In 1978, he appeared in a solo recital on \"Live from Lincoln Center\".\n\nHe made his international recital début at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri in 1973 as part of the college’s Fine Arts Program, now known as the Harriman-Jewell Series. Perspiring due to nerves and a cold, he kept a handkerchief in his hand all the way through the concert. The handkerchief was often associated with him after that during his solo performances.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, he set up \"The Pavarotti International Voice Competition\" for young singers, performing with the winners in 1982 in excerpts of \"La bohème\" and \"L'elisir d'amore\". The competition gave young people a chance to start their singing careers. It was repeated in 1982. They even travelled to China.\n\nIn 1992 Pavarotti sang in La Scala in a new Zeffirelli production of \"Don Carlo\" conducted by Riccardo Muti. Pavarotti's performance was heavily criticized by some observers and booed by some of the audience. The singer never returned to La Scala again after that.\n\nPavarotti became even more well-known throughout the world in 1990 when his sang Giacomo Puccini's aria, \"Nessun Dorma\" from \"Turandot\" which was used as the theme song for the BBC TV coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. The aria made him a kind of pop star and it remained his trademark song. This was followed by the hugely successful Three Tenors concert held on the eve of the World Cup final at the ancient Baths of Caracalla in Rome with fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras and conductor Zubin Mehta, which became the biggest selling classical record of all time. The high point of the concert happened when Pavarotti sang a famous part of di Capua's \"'O Sole Mio\". Domingo and Carreras copied him and the audience enjoyed it very much. This was one of the most remembered moments in opera of our time. Throughout the 1990s, Pavarotti appeared in many big outdoor concerts, including his televised concert in London's Hyde Park which drew a record audience of 150,000. In June 1993, more than 500,000 listeners gathered for his performance on the Great Lawn of New York's Central Park, while millions more around the world watched on television. The following September, in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, he sang for a crowd of about 300,000. Following on from the original 1990 concert, Three Tenors concerts were held during the Football World Cups; in Los Angeles in 1994, in Paris in 1998, and in Yokohama in 2002. \n\nPavarotti's rise to stardom was not without occasional difficulties, however. He got a reputation as \"The King of Cancellations\" because he often cancelled performances, and this made him unpopular with some opera houses.\n\nIn 1998, Pavarotti was given a very special award: the Grammy Legend Award.\n\nIn 2002, Pavarotti split with the Herbert Breslin, the man who had been his manager for 36 years. On 13 December 2003 he married his former personal assistant, Nicoletta Mantovani, with whom he already had a daughter. A second child did not survive, due to complications at the time of birth. He started his farewell tour in 2004, at the age of 69, performing one last time in old and new locations, after over 40 years on the stage.\n\nPavarotti gave his last performance in an opera at the New York Metropolitan Opera on March 13, 2004 for which he received a 12-minute standing ovation for his role as the painter Mario Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini's \"Tosca\".\n\nIn March 2005, Pavarotti had an operation to his neck. His health began to suffer. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in July 2006 and died of the disease on 6 September 2007 at his home in Modena, aged 71.\n", "id": "69930", "title": "Luciano Pavarotti"}

It is a kind of tort. The law calls someone negligent if he hurts someone else, or someone else's property, because he was not careful enough. In a legal case about negligence, the person who brings the lawsuit is called the plaintiff and the person who is being sued is called the defendant.\n\nThe law about negligence is different in many places (or jurisdictions), but for the plaintiff to win, he or she usually has to prove at least four things:\n\n\nThe defendant's \"duty\" is what the law says that he or she has to do. Usually, the law says that people have to be \"reasonable\". That means they have to be careful, use good judgment, and not be unfair to other people. In some cases, the law tells people that they have special duties. In other cases, the law says that people have no duties at all. For example, in most places that use the common law, a person has no legal duty to rescue another person from harm, even if the rescue is very easy and does not cost anything or put anyone else in danger.\n\nWhen people do not follow their duty, the law says that they \"breach\" their duty.\n\nA plaintiff can usually bring a lawsuit only if he or she has been hurt, or has some other legal harm. The law tells people what kinds of injuries people can sue about.\n\nA plaintiff can usually sue a defendant only if that defendant was the one who hurt the plaintiff. In many cases, it is easy to figure out who hurt someone. But sometimes people get hurt in ways that nobody expects. For example, a defendant might be driving while drunk, and he might hit an electric pole. The electric pole could fall down and cause a neighborhood to lose electric power. As a result, a person two miles away might trip and fall in the dark. The law will decide whether the drunk driver \"caused\" the person to trip and fall.\n\nThe word \"negligence\" is sometimes used outside the law in a similar way.

AFMs provide pictures of atoms on or in surfaces. Like the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), the purpose of the AFM is to look at objects on the atomic level. In fact, the AFM may be used to look at individual atoms. It is commonly used in Nanotechnology.\n\nThe AFM can do some things that the SEM cannot do. The AFM can sometimes provide higher resolution than the SEM. Further, the AFM does not need to operate in a vacuum. In fact, the AFM can operate in ambient air or water, so it can be used to see surfaces of biological samples like living cells.\n\nThe AFM works by employing an ultra-fine needle attached to a cantilever beam. The tip of the needle runs over the ridges and valleys in the material being imaged, \"feeling\" the surface. As the tip moves up and down due to the surface, the cantilever deflects. In one basic configuration, a laser shines on the cantilever at an oblique angle, and allows for the direct measurement of the deflection in the cantilever by simply changing the angle of incidence for the laser beam. In this way, an image may be created revealing the configuration of the molecules being imaged by the machine.\n\nThere are many different operating modes for an AFM. One is the \"contact mode\", where the tip is simply moved across the surface and the cantilever deflections are measured. Another mode is called \"tapping mode\", because the tip is tapped against the surface as it travels along. By controlling how hard the tip is tapped, the AFM can move away from the surface when the needle feels a ridge, so that it will not hit against the surface when it moves across. This mode is also useful for biological samples, because it is less likely to damage a soft surface.\nThese are the basic modes most commonly used, however there are different names and methods such as \"intermittent contact mode\", \"non-contact mode\", \"dynamic\" and \"static\" modes and more, but are often variations on the above described tapping and contact modes.\n\n", "id": "70019", "title": "Atomic force microscope"}

Usually the royal house of Saxony means the rulers of the Kingdom of Saxony.

One dynasty of the House of Wettin (the Dukes of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg) became extinct because there were no more male children to inherit.\n\nThe remaining members of the family divided their various lands between them. The duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld gave up Saalfeld and instead got the duchy of Gotha. Saalfeld became part of Saxe-Meiningen, which also took Hildburghausen when the Dule of Saxe-Hildburghausen became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nOn 12 November 1826 Ernst III of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld became Ernst I Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Duke of Jülich \"(Juelich)\", Cleves and Berg, also Engern and Westphalia, Prince of Lichtenberg, Landgrave in Thuringia, Markgrave of Meißen \"(Meissen)\", Count of Hennerberg, Count of the Mark and Ravensburg, Lord of Ravenstein and Tonna.\n\nErnst had two sons. His younger son, Albert, married his cousin Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Saxe-Coburg and Gotha became the name of the royal house of the United Kingdom from 1901 until 1917 (the reign of Edward VII), when the name was changed the Windsor because of hatred of anything German in World War I.\n\nErnst I died in 1844 and his elder son and successor, Ernst II, ruled until he died in 1893. As he had no children childless, the throne of the Duchy passed to the male descendant's of Ernst's late brother Albert the Prince Consort, husband of Queen Victoria. But, the Duchies did not want to be joined to Great Britain, so their constitutions stopped the King and heir apparent of Great Britain from becoming Duke if other eligible male heirs exist. Therefore after Edward, Prince of Wales, came his next brother, Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Alfred's only son, also named Alfred, committed suicide in 1899, so when Duke Alfred died in 1900, he was succeeded by his nephew, Charles Edward the Duke of Albany, the sixteen-year-old son of Queen Victoria's youngest son, Leopold.

The two Duchies became separate states, but soon joined with bigger states. Saxe-Coburg became a part of Bavaria, and Saxe-Gotha merged with other small states to form the new state of Thuringia in 1920 in the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe capitals of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha were Coburg and Gotha.

The person who came up with the show was Mark Burnett, who earlier successfully brought the British series \"Survivor\" to the US. Until 2016, it was hosted by then-businessman Donald Trump, but in 2005, there was a spin-off hosted by Martha Stewart.\n\nIn the program, a group of 15 to 18 people hope to get a job worth US$250,000 to run one of Trump's companies. In each episode, the contestants are split into two teams who each have to do a task. The task could be selling something, making an advertisement, or running a stall at an event. In the end, one team will win (usually because they have made the most money) and they will get a prize of some sort. The people on the team that loses have to explain to Trump what went wrong, and at the end of every episode, Trump will say \"You're fired!\" to one or more people from this team, who then no longer appears in the show for the rest of the season. However, in the very last episode, Trump says \"You're hired!\" to the person who wins the grand prize instead.\n\nThe American version of the show had fifteen seasons. In the first six seasons and the 10th season, the people who appeared on the show were ordinary people. In seasons 7 to 9 and from season 11 onwards, these people were celebrities, who try to win money for charities instead of running one of Trump's companies. This version of the show is called The Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nTrump hosted the show until he became President of the United States in 2016. The most recent season, which aired in 2017, had Arnold Schwarzenegger in charge, but Trump continued to be the executive producer. However, Schwarzenegger left the show at the end of the season after he was criticized by Trump for low ratings.\n\nMany countries have their own version of \"The Apprentice\", each having a different person in charge. For example, the version from the United Kingdom has Alan Sugar.\n\n", "id": "70039", "title": "The Apprentice"}

It was devised by Fintan Coyle and Cathy Dunning, and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment Department. It has since been replicated around the world. It was hosted by Craig Charles (2001-2002) and Claudia Winkleman (2002) and narrated by Chris Goldwell. The series features a team of contestants who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The object of each round is to create a chain of consecutive correct answers to earn an increasing amount of money for a communal pot within a specific time limit. The number of \"links\" in a chain are equal to the number of the contestants at the start of the show. An incorrect answer breaks the chain and loses all the money accumulated up to that point; however, a contestant can say \"bank\" prior to their question being asked, the accumulated money is stored, and the chain resets to zero. Six contestants competed to win a top amount of 50 000 (2001-2002) and 100 000 (2002) by playing a quiz/elimination contest. At the end of each round, each player is voted off as \"The Weakest Link\".\nThe original format features a team of six contestants who take turns answering general knowledge questions. The object of each round is to create a chain of six consecutive correct answers and earn an increasing amount for a single communal pot within a certain time limit. An incorrect answer breaks the chain and loses any money earned in that chain. However, before their question is asked, a contestant can choose to bank the current amount of money earned in a chain to a safe pot, after which the chain starts afresh. A contestant's decision not to bank, in anticipation that they will be able to correctly answer the upcoming question allows the money to grow, as each successive correct answer earns proportionally more money.\n\nWhen the allotted time for each round ends, any money not banked is lost, and if the host is in the middle of asking a question, or has asked a question but the contestant has yet to answer, the question is abandoned. Occasionally, the host gives the correct answer whether the contestant is able to answer the question correctly or not. The round automatically ends if the team successfully reaches the maximum amount for the round before the allotted time expires, and the next person says \"Bank\". Each round thereafter is reduced by 10 seconds as players are eliminated. The remaining two players have 90 seconds on the clock for the triple stakes round.\n\nThe first person to be asked a question in the first round is the player whose name is the first alphabetically in the original version. Every subsequent round starts with the \"strongest link\"—the player with the most correct answers—from the previous round, unless that person has been voted off, in which case the second strongest answers first.\n\nThe money tree was as follows:\n\n2001-2002\n\n2002 \nAt the end of each round, contestants must vote one player out of the game. Until the beginning of the next round, only the television audience knows exactly who the strongest and weakest links are statistically due to Goldwell's narration. While the contestants work as a team when answering questions, they are at this point encouraged to be ruthless with one another. Players often decide to vote off weaker rivals, but occasionally opt to eliminate stronger players as well. After the revealing of the votes, the host will interrogate the players on their choice of voting, the reasons behind their choice, as well as about their background and their interests. After interrogation, the player with the most votes is given a stern \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" and must walk off the stage in what is called the \"Walk of shame.\" In the event of a tie, the strongest link has the final decision about who is eliminated. If they voted for a tied player, they have the option of sticking with their vote or changing it. The strongest link usually sticks with their original choice, unless another player in the tie has voted for them. Occasionally, the strongest link has voted for someone who is not in the tie, and so is forced to change their decision one way or the other.\n\nThe final two contestants work together in a final round identical to the previous ones; however, all money banked at the end of this round is tripled and added to the current money pool, forming the final total for the game. At the end of this round, there is no elimination, with the game instead moving to a head to head round.\n\nFor the head to head round, the remaining two players are each required to answer five questions each in a penalty shootout format. The strongest link from the previous round chooses who goes first. Whoever has the most correct answers at the end of the round wins the game. In the event of a tie, the game goes to \"sudden death\". Each player continues to be asked questions as usual, until one person answers a question correctly and the other incorrectly.\n\nThe winner of the game takes home all of the money accumulated in the prize pool for the game, and the loser leaves with nothing, like all previous eliminated players. From 2001-2002, the maximum is 50 000 and In 2002, the maximum cash jackpot is 100 000.\n\n\"The Weakest Link\" won the CableACE Award in 2002 for Best Exellence. \n\n", "id": "70041", "title": "The Weakest Link"}

(It is not clear what his real name actually was; some historians think that his last name may really have been Thatch.) He attacked ships in the Caribbean and the American colonies. His flagship ship was the captured French slave ship \"La Concorde\" which Blackbeard renamed \"Queen Anne's Revenge\". About 1718 it ran aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina and was abandoned.\n\nBlackbeard often fought wearing a big feathered tricorn hat, and with lots of swords, knives, and pistols. Some pictures show him with lighted rope matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle. The matches burned slowly and gave of lots of smoke. They were designed to make him look frightening. He probably got the idea from seeing the burning rope was used to light the gunpowder in cannons and guns. (These old fashioned guns were called \"matchlocks\", later a flint was used to make a spark, these were called flintlock guns). No one knows how many wives Blackbeard had. The book \"A General History of the Pyrates\" says that he had as many as fourteen wives, but he was not legally married to most of them. \n\nBlackbeard is thought to have been born in Bristol. Teach went to sea when he was very young. He served on an English ship in the War of the Spanish Succession, privateering in the Spanish West Indies and along the Spanish Main. At the war's end in 1713, Teach, like many other privateers, turned to piracy.\n\nTeach began as a pirate under Benjamin Hornigold. In 1716, Hornigold retired, taking advantage of an amnesty offered to former privateers by the British government. Teach then took command of his own ship.\n\nDuring the next two years Blackbeard attacked merchant ships, forcing them to allow his crew to board their ship. The pirates would seize all of the valuables, food, liquor, and weapons. Ironically, despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone.\n\nThe governor of North Carolina sent two ships after Blackbeard. The most complete account of the following events comes from the \"Boston News-Letter\": \nTeach was said to have been shot five times and stabbed more than twenty times before he died and was decapitated. Legends about his death immediately sprang up. His headless body, was thrown overboard, but swam three times around the ship before sinking. Teach's head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship. Captain Maynard had to keep the head to claim his prize when he returned home. Later, Teach's head hung from a pike in Bath, Somerset.\n", "id": "70052", "title": "Edward Teach"}
