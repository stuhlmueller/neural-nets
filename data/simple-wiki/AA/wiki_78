His geological discoveries were made when, as a young man, he was a surveyor, and so travelled the country. Smith's greatest discovery was that sedimentary rocks of a similar age held fossils of a similar type. So he could identify them when they were at the surface in different parts of the country.\n\nSmith put together the geological history of Britain (England and Wales) and southern Scotland into a single record. At the time his map was published he was almost unknown to the scientific community. His humble family and education meant he did not mix easily in learned society. His work was plagiarised, he was financially ruined, and he spent time in debtors' prison. It was only later in his life that Smith got recognition for what he had done.\n\nIn 1799 Smith produced the first large scale geologic map of the area around Bath, Somerset. Before, he only knew how to draw the vertical extent of the rocks, but not how to display them horizontally. Then, in the Somerset County Agricultural Society, he found a map showing the types of soil and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. The different types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. He took a few rock types, each with its own colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.\n\nIn 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become \"The map that changed the world\". \n\nIn 1815 he published the first geological map of Britain. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours; the maps were hand coloured. The map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. He also published his \"Delineation of the strata of England\" in the same year. In another of his books \"Strata identified by organized fossils\" (London 1816–1819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossils. These fossil assemblages could be used to match rocks between regions. This marks Smith as an important figure in the history of stratigraphy.\n\nIn 1817 he drew a remarkable geological vertical section from Snowdon to London. Unfortunately, his maps were soon copied (plagiarised) and sold for prices lower than he was asking. He went into debt and finally became bankrupt.\n\nOn 31 August 1819 Smith was released from King's Bench Prison in London, a debtor's prison. He returned to his home at 15 Buckingham Street to find a bailiff at the door and his home and property seized. Smith again worked as an travelling surveyor for years. One of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised him and took steps to get him the respect he deserved. Between 1824 and 1826 he lived and worked in Scarborough. There he was responsible for the building of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast. The Rotunda was re-opened as 'Rotunda – The William Smith Museum of Geology', on 9 May 2008.\n\n", "id": "337427", "title": "William Smith (geologist)"}

A daughter of the river Sangarius picked an almond and laid it in her bosom, where the almond disappeared. She then had a child, a baby boy named Attis.\n\nHer orgiastic cult dominated the central and north-western districts of Asia Minor, and was introduced into Greece via the island of Samothrake and the Boiotian town of Thebes. Cybele was closely associated with a number of Greek goddesses, firstly Rhea, the Greek mother of the gods (Meter Theon), but sometimes also Demeter (especially in the Samothrakian cult), Aphrodite (on Mount Ida) and Artemis (in Karia).

The gods feared Agdistis because she held all the powers of creation within her body. Dionysus tricked her into castrating herself, and from then on she was known as the goddess Cybele. The blood from her severed gentials fertilized the earth, and from that spot an almond tree grew. One day the nymph Nana picked an almond from the tree, and held it against her chest, the almond vanished and she became pregnant with Attis.\n\nSome ancient writers say Agdistis is the same as Cybele, and worshiped under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly separate from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as an epithet of Cybele. Although primarily an Anatolian goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a lot of territory. By 250 BC it had spread to Egypt, and later to Attica, Rhamnus around 80 BC (where there was a sanctuary of Agdistis), and later in Lesbos and Panticapeum. \n", "id": "337451", "title": "Agdistis"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337535", "text": "Biological species concept\n\nThe biological species concept gives an explanation of how species form (speciation). A biological species is a group of individuals that can breed together (panmixia). However, they cannot breed with other groups. In other words, the group is reproductively isolated from other groups.\n\nAccording to Ernst Mayr, a new species forms when an existing species splits. A similar idea had been suggested in the 19th century by Moritz Wagner. Dobzhansky described the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of new species. Once a species lives in two different areas, the geographical isolation makes breeding between the groups reduce or stop. Each group develops features which make breeding between them work less well. Eventually, each group becomes a 'good' biological species, because the two species do not reproduce with each other even when they are together.\n\nThis is still considered the most common reason for species splitting, and has the technical name of allopatric speciation. It is contrasted with sympatric speciation where speciation takes place even though all the members live in the same area.\n\nThe biological species is the main reason for classifying living things, but applying it in practice is not easy. Good examples of this are the following:\n\nWhat this is saying is that, in practice, the biological species concept is not sufficient by itself to decide on the classification of animals.\n\nIn 1686 John Ray introduced a non-evolutionary biological concept. To him, species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.\n\nThe idea of a species as a physical type of organism had a long history. This survives as the concept of a type specimen in taxonomy. It was the way Linnaeus worked in his binomial classification, and is still useful for amateur naturalists today. \n\nIn the \"Origin\", Charles Darwin said that species were labels which experts gave on the basis of their observations.\n\nBut twenty years before, he had a much better idea. He thought of species as maintained by reproductive isolation. He even says \"Hence species may be good ones and differ scarcely at all in any external character\". Here he quotes the two sibling species of leaf warbler discovered in England by Gilbert White in 1768. At this early stage in his career, Darwin came very close to the modern biological species concept.\n\nIn the last 70 years two ideas have dominated the way professional biologists think about species.\n\nThe first is the population genetics concept. This is where a species is seen as a group which can mate together even though they are all to some extent different. It amounts to saying that a species is a gene pool.\n\nThe second is the use of DNA sequence analysis to show whether similar-looking species are genetically different from each other. This is especially useful when it is not practical to do breeding experiments.\n\nSibling species are often called cryptic (hidden) species because their differences can only be seen by analysing their DNA. They are very common in the marine environment. \n\nMany cryptic species exist in all habitats. In the marine bryozoan \"Celleporella hyalina\", DNA sequence analysis was used to show that more than ten ecologically distinct species that had been diverging for many millions of years.\n\nEvidence from the identification of cryptic species means that older estimates of global species richness are too low. For example, mitochondrial DNA research suggests there are at least 11 genetically distinct populations of giraffes. Similarly, the Amazonian frog \"Eleutherodactylus ockendeni\" is at least three different species which diverged over 5 million years ago.\n", "id": "337535", "title": "Biological species concept"}

There are an estimated 100,000 seamounts around the globe, but only a few have been studied. Seamounts come in all shapes and sizes, and follow a distinctive pattern of growth, activity, and death. In recent years, several active seamounts have been observed, for example Loihi seamount in the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.\n\nSeamounts are one of the most common oceanic ecosystems in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, and their raised position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and cetacea alike. Their effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are concerns about the effect of fishing on seamount ecosystems. There are well-documented cases of stock decline. 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which literally scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.\n\nMost seamounts are not yet to be studied, or even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies used to collect data. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses.

In biology it is in tune with Darwinian ideas of slowly changing species as opposed to big, rapid changes\n\nGradualism is one of the defining features of political liberalism and reformism. It is against abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprisings. Instead, change ought to be brought about in small, discrete steps.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating segregation. The government wanted to try to integrate African-Americans and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:\n\nThis is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.— Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC\n\nCharles Lindblom was an influential professor and author who believed in muddling through (\"incrementalism\") as the right way to go. He pointed out the connexions between the political system, the market-place and democratic freedom.\n\nIn the natural sciences, gradualism is a theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with catastrophism. The theory was proposed in 1795 by James Hutton, a Scottish physician and gentlemen farmer, and was later was the basis for Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\". William Whewell called the idea 'uniformitarianism'. It formed the basis of early evolutionary theory.\n\nCharles Darwin was influenced by Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\". Everything we see from the past is explained by processes we can see going on today. The present is key to the past. So Darwin thought evolutionary must occur gradually, not in jumps ('saltations'), since we do not see big changes going on today. Extreme and rapid changes in an organism would be most likely to be fatal. It is almost universally agreed that complex organs such as the eye must have evolved by many small steps rather than by one or two mutations.\n\n\"Phyletic gradualism\" is a term coined by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge to contrast with their model of punctuated equilibrium. This proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability or stasis, punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.\n", "id": "337670", "title": "Gradualism"}

It is in the middle of a district called Lomellina, a great rice-growing centre. Vigevano received the honorary title of city with a declaration of Duke Francis II Sforza on February 2, 1532. Vigevano is well known for its beautiful Renaissance \"\"Piazza Ducale\"\", in the middle of the town.\n\nVigevano dates back to the 10th century AD, when it was one of Lombard king Arduin's favourite places because of the good hunting. \n\nVigevano was a Ghibelline township, favoring the Emperor and was therefore invaded and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it finally gave itself up to Azzone Visconti, after which it shared the fortunes of Milan. The Church of S. Pietro Martire (St. Peter Martyr) was built, with the neighbouring Dominican convent, by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1445. In the last years of Visconti's control it kept a siege by Francesco Sforza. Once he was settled in power in Lombardy, Sforza secured the erection of Vigevano as the seat of a bishop and provided its revenues.\n\nVigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492–94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), the great patron born in the town, who changed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is credited with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that travels between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d'Este.\n\n", "id": "337859", "title": "Vigevano"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337929", "text": "Hotel Mario\n\nHotel Mario is a puzzle game developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media and Nintendo for the CD-i in 1994. The primary character of the game is Mario, who must find Princess Toadstool by going through seven Koopa hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into many levels, and what the player must do is close all doors on each level. Killing a Koopaling on the hotel's final level takes the player to the next building. After Nintendo decided not to have Philips create an add-on for the Super NES, they gave Philips permission to use five of their characters in games for Philips' CD-i. There wasn't a lot of time for the games to be developed and there was little funding. The games resulting from the license were widely criticized, with \"Hotel Mario\" being known as one of the worst \"Mario\"-centered games, due to the animation of the shutting doors, the non-working controls and especially known for the cutscenes that used full motion video. The CD-i was considered a commercial failure and the games became valuable because of their rarity.\n\nThe player controls Mario or his brother Luigi in two-player mode. The player has to complete all levels of the seven hotels in the game. The first six hotels contain 10 levels, and the last 2 hotels contains 15 levels. The player to shut every door before time runs out to get to the next level. The game does not show how to shut the doors. Elevators, which work differently depending on the hotel, let the player to go between the five floors of the level. The amount of points the player gets in the game will depend on how fast they can beat the level. Every stage has its own title screen, which is how the game can be saved. The screens are also used to enter hotel levels that were already played and the map of the Mushroom Kingdom, which allows the player to access any visited hotel.\n\nWhile trying to close the doors, the player must avoid certain hazards. Mario will lose a life if he touches an enemy, runs out of time, runs off the edge of the floor he is on, or if all the doors are open. Enemies in the game are mostly regular \"Mario\" series creatures, such as Goombas, Koopas, Boos, and their variations. The opponent on the last level of each hotel is one of the Koopalings, who use different methods to try to kill Mario.\n\nIn his normal state, Mario can take one hit from an enemy and kill most of the monsters with a stomp. By opening doors, the player can find power-ups, which grant different powers. A Super Mushroom transforms Mario into Super Mario, making Mario glow and have the strength to take two enemy hits. If the player finds another mushroom while Mario is in the Super Mario form, the item turns into a Fire Flower. When grabbing it, Mario becomes Fire Mario and can throw fireballs to kill enemies. A 1-up mushroom known as \"Extra Mario Mushroom\" or \"Toad\" can only be found by Fire Mario. Another way to earn an extra life is collecting 30 coins. The player can also get a Star Man, which makes Mario temporarily able to knock any enemy off the screen by simply touching them.\nBowser has turned the Mushroom Kingdom into a hotel resort for the use of himself and his children. The land is renamed \"Klub Koopa Resort\" because of this. Each hotel in the area is protected by one of the Koopalings and their henchmen. The hotels represent different building types with many different locations, including a tree, a mine and a cloud. When Mario and Luigi are invited to a picnic by Princess Toadstool, Mario and Luigi enter the Mushroom Kingdom. At the entrance, however, they find a message from Bowser. They find out that Bowser has taken control over the kingdom and established seven hotels there, at one of which Princess Toadstool is being held as a \"permanent guest\". As they visit the first six hotels, Mario and Luigi find the Princess many times, but on every occasion she disappears out of their sight, ending up in another hotel. They eventually enter another land where Bowser himself lives. With the hotel's owner killed, the brothers run away from the building with Princess Toadstool before it falls apart. The Princess, now able to rule her kingdom in peace, thanks the Mario brothers for saving her, giving them both a kiss.\n\nIn May 1991, after failing to develop a CD-ROM-based add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with Sony, Nintendo signed a deal with Philips to develop the add-on. However, after seeing the negative reviews of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo no longer considered the add-on profitable anymore, and the project was stopped entirely. As part of dissolving the deal, Nintendo gave Philips the license to use five of their characters, including Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool, to be featured in their games for the CD-i. Philips used the characters to create games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give comments on the look of the characters. The \"Mario\" characters were going to be used in \"Super Mario's Wacky Worlds\", but the game was cancelled with only some prototype versions being programmed. While \"Wacky Worlds\" was planned as a CD-i adaptation of the side-scrolling platformer video game \"Super Mario World\", \"Hotel Mario\" was made into a puzzle game in which level areas were limited to a single screen. Unlike the \"Legend of Zelda\"-related games also for the CD-i, the game was not developed by a third-party company, but by Philips' development team Fantasy Factory.\n\nMany full motion video cutscenes were animated for \"Hotel Mario\". The videos show Mario and Luigi as they get to the next hotel, telling each other and giving hints to the player such as: \"If you need instructions on how to get through the hotels, check out the enclosed instruction book!\". The voices of the Mario Brothers were provided by Marc Graue, with Jocelyn Benford doing the voice-over for Princess Toadstool. On top of the full motion video capabilities of the CD-i, \"Hotel Mario\" made use of the system’s internal clock by showing messages that changed according to the date.\n\nThe backgrounds of the hotel stages were designed by freelance artist Trici Venola. After seeing \"Hotel Mario\"'s first version—which Venola called \"mechanical\" and \"visually no fun\"—she and art director Jeff Zoern decided to use elements from Disney and J. R. R. Tolkien to improve the game's visual style. Drawings of the stages were made out of several blocks, each of which featured one detail. The first item Venola created for all hotels was the door. Every building took one week to complete and was designed according to a specific theme. For example, a gothic design was used for Bowser's hotel.\n\nUpon its release, \"Hotel Mario\" received negative reviews from video game magazines \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" and \"GamePro\". Critics commented that \"Hotel Mario\"s gameplay was simple yet addicting. \"GamePro\", while calling the game fun, believed that it would soon bore players, and gave it a fun factor of 2.5 out of 5. When \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" named Mario the greatest video game character in 2005, they considered \"Hotel Mario\" his most embarrassing moment. Similarly, it was considered as the worst Mario game of all time by ScrewAttack, who criticized the game for its audio and controls, as well as for being solely \"based on shutting doors.\" GameDaily included \"Hotel Mario\" in its list of the worst games starring Nintendo mascots, stating its gameplay lacked identifiable Mario elements mainly used in the series. The game was also listed as the worst 2D platformer in the \"Mario\" series by N-Europe. The site found the Koopaling battles \"uniquely bad\", calling the game itself a \"steaming turd\".\n\nIGN said that \"Hotel Mario\" was better than the \"The Legend of Zelda\" titles, but noted that closing doors was not \"a strong enough hook for an entire game.\" Chris Kohler of \"Wired\" magazine saw \"Hotel Mario\" as \"a puzzle game with no puzzles\", assuming it was one of the reasons why Nintendo was not impressed by the CD-ROM medium. The game was referred to as \"craptastic\" by GamesRadar and \"little more than a really rubbish version of \"Elevator Action\"\" by Eurogamer.\n\nIn its 1994 review, \"GamePro\" rated \"Hotel Mario\"'s graphics at 3.5 and sound at 4 out of 5, saying that \"the only intriguing aspects of this game are the well-fashioned animated sequences.\" Years after the game was released, the cut scenes were also criticized among video game websites, and were called \"outright terrifying\" by 1UP.com. IGN described them as \"abysmal\" and \"a bad flip-book of images printed out of Microsoft Paint. The quality of the voice acting was also questioned. Both 1UP.com and IGN thought the voices were unfitting for the characters and did not achieve the same playfulness as those of Mario and Luigi's current voice artist Charles Martinet. \"Hotel Mario\" was listed in the Top 20 Worst Mario Games of all time.\n", "id": "337929", "title": "Hotel Mario"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338075", "text": "Croup\n\nCroup (or laryngotracheobronchitis) is caused by a virus and leads to swelling inside the throat. This swelling causes problems with normal breathing. People with croup can have a \"barking\"cough, stridor (a high-pitched wheezing sound), and hoarseness. Croup symptoms often get worse at night. Taking steroids by mouth can treat the condition. Sometimes epinephrine is used in more severe cases. Hospitalization is rarely required.\n\nDoctors decide if a person has croup after they have eliminated other possibilities (for example, an airway foreign body). Blood tests, X-rays, and cultures are not needed. Croup is common. About 15% of children between 6 months and 5–6 years old get croup. Teenagers and adults rarely get croup.\n\nCroup symptoms include a \"barking\" cough, stridor ( a high pitched sound typically when breathing in), hoarseness, and difficult breathing that are worse at night. The \"barking\" cough can sound like a seal or sea lion. Crying can make the wheezing worse; wheezing can mean that the airways are narrowed. As croup gets worse, the wheezing can decrease.\n\nOther symptoms are fever, symptoms typical of the common cold), and the skin between the ribs pulling in when the child breathes. Drooling or a sick appearance can mean a different illness. The virus infection leads to swelling in the throat and air passages that can make breathing difficult.\n\nMost croup is caused by a virus infection. Some people call severe laryngotracheitis croup. This disease is caused by a milder virus. Croup also can be laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. These diseases are caused by bacteria and are more severe.\n\nIn 75% of cases, the parainfluenza virus, mainly types 1 and 2, causes croup. Other viruses that can cause croup include influenza A and B, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Spasmodic croup (croup with barking) does not have the usual signs of infection, such as fever, sore throat, and increased white blood cell count). Treating spasmodic croup is the same as treating regular croup.\n\nBacterial croup includes laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\" causes laryngeal diphtheria; bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis come from a virus infection, followed by a bacteria infection. The most common bacteria that cause croup are\"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\", \"Hemophilus influenzae\", and \"Moraxella catarrhalis\".\n\nCroup is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. The first step is to make sure it is not another condition that can block the upper airway, especially epiglottitis (an inflammation of the tissue that covers the trachea or windpipe) , something in the airway, subglottic stenosis (narrowing of the airway below the vocal cords), angioedema (swelling underneath the skin), retropharyngeal abscess (pus in the back of the throat), and bacterial tracheitis (bacterial infection in the trachea).\n\nAn X-ray of the neck is not routine, but if it is done, it can show a narrowing of the trachea, called the steeple sign, because the narrow shape looks like a church steeple. The steeple sign does not appear in half of cases.\n\nBlood tests and viral cultures (tests for the virus) can cause irritate the airway. Cultures of the virus, obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration (using a tube to suck mucus out of the nose), are used to confirm the exact cause. These cultures are restricted to people doing research. If a person does not improve with standard treatment, further tests can be done to check for bacteria.\n\nSeverity\n\nThe most common system for describing the severity of croup is the Westley score. This test is used for research, but does not help the person with croup. Points are given for five factors: level of consciousness, cyanosis (blue skin coloring), stridor (wheezing), air entry, and retractions (skin on the chest pulling in). The table to the right lists the points given for each factor; the final score ranges from 0 to 17.\n\n\n85% of children going to the emergency department have mild disease. Severe croup is rare–less than 1% of cases.\n\nImmunization (vaccines) for influenza and diphtheria can prevent croup.\n\nIt is important to keep children with croup as calm as possible. Children often are given steroids, but epinephrine is used in severe cases. If the amount of blood oxygen is under 92%, the child needs oxygen. People with severe croup can be hospitalized for observation. If oxygen is needed, \"blow-by\" administration (holding an oxygen source near the face of the child) is better than an oxygen mask, because it is less likely to upset a child than an oxygen mask is. With treatment, less than 0.2% of people need endotracheal intubation(a tube placed into the airway).\n\nCorticosteroids, such as dexamethasone and budesonide, can be used to treat croup. People begin to improve a lot within six hours after taking steroids. Steroids work when given by mouth, injection, or inhalation (breathing them in), but taking them by mouth is best. Most of the time, a single dose is enough. Dexamethasone at doses of 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg appear to be all equally good.\n\nModerate to severe croup can be helped with nebulized epinephrine(an inhaled solution that widens the airway). While epinephrine reduces croup severity within 10–30 minutes, the benefits last for only about 2 hours. If symptoms improve for 2–4 hours after treatment and no other complications happen, the child typically can leave the hospital.\n\nThere is not enough evidence that other treatments for croup are helpful. Clinical studies do not show that breathing hot steam or humidified air is helpful and currently it rarely is used. Medical professionals do not want people to use cough medicines, which containdextromethorphan and/or guiafenesin. Clinical studies also do not support inhaling heliox (a mixture of helium and oxygen) to make it easier to breath. Since most cases of croup is are diseases, antibiotics are not used unless bacteria are also suspected. The antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended for bacterial infections. In severe cases associated with influenza A or B, theanti neuraminidase inhibitors can be given.\n\nMost of the time, croup caused by a virus is a short-term disease. Croup rarely causes death from respiratory failure and/or cardiac arrest. Symptoms improve within two days, but can last for up to seven days. Other uncommon complications include bacterial tracheitis (infection of the trachea), pneumonia (lung infection), and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).\n\nAbout 15% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5–6 years will get croup. Croup accounts for about 5% of hospital admissions for this age group. In rare cases, children as young as 3 months and as old as 15 years have croup. Males are affected 50% more frequently than are females; croup is more common in autumn (fall).\n\nThe word \"croup\" comes from the Early Modern English verb \"croup,\" meaning \"to cry hoarsely\"; the name was first used for the disease in Scotland. Diphtheritic croup has been known since the time of Homer's Ancient Greece. In 1826, Bretonneau distinguished croup from a virus and croup due to diphtheria. The French called croup from a virus \"faux-croup,\" using \"croup\" for a disease caused by the diphtheria bacteria. Croup due to diphtheria has become nearly unknown since most people are immunized.\n", "id": "338075", "title": "Croup"}

It is the third movement in \"The Nutcracker pas de deux\". This \"pas de deux\" is from Act 2 of the 1892 ballet \"The Nutcracker\". It is danced by the principal female dancer. The number was choreographed by Lev Ivanov to music written by Tchaikovsky. \n\nChoreographer Marius Petipa wanted the Sugar Plum Fairy's music to sound like \"drops of water shooting from a fountain\". Tchaikovsky found the ideal instrument to do this job in Paris in 1891. It was then that he came across the recently invented \"celesta\". This instrument looked like a piano. It sounded like bells. Tchaikovsky wrote, \"[The celesta is] midway between a tiny piano and a Glockenspiel, with a divinely wonderful sound.\" He wanted to use the celesta in \"The Nutcracker\". He asked his publisher to buy one. He wanted to keep the purchase a secret. He did not want other Russian composers to \"get wind of it and ... use it for unusual effects before me.\" \n\nTchaikovsky introduced the \"celesta\" to Russian music lovers on 19 March 1892 when the \"Nutcracker Suite\" was performed for the Russian Musical Society in St. Petersburg. The instrument is forever identified with the Sugar Plum Fairy. It is heard in other parts of Act 2 of \"The Nutcracker\" besides the Sugar Plum Fairy's dance. The \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" is one of the ballet's best known musical numbers. It is often \"jazzed up\" for television commercials at Christmas time. \n\nThere is little information about the Sugar Plum Fairy's original choreography. In the first performances the \"presto\" at the end of the dance was cut. According to Roland John Wiley, the dance appears to have consisted of short \"pointe\" steps, \"petite batteries\", and \"attitudes\" in various combinations. He describes the dance as having \"a sense of dynamic build up: from delicate angularity ... to circular shapes, to plainer but more virtuoso movements\"pirouettes\" to \"rounds de jambe\"near the end.\" \n\nThe first Sugar Plum Fairy was Antonietta Dell'Era. She was a good technician, but Tchaikovsky's brother Modest described her as pudgy and unattractive. Although the Sugar Plum Fairy is the \"prima ballerina\" of \"The Nutcracker\", she has very little dancing to do. This was a considered a major defect among early critics. Dell'Era tried to expand the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy in later performances by putting a gavotte by Czibulka into the score.\n\n", "id": "338205", "title": "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"}

But some are different.\n\nNegative one is related to Euler's identity. This is because the identity states formula_1\n\nIn computer science, −1 is a common initial value for integers. It is also used to show that a variable has no useful information.\n\nMultiplying a number by −1 is the same as changing the sign on the number. This can be proved using the distributive law and the axiom at 1 is the multiplicative identity, that is, a number multiplied by 1 is the number itself. So, for x real, we have\n\nwhere we used the fact that 0 multiplied by any real number x equals 0, shown by cancellation from the equation\n\nIn other words,\n\nso (−1) · \"x\" or −\"x\" is the arithmetic inverse of \"x\".\n\nThe square of −1, i.e. −1 multiplied by −1, equals 1. So, a square of negative real numbers is positive.\n\nTo prove this with algebra, start with the equation\n\nThe first equality follows from the above result. The second follows from the definition of −1 as additive inverse of 1, that is, when added to 1, it gives 0. Now, using the distributive law, we see that\n\nThe second equality follows from the fact that 1 is a multiplicative identity, that is : formula_7. But now adding 1 to both sides of this last equation means\n\nThe above arguments hold in any ring. Ring is a concept of abstract algebra generalizing integers and real numbers.\n\nThe complex number \"i\" satisfies \"i\" = −1. So it is a square root of −1. The only other complex number \"x\" for which the equation \"x\" = −1 holds is −\"i\". In the algebra of quaternions, which has the complex plane, the equation \"x\" = −1 has an infinity of solutions.\n\nA non-zero real number can have a negative number as its power. We define that \"x\" = 1/\"x\". This means a number raised to a power of −1 is equal to the reciprocal of that number. The exponential law \"x\"\"x\" = \"x\" for a,b non-zero real numbers is true even if a or b is negative.\n\nThere are many ways that −1 (and negative numbers in general) can be represented in computer systems. The most common is as two's complement of their positive form. In standard binary representation, this can also represent a positive integer.\n", "id": "338243", "title": "−1 (number)"}

It is mainly used for security in database systems. The algorithm generates a unique hash code for every piece of data (strings, text etc.). Any change to the data, either deliberate or accidental, will mean the hash code will also change. By comparing the codes, it is easy to see if a change has been made. MD5 was invented by Ron Rivest of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1991. An MD5 hash code is usually a 32-digit hexadecimal number. By 1996, methods were developed to break the security of an MD5 algorithm. This was done by getting another program to make the same hash number for different sets of data. MD5 is no longer considered acceptable for protecting against intentional malicious changes to data, but it is still considered OK to protect from accidental changes, for example single-bit changes caused by noise on a network connection. An MD5 hash could look like: 9c677286866aad38f8e9b660f5411814. This is the hash of the string \"Wikipedia\".\n", "id": "338276", "title": "MD5"}

It is one of the three main forms of plague (the other two being the bubonic and penumonic). It is caused by the bacterium \"Yersinia pestis\".\n\nSepticemic plague can cause the blood to form small clots through the body. Without treatment it is almost always fatal. The death rate in medieval times was 99-100 percent. Septicemic plague is the rarest of the three plagues that struck Europe in 1348, the other forms are bubonic and pneumonic plague. This disease is caused mainly by the bite of an infected rodent or insect. In rare cases it can also enter the body through an opening in the skin or by cough from another infected human. In septicemic plague the bacteria grow quickly in the blood, causing severe sepsis. The endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This is tiny clots of blood throughout the body which stops the blood getting to some areas. This causes the cells in the area to die. DIC uses up the bodies ability to make blood clot, so that it can no longer control bleeding. This means there is bleeding into the skin and other organs, which can cause red and/or black patchy rash and coughing up or vomiting of blood (hemoptysis/haemoptysis). There are bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites. These bumps are usually red, and sometimes white in the center. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the death rate to between 4 and 15 percent. People that get this disease must receive treatment in at most 24 hours or they will die. In some cases, people may even die on the same day they get the disease.\n\n\nNote: Septicemic plague may cause death before any symptoms occur\n\nThe septicemic plague was the least common of the three plagues that occurred from 1348 to 1350. Like the others, the septicemic plague spread from the East through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea. Major port cities such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest. The three plagues that are part of the Black Death were a major factor in the Peasant's Revolt of 1381.\n\n\nGoogle Health - Plague<br>\nHowStuffWorks - \"Septicemic Plague\"\n", "id": "338355", "title": "Septicemic plague"}

In 1533, Charles V made him a nobleman. He also obtained a job as a painter at the court of Charles V. In 1545, Pope Paul III invited him to come to Rome, in 1548 and 1550, Titian accompanied Charles V and his son, Philip II to the Diet of Augsburg.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338395", "text": "The Dream of Gerontius\n\nThe Dream of Gerontius is a large musical work for choir, three solo singers and orchestra composed by Edward Elgar. It was composed and first performed in 1900. It is an oratorio, although Elgar did not like it being called an “oratorio”, but this is how it is usually described. It is usually thought of as the best choral work Elgar ever wrote.\n\nThe words are from a poem by John Henry Newman. They are supposed to be the words of a man called Gerontius who is dying. He imagines what is going to happen to him when he dies: how he will meet God who will judge whether he has been good enough to go to heaven. The angel speaks to him in the poem. There is also a priest, and a short solo for the Angel of Agony. The work is in two parts. Part I is about 40 minutes long and Part II lasts about an hour.\n\nThe work was composed for the Birmingham Music Festival of 1900 and the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in Birmingham Town Hall. There were problems at the first performance: the chorus master died while the work was being learned. Some of the music sounded strange to the choir who found it very difficult. The soloists were not very good, and it was difficult for the conductor, Hans Richter (who was an excellent conductor) to stop the choir from singing out of tune. Richter had not had time to prepare the work properly: he was only given the full score on the day before the first rehearsal. The next year the work was performed in Germany where it was well received.\n\nAnother reason why it was slow to become popular in England was that the ideas in the poem were from the Roman Catholic teaching (John Henry Newman was a Roman Catholic Cardinal). This meant that a lot of Anglican cathedrals did not want it to be performed, so changes were made to the text. This new version was used for performances at the Three Choirs Festival until 1910. It quickly became popular in England. It was performed in Chicago and New York in 1903, and then in many other cities.\n\nA few years earlier it had been suggested to the Birmingham Festival that Antonín Dvořák should be commissioned to compose a work on “The Dream of Gerontius”. They decided that the work was “too catholic”.\n\nThere are three solo singers in the work. The most important is the tenor soloist who sings the words spoken by the dying Gerontius. There is also a bass who sings the Priest, and a mezzo-soprano who sings the part of the angel. The Angel of the Agony can be sung by the same bass who sings the Priest. The choir sometimes divides into two, and sometimes there is a small group of upper voices called the “semi-chorus”.\n\nNewman's poem tells the story of a soul's journey through death. It is thinking about the unseen world of Roman Catholic theology. The name Gerontius comes from the Greek word \"geron\", \"old man\". The name \"Gerontius\" is not sung in the work, and not everyone agrees on how it is pronounced. The Greek \"geron\" has a hard 'g' (like in “grass”), but English words that come from it often have a soft 'g', as in \"geriatriac\". Elgar did not use all the words of Newman’s poem. He leaves out a lot of the meditations in Part 2 which would otherwise have made it very long.\n\nIn the first part, we hear Gerontius who is very faithful to God. Sometimes he is frightened but at other times he is hopeful. A group of friends (also called \"assistants\" in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, say farewell as he sets off on his journey. In the second part, Gerontius, now called \"The Soul\", wakes up in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware that his guardian angel is there. She is happy that her task (bringing Gerontius to God) is done (the angel in Newman’s poem is male, but Elgar makes the angel female, giving the part to a female singer). They have a long conversation after which they journey to the throne of judgement. They have to pass the demons. They meet a choir of angels who are praising god. The Angel of the Agony pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius briefly sees God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, gives him a final blessing and promises him he will wake up in glory.\n\nElgar scored the work for a large orchestra which includes, besides the usual instruments, piccolo, cor anglais, contrabassoon, harp and organ.\n\nAlthough people usually describe it as an oratorio, it is not an oratorio in the traditional sense: there are no breaks in the music (except between the two parts), and it does not tell a story from the Bible.\n\nThe music is written in a late Romantic style which is clearly inspired by Wagner, especially by his opera Parsifal. The opening of “The Dream of Gerontius” is a long orchestral introduction which uses themes that are going to be important in the work. The music of the character Gerontius is sometimes in speech rhythm (similar to recitative) but often very lyrical. Elgar moves quickly from one style to the other. The chorus provide a wonderful reflection on what is happening. The chorus of angels singing “Praise to the Holiest in the Height” is particularly beautiful. The chorus of demons is very difficult to sing.\n\n", "id": "338395", "title": "The Dream of Gerontius"}

The population was about 375,000 as of 2006. It is the capital of Balkh province. It is linked by roads to Kunduz in the east, Kabul in the south-east, Herat to the west and Uzbekistan to the north. The city is a major tourist attraction in Afghanistan because of its famous shrines as well as the Muslim and Hellenistic archeological sites. In 2006, the discovery of new Hellenistic remains was announced.\n\nThe region around Mazar-e-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khorasan and was controlled by the Tahirids followed by the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurids, and Khanate of Bukhara. \n\nThe name Mazar-e-Sharif means \"Noble Shrine\". This name represents the Blue Mosque which is widely known to be the grave of Hazrat Ali (prophet Mohammad's son-in-law).\n\nThe city and region became part of the Afghan Durrani Empire around 1750.\n\nMazar-e Sharif remained peaceful for the next one hundred years. In 1979 then neighboring Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. During the 1980s Soviet war, Mazari Sharif was a strategic base for the Soviet Army.\n\nBetween May and July 1997, the Taliban unsuccessfully attempted to take Mazar. About 3,000 Taliban soldiers were killed by Abdul Malik and his Shia followers. The Taliban returned on August 8, 1998 and led a six-day killing frenzy of Hazaras. Soon after, the city was occupied and taken over by the Taliban. \n\nFollowing 9/11, Mazar Sharif was the first Afghan city to fall to the Northern Alliance (United Front). The Taliban's defeat in Mazar quickly turned into defeat from the rest of the north and west of Afghanistan. On November 9, 2001 the city was captured by the Afghan Northern Alliance forces after the Battle of Mazar e Sharif with help from the United States Special Operations Forces and bombing by U.S. Air Force aircraft. As many as 2,000 Taliban fighters who surrendered were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle. Reports also place U.S. ground troops at the scene of the massacre. \n\nThere are also NATO peacekeeping forces in and around the city providing assistance to the Afghan government.\n\nOn April 1, 2011, as many as ten foreign employees working for United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) were killed by angry demonstrators in the city. The demonstration was organized in retaliation to the March 21 Qur'an-burning in Florida, United States. \n\nThe climate in Mazari Sharif is very hot during the summer. Daily temperatures are over 40°C or 104 degree Fahrenheit in June and July. The winters are cold with temperatures falling below freezing.\n\nThe population of Mazari Sharif is around 375,000. It is a multiethnic and multilingual society. \n\nThe main language in Mazari Sharif is Dari (Persian) followed by Pashto. Both are the official languages of Afghanistan.\n\nThe city is a centre for the traditional buzkashi sport, and the Blue Mosque is the focus of Afghanistan's Nawroz celebration.\n\nMazar-e Sharif serves as the major trading center in northern Afghanistan. It was the first city to connect itself by rail with a neighboring country. The rail service from Mazar-e Sharif to Uzbekistan began in 2011 and is expected to rapidly boost the economy of the city. Cargo on freight trains arrives to the last station near Mazar-i-Sharif Airport, where the goods are reloaded onto trucks or airplanes and sent to their last destinations across Afghanistan. \n\nThe local economy is mainly trade, agriculture and karakul production. Some oil and gas have also boosted the city's economy.\n\nThe modern city of Mazar-i Sharif is centered around the Shrine of Hazrat Ali. Much restored, it is one of Afghanistan's most glorious monuments. Outside Mazar-i Sharif lies the ancient city of Balkh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "338619", "title": "Mazar-i-Sharif"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338672", "text": "History of Azerbaijan\n\nThe history of Azerbaijan is very ancient and goes back to the Stone Age. The population of Azerbaijan comes from numerous ancient tribes from that area, such as Sakhs, Caspians, Gargars, Nakhchies, etc.\n\nThe name Azerbaijan has existed for many centuries, although its spelling often changed throughout its history. Historical sources show the former names of Azerbaijan as Andirpatian, Atropatena, Adirbijan and Azirbijan. The most ancient archaeological and paleontological materials found recently on the territory of Azerbaijan prove that Stone Age people settled here 1.7-1.8 million years ago. The early civilizations such as Mana, Scythia, Atropatena and Caucasian Albania appeared on the lands of Azerbaijan from the 1st millennium BC. Caucasian Albania was relatively independent under Roman and (Persian) control.\n\nIn the 7th century, Islam was introduced with the Arab conquest, which was important in the formation of a single nation and language in Azerbaijan, when the population became Muslim. A common religion for both Turkic and non-Turkic ethnic groups brought about the formation of common traditions, and the integration between the different ethnic groups living on the territory of Azerbaijan. By the middle of the 9th century, the Turkic ethnic group, the Azerbaijani people became the major ethnic group.\n\nThe establishment of a single state in Azerbaijan happened between the 15th century and the 18th century. This period is very important in the history of Azerbaijan. The ruler Shah Ismail Khatai (1501-1524) who was of Azerbaijani origin, united all the territories of Azerbaijan under his control. He founded the Safavid dynasty with Tabriz as its capital. During the rule of the Safavis, the Azerbaijani language also became the only official language. After the Safavid dynasty ended, Nadir Shah Afshar (1736-1747), an Azerbaijani commander founded the Afsharid dynasty (1736-1796) named after himself, and continued to rule over Azerbaijan's territories. He strengthened the borders and in 1739 invaded North India including Delhi. After Nadir Shah's death, his dynasty weakened and in the second part of the 18th century resulted in the formations of new smaller states.\n\nIn the late 18th century, then, the government of Iran passed to the Qajar dynasty (1796-1925), who were also of Azerbaijani origin. Their main policy was to unite all the territories once ruled by their ancestors. This gave the start to several long wars between the Qajars and Russia, with both parties aiming to occupy the South Caucasus which Azerbaijan is a part of. Azerbaijan was divided between the two empires. The northern part of Azerbaijan was annexed to Russia, while the south went to Iran. This is the origin of today's political division between \"North Azerbaijan\" which today has become the Republic of Azerbaijan, and \"South Azerbaijan\", which today is a part of Iran. \n\nAzerbaijan came under Russian rule after the Persian-Russian wars of 1804-1813. The country gained independence for a short period, however, towards the end of the First World War. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, Azerbaijan, together with Armenia and Georgia became part of the short-lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. When this republic ended in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan on May 28, 1920, which was the first modern and secular parliamentary republic in the Muslim World. However, the Red Army occupied the territory and annexed it to the newly formed Soviet Union and the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was founded on April 28, 1920. During the Second World War and after, the Azerbaijan SSR played as a petroleum producer, an important role in the energy policy of the Soviet Union. Following the politics of reforms called \"glasnost\", started by the leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, riots and ethnic fighting grew in various regions of the Soviet Union, including Nagorno-Karabakh, a region of the Azerbaijan SSR. The disturbances in Azerbaijan, in response to the Soviet government's lack of response to the already tense conflict between the Azerbaijanis and Armenians, resulted in calls for independence and secession, which resulted in the massacre known as \"Black January\" in the capital Baku in January 1990. Azerbaijan eventually declared independence on October 18, 1991. The Soviet Union was ended on December 25, 1991.\n\nWhen Azerbaijan became independent, the conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh turned into the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1991-1994.\n\nThe politician Heydar Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan in 1993 and successfully stabilized the country and a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and Armenia was signed in 1994, which ended the war. However, 20 % of Azerbaijan is still occupied by the Armenian military and the two countries are in a state of war. Nevertheless, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks organized by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) \"Minsk Group\" to solve the conflict and restore the territory to Azerbaijan. When Heydar Aliyev died in 2003, his son Ilham Aliyev became the President of Azerbaijan and is continuing his father's policies today. As an important producer of petroleum and natural gas, Azerbaijan's economy is increasing very rapidly every year, and has become rich as a result.\n\n\n", "id": "338672", "title": "History of Azerbaijan"}

The Polish contingents serving under the UN auspices focused their tasks among others on … sanitary-epidemiological reconnaissance … \nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance is a collection and transfer of all data available on sanitary and epidemiological situation of the area of possible deployment and action of armed forces, the same data for the neighbouring and enemy armed forces. The aim for the reconnaissance is to clear up the reasons of the specific disease origin- sources of the infection in extreme situations, including local wars and armed conflicts, the ways of the infection transfer and all factors promoting to the infestation. It should result in revealing of the patients and persons, suspected to the specific disease, their isolation and hospitalization. Mobile equipped group for sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance includes: epidemiologist, specialist on infections, assistant of epidemiologist (bacteriologist- lab assistant), medical orderly (if necessary, the group will include zoologist or parasitologist). After the armed forces have become stationary during wartime and emergency of peace time the sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance turns into sanitary and epidemiological surveillance of vital and communal activity of the armed forces.\n\nIn 2010 at The Meeting of the States Parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and Their Destruction in Geneva \nthe sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance was suggested as means for monitoring of infections and parasitic agents and for practical implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases, the treat of alleged use of biological weapons. The sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance will be important in assessing the sanitary-epidemiological situation, organizing and conducting preventive activities, indicating and identifying pathogenic biological agents, suppressing hotbeds of infectious diseases, providing advisory and practical assistance to local health authorities.\n\nSanitary epidemiological reconnaissance (inspection) or a similar practice and specific indication in the hotbed should be performed immediately after the receiving of the information about bio-terrorism attack.\n", "id": "339322", "title": "Sanitary epidemiological reconnaissance"}

It is on the eastern edges of Cambridge, south of Newmarket Road and west of the village of Teversham, from the centre of Cambridge and about from London. \n\nThe airport opened in 1938. It replaced the old airfield at Fen Ditton. The airport is owned and run by Marshall Aerospace. This is a Cambridge-based company with many years' history servicing civilian and military contracts. The main building was designed by the architect Harold Tomlinson of the University of Cambridge. It was constructed in 1936–37. For many years it was the base for the Cambridge University Air Squadron.\n\nMarshall of Cambridge Aerospace Limited has a CAA Public Use Aerodrome Licence (Number P433). This is a special license that allows it to have public passenger flights and flights for flying training. It has four flying schools. It is also used for corporate and private flights.\n\nIn October 2008, the airport's name was changed from Cambridge City Airport to Marshall Airport Cambridge UK. This happened at the same time as the new Marshall Business Aviation Centre was opened. In 2011, Cambridge Airport officially broke off from Marshall. It hired a new director and changed its name back to Cambridge Airport. Its aim is to become a \"hub\" (important airport) for the east of England. The Passenger Terminal will be refurbished.\n\nLand in Cambridge is expensive. Around the city are large areas of green belt land. Building new houses on this land is not allowed. Because of this, a proposal was made in 2000 to move the airport to a new site away from the city. It would have freed up of land so that several thousand new homes could be built there instead. Cambridgeshire County Council did a study for a new airport. The council asked for permission to plan the new airport, but they withdrew the request later.\n\nSince then, Marshall Aerospace has continued to develop the site. In autumn 2008 new facilities for aviation companies were opened. These included a new hangar, which added to the of hangar space already on the site.\n\nIn April 2010, Marshall Aerospace said it would not be moving Cambridge Airport to make way for new housing. RAF Mildenhall, Waterbeach Barracks and RAF Wyton were though of as alternative sites, but Marshall decided that there were \"no suitable relocation options\" (none of the options were good enough). \n\nIn January 2011, Cambridge Airport broke off from Marshall, and released plans for the airport's future. Its plans are to have international flights for the London 2012 Olympic Games. For 2012 the airport has introduced new international holiday charter flights to Europe as well as new regular (on a timetable) air links to the Channel Islands. Passenger terminal facilities are being fully upgraded to improve services and convenience for passengers.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339506", "text": "Bias (textile)\n\nThe bias of a piece of woven fabric is at 45 degrees to its warp and weft threads. Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, at right angles to each other. Fabrics which are not woven, such as felt, do not have a bias.\n\nWhen cut on the bias, woven fabric is more elastic as well as more fluid in movement, compared to the on-grain direction. This helps many types of garment, such as skirts, dresses and neckties.\n\nThe \"bias-cut\" is a technique used by tailors and dress-makers for cutting cloth. The greater stretch in the bias (diagonal) direction of the fabric, helps it accentuate body lines and curves and drape softly. For example, a full-skirted dress cut on the bias will hang more gracefully or a narrow dress will cling to the figure. \n\nBias-cut garments were prominent in haute couture clothes designed by Madeleine Vionnet in the 1920s. It is still used often in both haute couture and high street clothing. In the Middle Ages, before the development of knitting, hose leggings were cut on the bias in order to make them fit better.\n", "id": "339506", "title": "Bias (textile)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339509", "text": "Madeleine Vionnet\n\nMadeleine Vionnet (22 June 1876 – 2 March 1975) was a French fashion designer. She used the bias cut, made Grecian-style dresses and introduced haute couture design to high street shops.\n\nBorn into a poor family in Chilleurs-aux-Bois, Loiret, Vionnet began her apprenticeship as a seamstress at age 11. After a brief marriage at age 18, she left her husband and went to London to work making clothes in a hospital. While in London, Vionnet worked as a fitter for Kate Reily (or Reilly). Reily bought original French designer dresses and brought them to her London workshop. There she had them copied, and sold the copies to her London clients for half the price of the originals. Vionnet was head of her workshop (\"atelier\"), cutting, fitting and directing the seamstresses.\n\nVionnet eventually returned to Paris and trained with well known fashion houses. In 1912 she founded her own fashion house, \"Vionnet\". In the 1920s she created a stir by re-introducing the bias cut, an old technique for cutting cloth diagonal to the grain of the fabric. She developed techniques for managing the problems the bias cut caused. Bias cuts cling to the body and move with the wearer. Vionnet's use of the bias cut to create a sleek, flattering, body-skimming look would change women's clothing and carry her to the top of the fashion world.\n\nMadeleine's clothes were famous for accentuating the natural female form. Influenced by the modern dances of Isadora Duncan, Vionnet created designs that showed off a woman's natural shape. Like Duncan, Vionnet was inspired by ancient Greek art, in which garments appear to float freely around the body rather than distort its shape. \n\nVionnet's simple-looking styles were not simple to produce. She cutt, draped, and pinned fabric designs on to miniature dolls, before recreating them in chiffon, silk, or Moroccan crepe on life-size models. Vionnet used materials such as crêpe de chine, gabardine, and satin to make her clothes; fabrics which were unusual in women's fashion of the 1920s and 30s. She would order fabrics two yards wider than necessary in order to accommodate draping, creating clothes – particularly dresses – that were luxurious and sensual but also simple and modern. Characteristic Vionnet styles included the handkerchief dress, cowl neck, and halter top.\n\nVionnet influenced the design of mass production \"prét à porter\" (ready to wear) clothing. She had worked in mass production as a hospital seamstress, and could simplify her designs for the retail market. High fashion was too expensive for working people, and (unlike today) was not copied in the high street. Vionnet's ability to take her designs off the cat walk and into the high street revolutionised the fashion industry and popular culture.\n\n\nIn 1930, Suzanna Laneil was caught with 48 copies of Chanel and Vionnet designs. Vionnet sued her, in a French landmark case. The Court found that the design originals by Vionnet were \"real works of art\" and that they were \"entitled to the same protection accorded authors and copyright holders\". That protection has been written into the statute and ratified by European treaties on copyright law. Vionnet began as a style copiest with Kate Reilly, but became a strong supporter of intellectual property protection for designers.\n\n\n\n", "id": "339509", "title": "Madeleine Vionnet"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339566", "text": "To each according to his contribution\n\nWhen a society transforms from capitalism to socialism and then to communism, every person should be rewarded for the amount they contribute to society. Economists such as David Ricardo (1772-1823) had this idea. Ricardo founded a movement that is known as Ricardian socialism today. Many people in the labour movement had this idea too. Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864) and Eugen Dühring (1833-1921) expressed such ideas towards Leon Trotsky. Despite this, Vladimir Lenin was the first person to say that this element is fundamental to Marxist theory.\n\nAccording to Libertarian socialist thinkers, such as American anarchist Benjamin Tucker, socialism is a system in which the laborer receives the full product of his labor. This eliminates exploitation and \"unearned\" income accrued to the capitalist.\n\nThe term \"To each according to his contribution\" simply means that each worker in a socialist society receives wages and benefits according to the quantity and value of the labor that he or she contributed. That way, highly productive workers will receive more wages and benefits than workers of average productivity, and substantially more than workers of low productivity. What is more, the more difficult the job is, the more one is rewarded for the labor contributed. Difficulty can result from factors such as greater training requirement, job intensity or safety hazards. According to Trotzky, the idea is to promote productivity. This is done by creating incentives to work harder, longer, and more productively. In the end, the principle comes from capitalism, but will vanish, according to Marx, as work becomes more automated and enjoyable, and as goods become available in greater quantities.\n\nIn capitalism, the means of production are owned by few people. These people do not produce, but they live off the work others do for them. Socialism can fix this issue, because with socialism, the means of production are owned by all people, they are a common good.\n\n", "id": "339566", "title": "To each according to his contribution"}

Singapore architecture may be divided into two periods: the more traditional pre-World War II colonial period, and the modern post-war and post-colonial period.\n\nMalay houses built in the 'kampong' style were common before the British came.\n\nAfter the British established a settlement near the mouth of the Singapore River in 1819, building construction in Singapore changed. The new settlement was small but very urban. Merchants built warehouses right next to each other along Boat Quay. Risk of fire became a problem because the buildings were so close together and had many valuable goods inside. Builders switched to brick masonry with clay tiled roofs, to reduce the fire hazard. Bricks and tiles were made at kilns on the island, and the mortar and plaster was made by grinding up corals from sea around Singapore.\n\n Shophouses are common style of building in Southeast Asia. They are usually two or three storeys high. Each shophouse is usually very narrow and part of a long row of terraced buildings. But, shophouses may be very deep front to back. The first floor is usually for business and the upper floors are for living.\n\nThe front of the building usually has a covered area called the \"\"five foot ways\"\". An 1822 law in Singapore said that all houses made of brick or tiles should be similar in the front. They should have an open arcade making an open passage on each side of the street. This style of building shophouses soon spread to other states in British Malaya. More rules said that the verandah ways should be .at least seven feet from the edge of the road and the walkway must be at least five feet wide.\n\nA bungalow is usually a small one or one-and-half storey home with deep verandahs. In Singapore, Many Europeans lived in bungalows from the 19th century until World War II. They are called Black and Whites for their white paint and dark wood.\n\nThese homes were similar to the UK's Arts and Crafts and Art Deco movements. They were built large enough to give rich families homes with light, air, and space. Black-and-Whites were built by wealthy families, successful businesses, the Public Works Department, and the British Armed Forces. Many are still homes today, but some have become shops, restaurants, or bars.\n\nSingapore has many Art Deco buildings from the 1920s and 1930s. The style was especially popular in commercial architecture, like factories and offices. Sometimes the style was only on the surface. Often, Art Deco style ornaments were added to typical shophouses or bungalows. The Art Deco period was important as a style, but also for bringing modern construction technologies like reinforced concrete to Singapore.\n\nSingaporean architecture moved to a modern direction after the war. The need to save money meant less spending on ornaments or features that only looked good. Simple forms and surfaces became more common. Modern architecture was also better for building many public buildings with the same or similar designs such as schools, clinics, factories, and especially public housing.\n\nPublic housing started in Singapore in the 1930s. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) carried out a building programme because there was not enough housing in the city. The SIT mainly built housing for middle and lower-middle class Asians at first. The Tiong Bahru estate is a typical example. It is a group of four-storey Art Deco style apartment blocks, shops, and markets outside the city center. After the war, the style changed from Art Deco to a simple, modern style.\n\nModern architecture was most important during the 1970s and 1980s. Brutalist architecture was common. Some older commercial buildings, such as the OCBC Centre by I. M. Pei, and many government office buildings are examples of this style.\n\n\n", "id": "339642", "title": "Architecture of Singapore"}

She was an inspiration for modern dance. \n\nDuncan was born in San Francisco, California. She preferred natural movement, instead of what she called the artificial movements of ballet. Her 'free dance movement' was based on simple, flowing movements of the body. It was inspired by nature, and by ancient Greek sculptures. Costumes were flowing and transparent. Dances involved simple runs, skips and jumps, big gestures and mime. \n\nDuncan was wildly unconventional. A bisexual who had two children but did not marry either of their fathers, she became a communist, and boasted about it. She went to the Soviet Union in 1922, but left in less than two years. At different times she lived in Paris, London and other European cities. She started dance schools in Moscow, Berlin and Paris. The schools did not last long, but Duncan had admirers who have continued her influence to the present day. \n\nDuncan's private life was tragic. Both her children were killed in a strange accident on the River Seine in 1913. The children were in a car with their nanny when the car stalled as the driver tried to avoid a collision. He got out to hand-crank the engine, but forgot to put the brake on. The car rolled across the road, down the bank and into the river. The children and their nanny drowned. Duncan married poet Sergei Yesenin (1895–1925) in 1922. He left her in 1923, and hanged himself two years later.\n\nDuncan liked long, flowing scarves. One of these scarves caused her own death. As \"The New York Times\" noted in its obituary: \"Isadora Duncan, the American dancer, tonight met a tragic death at Nice on the Riviera. According to dispatches from Nice, Miss Duncan was hurled in an extraordinary manner from an open automobile in which she was riding and instantly killed\". At her death, Duncan was a Soviet citizen.\n\nBorn in the United States, she lived in Europe from the age of 22 until her death at age 50. In the United States she was popular only in New York, and then only later in her life.\n\nHer work was continued by some of her six adopted daughters. They were her pupils, the Isadorables, who continued to teach her methods after her death. There have been several revivals of interest in Duncan. There was a film, \"Isadora\" (1969) by Karl Reisz. There were two ballets. \"Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora\" by Frederick Ashton had its first show in 1976. Kenneth Macmillan created a two-act ballet \"Isadora\" for the Royal Ballet (1981).\n\nIn New York her tradition has passed to third generation Duncan dancer Lori Belilove. She founded The Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation in 1979 and The Isadora Duncan Dance Company in 1989.\n\nHer ideas on natural dance influenced a wide range of other dancers. Some of the ideas of the Denishawn School of Dancing are quite Duncanesque, and the growth of modern dance in general owes something to her.\n\n", "id": "339762", "title": "Isadora Duncan"}

Standish became a assistant governor, and a treasurer of Plymouth Colony.\n\nStandish's place of birth is uncertain. In his will he mentions Lancashire. Nathaniel Morton, secretary of Plymouth Colony, wrote that Standish was born in Lancashire.\n\nStandish was a soldier and fought against the Spanish in the Eighty Years' War.\n\nStandish and his wife did not believe in the Church of England and in 1608 they moved to Leiden Netherlands. After some years, they became concerned because their children were losing their English customs and culture. Since their religion was outlawed in England, they decided to travel to the New World.\n\nThere were many people in Leiden who did not believe in the Church of England and they also wanted to travel to the New World. They looked to employ someone who would protect them in the New World. They first asked John Smith. Smith was one of the founders of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia. He had explored and made a map of the North American coast. Smith's experience would have helped them but he asked for too much money. He was also too bold and they feared he might try to rule over them. They asked Standish instead and he agreed to help protect them. They decided to hire the ship \"Mayflower\" to take them on their long voyage.\n\nThe \"Mayflower\" left Plymouth, England on 16 September 1620. There were 102 passengers and 30–40 crew. On 19 November 1620, the \"Mayflower\" saw land. The \"Mayflower\" was supposed to land in Virginia Colony, but the ship was too damaged and they were forced to land at Cape Cod now called Provincetown Harbor on November 21. They wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.\n\nWhile the Mayflower was anchored off Cape Cod, Standish took some men ashore to find a good place for all to live.\n\nWilliam Bradford wrote of one of the exploration missions. They were Bradford, John Carver, Myles Standish, Edward Winslow, John Howland, Richard Warren, Stephen Hopkins and Edward Doty set off in small boats. Hopkins was the most experienced because he had seen Native Americans during his time at Jamestown. Bradford said they set off in below freezing temperatures. Many of the men were ill, and when they left the salt spray froze on their coats. During their trip they saw Native Americans who appeared to be cutting up a whale which was very large. When they saw the men approaching the Indians fled. At night they tried to protect themselves from the cold and the Indians.\n\nAfter more trips in late December 1620 they picked a place to live. Standish gave good advice and they built a small fort and placed cannon for protection against any who might try to harm them. Standish's wife, Rose, died in January.\n\nMany passengers were sick but Standish stayed healthy. Standish was a source of great comfort and strength to those who suffered. Standish helped to care Bradford when he was sick and they became good friends. Bradford held the position of governor for most of his life and worked closely with Standish.\n\nIn March of 1621, a Native American named Samoset came to the colony and spoke to the people in English. He stayed one day and talked with the leaders about many things. When he returned he brought the tribe leader Massasoit to meet with the Pilgrims. Governor John Carver, signed a treaty with this chief and they became friends. They all promised to help and defend each other. \n\nIn August 1621 a leader named Corbitant tried to turn the people of Nemasket against Massasoit. Standish led a group of ten men to kill Corbitant. Three Native Americans, Squanto, Hobomock and Tisquantum went with them. When Tisquantum and Hobbamock went to Nemasket, Corbitant took Tisquantum captive and threatened to kill him. Hobbamock got away and warned the people of Plymouth.\n\nStandish planned an attack. Standish and Hobbamock went to where they thought Corbitant would be sleeping but he had already fled the village. They did not kill Corbitant but because the colonist were willing to fight, if necessary, nine other leaders, and Corbitant, signed a treaty with the leaders of Plymouth.\n\nIn November 1621, a Narragansett messenger came to Plymouth with a bundle of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin. The Pilgrims were told by Tisquantum and Hobbamock that this was a threat and an insult from the Narragansett leader who was called Canonicus. This was one of the more powerful tribes in the area. Bradford sent back the snakeskin filled with gunpowder to show them they were not afraid. Standish told the colonists to prepare for a possible fight. The ship \"Fortune\" had brought some more men to the colony but there were still not very many men. Standish put one man to each wall and gave them orders on how to protect themselves and the people in case of an attack.\n\nBradford called a public meeting. The Pilgrims decided to send Standish and a small group of eight, including Hobbamock, to Wessagusset to kill the leaders who wanted kill them. The day after Pecksuot, a Massachusett warrior and leader of the group who threatened Wessagusset, came to the settlement with other warriors. Pecksuot approached Standish and, looking down on him, said, \"You are a great captain, yet you are but a little man. Though I not a chief, I am of great strength and courage.\" He said this to make Standish afraid of him. The next day, Standish attacked Pecksuot, and stabbed him with the Native American's own knife. Standish returned to Plymouth. The leaders who wished them harm had been killed and there was no more threat. The attack also caused many of the unfriendly Native Americans to leave the area.\n\nStandish showed great courage and skill as a soldier but sometimes was too harsh with the Native Americans. This would make both the Native Americans and the members of the colony angry.\n\nBy the 1640s, Standish was leading a quiet life on his farm in Duxbury. Standish also served as a surveyor of highways, as Treasurer of the Colony from 1644 to 1649. In 1642, his old friend Hobbamock, who had been part of his household, died and was buried on Standish's farm in Duxbury.\n\nStandish put Lieutenant William Holmes in charge of training the men. He died in his home in 1656. He was buried in Duxbury's Old Burying Ground, now known as the Myles Standish Burial Ground.\nStandish's first wife, Rose, died in 1621.

During this time, new ideas and discoveries fundamentally changed the way people thought; they also forced people to think differently, and started what is called science today. This period roughly lasted from the 16th to the 18th century. \n\nThe era was jump-started by Galileo Galilei when he disproved Aristotle with his new theory of gravity. One of his students said he dropped two balls of iron (one weighing one pound, the other a hundred) off the leaning tower of Pisa. The objects fell at the same rate which brought about new methods of thinking in that time period. In 1542, Nicolaus Copernicus published his work \"On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres\", in which he said that not the earth, but the sun was at the center of the universe. This theory is known as Heliocentrism today. In the same year, Andreas Vesalius pubilshed his work \"On the Structure of the Human Body\". This book is about the anatomy of the human body.\n\nThe philosopher Alexandre Koyré (18921964) first used the term 'scientific revolution' for this time period.\n", "id": "339813", "title": "Scientific revolution"}

They have a record from the latest stages of the Ediacaran to the early Cambrian period. Almost all are from earlier rocks than more familiar fossils such as trilobites. Most SSFs were preserved by being covered quickly with phosphate. This method of preservation is mainly limited to the later Ediacaran and early Cambrian periods, so the animals that made them may have arisen earlier and continued after this time.\n\nSome of the fossils represent the entire skeletons of small organisms, including the mysterious \"Cloudina\" and some snail-like molluscs. However, the bulk of the fossils are fragments or parts of larger organisms, including sponges, molluscs, slug-like halkieriids, brachiopods, echinoderms, and onychophoran-like organisms that may have been close to the ancestors of arthropods.\n\nOne of the early explanations for the appearance of the SSFs – and the evolution of mineralized skeletons – is a sudden increase in the ocean's concentration of calcium. However, many SSFs are made of other minerals, such as silica. The first SSFs appear around the same time as organisms first started burrowing to avoid predation, so it is likely that they represent early steps in an evolutionary arms race between predators and increasingly well-defended prey. Nevertheless it is still true that the animals used minerals that were most easily accessible.\n\nThe small size and (usually) broken nature of SSFs makes them difficult to identify and classify. However, they provide evidence for how the main groups of marine invertebrates evolved, and for the pace and pattern of evolution in the Cambrian explosion. They include the earliest known representatives of some modern phyla, and they have the great advantage of presenting a nearly continuous record of early Cambrian organisms whose bodies include hard parts.\n", "id": "340041", "title": "Small shelly fossils"}

Stating that, or asking if, someone was a \"friend of Dorothy\" was a euphemism used for discussing sexual orientation without others knowing its meaning. \n\nThe origin of the phrase is most commonly attributed to the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\" because Judy Garland, who starred as the main character Dorothy, is a gay icon. In the film, Dorothy is accepting of those who are different. For example the \"gentle lion\" living a lie, \"I'm afraid there's no denyin', I'm just a dandy lion.\" Others claim that the phrase refers to celebrated humorist and critic Dorothy Parker, who included some gay men in her famous social circle.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the Naval Investigative Service was investigating homosexuality in the Chicago area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as \"friends of Dorothy.\" Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that a woman named Dorothy was at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel.

It was directed by Charles Walters and stars Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, Eddie Bracken, Gloria DeHaven, Marjorie Main, and Phil Silvers. Nicholas Castle Sr. was the choreographer. \n\nJudy Garland struggled with many personal problems during filming, and \"Summer Stock\" was her last MGM movie. It was also her last pairing with Gene Kelly onscreen. MGM terminated Garland's contract - by mutual agreement - in September 1950. \nJane Falbury (Garland) is a farm owner. Her actress sister Abigail (DeHaven) arrives at the farm with her theater troupe. They need a practice stage, and Jane and her housekeeper Esme (Main) reluctantly agree to let them use their barn. The actors and actresses, including the director Joe Ross (Kelly), repay her hospitality by doing chores around the farm. Although Joe is engaged to Abigail, he begins to fall in love with Jane after Abigail leaves him in an angry fit. Jane is engaged to Orville (Bracken), but falls in love with Joe. The movie ends with a spectacular show in the barn itself, with the new leading lady, Jane.\n\nAll songs were written by Harry Warren (music) and Mack Gordon (lyrics) except where noted. Orchestration chores were divided between Conrad Salinger and Skip Martin. \n\n\nShooting this movie was sometimes a struggle for Garland. She was coping with many pressures in her personal life, including a heavy reliance on prescription medication. \n\nAudiences noticed that in the last number \"Get Happy\" she appears thinner than in the rest of the movie. Before shooting the number, she had taken two months off and lost between 15-20 pounds. Garland finished the movie, and embarked on a long promised vacation from the studio. Soon, however, she was called back to star with Fred Astaire in the upcoming movie \"Royal Wedding\". Once again, Garland struggled to perform at her absolute best in the face of exhaustion and overwork. She was fired from the movie, and her contract with MGM was terminated through mutual agreement. Even though \"Summer Stock\" took six months to film, it was a box-office success.\n\nThe film's most famous scene is the final song-and-dance number \"Get Happy\" performed by Judy Garland in a tuxedo jacket, black fedora, and black nylons to an arrangement by Skip Martin. This sequence was choreographed by Charles Walters and filmed two months after the rest of the movie, after Garland sought the help of a hypnotist in Santa Barbara and lost 20 pounds. With the sedative-hypnotic paraldahyde reportedly on her breath, which the number's male dancers described as sickeningly sweet, Garland performed the number perfectly in just a couple of takes, and the rest is history. According to \"New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther: \" 'Get Happy' finds Miss Garland looking and performing her best.\"\n\nIn another notable sequence, Kelly performs a solo dance in a darkened barn, using a newspaper and a creaky board as partners and props; the musical accompaniment reprises \"You Wonderful You\".

It was added to the World Heritage List at meeting of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairns in November 2000.\n\nThis area is one of rugged tablelands, cliffs, deep valleys and rivers and lakes. There are many rare and different plants and animals which tell the story of Australia's great age. It shows the story of the evolution of Australia's unique eucalypt trees and the other plants and animals which live among them.\n\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area covers about 10,300 square kilometres. It is mainly forest on a sandstone plateau 60 to 180 kilometres inland from central Sydney. The area includes large areas of wilderness and is about one third the size of Belgium, or twice the size of Brunei.\n\nThe Blue Mountains are a blue color. This is because rising air temperature makes the oil of Eucalypts evaporate into the air. This makes the mountains seem bluish.\n\nThe World Heritage Site includes eight protected areas. These are in two main blocks separated by land set aside for transport and housing. These areas are the:\n\nThe Blue Mountains are not really mountains, but a sandstone plateau rising from less than 100 metres above sea level to 1300 metres at the highest point. The plateau is cut through with deep valleys. There are basalt outcrops on the higher ridges. There are many different plants and animals which probably survived because they found shelter from climatic changes during recent geological history. \n\nThe area is famous for its many different eucalypt habitats, from wet and dry sclerophyll grasslands, mallee heathlands, as well as swamps and wetlands. There are 91 species of eucalypts, 13% of all eucalypts, in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. Of these, 12 only grow here.\n\nThe area has been described as a natural laboratory for studying the evolution of the eucalypts. This is because there are so many of the different types growing in the Greater Blue Mountains Area. The area shows examples of how the eucalypts have changed to grow in the different Australian environments. These vary from tall forests at the margins or rainforest in the deep valleys, through open forests and woodlands, to shrublands of stunted mallees on the exposed tablelands.\n\nAs well as the eucalypts, the Greater Blue Mountains Area also contains ancient, relict species of world wide importance. The most famous of these is the recently discovered Wollemi pine. This tree is a \"living fossil\" dating back to the age of the dinosaurs. Thought to have been extinct for millions of years, the few surviving trees of this ancient species are known only from three small groups located in remote valleys within the area. The Wollemi pine is one of the world's rarest species.\n\n\nMore than 400 different kinds of animals live within the valleys and tablelands of the Greater Blue Mountains Area. These include threatened or rare species such as the tiger quoll, the koala, the yellow-bellied glider and the long-nosed potoroo. There are also rare reptiles and amphibians including the green and golden bell frog and the Blue Mountain water skink.\n\nThe largest predator of the area is the dingo. These wild dogs hunt for grey kangaroos and other prey.\n\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It has many of the world's rockwarblers, as well as flame robins, diamond firetails and pilotbirds. The endangered regent honeyeater is seen there regularly. It is also a migration bottleneck for yellow-faced honeyeaters.\n\nThe Greater Blue Mountains Area was listed as a World Heritage Area by UNESCO on 29 November 2000.

Poor, sick or injured people are generally considered the proper people to whom charity should be given.

These organisations collect money and goods and then give them to those in need.\n\nMost charities are concerned with providing basic needs, such as food, water, clothing, health care and shelter. The most common form of charity is donating money. The money is then used to buy these basic needs. However, there are many other actions that may be performed as charity, such as teaching orphans, donating blood, or money to help fund medical research.\n\nCharitable giving can be a responsibility in many religions.

The haemolymph is pumped throughout the body cavity (which is called a haemocoel).\n\nThe Daphnia’s nervous system consists of a brain that has two or three pairs of ganglia. Ganglia are nerve cells that tend to cluster up. The nervous system also has nerve rings that go round the oesophagus. Last of all, it has a paired ventral nerve cord.\n\nThe Daphnia reproductive system is parthenogenetic. The female daphnia produce eggs without mating. That means that their eggs can grow without being fertilized. The female daphnia carries its 50 or so eggs in the brood chamber, until they are ready to hatch. Daphnia can still mate, the only difference is that the “mated” eggs have an extra hard shell that can protect them from harsh conditions for a long time. These eggs are called cysts, and they can hatch when conditions are favorable again, which is usually around spring.\n\n\"Daphnia\" spp. are a popular live food in tropical and marine fish keeping.\n\n", "id": "340341", "title": "Daphnia"}

It was the last movie in \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\".\n\nEight years after Harvey Dent's death and the defeat of the joker , the Dent Act grants the Gotham City Police Department to organized crime. Feeling guilty for covering up Dent's crimes, Police Commissioner James Gordon writes a resignation speech telling the truth, but decides not to tell because it was not the right time. Batman has disappeared, with Bruce Wayne becoming an outcast. Cat burglar Selina Kyle steals Bruce's fingerprints from his home, kidnaps a congressman, then disappears. Selina hands Bruce's fingerprints to Phillip Stryver, an assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett, in hope of having her criminal record erased. Stryver double crosses Selina, but she uses the congressman's stolen phone to alert the police of their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, then chase the criminals into the sewers while Selina escapes. A masked man called Bane who had escaped from a hijacked CIA Plane captures Gordon. Gordon escapes, and is found by John Blake, a patrol officer who grew up as an orphan and has known Batman's true identity from their similar backgrounds. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him.\nWayne Enterprises is on the point of becoming bankrupt after Bruce wasted almost all of the companies money on a fusion reactor project when he learns that the core could be weaponized. Later, Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints to bankrupt Wayne Enterprises. Alfred Pennyworth, concerned that Bruce has not moved on from being Batman, reveals to him that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and resigns in an attempt to dissuade him. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce and Lucius Fox asks board member Miranda Tate to take over his company. Bane later kills Daggett. After being promised to erase her records, Selina agrees to take Batman to Bane, but instead betrays him to a trap. Bane appears and reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows. He breaks Batman's back and takes him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping, the only prisoner to have ever done so; Bruce thinks the child is Bane.\nMeanwhile, Bane had kidnapped Fox, Tate, and Fredricks in order to turn on the bomb. While in the stadium, Bane triggers bombs under Gotham that causes the tunnels to collapse and traps most of the Gotham's police underground. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces an abducted physicist, Dr. Leonid Pavel, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb before killing him. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Prison, causing a revolution. The wealthy and powerful have their property destroyed or taken, are dragged from their homes, and given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane, where any sentence likely means death.\nAfter months of recovery and re-training, Bruce escapes from the prison; thanks to the prison doctor, and enlists Selina, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's forces fight at Gotham City Hall, Batman defeats Bane, but Tate later stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia, Ra's al Ghul's child, who escaped the prison thanks by her fellow prisoner, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by activating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, which makes the remote of detonation useless. Talia, then leaves to find the bomb. Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, an aircraft created by Fox, to bring the bomb back to the reactor, where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses The Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates.\nIn the months after, Batman is thought to be dead but is honored a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed The Bat's autopilot, and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refixed. While visiting in Florence, Italy, Alfred saw Bruce and Selina together. Blake resigns from the police force and finds the Batcave.\n\nThe movie is based on DC Comics character Batman. It is distributed under Warner Bros..

This produces a kind of oil that still has many unwanted substances, such as pigments and smell, which influence the quality of the refined product. In essence, the factors influenced are taste, shelf life, smell and color, as well as the ability to use the oil for further technical transformations.

However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of Iran since then, except short duration after Mongol raid and establishment of Ilkhanate. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nBefore the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian, however, there were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities. Eastern Iran (what is now Afghanistan) was predominantly Buddhist. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward Islam. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the \"dihqans\", or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.\n\nThough Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The Safavid dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran had become Shi'as, an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.\n\nNowadays Islam is the religion of 98% of Iranians, approximately 90% of Iranians are Shi'a and 8% are Sunni, mostly Turkomen, a minority of Arabs (mainly in Hormozgan Province), Baluchs, and Kurds living in the south, southeast, northeast and northwest. Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are Twelvers.\n", "id": "340462", "title": "Islam in Iran"}

Entry into the park is restricted; express permission from the Brazilian government is required to enter the reserve.\n\nThe park is a good example of tropical rainforest conservation in the Amazon. Its forests, lakes and channels are a \"constantly evolving aquatic mosaic that is home to the largest array of electric fish in the world\". The site protects key threatened species, including giant arapaima fish, the Amazonian manatee, the black caiman and two species of river dolphin and the jaguar. There are many other species of animals and plants.\n\nThe park is in the lower reaches of the Rio Negro branch of the Amazon. This branch is black with the organic matter picked up by the river. It has white-sand beaches during the dry season and flooded forest during the wet season. The streams turn into a 'ria' lake in the wet season, flooding huge areas of land, typical of all large rivers in the Amazon region. The site contains the nine-tier waterfall of the Carabinani River.\n\nThe Rio Negro flows through the eastern edge of Brazil’s Jau National Park. The river is the big strip of blue running from left to right across the image, and the other blue ribbons are tributaries. It starts at the border of Venezuela and Brazil, and meets up with the Amazon in central Brazil. Half-submerged islands can be seen in the center of the river. Between November and April when the river is at its peak, many of these islands disappear.\n\nThere is a high diversity of vertebrates in the park, with 120 species of mammals, 411 birds, 15 reptiles and 320 fishes. The site is home to relics of past human occupation of the Amazon region.\n\n", "id": "340465", "title": "Jaú National Park"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340548", "text": "Island of stability\n\nThe chemical elements beyond lead are radioactive, and they do not have stable isotopes. This means that they will decay into other elements. Except for Plutonium, their half life is in the order of several minutes, to seconds. There is a theory in physics that says that after a number of elements with short half lives, there will be others with longer half lives. These are generally known as Islands of stability. These elements are expected to have isotopes with half lives in the range of several minutes. The hypothesis is that the atomic nucleus is built up in \"shells\" in a manner similar to the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of quantum energy levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap. So when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby isotopes that do not possess filled shells.\n\nA filled shell would have \"magic numbers\" of neutrons and protons. One possible magic number of neutrons for spherical nuclei is 184, and some possible matching proton numbers are 114, 120 and 126 – which would mean that the most stable spherical isotopes would be Flerovium-298, unbinilium-304 and unbihexium-310. Of particular note is Ubh-310, which would be \"doubly magic\" (both its proton number of 126 and neutron number of 184 are thought to be magic) and thus the most likely to have a very long half-life. (The next lighter doubly magic spherical nucleus is lead-208, the heaviest stable nucleus and most stable heavy metal.)\n\nRecent research indicates that large nuclei are deformed, causing magic numbers to shift. Hassium-270 is now believed to be a doubly magic deformed nucleus, with deformed magic numbers 108 and 162. However, it has a half-life of only 3.6 seconds.\n\nIsotopes have been produced with enough protons to plant them upon an island of stability but with too few neutrons to even place them upon the island's outer \"shores\". It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties and, if they have isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well).\n", "id": "340548", "title": "Island of stability"}

It is in the South Atlantic Ocean and is made up of the island of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and the island group called Tristan da Cunha. In total, there are eight islands and the main is St Helena with a total area for the territory of .\n\nIt was known as Saint Helena and Dependencies until 1 September 2009. At that time a new constitution gave an equal status to all the islands in the territory.\n\nOf volcanic origin, the islands of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha were all formerly separate colonies of the English crown, though separately discovered by several Portuguese explorers between 1502 and 1504.\n\nGoing to India, in May 1501, the Portuguese admiral João da Nova saw the Ascension island in the South Atlantic. On his return journey, Nova is said to have discovered the South Atlantic island of St Helena on 21 May 1502, the feast day of Helena of Constantinople.\n\nAnother Portuguese, Tristan da Cunha () discovered a group of islands in 1506 and gave its name to the principal island of the group () but it was soon changed to \"Tristan da Cunha\".\n\nThe Portuguese found that nobody was living in the St Helena island, with forests and fresh water. They built a timber chapel in the valley where later Jamestown was built.Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island became very important for ships coming from Asia and going back to Europe.\n\nDuring the first years of the 16th century, the island of St Helena was used as a place to stop by the Portuguese, Dutch, English and French on their way to India and other Asian countries.\n\nThe Netherlands took St Helena from 1645 to 1659. In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, and it is from this date that St Helena claims to be Britain’s second oldest (remaining) colony (after Bermuda). A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named \"James Fort\" and the town \"Jamestown\", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England.\n\nIn 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena.\n\nOn 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown. In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938 .\n\nDuring the Second Boer War (1899-1902), the island of St. Helena served as camp for about 5,000 prisoners of war.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Ascension was leased to the United States who established a base for their airplanes. \n\nIn 1961, a volcanic eruption on Tristan da Cunha forced authorities to evacuate the entire population of the island to the United Kingdom. The people of Tristan da Cunha could not return to the island until 1963.\n\nThere is a huge distance between the northern and the southern points of the territory. The northern-most island, Ascension, is at latitude of the equator and the southern-most island, Gough Island is at . Between St Helena and Tristan da Cunha is the Tropic of Capricorn. The distance between the northern tip of Ascension Island and the southern tip of Gough Island is . The whole territory lies in the Western Hemisphere and has the same time zone: Greenwich Mean Time. Daylight saving time is not observed.\n\nThere are eight islands in the Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha territory:\n\nAscension has a warm, arid climate, but it is more moderated (and arid near the sea) in St Helena; Tristan da Cunha is much cooler. The highest point of the territory is Queen Mary's Peak on the island of Tristan da Cunha, with an elevation of above sea level.\n\nAlthough all three parts of the territory were formed by volcanic activity, only the Tristan da Cunha group of islands are active at the moment.\n\nAdministratively, the territory is divided into the same three parts as the territory's geography, namely Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Each is governed by a council. The Governor of the territory is the representative of the British monarch across the territory and presides over the St Helena Legislative Council, while he or she is represented by an Administrator on Ascension Island and an Administrator on Tristan da Cunha that preside over these two areas' Island Councils.\n\nThe island of St Helena is divided into eight districts.\n\nWith a population of 6,567 inhabitants in the census of 1998 (estimated to be 7,754 in 2013), the territory appears as one of the least populated British territory. The largest city of the territory is the capital, Jamestown, with a population of 1,000 in 2009.\n\nApproximately 50% of the population are of African origin while the descendants of Europeans (British and Scandinavian) and Chinese each represent a quarter of the population.\n\nThe inhabitants are mostly Anglicans, but there are Baptists, Adventists and Catholics.\n\nThe islands had a very simple economy the mid-1960s, mainly based on the culture of New Zealand flax, a plant of the genus \"Phormium\", that was used to produce fibers and ropes. Agriculture is now mainly for food, except for a bit of coffee.\n\nFishing remains the only really important activity on the island, but the territory is almost entirely supported by the help from United Kingdom, particularly through the U.S. and British facilities in the Ascension Island, which employ about 25% of the population.\n\nThe tourism industry in St Helena is not well developed and is based on the fact that Napoleon lived and died here.\n\n\n", "id": "340669", "title": "Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha"}

Edward Stratemeyer, the founder of the book-packaging Stratemeyer Syndicate, created the concept, but the books were written by several ghostwriters over the years under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon. \n\nThe series overview is simple. Frank and Joe Hardy are two high school boys in their late teens. They live in the fictional city of Bayport with their famous private detective father Fenton Hardy. The boys sometimes help their father with his cases, but, at other times, they find and solve their own. The boys have enough money to pursue a WWE Tag Team Championship and are the current holders of the prestigious award. Joe and Scott are renowned for not only there flamboyant appearances, but acrobatic manoeuvres\n\nIn 1959, the books were revised to eliminate objectionable material, and rewritten in a simpler style. New series were launched in 1987, 1997, and 2005. The original Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005. Some stories were adapted for television programs. Critics have offered many explanations for the Hardy Boys popularity including escapism, homosociality, and the triumph of good over evil.\n\nThe Hardy Boys are fictional teenage brothers and amateur detectives. They live in the fictional city of Bayport on the Atlantic Coast with their father, internationally famous private detective Fenton Hardy. The boys are in their late teens, have their own car, and are in the same grade in high school. Friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper sometimes help the Hardys solve their cases. The boys have enough money to travel around the United States and even the world in pursuit of cases. Frank and Joe are very much alike, but \"Frank was the thinker while Joe was more impulsive, and perhaps a little more athletic.\"\n\nEdward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, came up with the idea of mystery-solving brothers in 1926. Publishers Grosset & Dunlap approved the idea, and the name \"The Hardy Boys\" was chosen for the series. The books were written under the pseudonym Franklin W. Dixon, by ghostwriters who signed away their rights to authorship, pseudonyms, and future royalties. The first three books were published in 1927, and were an instant success. By mid-1929, over 115,000 books had been sold. The Stratemeyer Syndicate received all royalties, and their offices handled all correspondence. Public and school libraries agreed to keep the ghostwriters' names secret.\nThe earliest books are known for their atmosphere, detail, and clear writing style. Between 1938 to 1942 futuristic gadgetry and exotic locations were introduced to the series. The world in these early books is a dark and \"divided place\". Police and authority figures usually come off poorly; the rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish; and racial stereotypes abound. Parents complained and a revision project was undertaken in 1959. Texts were streamlined; stereotypes eliminated; plots were rewritten, lurid elements deleted, chapters per book were reduced, slang and difficult words were deleted, and the writing style was tightened. The revised versions focused on non-stop action rather than atmosphere and suspense, and were meant for a younger audience with short attention spans. Commentators thought the originals had been \"gutted\".\n\nThereafter, the books became more respectful of law and authority. Villains no longer smoked or drank, and scenes involving guns and shoot-outs were removed. The boys, too, become more respectful of rules and law: they drove within the speed limit, for example, even in pursuit of a villain. The Hardys became upscale and lost touch with the typical boy who bought their books. They became \"members and agents of the adult ruling class, acting on behalf of that ruling class.\"\n\nNew series were launched in the last decades of the 20th century: the Hardy Boys Casefiles in 1987 and the Clues Brothers in 1997. The boys have distinct personalities and carry guns in the Casefiles series. The long-running Hardy Boys Mystery Stories series ended in 2005, and was replaced with \"The Hardy Boys: Undercover Brothers\". In these books, the boys take turns narrating their adventures, and are given their cases by a secret group called American Teens Against Crime (ATAC). The Hardys were also featured in a graphic novel series (2005), and a chapter book series for early readers called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files (2010).\n\nThe Hardy Boys have been called \"a cultural touchstone all over the world\". The books have been translated into over 25 languages. The books have been continuously in print since 1927. The series was an instant success: by mid-1929 over 115,000 books had been sold, and as of 2008 the books were selling over a million copies a year. The first Hardy Boys book, \"The Tower Treasure\", sells over 100,000 copies a year. Worldwide, over 70 million copies of Hardy Books have been sold.\n\nThe longest-running series of books to feature the Hardy Boys is the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories, sometimes also called the Hardy Boys Mysteries. The series ran from 1927 to 2005 and comprises 190 books. Some consider only the first 58 volumes of this series to be part of the Hardy Boys canon. The Hardy Boys also appeared in 127 volumes of the Casefiles series and are the heroes of the Undercover Brothers series. The Hardy Boys are largely successful because their adventures represent \"a victory over anxiety\". The series teaches readers that \"although the world can be an out-of-control place, good \"can\" triumph over evil, that the worst problems can be solved if we each do our share and our best to help others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe various Hardy Boys series offer readers an escape from the everyday world into one of mystery and adventure with two self-controlled, gentlemanly, homosocial, idealized young white males who are the equals of their father (and other men) in intelligence and powers of deduction. Their ignorance of sex, their \"squareness\" (socially conventional), their respect for the law, and their homosociality have generated parodies such as \"The Hardy Boys and the Mystery of Where Babies Come From\", \"The Secret of the Old Queen: A Hardy Boys Musical\", and \"A Ghost in the Closet: A Hardly Boys Mystery\".\n\n\n1. tower treasure\n2. house on cliff\n3. secret of old mill\n4. missing chums\n5. hidden gold\n6. shore road\n7. caves\n8. cabin island\n9. airport\n10. midnight\n11. clock\n12. footprins\n\n", "id": "340715", "title": "The Hardy Boys"}

The crater is in the Free State Province of South Africa. \n\nIn 2005, the Vredefort Dome was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as a natural site of geologic interest.\n\nThe asteroid that hit Vredefort was one of the largest ever to strike Earth since the Hadean eon, some four billion years ago. It is thought to have been about 5–10 km (3–6 miles) in diameter. \n\nThe crater has a diameter of roughly , larger than the Sudbury Basin and the Chicxulub crater. This makes Vredefort the largest known impact structure on Earth. If the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica is an impact crater then it is the largest known at diameter.\n\nThe Vredefort crater's age is estimated to be 2.023 billion years (± 4 million years) which places it in the Palaeoproterozoic era. It is the second-oldest known crater on Earth, a little less than 300 million years younger than the Suavjärvi crater in Russia. In comparison, it is slightly more than twice the age of the Sudbury Basin impact (at 1.849 billion years).\n\nIt was originally thought that the crater was formed by a volcanic explosion, but in the mid 1990s evidence showed that it was the site of a huge bolide impact. Telltale shatter cones were discovered in the bed of the nearby Vaal River. \n\nThe Vredefort crater site is one of the few multi-ringed impact craters on Earth, although they are more common elsewhere in the Solar System. Perhaps the best-known example is Valhalla crater on Jupiter's moon Callisto, although Earth's Moon has a number as well. Geological processes, such as erosion and plate tectonics, have destroyed most multi-ring craters on Earth.\n\nThe nearby Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) and Witwatersrand Basin were created during this same period, leading to speculation that the bolide was big and fast enough to cause local volcanism. The BIC is where most of the world's known reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs) are found, while the Witwatersrand basin holds most of the known reserves of gold.\n\nThe Vredefort dome in the center of the crater is home to three towns: Parys, Vredefort and Koppies.\n", "id": "340738", "title": "Vredefort crater"}

The fossil site covers an area of about 100 km².\n\nThe fossils that have been found are the remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene epochs. The site was listed as a World Heritage site in 1994. The fossils at Riversleigh are rare because they are found in soft freshwater limestone which has not been compressed. This means the animal remains retain their three dimensional shape.\n\nFossils at Riversleigh are found in limestone by lime-rich freshwater pools, and in caves. They are from when the ecosystem was evolving from rich rainforest to semi-arid grassland. Thirty-five fossil bat species have been found at the site, which is the richest in the world. A skull, complete with all its teeth, of a 15 million-year-old monotreme, \"Obdurodon dicksoni\", shows how this Australia group of animals evolved. Fossil ancestors of the extinct thylacine, \"Thylacinus cynocephalus\", have also been found at Riversleigh. In 1993, \"Nimbadon\" skulls were found in newly discovered cave. Scientists think this prehistoric marsupial first appeared about 15 million years ago and died out about 12 million years ago, perhaps from the effects of climate change.

The bombing killed 70,000 people instantly, and another 70,000 died later from the radiation.\n\nCzech architect Jan Letzel designed the building.

A teenage female can be pregnant as early as age twelve or thirteen, although it is usually fourteen and older. The fact that teenagers become pregnant is related to many factors. These are related to the specific situation of the teenager, and the group that she interacts with. The rates of teenage pregnancy vary from country to country and are related to differences of sexual activities, the general sex education being provided and contraceptives being available. Teen pregnancy will sometimes involve low birth weight. Social matters also play a role: Often, the teenager grew up in poverty. She also often has a lower level of general education. Pregnancy in teenagers in the developed world usually occurs outside of marriage. The lowest levels of teenage pregnancy are in Japan and South Korea.\n\nTeenage pregnancies have a number of problems:\n\nA large cause of teenage pregnancy is a lack of education about sex and pregnancy. The first to be blamed are schools and teachers, but the real starting point should be from within the family. Sometimes parents might think talking about sex is inappropriate or that it is automatically encouraging their children to have sex, so they avoid talking about it entirely. This leaves kids with information only from their peers, which often includes pressure to engage in sex acts to meet social standards. Parents should realize that in attempting to protect their children from the reality of human sexuality they are causing more harm than good. Open discussion about sex in a safe, nonjudgmental environment is essential to helping minors make educated decisions about sex. Pediatricians also take it upon themselves to make up for the information that has not been properly communicated to teens, and continually recognize better education as the key to helping reduce teen pregnancy.\n", "id": "340870", "title": "Teenage pregnancy"}

It involved 2 trains, one run by Thames Trains, the other by First Great Western.\n\nA train run by Thames Trains left London Paddington railway station for Bedwyn in Wiltshire at 08:06am. \n\nIt was a \"Thames Turbo\", painted in Network SouthEast colours and made up of 3 carriages. \n\nAt Ladbroke Grove Junction, trains switched onto the usual route, one track for trains away from London, the other for trains to London. \n\nIt should have stopped at a red signal and waited until it could do this safely, but it failed to stop at the signal (called a Signal Passed at Danger or SPAD). \n\nIt collided nearly head on with a train run by First Great Western from Cheltenham Spa in Gloucestershire, after the signal that was changed failed to stop the train.\n\nThe train was a diesel High Speed Train, with 8 coaches and two locomotives, one at each end. \n\nThe front two coaches of the Thames Turbo were completely destroyed, and the front locomotive of the High Speed Train was badly damaged. \n\nThe diesel fuel in the Thames Turbo was scattered as a result and caught fire, which caused separate fires to burn in the wreckage, especially in Coach H of the High Speed Train which was completely burned by the fire. \n\nThe drivers of both trains were killed in the crash. Altogether, 31 people died: 24 people on the Thames Turbo and 6 people on the High Speed Train were killed by the crash itself, while another person was killed by the fire. 523 people were injured, of which 227 were taken to hospital. The remaining 296 people were treated where the crash happened.\n\nThe immediate cause was the Thames Turbo failing to stop at a red signal at Ladbroke Grove Junction. A signal before it was amber, which should have prepared the driver for the red signal. Because the driver was killed, it was hard to find out why he did not stop at the signal. An inquiry was held in 2000 by Lord Cullen, one year later.\n\nLord Cullen took note of the fact that the railway line in London Paddington was prone to trains failing to stop at the same red signal that the Thames Turbo passed. \n\nOne reason for the driver not stopping was that it was difficult for him to see the signal. It was very early in the morning and the sun was very low in the sky. This made the amber signal difficult to notice. Overhead power lines had been put up for the Heathrow Express to run, which obscured the signals even more.\n\nThe crash also happened shortly after the Thames Turbo driver had qualified, after his 2 weeks of training. The trainer did not tell him about the signal and later claimed that he was \"not there to teach the routes\" and was \"totally there to teach how to drive a Turbo\". Thames Trains also had no standardised test system for drivers, and no clear pass or fail criteria. The driver had been in the Navy and had little experience on the railways, and had qualified 13 days earlier than British Rail drivers did (British Rail also did not allow new drivers to drive on difficult routes such as the Great Western Main Line between London and Bristol, on which this accident happened, until they got experience on easier routes).\n\nAnother reason was that the Thames Turbo had been fitted with a safety system called ATP (automatic train protection), which would have stopped the train if it failed to stop at a red signal, but it was switched off. The High Speed Train's ATP was also off. Although it was recommended after a rail crash at Clapham Junction many years earlier, it had proved annoying in the past and no company required its trains to have it working and switched on.\n\nOn 5 April 2004, Thames Trains was fined £2 million for breaching Health & Safety laws in connection with the crash. \n\nOn 31 October 2006, 7 years and 26 days after the crash, Network Rail pleaded guilty to charges under the Health & Safety at Work act 1974, was fined £4 million and ordered to pay a further £225,000. \n\nBoth the front locomotive of the High Speed Train and the Thames Turbo were written off. The back carriage of the Thames Turbo, however, is now a spare part.\n\nA memorial garden was created next to the Great Western Main Line near Paddington station, near the car park of a Sainsbury's supermarket.\n", "id": "340898", "title": "Ladbroke Grove rail crash"}

They can live in fresh water or very damp soil, depending on the type. \n\n\"Planaria\" are bisexual (hermaphrodite): they produce both eggs and sperm. To reproduce planaria release eggs and sperm into the water, where the eggs get fertilised. Planaria can repair damage by regenerating any part of their body. \n\n\"Planaria\" are the one of most simple creatures to develop a nervous system. Their nervous system consists of ganglia under the eyespots and a cord of nerves that run down the body, under the gut (ventral nerve cord). The three pairs of ganglia under the eyespots make a inverted U shape that have nerves sticking out to the outside of the head so that the head of the planarian is more sensitive than the rest of the body. If the light hits the animal near the eyespots, they usually move away into darker water. \n\nThe digestive system of \"Planaria\" consist of a mouth a pharynx and a gut cavity. Its mouth is on the underside of the body. Digestive enzymes are released from the mouth onto the food to soften it, Then the half digested food is sucked up the pharynx and into the stomach. From there the nutrients diffuse into the rest of the body. \n\nThere are no circulatory or respiratory systems. Oxygen enters and carbon dioxide leaves the planarian's body by diffusing through the body wall. \"Planaria\" do not have a skeleton. They have an extendable crumpled muscle that allows them to move. Also, planarians have three layers of body-wall muscles that are constructed of circular muscle fibers as well as longer muscle threads.\n\nPlanarians have both ovaries and testes. To reproduce, they can have sex with another planarian; this is called sexual reproduction. Another way planarians reproduce is called asexual reproduction. This is when a planarian splits and regenerates the parts that are missing. However, asexual reproduction is uncommon.\n", "id": "341080", "title": "Planaria"}

They were placed at cross-roads and on the borders of lands as protection. \n\nIn Athens, they were placed outside houses, temples and gymnasiums for good luck and to avert harmful or bad influences, like the evil eye.

In Spanish, it is called Movimiento 26 de Julio, it is often abbreviated M-26-7. The name comes from the date of the attack on the Moncada Barracks, in Santiago de Cuba, which was carried out on 26th July 1953. The participants were condemned to long prison terms, but were freed at an amnesty in 1955. After this, they formed the movement. Their strategy was armed resistance, in small cells, that were spread all over the country, and were kept secret. Frank País was made the leader of the resistance in Cuba, other activists were Raúl Pujol, Celia Sánchez, Haydée Santamaría, Aldo Santamaría and Vilma Espín.\n\nFidel castro and other Moncadistas went into exile. Castro went to Mexico, where he met Ernesto Guevara. In 1956, Fidel and Raul Castro, Juan Almeida Bosque, Ramiro Valdés Menéndez, Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos went back to Cuba to support the cells there. After two years of guerilla fighting, Fulgencio Batista fled from Cuba, in 1959. \n\nUntil the fall of Batista, the forces did not have a Marxist ideology, rather they were different people collaborating to overturn the Batista regime. Later they started to work together with the Communist Party of Cuba. In 1961, they merged with the Communist Party.\n", "id": "341104", "title": "26th of July Movement"}

Tipton had been assigned female gender at birth.\nTipton was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. His aunt raised him after his parents' divorced. He became interested in music in high school, especially jazz. He studied piano and saxophone. He went back to Oklahoma for his last year of high school and joined the school band there. His nickname in high school was \"Tippy\".\n\nTipton later took his father's nickname, Billy, when he started a music career. He also began to try to appear to be male by dressing to hide his breasts. At first, Tipton only behaved as a male while performing. However, by 1940 Tipton was living as a man all the time. Very few people knew both sides of his life. They were two of his female cousins and maybe his later lovers.\n\nIn 1936, Tipton lead a band playing on the radio station, KFXR. In 1938, Tipton joined Louvenie’s Western Swingbillies. This band played on another rado station, KTOK, and at Brown's Tavern. In 1940, Tipton was touring the Midwest and playing at dances with Scott Cameron's band. Starting in 1941, he played for two and a half years at Joplin, Missouri's Cotton Club with George Meyer's band. He then toured for a time with Ross Carlyle. Later, he played for two years in Texas.\n\nIn 1949, Tipton began touring the Pacific Northwest with George Meyer. A local radio station recorded the band's appearances at Roseburg, Oregon's Shalimar Room. Recordings of Tipton's early playing include \"If I Knew Then\" and \"Sophisticated Swing\". The band was well known for the song \"Flying Home\". They played the song like Benny Goodman's band did.\n\nGeorge Meyer's band became more successful, and they began getting better chances to perform. They played with The Ink Spots, the Delta Rhythm Boys, and Billy Eckstine at the Boulevard Club in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.\n\nTipton began playing piano alone at the Elks club in Longview, Washington. In Longview, he started the Billy Tipton Trio. This band was Tipton on piano, Dick O'Neil on drums, and Kenny Richards (and later Ron Kilde) on bass. The trio became popular in the area.\n\nA talent scout from Tops Records heard them play at King's Supper Club in Santa Barbara, California and got them a contract to record songs. The Billy Tipton Trio made two albums of jazz standards for Tops, \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" and \"Billy Tipton Plays Hi-Fi on Piano\", in 1957. The albums sold 17,678 copies. This was a good number for a small independent record label.\n\nAfter the albums' success, the Holiday Hotel in Reno, Nevada asked them to become play there regularly. Tops Records asked the trio to record four more albums. Tipton said no both offers. Instead, he moved to Spokane, Washington worked as an agent. The trio played every week at Allen's Tin Pan Alley as the house band. He played mainly swing standards and less jazz, even though he preferred jazz. His performances also included skits like vaudeville performers did. He imitated celebrities like Liberace and Elvis Presley. In some of these comedy skits, he played a little girl. He helped young musicians at the Dave Sobol Theatrical Agency.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tipton's arthritis got worse and he had to retire from music.\n\nEarly in his career, Tipton appeared as a male only as a musician. He appeared as a woman at other times. He lived with a woman named Non Earl Harrell.,Other musicians thought this was a lesbian relationship. The relationship ended in 1942. Tipton's next relationship was with a singer known only as \"June\". This lasted for several years.\n\nThen, or seven years, Tipton lived with a young woman named Betty Cox. She was 19 when they started their relationship. Cox said they had a heterosexual relationship. Betty remembered Tipton as \"the most fantastic love of my life.\" Tipton kept the secret of his physical sexual characteristics a secret from Betty with a story. Tipton said that he had been in a serious car accident which had badly damaged his genitals and broken some ribs. He said he had to wear bandages protect his damaged chest. He told his female partners this story later in his life. Tipton was never legally married, but several women had drivers' licenses naming them Mrs. Tipton. \n\nIn 1960, Tipton ended the relationship with Cox. He settle down with nightclub dancer and stripper, Kitty Kelly (later known as Kitty Oakes). Her professional name was \"The Irish Venus.\" They were involved with their local PTA and with the Boy Scouts. They adopted three sons, John, Scott, and William. After Tipton died, Kitty gave several interviews about him and their relationship. In early interviews, she said, “He gave up everything... There were certain rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a musician.” She was taking about trying to be part of 1920−30s music industry. His son William described Tipton as a good father who loved to go on Scout camping trips.\n\nThey had trouble with their adopted sons during their adolescence. The couple often argued over how they should raise the boys. Tipton left Kitty in the late 1970s and moved into a mobile home with their sons. He restarted an old relationship with Maryann. He was poor, but stayed there until his death.\n\nIn 1989, at the age of 74, Tipton had medical problems. He said it was emphysema and refused to call a doctor. Actually he had a hemorrhaging peptic ulcer. He died because he did not get medical care for this serious problem. His son William watched while paramedics were trying to save Tipton's life. That is how William learned that his father was born female. Tipton was pronounced dead at Valley General Hospital. The coroner shared the secret with the rest of the family. Kitty had his body to be cremated so that nobody would find out, but one of their sons did not keep the secret. A newspaper article was published the day after Tipton's funeral and wire services picked it up. Stories about Tipton appeared in papers including tabloids such as \"National Enquirer\" and \"Star\", as well as more serious papers such as \"New York Magazine\" and \"The Seattle Times\". Tipton's family even made talk show appearances.\n\n\"Kill Me, Por Favor\" is a short story including a section about Billy Tipton in Ry Cooder's 2011 volume entitled \"Los Angeles Stories\". Pub.

They feed on the acidic bacteria from vinegar and other things, like fermented apples. They range from 1mm to 10mm long or larger. These nematodes go through a six-stage life cycle. The stages are: an egg, four larval stages, and reaching adulthood. They live about 10 months.\n\nThe nematode's reproductive system is sexual. Female vinegar eels have ovaries and produce eggs. Their reproductive system is in the form of a tube. The females also have a short sac-like seminal receptacle that stores sperm. A fertilized egg hatches in the uterus before leaving the womb. Vinegar eels give birth to as many as 45 babies every 8-10 days. A male vinegar eels’ reproductive system is smaller than the female’s. They have testis and a vas deferens. The testes open into a wide sperm duct and then into a muscular duct which can push out the sperm. The duct empties into a cloaca. \n\nNematodes, such as the vinegar eels, have no circulatory system. Through their body’s wall, gas and excretion waste are diffused. Oxygen from the outside environment is diffused into the body, and carbon dioxide is diffused out of the body. Vinegar eels have to live in liquids that have enough oxygen so that it can diffuse into their bodies. \n\nExperiments with \"T. aceti\" were done to understand the cause of ageing. DNA damage accumulates when the rate of damage occurrence is more than the rate of DNA repair. Accumulation of DNA damage leads to a decline in gene expression. There is a consistent decline in DNA repair capacity with age in the nematode. A second report measured the ability to repair DNA damage in young and old nematodes after exposure to ionizing radiation. They observed that the old nematodes were strikingly less able to carry out this type of DNA repair than young nematodes. These experiments suggest that a decline in DNA repair capability occurs with age. This is the the \"DNA damage theory of aging\".\n\n", "id": "341432", "title": "Turbatrix aceti"}

It has a population of 231 (2011) and an area of 9,15 km2 (density : 25,2/km2). Its patron saint is Saint Anna, mother of Saint Mary and therefore, grandmother of Jesus. \n\nThe Castle of Ribalonga was a fortress that probably began to be inhabited on the Iron Age and continued on the Ancient Rome.\nRibalonga belonged on the 13th century to the parish of Vila Chã, on 1839 to Vila Real, on 1852 to Vilar de Maçada and on 1872 to Alijó.\n\nThe legend tells that in the year 2000, a man of the family Sampaio, whose descendants still live in the village, coming from the fair of Vilar de Maçada, brought with him some meat. Suddenly, he was followed by a pack of wolves and he became very scared, because he realized that the wolves were very hungry. When he arrived near the village, the wolves began to close the circle. When he saw himself lost, he got off his horse and knelt and asked the Lord of the Afflicted to save him from the wolves. At this moment, the dogs in the house of Mr. Sampaio began barking anxiously and the wife of the man let them go. They ran fast to the place where the man was and drove the wolves away. In recognition, he built a cross where he asked the Lord to help. A few days later, one of the dogs appeared, all hurt.\nThis cross can be seen today, a little bit degraded, on the place that has the name \"Red Cross\" and that is in the South of Ribalonga.\n\nThere is another legend of Ribalonga, referring to its place of St. Ana. There is a huge rock, rectangular, with three grooves at the top, the head, the torso and the limbs of a person.\nThe voice of the people, that same voice that describes the legends word by word, says that these signs were left there by St. Ana when she was on pilgrimage to holy places.\nThe legend tells that St. Ana, very tired and seeing no other place to lie down, took this rock to rest. And so the stone became soft for her to be comfortable and cosy, taking the shape of her body. And the next day, at dawn, her forces restored, she continued her journey. After that, people began to pass the rock to go to work and, noticing the furrows, they were amazed. Nobody knows how they came to the conclusion that it was St. Ana. Was it because they were devotees? No one can answer, the fact is that currently the village patron saint is St. Ana and the hills and the land around the place where the famous rock is, are known as \"Santa Ana\".\n\nRibalonga borders to Rapadoura, Vila Verde, Popúlo, Vilar de Maçada, Vila Chã and to the region of Douro. It has a lot of mountains, hills, pines and it's very stony.\n\nThe cuisine of Ribalonga is based on meat. There are a lot of different specialities like \"cozido à portuguesa\" ('Portuguese stew'), \"feijoada à transmontana\" (rice and black beans), \"alheiras\" or \"linguiças\" (both sausages).

The city is on the left bank of the Moselle river.\n\nThe name Grevenmacher is formed by two words: \"Greven\" and \"Macher\". \"Macher\" comes from the Latin word \"maceria\" (\"very old walls\"); \"Greven\" comes from the old German word \"Grafen\" (modern German: \"Graf\") that means \"count, earl\". The town \"Macher of the Count\" was, since 1346, different from other \"Machern\" found in the region: Königsmacher, Kleinmacher, Rodemacher, Mecher, Mézières etc. The present name of Grevenmacher has been in use since 1769.\n\nThe valley of the Moselle, which owes its wealth to the fact that it is located close to the water and it has fertile land, was settled long before the Roman era. As for Grevenmacher, the first town was behind the Holy Cross Chapel at the place called \"Buerggruef\", not far from the Roman road to the city of Luxembourg.\n\nA few centuries later, the Counts of Luxembourg chose a safe place to protect their land against the powerful archbishops of Trier. They found it in Grevenmacher, that was the place where the road going from the city of Luxembourg to Trier meet with the one going from Trier to Thionville. Here a strong fortress was built, probably on the orders of Count Henry V. In 1252, this same count made Grevenmacher a city.\n\nThe \"commune\" of Grevenmacher, which lies in the eastern part of the canton on the left bank of the Moselle river, has an area of , with of forests and of vineyards.\n\nThe altitude of the \"commune\" is high. At the church, the altitude is high.\n\nThe most important river is the Moselle (; ; ).\n\n, there are 6,794 persons living in the \"commune\", for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\n\nFamous sights in Grevenmacher are, for example, the \"Huelen Zant\" the remains from an old castle, the chapel \"Saint-Croix\" (this is French and means \"holy cross\"), the \"Kelsbach\", a beautiful piece of nature, the \"Jardin des papillons\" (this is French again and means \"garden of butterflies\") a building which contains a lot of butterflies and other insects or the \"Kulturhuef\" which is a museum and a cinema.\n\nThe city has three soccer places, two in \"Op Floor\" (there is also the stadium from the CSG the soccer club from Grevenmacher) and one on the bank from the Mousel. The city has also six tennis fields, three in a hall and the other three on the bank of the Mousel. Next to the tennis fields is an outdoor swimming pool.

They are a superfamily in the suborder Apocrita.\n\nThe superfamily is made up of the ichneumon wasps, (family Ichneumonidae), and the braconids (family Braconidae). The superfamily contains well over 80,000 different species. Members of the family Ichneumonidae are usually larger than members of the Braconidae, and the family has three times as many species as the braconids. The two families are distinguished mainly by details of wing venation. \n\nAlmost all are solitary insects, and most are parasitoids—the larvae feeding on or in another insect which finally dies. Being in the same order, ichneumonoids are closely related to other hymenoptera such as ants and bees. Many species in both families use polydnaviruses (with double strand DNA) to suppress the immune system of the host insect.\n\nSome species use many different insects as hosts, others are very specific in host choice. Various ichneumons are used successfully as biological control agents in controlling pests such as flies or beetles.\n\nIchneumon wasp species are highly varied, ranging from to long. Most are slender, with the females of many species (particularly in the genus \"Megarhyssa\") having an extremely long ovipositor for laying eggs. The female finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. Upon hatching, the larval ichneumon feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when they themselves are ready to pupate. Despite looking formidable, the ovipositor does not deliver a sting like many wasps or bees. It can be used by the wasps to bore through rotten wood, and lay eggs in grubs hiding under the wood.\n\n", "id": "341502", "title": "Ichneumon"}

It says that in a contract the two parties of the conract do not have the same information. Information economics is a field of science that looks at some of the problems that result from this bias. Neoclassical economics assumes there is perfect information: all the actors know all the states of their environment; they can also observe what all the other actors do. Information is free -it has no cost in the economic sense. This is also true for the ability to observe the other parties.\n\nA model called New institutional economics changes this: information is no longer free, there are costs associated with obtaining information.\n\nInformation asymmetry is concerned with three main asymmetries:\n\nIn 2001, the Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E.

Simpson, a British statistician who first described it in 1951. The statistician Karl Pearson described a very similar effect in 1899.- Udny Yule's description dates from 1903. Sometimes, it is called the Yule–Simpson effect. When looking at the statistical scores of groups, these scores may change, depending on whether the groups are looked at one by one, or if they are combined into a larger group. This case often occurs in social sciences and medical statistics. It may confuse people, if frequency data is used to explain a causal relationship. Other names for the paradox include \"reversal paradox\" and \"amalgamation paradox\".\nThis is a real-life example from a medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones.\n\nThe table shows the success rates and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes all open procedures and Treatment B is percutaneous nephrolithotomy:\n\nThe paradoxical conclusion is that treatment A is more effective when used on small stones, and also when used on large stones, yet treatment B is more effective when considering both sizes at the same time. In this example, it was not known that the size of the kidney stone influenced the result. This is called a hidden variable (or lurking variable) in statistics. \n\nWhich treatment is considered better is determined by an inequality between two ratios (successes/total). The reversal of the inequality between the ratios, which creates Simpson's paradox, happens because two effects occur together:\n", "id": "341512", "title": "Simpson's paradox"}

Apple snails are most commonly found in Africa, South and Central America, West Indies, Southern USA, and Asia, but can be found all over the world. They are well adapted to their region and therefore can also be sold as pets and bought at most pet stores in the US. Apple snails are the preferred type of pet snail because of their appearance and size. Apple snails are also called golden mystery snails, golden snails, and mystery snails.\n\nApple snails live in water. They prefer water temperatures between 18°-28° Celsius, or 65°-82° Fahrenheit. They eat things like fresh fruits, lettuce, other vegetables, algae and wafers. However, they are not called apple snails because they eat apples. They get their name from the fact that one species of apple snails can grow to be the size of an apple. Apple snails are also common aquarium pets because of their size. They also prefer to be with other snails. They are good pets because they can live in almost any water condition, for example, water with low/high levels of oxygen, and various temperatures. Although they can live in water with high oxygen, this makes them move slower.\n\nA snail has a basic anatomy like any other mollusk. They have a shell, a nervous system, a circulatory system, a respiratory system, and a reproductive system. The circulatory system has an open heart system, which pumps blood which flows over all of the organs in the snails body without veins or arteries. The respiratory system includes gills and lungs. They need gills to be able to live in water. They have lungs because their bodies adapted to their environment because of frequent droughts; so they need lungs to breathe during the droughts. Their nervous system includes their brain, which controls their body. They are one of the only species of snails that are not hermaphrodites. Each gender has its own reproductive parts.\n\nApple snails are herbivores, so they eat mostly aquatic vegetation, and algae. In captivity, they are commonly fed fish food, along with supplements of rotting organic waste, such as vegetables.. To digest food, apple snails first break up food with the radula teeth, and then the food will be swallowed, and travel down the esophagus and to the stomach. It will eventually exit through the anus as feces. Apple snails will eat most aquatic vegetation, and can \"ruin\" the look of an aquarium very quickly, as they are scavengers.\n\nApple snails have an open circulatory system. This means that the heart pumps blood, but instead of it pumping through veins and arteries like humans have, the blood washes over the organs, and the organs absorb it on contact. After the blood is pumped and the nutrients have been absorbed, it flows back to the heart to take the carbon dioxide away and to get new oxygen.\n\nThe apple snails are not hermaphrodite, like most snails, meaning that they have two genders.\n\nThe male snail has two kinds of sperm. One is for attaching onto the female's egg, and the function of the other sperm is unknown.\n\nThe female's eggs are stored in the \"ovaria\" which is near the digestive gland. It goes to the receptaculum seminis, where the male's sperm is stored. The eggs are fertilized here. Then, after the eggs are fertilized, they are sent to the shell gland which will give the eggs a protective shell. After, they shall continue down their tube and leave the mother's body, waiting to be hatched.\n\n", "id": "341582", "title": "Ampullariidae"}

That way they will either be classified as substitutes or complementary goods. Two goods are substitutes if the demand of one good increases and the price of the other good increases. In this case, consumers will replace one good with the other. \n\nClassic examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter, or tea and coffee. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity). The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demand for the two kinds of good will be bound together by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if they get an advantage by to do so.\n\nPerfect substitutes can replace each other, without trade-off in costs, or quality. For imperfect substitutes, the customer has to make a trade-off, either in price, or in quality. Artificial leather is much cheaper than real leather, and can replace it in many situations - artificial and real leather are substitute goods. Real leather is much more durable, and has a different look and feel. When these factors are important, the two are not interchangeable.

The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.\n", "id": "341826", "title": "Sphere packing"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341852", "text": "M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle\n\nThe Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was a group of American automatic rifles and light machine guns. It was used by the United States and several other countries. The most-used type of BAR was the M1918. It was designed by John Browning in 1917. It was supposed to replace the French Chauchat and the M1909 Benet-Mercie machine guns.\n\nThe BAR was designed to be carried by soldiers that were moving forward. It was supposed to be put over the shoulder on a strap and fired from the hip. This was called \"walking fire\". It was thought that walking fire was needed for trench warfare. However, it was usually used as a light machine gun and fired from a bipod.\n\nWhen the United States joined World War I, they did not have very good machine guns. One reason for this was because there was no military doctrine for their use. The U.S. declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. At this time, the commanders were told that the U.S. only had 670 M1909 Benet-Mercies, 282 M1904 Maxims and 158 Colts, M1895 to fight the war. After a lot of arguments, they decided that the U.S. would have to build up more American weapons. However, until then, U.S. soldiers would have to take what the French and British could give them. The machine guns given to the U.S. by the French were often not very good. They also fired different cartridges from what the U.S. soldiers usually used. This meant that soldiers and machine gunners had to be given different kinds of cartridge.\n\nIn 1917, before the United States joined the First World War, John Browning brought two weapons to Washington, D.C. These were: a water-cooled machine gun (later named the M1917 Browning machine gun) and an automatic rifle. Back then, this automatic rifle was called the Browning Machine Rifle or BMR. Both of these weapons fired the standard U.S. cartridge. John Browning had set up a demonstration of the weapons at Congress Heights. Congress Heights is just outside of Washington D.C. On 27 February 1917, Browning tested the automatic rifle in front of 300 people. The crowd was so impressed that he was immediately given a contract for the weapon. It was quickly brought into service. The water-cooled machine gun was tested further.\n\nMore tests were done for U.S. Army weapon officers at Springfield Armory in May 1917. Both weapons were recommended to be brought into service immediately. So that the BAR was not confused with the M1917 machine gun, it was officially named the M1918 or Rifle, Caliber .30, Automatic, Browning, M1918. On 16 July 1917, 12,000 BARs were ordered from Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company. They were allowed to make the BAR under Browning's patents (Browning's patent 1293022 was owned by Colt). However, Colt was already making as many weapons as they could (as they were making the Vickers machine gun for the British Army). They asked for the military to wait a while, as they were opening a new factory in Meriden, Connecticut. Because of how much the weapon was needed, the request was turned down. The Winchester Repeating Arms Company (WRAC) would make the weapons instead. Winchester also helped out with the BAR's final design.\n\nSince work on the gun did not begin until February 1918, Winchester was hurrying to make many BARs. They were in such a rush that the first 1,800 guns were delivered with things wrong. The contract with Winchester said that they had to make 25,000 BARs. Winchester were making many BARs by June 1918. By July, they were making 9,000 guns a month.\n\nColt and Marlin-Rockwell Corp. also began making BARs just after Winchester started making a lot of them. Marlin-Rockwell had a contract to make BARs for the Belgian government. They bought the Mayo Radiator Co.'s factory. They only used it to make the BAR. The first BAR from Marlin-Rockwell was delivered on 11 June 1918. The company eventually started making 200 BARs per day. Colt had only made 9,000 BARs when the armistice was signed. This was because they were busy with other orders. Together, the three companies made 706 BARs every day. Around 52,000 BARs were delivered by all companies by the end of WWI. Between 1918 and 1919, 102,125 BARs were made. Colt made 16,000, Winchester made 47,123 and Marlin-Rockwell made 39,002 BARs.\n\nBy July 1918, the BAR had arrived in France. The first unit to get BARs was the U.S. Army's 79th Infantry Division. The division used them for the first time on 13 September 1918. Even though it was brought in very late in the war, the BAR made a large effect. It was used a lot during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The other Allies were impressed by the BAR. France asked for 15,000 BARs to replace their Chauchat.\n\nThe M1918 is a selective fire automatic rifle. It fires from an open bolt.\n\nThe weapon's barrel can not be removed quickly. The M1918 gets its ammunition from a 20-round box magazine. 40-round magazines were also used to shoot down aircraft. However, these stopped being used in 1927. Not many bayonets for the BAR were made. Because of this, they are very rare.\n\nBecause the M1918 was supposed to be used as a support weapon, it did not have a place to put a bayonet. No bayonets were ever used on a BAR. Winchester did make one BAR with a place to put a bayonet, but it was only for testing.\n\nDuring its long time in service, the M1918 was developed further and further. It was upgraded many times. The first big try at making the M1918 better made the M1922 light machine gun. The M1922 was taken into service with the United States Cavalry in 1922. The weapon used a new type of barrel. It also had a bipod with spikes on the end. The handguard was also changed. \n\nIn 1931, the Colt Arms Co. made the Colt Monitor Automatic Machine Rifle (R 80). This was mostly meant to be used by prison guards and the police. The Colt Monitor did not have a bipod. The Colt Monitor weighed around 16 lb. 3 oz. without any ammunition in it. It had a rate of fire of around 500 rpm. Around 125 Colt Monitor automatic rifles were made. 90 of these were bought by the FBI. Eleven rifles went to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. The rest went to many prisons, banks, security companies and police departments. \n\nIn 1932, a much shorter version of the M1918 BAR designed for 'bush warfare' was made by USMC Major H.L. Smith. Captain Merritt A. Edson wrote a report on this rifle. Edson was the Ordnance officer at the Quartermaster's Depot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The barrel was made nine inches shorter (229 mm), and there were some other changes as well. The changed BAR weighed 13 lb. 12 oz. and was only long. This version was more accurate than the BAR when firing automatically and while lying down, it was less accurate when fired from the shoulder. It was also very loud. Though the report written by Edson said that six of the 'jungle' BARs should be built for testing, no more work was done on the project. \n\nThe M1918A1 had a light bipod with spikes on it, along with some other new features. It was brought into service on 24 June 1937. Not many M1918s were rebuilt to be M1918A1s.\n\nIn April 1938, work was started on an improved BAR for the U.S. Army. Early prototypes had bipods that were put onto the barrel. It also had a special mechanism to make the rate of fire less. However, in 1939 the Army \n\nFinal development of the M1918A2 started on 30 June 1938. The M1918A2's buttstock (the part of the gun which sticks out at the back) is about one inch longer than the M1918 BAR buttstock. Late in the war, a handle was put onto the barrel to carry the weapon around.\n\nBecause the companies did not have a lot of money, the first M1918A2s were just older M1918 BARs that were changed. A small amount M1922s and M1918A1s were also changed. After WWII started, it was tried to make more M1918A2s. However, the World War I tools used to make the M1918 were either worn out or could not be used with modern machines. In 1942, there was not enough wood to make the buttstocks, so a black plastic buttstock was made for the BAR. Firestone Rubber and Latex Products Company made the plastic buttstock for the U.S. Army. This was brought into service on March 21, 1942.\n\nIn 2008, one company made a modern, semi-automatic version of the Browning Automatic Rifle. This was called the 1918A3 SLR (\"self-loading rifle\").\n\nWhen the war ended, Colt Arms Co. were given the Browning patents to make the BAR that was not given out during the war. This allowed Colt to make the BAR for sale to civilians. This BAR was called the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle Model 1919. It was first made up of M1918s from the contract with the military which were not delivered. It was one of several Colt BARs. However, the weapon had a high price. It was also not very useful to civilians. Because of this, it did not sell much. Ad Topperwien was a famous shooter of the early 1920s. He bought one of the first Colt BARs to shoot things out of the sky. When the National Firearms Act of 1934 was passed, civilian BARs were restricted. Machine guns for U.S. civilians were banned in 1968. Also, making machine guns for U.S. civilians was banned in 1986.\n\nClyde Barrow, a gangster, liked the army's M1918. He got his BARs by robbing the Army National Guard. Barrow taught his girlfriend Bonnie Parker to fire the M1918 as well.\n\nAutomatic weapons were becoming more popular with gangsters in the United States. Because of this, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover told the FBI to train agents with automatic weapons. Examples were the Thompson submachine gun and the BAR. The FBI bought its BARs from Colt. Colt sold 90 BARs to the agency. Some of the FBI's BARs were sent to FBI offices. They were to be used as support weapons if they were needed. The rest were kept at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. They were there for training. Colt sold another 11 BARs to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1934. 24 guns were sold to prisons, banks, security companies and police departments. \n\nIt has sometimes been said that the M1918 or M1918A2 BAR was used by Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) members in a shootout with Los Angeles police. This happened on 17 May 1974. However, no SLA members ever used such a weapon. This confusion happened because Browning decided to call its semi-automatic hunting rifle the Browning BAR. The SLA changed a Browning BAR hunting rifle to automatic fire. It was this weapon that was used in the shootout.\n\nWhen it first came into service, the M1918 was supposed to be fired from the shoulder. It was meant to be a rifle that could give both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. The M1918 was first given out in September 1918. \n\nAs well as being fired from the shoulder, M1918 gunners were given a belt which had pouches on it for the magazines. They were also given a sidearm.\n\nThe BAR was not used much during World War I. This was partly because of the Armistice, and also because the U.S. Army did not want the enemy to be able to capture an M1918. 85,000 BARs were built by the war's end.\n\nIn between World War I and World War II, the M1918 was given to all U.S. naval landing forces. The weapon could be found on board most U.S. ships. Each BAR had a spare barrel. Big ships often had over 200 BARs on board. Many of the U.S. Navy BARs were still used until the 1960s. \n\nWhen the threat of a new war rose, U.S. Army Ordnance realized they did not have a squad light machine gun that could be moved around easily. They tried to use the M1918 BAR as a light machine gun when the M1918A2 was brought into service with the U.S. Army on 30 June 1938. The BAR was given as the only automatic gun for a squad of eight soldiers. All men were trained how to use the BAR in case the gunner(s) were killed or injured. At the start of the war, most BAR teams were two or three people. These were a gunner and one or two assistants who carried extra magazines for the gun. By 1944, some units' BAR teams were just one person, with the other people in the squad carrying ammunition.\n\n\n\n", "id": "341852", "title": "M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle"}

Very often, the term is shortened to ER model. ER models are used to create relational databases. They show how the different parts of a data model interact with each other. \n\nPeter Chen proposed to use this modelling approach in an article he wrote in 1976. Chen was not the first to have this idea. After the publication of the article, the idea was modified as well.\n\nIn an ER model, there are three different types of objects:\nSince the database must be able to find an entity or a relationship, it must be able to identify it with a set of attributes that is unique. This set of attributes is usually called \"primary key\".\nAfter all the relations have been mapped, they are usually also revised to include cardinalities; a cardinality specifies the number of entities related in a relationship. This information is needed when the database is created. Depending on cardinality and the level of database normalisation, it may be necessary to introduce additional entities and relationships. \nWhen everything has been described, it is easy to create a relational database, as follows:\n\nAn ER model describes the relations between entities. It is adapted to represent relational data. Data that cannot easily be put into this form should not be modelled with an ER model. ER is aimed at designing a database from scratch; using it to describe and change a database that already exists may be more difficult to do. \n\nEven where it is suitable in principle, ER modeling is rarely used as a separate activity.\nOne reason for this is that there are many tools that allow diagramming and that have other design support directly on relational database management systems.\nThese tools can extract database diagrams that are very close to ER diagrams from existing databases, and they provide alternative views on the information contained in such diagrams.\n\nIn a survey, Brodie and Liu could not find a single instance of entity-relationship modeling inside a sample of ten Fortune 100 companies. Badia and Lemire blame this lack of use on the lack of guidance but also on the lack of benefits, such as lack of support for data integration.\n", "id": "341952", "title": "Entity-relationship model"}

He specializes in number theory. He is most famous for proving Fermat's Last Theorem. He is a foreign member of the United States National Academy of Sciences since 1996. \n\nIn the summer of 1986, Wiles decided to prove the theorem. Gerhard Frey, Jean-Pierre Serre and Ken Ribet had done successful research in the last few years. Wiles realised that he could prove a limited form of the modularity theorem. So, he decided to solve this problem. This was done somewhat secretly. In 1993, he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in Cambridge. In August 1993, however, it turned out that the proof contained a gap. Wiles tried to fill in this gap. But the error he made was a very basic one. Wiles got the crucial idea for avoiding, rather than closing this gap. This came to him on 19 September 1994. Together with his former student Richard Taylor, he published a second paper. This avoided the error and thus completed the proof. Both papers were published in 1995 in a special volume of the \"Annals of Mathematics\".\n\nWiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem was scrutinized by mathematical experts. Wiles was interviewed for an episode of the BBC documentary series \"Horizon\" that focused on Fermat's Last Theorem. This was renamed \"The Proof\". It was made an episode of the Public Broadcasting Service's science television series \"Nova\".\n", "id": "341958", "title": "Andrew Wiles"}

This for his work on the Langlands program. He did this work with Robert Langlands.\n\nTaylor received his B.A. from Clare College, Cambridge. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1988.

He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1995.\n\nThere are two papers which have the complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. One of them was written by Taylor with Andrew Wiles.\n\nIn his later work, Taylor (along with Michael Harris) proved the local Langlands conjectures. A simpler proof was suggested almost at the same time by Guy Henniart.\n\nLater, together with Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, and Fred Diamond, he completed proving the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, by performing very difficult computations. \n\nRecently, Taylor, following the ideas of Michael Harris, developed on his work with Laurent Clozel, Michael Harris, and Nick Shepherd-Barron. He has announced that he proved the Sato–Tate conjecture, for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant.

For example:\nis an algebraic equation over the rational numbers.\n\nTwo equations are called equivalent if they have the same set of solutions. This means that all solutions of the second equation must also be solutions of the first one and vice versa. The equation formula_1 is equivalent with formula_4. So the study of algebraic equations is equivalent to the study of polynomials.\n\nIf an algebraic equation is over the rationals, it can always be converted to an equivalent one, where all the coefficients are integers. For example, in the equation given above, we multiply by 42 = 2·3·7 and group the terms in the first member. The equation is converted to\n\nThe solutions of an equation are the values of the variables for which the equation is true. But for algebraic equations there are also called roots. When solving an equation, we need to say in which set the solutions are allowed. For example, for an equation over the rationals, one can find solutions in the integers. Then, the equation is a diophantine equation. One may also look for solutions in the field of complex numbers. One can also look for solutions in real numbers.\n\nAncient mathematicians wanted the solutions of univariate equations (that is, equations with one variable) in the form of radical expressions, like formula_6 for the positive solution of formula_7. The ancient Egyptians knew how to solve equations of degree 2 (that is equations in which the highest power of the variable is 2) in this manner. During the Renaissance, Gerolamo Cardano solved the equation of degree 3 and Lodovico Ferrari solved the equation of degree 4. Finally Niels Henrik Abel proved in 1824 that the equation of degree 5 and the equations of higher degree cannot always be solved by using radicals. Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, were introduced to give criteria deciding if an equation is solvable using radicals.\n", "id": "341994", "title": "Algebraic equation"}

It tells the story of the travels of Rick Grimes, his family, and other survivors of a zombie apocalypse.\n\nThe series was first published in 2003 by Image Comics. It was created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore. Moore was replaced by Charlie Adlard from issue #7 forward. Moore still did the art for the covers up to issue #24.)\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" won the 2010 Eisner Award for \"Best Continuing Series\" at San Diego Comic-Con International. A television series, \"The Walking Dead\" was created based on the comic. It was first broadcast on AMC in 2010. The series has been translated into languages such as Portuguese and Spanish.\n\nRick Grimes was a Atlanta police officer. After being shot by criminals, he wakes from a coma in the hospital to see that his town is overrun with walking dead people. He goes to Atlanta, Georgia to look for his wife and son. Rick finds them in a small camp near the city. The group is being led by Shane. Shane was Rick's partner as a police officer. He helped Lori and Carl get to Atlanta.\n\nAfter a zombie attack on the camp that caused people to be killed, Rick criticizes Shane. Shane pulls his gun on Rick, but is shot and killed by Rick’s 7-year-old son Carl. Rick, as the new leader of the group, decides the survivors need to find a better place to live.\n\nRick’s early tries to find a place to live end very badly. A mother is killed after the survivors go into a neighborhood full of zombies. A farmer, Hershel, lets the group stay on his land. They stay there until zombies break free from his barn and kill several members of his family. Things get better when the group finds prison with fences to keep out the zombies.\n\nRick send a message back to Hershel and his family to come join them at the prison. Rick’s group and four prisoners do what they can to make the prison safe from the zombies. One of the prisoners kills Hershel’s two youngest daughters. Rick kills another of the prisoners when they try to take control of the prison from his group. Because of many problems Rick chooses to not be the group’s leader. He is replaced by a committee.\n\nRick and two friends, Glenn and Michonne, leave the prison when they see a helicopter crash close to the prison. They find the town of Woodbury. It is a survivor town controlled by an insane tyrant called the Governor. When Rick and his group won't tell him where they came from, the Governor locks them up. He cuts off Rick's right hand and rapes Michonne many times. The Governor lets the three escape. He hopes they can be followed back to where they came from. Before leaving, Michonne attacks the Governor. She tortures him and causes much damage to his body.\n\nThe group at the prison get ready for an attack by the people from Woodbury. As time passes and there is no attack for weeks, they start to feel safe. Lori, Rick’s wife, gives birth. Glenn marries his girlfriend Maggie. The two of them “adopt” Sophia, a girl in the group whose mother died. Rick and Hershel are out in the yard looking at their vegetable garden when the Governor and a small army comes to the prison fence.\n\nThe group from Woodbury have better weapons and more people but Rick's group kills many of them and they move back away from the prison. Glenn and Maggie think they will attack again. They take Sophia and leave the prison with another family. Michonne and Tyreese are caught while trying to attack Woodbury. Michonne escapes but the Governor kills Tyreese outside the prison gate. He then begins a second attack on the prison.\n\nThe Governor’s forces use a tank to break down the fence. Many people in Rick's group are killed in the fighting. These include Hershel, Lori and the baby. Rick and Carl escape from the battle. Zombies move in through the broken fence. They begin to attack the Woodbury forces. One of the Woodbury soldiers shoots the Governor in the head. The people of Woodbury fight on, but there are too many zombies.\n\nRick and Carl find Michonne and those who left the prison earlier. They soon find three people who are traveling to Washington, D.C. One of them, Eugene, says he is a government scientist. He tells them he is in radio contact with survivors in the capital.\n\nMaggie tries to kill herself after the death of her family. Rick and Abraham go out looking for supplies. Abraham is a U.S. Army sergeant who is traveling with Eugene. The two become friends when they tell each other about the killings they have had to do to survive.\n\nThe group’s oldest member, Dale, is bitten by a zombie. He leaves the group in the dark to go into the forest so he can die alone. He is captured by a group of cannibals. They eat his leg before he dies. Rick and the other adults find and kill the cannibals. A reverend is the only person among them who think they way they killed the cannibals was bad.\n\nWhen they get near Washington, Eugene tells the group that he was actually a high school science teacher and has no contact with the government. Washington is full of zombies like other cities. A man comes to the group and tells them about a peaceful walled-off town of about 40 people. It is called the Alexandria Safe Zone. He takes them to this town.\n\nRick is worried that the Alexandrians have forgotten how dangerous the world is. He slowly starts to not follow their rules. As town constable, he secretly carries a gun and disobeys Alexandria's leader, Douglas, to stop a domestic dispute. After the newcomers help stop an attack on Alexandria by other survivors, Douglas sees that Rick is a better leader and steps down.\n\nThe gunfire during the attack causes a herd of zombies to move toward the town. They break through Alexandria’s wall and begin to kill people. The people hide in their houses while zombies fill the town. Rick, Carl and Alexandria resident Jessie try to escape the town. Jessie is killed by the walkers.\n\nWhen Rick and Carl are surrounded by zombies, Douglas tries to help them. He accidentally shoots Carl in the eye before being killed. Rick carries Carl to Alexandria’s surgeon. He then goes back outside. Rick, Michonne and other residents destroy the entire herd. This shows Rick that zombies can be dealt with. He decides to rebuild civilization at Alexandria.\n\nCarl wakes from a coma but he does not remember everything that has happened over the past few years.\n\nRick stops a small rebellion in Alexandria but forgives the rebels.\n\nAndrea tells Rick that she loves him. He does not love her back.\n\nA man named Paul soon comes to the town. He says he is from a nearby community of about 200 people. Paul wants to trade supplies with Alexandria. He tells them that he already does so with several other survivor groups in the area. Rick thinks this may be a trap and captures Paul. He gets Alexandria ready to defend against an attack. Rick soon changes his mind and decides to trade with Paul's group. He tells Andrea that Carl is in the house and asks her to watch him while he is gone. Rick then leaves with Paul and several other to go to Paul's group.\n\n\nThe series is very well liked by critics. It won the Eisner Award for \"Best Continuing Series\" in 2010. Eric Sunde of IGN comics called it \"one of the best monthly comics available\". Max Brooks told Kirkman that he read \"The Walking Dead\" and liked it.\n\nIGN ranked Rick Grimes as the 26th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time in 2011. They said that Kirkman \"has an endless supply of [wringers] to run Rick through.\" IGN ranked Michonne as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time the same year. It ranked the Governor as the 86th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time in 2009. They said that he was \"a sadistic evil that \"The Road Warrior\" forgot.\" \"Wizard\" magazine ranked The Governor as the 131st greatest comic book character of all time.\n\nAMC picked up the rights to make a series based on the comic in 2009. It ordered a pilot episode on January 21, 2010. Filming for the series started on May 15, 2010. The series premiered on October 31, 2010. It had very high ratings. On November 8, 2010, after broadcasting two episodes, AMC wanted a second season of \"The Walking Dead\". This season would have 13 episodes. The second season began on October 16, 2011. Frank Darabont wrote, directed and served as an executive producer until July 25th, 2011. Kirkman and Charles H. Eglee are currently writers and executive producers.\n\nAMC released an animated movie of the first part of Issue #1 of the comic. It was animated by Juice Films. The voices were done by Phil LaMarr and art by Tony Moore.\n\nOn February 18, 2011, Telltale Games said they planned to make a video game based on the series. It was scheduled for the fall of 2011, but was not released until April 24th 2012. Kirkman has said that, unlike most zombie games such as \"Left 4 Dead\", it will focus more on characterization and emotion than action.\n\nThe series has so far been collected into the following collections:\nThe trade paperbacks have six issues in each. They have only the story and no cover art. Each paperback has a three-word title.\n\nAll hardcovers have the contents of the comics with the covers. Some have extra material. They are larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover has two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.\n\nLimited omnibus editions have 24 issues in a slipcase with several extras. The first volume is signed by Kirkman and Adlard. There are 300 of this edition. Later volumes were released with 3000 pieces each. There is also a deluxe limited edition (signed by Kirkman/Adlard) with 300 pieces available.\nThese are 48-issue softcover editions. The large books have over a thousand pages. They have no cover art.

The playing field would often go between neighboring ranches. The first team to reach its own ranch house with the duck was the winner.\n\nPato was banned several times during its history. This was due to the violence—not only to the duck; many gauchos were trampled underfoot. Some lost their lives in knife fights started in the heat of the game. In 1796, a Catholic priest said that pato players who died this way should not get Christian burial. Laws saying people could not play pato were common in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the 1930s, pato had rules added by ranch owner Alberto del Castillo Posse. He made a set of rules based on modern polo. President Juan Perón made pato Argentina's national game in 1953.\n\nIn modern pato, two four-member teams ride on horses. They try to get a ball which has six handles. They score by throwing the ball through a ring that is vertical. The rings have a 100 cm (3.3 ft) diameter. They are on 240 cm (7.9 ft) high poles. A closed net, going up for 140 cm (4.6 ft), holds the ball after goals are scored.\n\nThe winner is the team with most goals scored after the time is done. Game time is six 8-minute \"periods\".\n\nThe field is: length 180 to 220 m (196.9 to 240.6 yd), width 80 to 90 m (87 to 98 yd). The ball is made of leather, with an inflated rubber chamber and six leather handles. Its diameter is 40 cm (15.7 in) handle-to-handle. The weight is 1050 to 1250 g (2.3 to 2.8 lbs).\n\nThe player that has control of the ' (i.e. holds the ball by a handle) must ride with his right arm outstretched. He offers the pato so rival players have a chance of tugging the pato and stealing it. Not holding his arm out while riding with the pato is an offense called ' (refusal).\n\nDuring the tug itself, or \", both players must stand on the stirrups and not sit on the saddle.

It was created by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, after the Congress of Vienna of 1814, by uniting the Kingdom of Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples, which had been ruled by Joseph Bonaparte during the reign of Napoleon. It was ruled by a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. \n\nThe capital of the kingdom was Naples. Roman Catholicism was the state religion. The House of Bourbon was the ruling dynasty. The kingdom was full of corruption and poverty: mainly because of this, most of the population welcomed the Risorgimento with the unification of southern Italy to the rest of Italy in 1861.\n\nIn 1861, Sicily was captured by Giuseppe Garibaldi and his men, who were known as \"red shirts\". This was welcomed by the local population. Garibaldi then crossed the Strait of Messina and captured Naples. It then joined the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe peninsula was divided into fifteen \"departments\" and the island of Sicily was divided into seven departments. The island itself had a special administrative status, with its base at Palermo.\n\nIn 1860, when the Two Sicilies were conquered by Garibaldi, the departments later became provinces of Italy, according to the so called \"Rattazzi law\".\n\nFor a time the heir to the throne was given the title of \"Hereditary Prince of Naples\". But this was later changed to the Duke of Calabria after the uniting of the two kingdoms. Collectively the royal family generally lived at the Palace of Caserta. Children of the monarch were born with the style of \"Royal Highness\" as well as the title of Prince/ss of the Two Sicilies. Several males in the family were given titles such as \"Duke of Castro\", \"Count of Caserta\", \"Prince of Salerno\", a majority of which were lost due to a lack of male heirs. The present pretending monarch is Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, who does use the title of Duke of Calabria. \n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The city of Benevento was formally included in this department, but it was occupied by the Papal States and was \"de facto\" an exclave of that country.\n", "id": "342266", "title": "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies"}

It is the most widely distributed species of owl, and one of the most widespread of all birds. The barn-owl family Tytonidae is one of two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). It is known by many other names in different parts of the world, which is one of the problems with 'common names'. It is one of the main reasons Linnaeus invented his system of scientific naming.\n\nThis owl has long wings, a pale face, and a square-shaped tail. It lives in rural areas like farms and woodland. The barn owl has a wing span of 75–110 cm and its body length measures up to around 25–50 cm. It weighs between 187 and 800 grams.\n\nBarn owls' breeding season is spring and it breeds in nests in trees. It eats small mammals, reptiles, fish, insects and smaller birds.\n\n\"Tyto alba\" is nocturnal, as usual for owls. However, it often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day, when it moves from a sleeping place it does not like.\n\nThis is a bird of open country such as farmland or grassland with some interspersed woodland. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods. It has an effortless wavering flight as it moves over pastures or similar hunting grounds. Like most owls, the Barn Owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers help to break up the flow of air over its wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it. \n\nIt hunts by flying low and slowly over an area of open ground, hovering over spots that conceal potential prey. They may also use fence posts or other lookouts to ambush prey. The Barn Owl feeds primarily on small vertebrates such as rodents. \n\nStudies have shown that an individual Barn Owl may eat one or more rodents per night; a nesting pair and their young can eat more than 1,000 rodents per year. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up most of the prey. Such animals probably make up at least three-quarters of the biomass eaten by each and every \"T. alba\", except in some island populations. In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the Bank vole in the 1950s has led to a major shift in the Barn Owl's diet: where their ranges overlap the vole is now by far the largest prey item. The diet is supplemented with local small vertebrate and large invertebrate life. \n", "id": "342555", "title": "Common barn owl"}

When the King or Queen dies, the job passes to their son, daughter or next in line to the throne. As monarch of Australia, they then have ceremonial and constitutional duties as part of the government of Australia. The Governor General of Australia does the work of the monarch for the national Government. State Governors do the work of the monarch for State Governments of Australia.\n\nThe British First Fleet of convict ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 and New South Wales became a Crown Colony, with King George III of England as its King. The British set up other colonies all around Australia with powerful colonial governors chosen by Britain. From the 1820s, these colonies began to get more and more self-government and from the 1850s they began to become parliamentary democracies, which kept the Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom as their Heads of State, with royal duties done by Colonial Governors who had less and less real power.\n\nIn 1901, after a vote, the British colonies of Australia decided to become one country, with a constitutional monarchy with Queen Victoria as the monarch. The Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) opened the first Parliament of Australia in 1901 and the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother) opened the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927. \n\nThe Balfour Declaration of 1926, changed the situation in the British Empire, so that United Kingdom and the Dominions (like Australia, Canada and New Zealand) were to be seen as equal and independent, but \"united by a common allegiance to the Crown\". This situation of independent monarchies was confirmed by the Statute of Westminster. The Curtin Labor Government chose Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester (the brother of King George VI), as Governor-General during the Second World War. \n\nQueen Elizabeth II became the first reigning monarch to visit Australia in 1954, greeted by huge crowds across the nation. Her son Prince Charles went to school in Australia in 1967. Her grandson Prince Harry lived in Australia for some of his gap-year in 2003.\n\nThe Royal family was very popular for most of the 20th Century - but by the 1990s, some politicians and lots of people wanted Australia to become a republic. In 1999, the country had a referendum to become a republic, but the people chose to keep the Australian monarchy instead of changing to a republic.\n\nAt the moment, the monarch of Australia is Queen Elizabeth II. She has the title of Queen of Australia and has reigned since 6 February 1952. She is represented in Australia by the Governor-General. The Governor-General does the work of the Queen in Australia and follows the rules of the Australian Constitution. He or she is chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the monarch.\n\nIn each of the States of Australia, the monarch is represented by a Governor. The Governors are appointed by the Queen after the state premiers tell her their choice.\n\nThe Australian monarch is also monarch of fifteen other Commonwealth countries known as Commonwealth realms: including Britain, New Zealand, Canada and Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe Governor General is chosen by the Prime Minister and is appointed by the monarch to act as Head of State. The Governor General cannot behave like a politician or member of a political party, but must do the work of the monarch in Australia. The Governor General does things like opening parliament, and giving out awards on Australia Day. After elections, or when a government loses or wins a majority in the Australian House of Representatives, the Governor General is the person who legally decides that the prime minister has the numbers to lead a government.\n\nSome Governor-Generals belonged to the Royal Family and for a long time they all came from Britain, but for many years all Governor Generals have been Australians.\n", "id": "342629", "title": "Monarchy of Australia"}

Cartridge shells are ejected and new cartridges are loaded into the chamber automatically. However, some automatic rifles are designed to give both semi- and fully automatic fire. Automatic rifles are usually selective fire and use rifle bullets from a magazine. This makes them different from other automatic firearms like the machine gun and submachine gun.\n\nSoldiers in the United States Army who carry the M249 SAW are called \"automatic riflemen\". The weapon is also called an \"automatic rifle\". However, it is a fully automatic firearm. These are normally called squad automatic weapons (SAW) or light machine guns.\n\nAn assault rifle is quite similar to an automatic rifle. However, it uses less powerful bullets than the machine gun or battle rifle. This allows the soldier using it to control the recoil of the weapon without using a bipod or something similar. Bullets like these are called \"intermediate\" bullets. For example, the AK-47 assault rifle often uses a 7.62x39mm bullet. The bullet is the same diameter. However, it is smaller and less powerful compared to the 7.62x54mmR. The 7.62x54mmR was what was being used with rifles when the AK-47 was brought in to service.\n\nThe very first automatic rifle was the Mexican Mondragón rifle. It was designed by General Manuel Mondragón. He began working on the weapon in 1882. He patented it in 1887. In the 20th century, automatic rifles go back to World War I. This is where the Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) and Huot were first used. They were supposed to be used like light machine guns to help soldiers attack.

He decided in the end to write not just one, but three oratorios (a “trilogy”). The first one was to be about the apostles being called to follow Jesus. This one was called \"The Apostles\" and was composed and performed in 1903. The second one was to be about the apostles being persecuted. This one, first performed in 1906, was given the title The Kingdom. The third one was going to be about the Last Judgement. Elgar never got round to composing it, although he thought about it as late as the 1920s.\n\nElgar prepared the words of \"The Kingdom\" himself. He describes events from the Acts of the Apostles, and he also put in lines from the Gospels, the Old Testament and the Apocrypha.\n\nA lot of the music is calm and thoughtful rather than dramatic. If Elgar had completed all three oratorios, \"The Kingdom\" would have been the middle one: quiet and relective between two more dramatic ones. As in \"The Apostles\" , Elgar used the idea of the Leitmotif. This is something that Richard Wagner had developed in his operas: the technique of having short tunes (motifs) which represent particular characters or events in the story.\n\nThe oratorio is divided into a prelude which is played by the orchestra, and five parts.\n\n\"The Kingdom\" is written for a large orchestra. There is a double chorus (the choir split into 8 parts) with semichorus, and four soloists who represent The Blessed Virgin (soprano), Mary Magdalene (contralto), St John (tenor), and St Peter (bass).\n\nIn the orchestral prelude we first hear tunes (motives) which we heard in \"The Apostles\". There are motifs which represent Jesus’ sadness, and one for Peter, another one representing the new faith, Christ the Redeemer and the prelude ends by hearing these last two at the same time.\n\nPart I is about the Apostles and Holy Women meeting after Christ’s Ascension. Matthew is chosen to take Judas’ place.\n\nPart II is quite short. Mary (Christ’s mother) and Mary Magdalene are talking about a lame man and remembering how Jesus healed the blind and the lame.\n\nPart III is about the Pentecost. This is when the Holy Spirit came down and gave the apostles the ability to speak all languages so that they could tell everybody in the world about Jesus. Peter tells everybody that they should be baptised in the Name of the Lord.\n\nPart IV John sings a big duet with Peter. They preach to the crowd about Jesus’s resurrection, so they get arrested. After their arrest Mary prays for the two men (this is not in the Bible, it was Elgar’s idea).\n\nPart V The opening chorus is heard in a different form. The Apostles and Holy Women take communion and sing the Lord's Prayer. Christ the Redeemer appears, and the work finishes with the theme of the new faith. The music does not end in a loud burst of glory, but quietly and peacefully.\n\n\n", "id": "342669", "title": "The Kingdom (Elgar)"}

They were used to take command of the sea, and represented the apex of a nation's naval power. In 1906 the new HMS Dreadnought made all older battleships obsolete. \n\nBattleships gave support gunnery (that is: shooting targets on coast or inland) for amphibious invasions. They often served as flagships. \n\nAfter World War II with the rise of bombers and guided missiles, a battleship's large guns and thick armor were less useful for fighting other ships. Battleships were no longer made, and faded from use. The United States Navy used battleships until 2004, when the last ones were made museums.

During her childhood, her family moved many times. She read a lot. She attended Holy Cross College.\n\nMcCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian, and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis. She was told not to be a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked in Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney. \n\nIn 1963, McCullough moved to the United Kingdom for four years. At Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University. He offered her a research associate job at Yale. McCullough spent ten years from April 1967 to 1976 researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was while at Yale that she wrote her first two books.\n\nBecause these books were successful, McCullough stopped being a doctor. In the late 1970s, she lived in London and Connecticut, USA.

They are all called Indigenous Australians. It includes a variety of distinctive traditional music styles practiced by Indigenous Australian people. It also has a range of contemporary musical styles of and fusion with European traditions. Music has formed an strong part of the social, cultural and ceremonial observances of these peoples. This is true both in the far past and the present day. There are performance and musical instrumentation which are unique to particular regions or Indigenous Australian groups. There are some musical traditions which are common through much of the Australian continent, and even beyond. The culture of the Torres Strait Islanders is part of New Guinea. \n\nIn addition to these traditions, there has been an influence from the 18th century European colonisation. Likewise non-indigenous artists and performers have used and sampled indigenous Australian styles and instruments in their works. Contemporary musical styles such as rock and roll, country, rap and reggae have all featured a variety of notable Indigenous Australian performers.\n\nA didgeridoo is a type of musical instrument. It is one of the oldest instruments to date. It has a long tube, without finger holes, through which the player blows. It is sometimes fitted with a mouthpiece of beeswax. Didgeridoos are usually made of eucalyptus, but new materials such as PVC piping can be used. \n\nA clapstick is a type of musical instrument that is in the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to strike a drum, clapsticks are for striking one stick on another.\n\nBunggul is a style of music that came into being around the Mann River. It is known for its intense lyrics. They are often stories of epic journeys. They continue, or repeat, unaccompanied after the music has stopped.\n\nA particular clan in Aboriginal culture may share songs. Songs are about clan or family history. They are often updated to take into account popular movies and music, controversies and social relationships.\n\nSonglines are about Dreamtime. They have oral lore and storytelling in a series of song cycles. These songs often describe how the features of the land were made and named during the Dreamtime. By singing the songs in the right order, indigenous Australians could travel vast distances. \n\nA mourning lament recorded in a number of places in central and northern Australia and among the Torres Strait Islanders.\n\nThe Krill Krill song cycle is new music from east Kimberley. A man named Rover Thomas discovered the ceremony in 1974. This was after a woman to whom he was spiritually related was killed. Thomas says he was visited by her spirit and she gave him the ceremony. In addition to the music, Thomas and others, including Hector Jandany and Queenie McKenzie, made a famous style of painting to go with the ceremony.\n\nKun-borrk was started around the Adelaide, Mann and Rose Rivers. It has a didgeridoo start and then percussion and vocals. The vocal often include words.\n\nWangga started near the South Alligator River. It has a very high note to start the song. This joined by rhythmic percussion. It is followed by a sudden shift to a low tone.\n\nA number of Indigenous Australians have had mainstream success, such as Jimmy Little, Yothu Yindi, Troy Cassar-Daley and NoKTuRNL. Indigenous music has also had broad exposure through the world music movement.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=343082", "text": "Falstaff (opera)\n\nFalstaff is an Italian opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, on a libretto by Arrigo Boito, based on William Shakespeare's \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". It was first performed in Milan, on February 9, 1893. Verdi's last opera and perhaps greatest masterpiece, composed when he was 80, and only his second comedy since his earlier attempt \"Un giorno di regno\" in 1840.\n\nWhen Verdi composed \"Falstaff\" he was not writing it for a commission. He was just writing it for his own pleasure, without a performance in mind. When he had finished it he felt that it would be his last work and that his life’s work had finished. It was almost true. It was indeed his last opera and his last big work.\n\nWhen composers turn plays into operas they usually have to make some changes in the drama to make it suitable to be sung. Verdi had already turned two other Shakespeare plays into opera: \"Otello\" and \"Macbeth\". When he composed these he worked with librettists to create something as close to Shakespeare’s plays as possible, but when writing \"Falstaff\" he took more freedom. The character of Falstaff is very close to the way he is shown in Shakespeare’s \"Henry IV\" plays, rather than the Falstaff of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". \n\n\nThis takes place in the Garter Inn (). Dr Caius, who is a rich man with servants, complains that Falstaff has beaten his servants and that Falstaff’s two friends Bardolfo and Pistola made him drunk and then stole his money. Falstaff laughs at him. He says he will never get drunk again unless he is in the company of good, religious people. Bardolfo and Pistola in the background sing “Amen” until Falstaff stops them, complaining that they sing out of tune.\n\nFalstaff complains that his bill for the drinks is very high. He says that his two friends drink so much that he won’t have enough to eat and he’ll get thin and then he cannot be his proper self. He says he is in love with two ladies: Mrs Ford and Mrs Page. He has written love letters to them both. He asks his two friends to take the letters to them, but they refuse. Falstaff is cross and gets a page boy to take them instead. Then he chases his friends with a broom.\n\nThe next scene changes to the garden of Ford’s house. Four ladies are in the garden: Alice Ford and Meg Page and also Mistress Quickly and Anne Ford, the daughter of Mr and Mrs Ford. Verdi calls her “Nannetta”. The four of them look at the two letters that Alice and Meg have received and find they are exactly the same except for the address. They are amused and a bit annoyed, so they decide to tease Falstaff.\n\nMr Ford is walking with Dr Caius, Fenton and Falstaff’s two friends. Fenton is a young man who is in love with Nannetta, but Ford does not want him to marry his daughter. Bardolfo and Pistola have deserted Falstaff. They tell Ford that Falstaff is in love with his wife. He is cross, of course, and plans revenge. The music of the four ladies and the music of the five men is sometimes heard separately, and sometimes it is combined. Fenton and Nannetta stay behind to kiss and they sing a love duet. When the men and ladies come back they each sing their own music again. This is a famous ensemble: the way Verdi has combined the two songs is very clever.\n\nBardolfo and Pistola are back in the Garter Inn with Falstaff. They pretend they are very sorry to have deserted Falstaff. They tell him that there is an old woman outside who wants to speak to him. It is Mistress Quickly, who comes in and curtseys very low to Falstaff. She gives him the message that Alice would love to see him, but that Meg’s husband is guarding her and never leaves her by herself. He can see Alice when her husband is out between two and three o’ clock (). Falstaff is pleased and gives Mistress Quickly a tip (some money) as she leaves. He sings to himself “Alice is mine” (“”).\n\nThe next visitor Falstaff has is Ford. Falstaff does not know who he is. Ford says his name is Master Brook (Signor Fontana). He gives Falstaff a purse with silver and tells him that he is in love with Mistress Ford (Alice). He asks Falstaff to get her for him. Falstaff says he will be seeing her that very afternoon. Ford asks him whether he knows Alice’s husband (i.e. himself). Falstaff says he does and he describes to him what a terrible man Ford is. It is a very comic scene with a lot of very clever humour.\n\nWhen Falstaff goes out to change his clothes Ford shows his anger. When Falstaff returns the two men go out arm in arm like friends, arguing about who shall go through the door first.\n\nBack in Ford’s house the four women are getting ready to tease Falstaff. From the conversation we learn that Ford wants Nannette to marry Dr Caius who is a fussy old man. Nannette of course wants to marry young Fenton.\n\nWhen Falstaff comes Alice is playing the lute. He sings to her accompaniment. When Quickly says that Ford is coming they hide Falstaff behind a screen. Ford and his men start to search another part of the house, and the women hide Falstaff inside a big laundry basket with dirty clothes. Ford comes back, he hears the sound of kissing and thinks it is his wife with Falstaff, but he finds it is Nannetta and Fenton. Ford goes out furiously, and the women quickly throw the laundry basket out of the window into the river Thames below. When Ford comes back his wife takes him to the window and he sees Falstaff, who is very wet, getting out of the river.\n\nFalstaff is recovering in the Inn. He is very grumpy, although he starts to cheer up when wine is brought. Mistress Quickly comes in and says he can meet Alice, but Falstaff is not really in a mood for this. In the end Quickly manages to persuade him to meet Alice at Herne the Hunter’s Oak in Windsor forest. There is a legend about a black hunter who hanged himself from this tree, and so the spot is haunted by witches and sprites. Falstaff is told he must disguise himself as the black hunter.\n\nThe men and women sing an ensemble in which they describe the plot they have made to tease Falstaff. Ford also plots to announce that Caius will marry Nannette.\n\nThe last scene takes place at night under Herne’s Oak. The moon shines. Fenton sings an aria. Falstaff appears in his disguise, wearing a pair of antlers on his head and wrapped in a big cloak. Midnight strikes. For a moment he is alone with Alice, but then she leaves him by himself. Nannetta is disguised as the Queen of Fairies. She and her friends sing beautiful music. Falstaff has hidden his face in his cloak, but everyone goes to him and torments him. When people take off their masks Falstaff feels really stupid, although he tries to say that his wittiness helped the joke. Ford announces that Nannetta will marry Caius. Alice leads another couple to him and he announces that they too will marry. When they take off their masks he finds that Bardolfo was disguised as Nannetta, so he will marry Caius! The other couple were Fenton and Nannetta in disguise. Now it is Ford who looks stupid, and Falstaff takes the opportunity to tease him. They finish by singing “” (“Joking is man’s vocation. Wise is he who is jolly”). The music is a fugue, which is usually thought of as being a serious academic form, but the mood here is jolly.\n\nAn engravement was made in favour of Falstaff's existence; (\"Where 'o where shall the holly be on the night of song, more for thee to ascend in me.\")\n\n", "id": "343082", "title": "Falstaff (opera)"}

The meme began on the /int/ board of Krautchan.net in 2009. The meme takes the form of large number of online comics. In the comics, countries and are drawn as balls. The balls interact in broken English and ridicule national stereotypes and international relations.\n\nPolandball has its roots in an August 2009 'cyberwar' between Polish Internet users and the rest of the world on drawball.com. Drawball.com allows Internet users to draw whatever they want. It also allows people to draw over others drawings. On the Polish internet, an idea was raised to draw the Polish flag on the ball. Thousands of Poles managed to take over the drawball. The painting consisted of white on top of red. In the middle, the word \"POLSKA\" was written. After co-ordination from 4chan, this was then covered over by a giant swastika.\n\nKrautchan.net is a German-language imageboard. Its /int/ board is frequented by English-speaking netizens. The beginning of the Polandball meme is credited to \"Falco\". Falco is a Brit on /int/. In September 2009 Falco created the meme using MS Paint. The meme was made in an apolitical way to troll \"Wojak\". Wojak is a Pole on the same board and contributes in broken English. Afterwards, Polandball cartoons were enthusiastically drawn by Russians.\n\nA description of polandball is found on the reddit sub /r/polandball, \"Wiggly mouse-drawn comics where balls represent different countries. They poke fun at national stereotypes and the \"international drama\" of their diplomatic relations. Polandball combines history, geography, Engrish, and an inferiority complex. The comic series first became popular on a well known German image board /int/.\"\n\nThe premise of Polandball is it represents Poland and its history, relations with other countries, and stereotypes. It concentrates on Polish megalomania and national complexes. The meme gained in popularity after the plane crash in Smolensk which killed Polish President Lech Kaczyński. Interactions between countryballs are written in broken English and internet slang. This is similar to the Lolcat meme. Poland is purposely drawn as red on top of white. This is the opposite of the Polish flag. By the end of the cartoon, Poland weeps.\n\nSome Polandball comics are based on the premise that Russia can fly into space. This premise also includes Poland can not fly into space. One of the most popular Polandball cartoons begins with the premise that Earth is going to be struck by a giant meteor. All countries with space technology leave Earth and go into orbit around the planet. At the end of the cartoon, Poland is still on earth and is crying. In broken English Poland says the famous Polandball catchphrase \"Poland cannot into space\". In this humorous way, Russians stop discussion with Poles on which country is superior. Another Polandball comic delves into historic-political satire. Poland is seen to be boring other countryballs. Poland proclaims \"So when we crushed Russia and the turks [sic] were were the biggest country in the world... and..\". This leads other countryballs to laugh at it. Poland, by now irritated, utters \"kurwa\". Poland holds up a sign saying \"Internet serious business\". This is an internet slogan used to deride others who treat subjects with disdain. Then in Polandball convention, Poland finishes by crying.\n\nIn 2014, released a game about Pollandball for Android. In this game, Poland can into space and the player's goal as long as possible to keep it there. Also have the opportunity to play for other countryballs.\n\nPolandball can also include comics on other countries. By convention these comics are usually still referred to as Polandball. They can also be called countryballs. According to Lurkmore.to, Bavaria has its own ball. Other balls have been created for U.S. states, Brazil, Catalonia and Siberia. Singapore and Bermuda are drawn as a triangle and called Tringapore and Bermudatriangle, respectively. Israel and Michigan take the form of a hypercube (in reference to Jewish physics).

The speaker both asks and answers the question himself. A rhetorical question is often a statement in the form of a question.\n\nFor example, in \"Can't you do \"anything\" right?\", the words are not intended to start an investigation or to invite any response at all. What the words actually mean could change according to circumstance. It could be a little joke between friends, or it could be an insulting criticism. Generally, it would be taken to mean \"You can't seem to do anything right\". \n\nThe role of context is always important if someone asks \"What does that mean\". Consider this question: \"Do you think this treatment is just?\". There is no way of knowing whether this is a genuine question or not, because we do not know what the circumstances are. This is true of many kinds of communication, that what they mean varies according to circumstance.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Is it right for a murderer to be allowed out of prison after only ten years?\" clearly asks for the reply \"No!\". This is because the questioner has \"signalled\" what answer is expected. A neutral way to describe the situation might be: \"A convicted murderer spends at least ten years in jail\".\n\n\n", "id": "343107", "title": "Rhetorical question"}

In 1955 she published her first collection of photographs, of a total of 30 monographs during her lifetime.\n\nIngeborg Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists. They went to different laboratories and universities in Europe during her childhood. She first went to French-speaking schools. In the 1930s her family moved to Darmstadt, a German intellectual center. Then they moved to Berlin.\n\nMorath's first encounter with \"avant-garde\" art was the Degenerate Art show by the Nazi party in 1937. It was supposed to make people not like modern art. \"I found a number of these paintings exciting and fell in love with Franz Marc's \"Blue Horse\"\", Morath later wrote.\n\nMorath went to Berlin University. At university, Morath studied languages. She learned French, English, and Romanian. Later she added Spanish, Russian and Chinese. Toward the end of World War II, Morath worked for factory service in Tempelhof, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war. During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she ran on foot to Austria. In later years, Morath would not photograph war.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Morath worked as a translator and journalist. In 1948, she was hired by Warren Trabant. She worked for \"Heute\". Morath met photographer Ernst Haas in post-war Vienna. She brought his work to Trabant's attention. Working together for \"Heute\", Morath wrote articles to go along with Haas' pictures. In 1949, Morath and Haas were invited by Robert Capa to join the newly founded Magnum Photos in Paris.\n\nMorath was briefly married to the British journalist Lionel Birch. She moved to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph during a visit to Venice. Morath asked for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman. He was then an editor for \"Picture Post\" and running the picture-agency Report. \n\nMorath divorced Birch and returned to Paris. Her first jobs were stories that did not interest \"the big boys.\" She went to London on an early job to photograph the residents of Soho and Mayfair. Morath's portrait of Mrs. Eveleigh Nash, from that job, is among her best-known works. During the late 1950s Morath traveled widely. She covered stories in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the United States, and South America. She worked for such publications as \"Holiday\", \"Paris Match\", and \"Vogue\". In 1955 she published \"Guerre à la Tristesse\", photographs of Spain, with Robert Delpire. This was followed by \"De la Perse à l'Iran\", photographs of Iran, in 1958. Morath published more than thirty monographs during her lifetime.\n\nLike many Magnum members, Morath worked as a still photographer on numerous motion picture sets. She met director John Huston while she was living in London. Huston's \"Moulin Rouge\" (1952) was one of Morath's earliest jobs.

It is the female equivalent of male bowing in European cultures. The word \"curtsy\" comes from \"courtesy\" which means \"politeness\".\n\nAccording to Desmond Morris, the movements in the curtsey and the bow were similar until the 17th century. Only later did the difference between the female and the male gesture develop. The earlier, combined version is still performed by Restoration comedy actors.\n\nWhen a curtsey is very formal, the girl/woman bends the knees outward (rather than straight ahead), often sweeping one foot behind her. She may also use her hands to hold her skirt out from her body. In Victorian times, when women wore floor-length, hooped skirts, they curtsied using the plié movement borrowed from second-position in classical ballet in which the knees are bent while the back is held straight. Both feet and knees point out so the body lowers straight down. In this way, the lady lowers herself evenly, not to one side. \n\nTraditionally, women and girls curtsey to people who are of higher rank (more important) than they are, just as men and boys bow. Today this practice has become less common. In European cultures it is traditional for women to curtsey in front of members of the Royal family. This is sometimes called a \"court curtsey\" and is often very deep. Some female domestic workers curtsey for their employers. \n\nFemale dancers often curtsey at the end of a performance to show thanks or acknowledge applause from the audience.

It is one of the most important cultural monuments in the country. Since the 1960s it has been one of the major tourist attractions in Vienna. The palace and gardens show the tastes and interests of Habsburg monarchs.\n\nIn the year 1569, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II purchased a large floodplain of the Wien river. It was between Meidling and Hietzing. The emperor had the area to be fenced and put game there such as pheasants, ducks, deer and boar. This was the court's recreational hunting ground. In a small separate part of the area, \"exotic\" birds such as turkeys and peafowl were kept. Fishponds were built, too.\n\nThe name \"Schönbrunn\" (meaning \"beautiful spring\") is from an artesian well from which water was consumed by the court.\n\nDuring the next century, the area was used as a hunting and recreation ground. Eleonora Gonzaga, who loved hunting, spent much time there. She was given the area as her widow's residence after the death of her husband, Ferdinand II. From 1638 to 1643, she added a palace to the Katterburg mansion. In 1642 it was called \"Schönbrunn\" for the first time. The start of the Schönbrunn orangery seem to go back to Eleonora Gonzaga as well.\n\nThe sculpted garden space between the palace and the \"Sun Fountain\" is called the \"Great Parterre\". The French garden, a big part of the area, was planned by \"Jean Trehet\" in 1695. It has a maze.\n\nWestern parts were turned into English garden style in 1828–1852. At the outmost western edge, a botanical garden was made in 1828.\n\nLining the Great Parterre are 32 sculptures, which represent deities and virtues.\n\nAfter the end of the monarchy in 1918, the new Austrian Republic became the owner of Schönbrunn Palace. They made it a museum.\n\nLater it was used for important events such as the meeting between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev in 1961.\n\nUNESCO catalogued Schönbrunn Palace on the World Heritage List in 1996, together with its gardens, as a remarkable Baroque ensemble and example of synthesis of the arts.\n", "id": "343202", "title": "Schönbrunn Palace"}

He made an independent kingdom. A dynasty was named after him. Diodorus Siculus calls him 'Atrapes'. Quintus Curtius wrongly names him 'Arsaces'.\n\nAt the end of the Achaemenid Empire, Atropates was governor (\"satrap\") of the Achaemenid province of Media. In the Battle of Gaugamela (October 331 BCE) between Darius and Alexander, Atropates was in charge of the Achaemenid troops of Media.\n\nWhen Darius lost he went to the Median capital of Ecbatana. Atropates helped him. Darius tried to get a new army but could not. He left Ecbatana in June 330 BCE. After Darius' death a month later at the hands of Bessus, Atropates surrendered to Alexander. Alexander first chose Oxydates as satrap of Media. In 328-327 BCE Alexander did not trust in Oxydates' loyalty. Atropates was made satrap again. In 325-324, Atropates gave Baryaxes (a rebel of the area) to Alexander. Alexander thought highly of Atropates.\n\nAlexander died on June 10, 323 BCE. Atropates' new son-in-law Perdiccas was named regent of Alexander's half-brother Philip III. After the \"Partition of Babylon\" in 323 BCE, Media was divided into two parts. The greater portion in the south-east was governed by Peithon, a general of Perdiccas. The smaller portion in the north west was given to Atropates.

Fernando is also known for his prolific work in advertisement and video clips. In 2009, Fernando founded the production house Spray Filmes. Located in the Jardins neighborhood in São Paulo, Spray Filmes acts in the realm of film, advertisement and internet production. \n\nFernando is the son of the PhD urbanist Marta Dora Grostein and the journalist Mario Escobar de Andrade, director of \"Playboy\" magazine in Brazil, who died in 1991. He is the brother, on his mother's side, of the TV host Luciano Huck.\n\nFernando got a degree in Business Administration at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas, in São Paulo. He studied film at CINUSP, USC and UCLA. \n\nFernando began his career in communications at 15 years of age at the advertisement agency DM9 and the radio station Jovem Pan 2. He also wrote articles for \"Trip\" magazine's website and for \"Playboy\" magazine. \n\nIn 2001, he made his first short film \"Strawberry\", the first shot in HD at 24 frames per second in Brazil. It introduced the actor Guilherme Berenguer in addition to the talent of other actors such as Fernanda Rodrigues and Daniel Dantas. The short film opened the International Brasília Festival, the 27th São Paulo International Film Festival, the Paulista Audio Visual Festival, as well as the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films. The short tells the tale of a boy whose girlfriend's sexual fantasy is to have sex in a bathtub filled with strawberry jam.

A ghazal talks about both the pain of loss and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient. It started in 6th century Arabic verse. It comes from the Arabian panegyric qasida. The structure of the ghazal are similar in strictness to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In its style and content it is a genre with a lot of variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. It is one of the main poetic forms the Indo-Perso-Arabic civilization gave to the eastern Islamic world. \n\nThe ghazal spread into South Asia in the 12th century. This was because of the influence of Sufi mystics and the courts of the new Islamic Sultanate. Although the ghazal is mostly a form of Dari poetry and Urdu poetry, today it is found in the poetry of many languages of the Indian sub-continent. \n\nGhazals were written by the Persian mystics and poets Rumi (13th century) and Hafiz (14th century), the Azeri poet Fuzuli (16th century), as well as Mirza Ghalib (1797–1869) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938). Through Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), the ghazal became very popular in Germany during the 19th century. The form was used by Friedrich Rückert (1788–1866) and August von Platen (1796–1835). The Kashmiri-American poet Agha Shahid Ali liked the form. He edited a volume of \"real ghazals in English\". \n\nIt is common in ghazals for the poet's name to be in the last verse. This is known as takhallus.\n", "id": "343522", "title": "Ghazal"}

It was used by his son Alexander the Great to conquer the Persian Empire. The formation was made up of spearmen carrying 18 to 20 ft (5.56 m) long spears. These were called sarissas. They were two-handed; the smaller shields were slung over the left shoulder. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx was impregnable from the front, but vulnerable from the sides and back, where it could be attacked by the enemy cavalry. Therefore, the system required protection, which it got from the Macedonian cavalry, which was the most flexible force.\nAt the start of a battle, Alexander used the phalanx to pin down the enemy. His heavy cavalry would drive the enemy horse from the field, and then charge selected opponents or exposed enemy unit flanks. Then, the phalanx would move against the centre. \n\nThe early Greek city states often fought on narrow valley floors, where cavalry was not so important. Often, there was little or no cavalry. But in the Greco-Persian Wars, the battles were fought on more open land, where cavalry was a great force. An example of this is the Battle of Gaugamela. There, Alexander manoeuvered to the right to prevent a double envelopment from the Persian army. Darius commanded his cavalry on his left flank to check the oblique movement of the Greeks by attacking their cavalry. Alexander's Companion cavalry then charged the weakened enemy center where Darius was posted and were followed by the phalanx formation.\n", "id": "343791", "title": "Macedonian phalanx"}

The game is set during the era of Ancient Greece.\n\nThe aim of the game is to expand the town which is controlled by a player, to gather resources and conquer other players. The game can be played for short periods of time. The player can build and research and it is during real time so the player can return at a later point and assign the town's people a new tasks. Upon registering, players are given control of a small town. The town's people pay taxes to the player or can be sent to gather resources instead. The game world is split into islands, each of which can support up to 16 (or up to 17 if the player purchases ambrosia) players and their towns. Each island has a structure called a Saw Mill. There are four types of islands, one is a crystal, one is sulfur, one is wine, and one is marble. With those four resources the player may construct buildings such as barracks, shipyards and academies. Citizens of the town can then be trained as soldiers, sent to research new technologies, or perform other tasks, which they are paid tax money for undertaking. Citizens must be kept happy to prevent them from leaving the town. Citizens happiness factors change multiple ways, the construction of a tavern is one of the best ways to gain happiness. Another way to gain is by building museums and set up cultural treaties with other players.\n\nThe game also provides four advisors to guide the player throughout the game; they are shown in the top right of the screen. From left to right the names are: Towns, Military, Research and Diplomacy.\n\n\nIkariam is free-to-play but players may opt to purchase in-game advantages via a Microtransaction system. This will give them access to a sixth resource called Ambrosia, which can be used for Ikariam Plus, the premium version of Ikariam.\n\nOn building an embassy and upgrading it to level three a player is then able to create an alliance. An alliance is a group of players with the same interests or goals. The players can also put their own units into each others towns for extra defense. With an alliance you can do join raids and work together on taking over towns. If you are the leader of the alliance, how many members you can have in your alliance depends on your embassy level. Also, you get a small amount of \"bonus\" resources each day, depending on the number of people in your alliance. An alliance has three jobs that can be assigned by the leader: the Diplomat, the General and the Home Secretary. The diplomat is responsible for making treaties, answering messages sent to the alliance, and editing the external alliance page which is viewable by all players. The General is responsible for overlooking all alliance members military movements, and has the ability to call off any attacks being made by alliance members. The Home Secretary is responsible for editing ranks within the alliance and editing the internal alliance page which is viewed only by the alliance members.\n\nThere are many worlds in \"Ikariam\".

The paradox is about epistemology: it shows that inductive reasoning violates intuition. It reveals the problem of induction. According to the paradox, the properties of objects can be confirmed by observing other objects which do not have these properties. That way seeing a yellow car confirms the proposition \"All ravens are black\".\n\nIn strict logical terms, saying:\nis equivalent to saying:\nWhenever (2) is true, (1) also is; and likewise, in all circumstances where (2) is false (i.e. if a world is imagined in which something that was not black, yet was a raven, existed), (1) is also false. This establishes logical equivalence.\n\nGiven a general statement such as \"all ravens are black\", a form of the same statement that refers to a specific observable instance of the general class would typically be considered to constitute evidence for that general statement. For example,\nis evidence supporting the hypothesis that \"all ravens are black\".\n\nThe paradox arises when this same process is applied to statement (2). On sighting a green apple, one can observe:\nBy the same reasoning, this statement is evidence that (2) i\"f something is not black then it is not a raven..\" But since (as above) this statement is logically equivalent to (1) \"all ravens are black\", it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.\n", "id": "344031", "title": "Raven paradox"}

It is a good example of what is good for the short term is not good for the long term. Also, what is good for some fishermen is not good for all of them (tragedy of the commons).\n\nSo much fish is caught that the there are too few adults of certain species left. With cod, for example, the greatest production of eggs is from large females. But these are caught, and the average size of spawning females has gone down. Eventually this gets so that the production of eggs is significantly reduced. The artificial selection of large fish has gradually reduced the size of mature females.\n\nThe Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s.\n\nConsumers can get information about the conservation status of the seafood available to them. \n\n", "id": "344042", "title": "Overfishing"}
