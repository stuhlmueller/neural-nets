It is the county seat of Lancaster County. It is one of the older inland cities in the United States. It has a population of 59,322. It ranks eighth in population among Pennsylvania's cities. The Lancaster metropolitan area population is 507,766. So, it is 101st among US metropolitan areas.\n\nLancaster was home to James Buchanan, the nation's 15th president, and to congressman and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens.\n\nThe city's primary industries include healthcare, tourism, manufacturing, and professional services. It also has the Park City Center shopping mall. A controversial, citywide video surveillance system includes the most outdoor cameras per capita of any US city.\nIt was first called Cuteanal Town. Its first leader, John Wright, renamed the city after his home English city of Lancaster. The city's symbol, the red rose, is from the House of Lancaster. Lancaster was part of the 1681 Penn's Woods Charter of William Penn, and was laid out by James Hamilton in 1734. It was incorporated as a borough in 1742 and incorporated as a city in 1818. When the British captured Philadelphia in the American Revolution, Lancaster became the capital of the colonies on September 27, 1777. After the Continental Congress met one day, they moved still farther away, to York, Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania government also moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster, but stayed in Lancaster until the British troops left Philadelphia. Lancaster was capital of Pennsylvania again from 1799 to 1812, after which the capital was moved to Harrisburg.\n\nIn 1737, the Lancaster County Prison was built in the city, styled after Lancaster Castle in England. The prison remains in use. Public hangings were conducted there until 1912.\n\nThe first paved road in the United States was the former Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike (which makes up part of the present-day U.S. Route 30). The Turnpike opened in 1795. The Turnpike connected the cities of Lancaster and Philadelphia, and was designed by a Scottish engineer named John Loudon MacAdam. Lancaster residents are known to use the word, \"\"macadam\"\", instead of \"pavement\" or \"asphalt\". This name is a reference to the paving process used by MacAdam.\n\nThe city of Lancaster was home to several important figures in American history. Wheatland, the estate of James Buchanan, the fifteenth President of the United States, is one of Lancaster's most popular attractions. Thaddeus Stevens, considered among the most powerful members of the United States House of Representatives, lived in Lancaster as an attorney. Stevens gained notoriety as a Radical Republican and for his abolitionism. The Fulton Opera House in the city was named for Lancaster native Robert Fulton, who had designed the modern steamboat. \n\nAfter the American Revolution, the city of Lancaster became an iron-foundry center. Two of the most common products needed by pioneers to settle the Frontier were manufactured in Lancaster: the Conestoga wagon and the Pennsylvania long rifle. The Conestoga wagon was named after the Conestoga River, which runs through the city. \n\nIn 1803, Meriwether Lewis visited Lancaster to be educated in survey methods by the well-known surveyor Andrew Ellicott. During his visit, Lewis learned to plot latitude and longitude as part of his overall training needed to lead the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n\nIn 1879, Franklin Winfield Woolworth opened his first successful \"five and dime\" store in the city of Lancaster. The F. W. Woolworth Company is succeeded by Foot Locker.\n\nLancaster was one of the winning communities for the All-America City award in 2000.\n\nLancaster is located at 40°02'23\" North, 76°18'16\" West (40.039860, -76.304366), and is above sea level.\n\nThe city is located about southeast of Harrisburg, west of Philadelphia, north-northeast of Baltimore and north of Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and 0.14% is water.\nAccording to Lancaster's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\n\nLancaster has one of the highest rates of green roof space per capita in the US.Lancaster now has of green roofs for a city with a downtown population of 65,000.\nCommunity discussion of rising crime rates sought to avoid a government- or police-operated system of cameras. The Lancaster Community Safety Coalition (LCSC) was registered with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a nonprofit in 2004 to carry out the implementation and operation of a video surveillance system. Paid LCSC staff are background checked by the FBI and trained to monitor the network of 164 closed-circuit TV cameras in the city of Lancaster.\n\nIn 2009, the LCSC's expansion from a 70 to a 165 camera network attracted national attention. The national attention led to people asking to end the system. MSNBC commentator Keith Olbermann used the story in his 'Worst Person in the World' segment, \"calling out the 'citizen patriots of Lancaster, Pennsylvania' and criticizing them for spying on each other\". The surveillance system was also featured on ABC's \"Nightline\" and \"CBS Evening News\".\n\nAlthough public opinion was initially mixed among Lancaster residents, statistical and anecdotal data suggest that the network of cameras is achieving the desired effect. In the fall of 2010, the Lancaster Community Safety Coalition was among several factors credited for a 13.7% drop in Lancaster's violent crime rate according to the FBI's Unified Crime Report (UCR). Property crime dropped 7.1% during the same period. Neighboring cities have not experienced similar reductions in crime. Although in the year 2010, cameras only helped solve 28 of the 6,653 crimes committed in the city in the year 2010. Although the year of 2009 received a reduction in violent crimes of over 13% and recorded 465 violent offenses, the following year of 2010 saw a rise in violent offenses. Violent offenses jumped from 465 in 2009 to 511 in 2010. Lancaster Community Safety Coalition had a success rate of preventing and helping police catch a suspect in .037% of crimes committed and Lancaster has more unsolved homicides since the installation of the cameras.\n\nThe Red Rose Transit Authority (RRTA) provides local bus transit to Lancaster City as well as surrounding areas in Lancaster County. RRTA is headquartered outside the City of Lancaster.\n\nBieber Trailways (formerly Capitol Trailways) provides intercity bus transit from the Lancaster Train and Bus Station to King of Prussia, Philadelphia, and New York City to the east, and York and Harrisburg to the west.\n\nAmtrak also serves the Lancaster Train and Bus Station, located on the northernmost edge of the city at 53 East McGovern Avenue. The \"Pennsylvanian\", with service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as the \"Keystone Service\", which runs from Harrisburg to New York via Philadelphia, both serve Lancaster.\nThe city is served by the Lancaster Airport, located six miles (10 km) north of downtown and just south of Lititz.\n\nLancaster is also a hub for automobile traffic, with so many major roadways passing through or around the city, including US-30, US-222, PA-283, PA-72, and PA-272.\n\nThe city of Lancaster hosts several museums that preserve its important contributions to society. The Demuth Museum is in the former home of a well-known Lancaster painter named Charles Demuth. Additional art museums include the Lancaster Museum of Art and the Philips Museum of Art on the campus of Franklin & Marshall College. Art students at the state-of-the-art Pennsylvania College of Art and Design present their works at the academy's gallery that is open to the public. Another newly constructed museum, completed in 2007, is the Lancaster County Quilts and Textile Museum that celebrates the hand-sewn quilts and other textile items produced by the region's Amish and Mennonite communities. Lancaster also possesses two other museums showing Pennsylvania Dutch heritage with the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society Museum and the Heritage Center Museum. Children can have a hands-on experience with educational learning at the Hands-on House, also known as Children's Museum of Lancaster. Nature and geology-minded visitors can view the more earthly exhibits of the Louise Arnold Tanger Arboretum and the North Museum of Natural History and Science. Upon completion, the Lancaster County Convention Center will incorporate the Stevens and Smith Historic Site, a museum that will include the preserved home of Thaddeus Stevens and his confidante Lydia Hamilton Smith.\nEducation in Lancaster is provided by many private and public institutions. The School District of Lancaster runs the city's public schools. The local high school campuses are McCaskey and McCaskey East. Established in 1836, it is the second oldest school district in Pennsylvania. Lancaster Catholic High School was founded in 1926. It currently falls under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Harrisburg. With a P-12 enrollment of more than 500 students, Lancaster Country Day School is one of the region's largest independent nonsectarian schools. Founded in 1908 as the Shippen School for Girls, the school later became coeducational.\n\nLancaster area hosts several colleges and universities including: Consolidated School of Business, Franklin & Marshall College, Lancaster General College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Lancaster Theological Seminary, Lancaster Bible College, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design, Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, Millersville University of Pennsylvania, Central Pennsylvania College,and the Harrisburg Area Community College.\n\n\n from Wikivoyage\n", "id": "316436", "title": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}

The first gear-shiftable bicycle was constructed at the beginning of 20th century. You could choose from 2 speeds. It's not big deal nowadays, but then it was huge progress.\n\nStandard system gearing up or down is provided all its way by bowdens. A bowden is special kind of wound-steel cable, which connects levers with the shifter, derailleur or brakes. As we pull or tap a lever, the bowden reacts at the same time. That causes the bicycle to change gear.\n\nElectronic shifting works a little like that, but there are no bowdens. The system is digital. That means no wound-steel cable, but multiple combinations of 0 and 1 provides shifting. A battery placed under the frame powers the whole system. A battery should last for 1000km (depending on the manufacturer), then it needs to be recharged. Wires for data and powering are hidden inside the frame. Parts of the shifting systems are connected together and are powered by the battery. Shifting is done by servomotors. The shifter and derailleur have a pair of servomotors built inside. A microchip in the derailleur gives us freedom. It is self-adjustable. It has its own logic, which keeps the chain from dropping. There is no need of maintenance, because the derailleur adjusts itself, thanks to a microchip. \n\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\n", "id": "316447", "title": "Electronic gear shifting"}

It is famous for its many curry houses. It has a most interesting history.\n\nBrick Lane gets its name from former brick and tile manufacture, using the local brick earth deposits, that began in the 15th century.\n\nSuccessive waves of immigration began with Huguenot refugees spreading from Spitalfields, where the master weavers were based, in the 17th century. This started a connection with clothing which lasted for over three centuries.\n\nThe Huguenots were followed by Irish, Ashkenazi Jews and, in the last century, Bangladeshis. The area became a centre for weaving, tailoring and the clothing industry, due to the abundance of semi- and unskilled immigrant labour.\n\nBrewing came to Brick Lane before 1680, with water drawn from deep wells. One brewer was Joseph Truman, first recorded in 1683. His family went on to establish the sizable Black Eagle Brewery on Brick Lane.\n\nThe Brick Lane Market was developed in the 17th century for fruit and vegetables. The Sunday market, like the ones on Petticoat Lane and nearby Columbia Road, dates from a dispensation given to the Jewish community. The Brick Lane Farmers' Market opened 6th June 2010.\n\nEmma Elizabeth Smith was viciously assaulted and robbed in Osborn Street, the part of Brick Lane that meets Whitechapel High Street, in the early hours of 3 April 1888. It was one of the first of the eleven Whitechapel Murders, some of which were done by the serial killer, Jack the Ripper.\n\nIn 1742, La Neuve Eglise, a Huguenot chapel, was built on the corner of Brick Lane and Fournier Street. By 1809, it had become The Jews’ Chapel, for promoting Christianity to the expanding Jewish population, and became a Methodist Chapel in 1819 (John Wesley having preached his first covenant sermon at the nearby Black Eagle Street Chapel). In 1898, the building was consecrated as the Machzikei HaDath, or Spitalfields Great Synagogue. In 1976, it became the London Jamme Masjid (Great London), to serve the expanding British Bangladeshi community. The building is Grade II* listed. Many Bangladeshi immigrants to Brick Lane were from the Greater Sylhet region. These settlers helped shape Bangladeshi migration to Britain; families from Jagannathpur and Bishwanath tend to dominate in the Brick Lane area today.\n", "id": "316493", "title": "Brick Lane"}

It was published in 1965 as the second book in The Chronicles of Prydain series. \"The Black Cauldron\" was awarded a Newbery Medal. \"The Black Cauldron\" centers around Taran, an Assistant Pig-Keeper who lives in the fantasy land of Prydain.\n\nThe book begins with a meeting of many leaders. They make plans to stop the evil Arawn from taking over Prydain. The leaders decide to steal the Black Cauldron, a powerful tool, from Arawn. Prince Gwydion, the war lord of Prydain, leads a band of people into Annuvin, Arawn's country. When there, they learn that the cauldron has already been stolen. The Fair Folk (fairies) tell the group that the witches of Morva stole the cauldron. Prince Ellidyr, a poor youngest son, sneaks away from the group so that he can steal the cauldron for himself. The rest of the group follows to save him from Arawn's soldiers, but are attacked themselves. In the battle, Fflewddur Fflam and Doli are separated from the group. Also, Adaon, son of the chief bard, is wounded very badly. Before he dies, he passes on a brooch to Taran. The brooch has magical powers and Taran uses it to find Fflewddur and Doli. They continue to Morva, where Taran trades the brooch for the cauldron. The group then tries to smash it, but the witches tell them it can only be destroyed when a living person dies in it willingly. On the way back, Ellidyr attacks the group and steals the cauldron. The group is later found by King Morgant and his men, who have captured Ellidyr and beaten him. Morgant plans to use the cauldron to rule Prydain. Morgant ties up the entire group and offers to free them if Taran will join his service. While they are talking, Doli turns invisible and frees the whole group. During the fight that follows, Ellidyr throws himself into the cauldron, destroying it. King Smoit then comes and attacks Morgant, killing him. The group is rescued. \n\n", "id": "316539", "title": "The Black Cauldron"}

It was broadcast from September 26 to December 19, 2011 on Fox. Fox has said they will not pick the series up for a second year. The series is shopped to other networks. The series tells the story of the Shannon family as they travel 85 million year into the past. The series starred Jason O'Mara and Stephen Lang.\n\nIn the future, Earth is overcrowded. Most plants and animals are extinct. The skies are dark grey and the air is barely breathable because of pollution. The only hope for humanity to survive is in the distant past. Scientists find a way to travel to the past. They decide to send people into prehistoric times. They want to try to rebuild civilization and not repeat the mistakes they have made in their own world. The group in the past calls their new home \"Terra Nova\". The name means \"new land\" in Latin. People are sent back in time in groups called \"pilgrimages\". The story told in the series begins in the year 2149. It continues 85 million years in the past. \n\nThe series is about the Shannon family as they join the Tenth Pilgrimage of settlers to Terra Nova. Jim Shannon is the father of the family. He is a former police officer. Jim’s wife, Elisabeth, is a surgeon. She is the newest member of Terra Nova’s medical team and the new chief medical officer. Jim and Elizabeth have three children; Josh, Maddy and Zoe. Josh () is their 17 year old son. Josh did not want to travel back in time because doing this meant he would have to leave his girlfriend. Upon arriving at Terra Nova, he finds himself instantly drawn to the beautiful and rule-breaking Skye. Maddy is Josh’s 15 years old sister. She hopes Terra Nova will give her a chance to reinvent herself. Zoe is the Shannon's 5 year old daughter. \n\nWhen the Shannon family first gets to Terra Nova, they meet Commander Nathaniel Taylor. He is the first person to go to Terra Nova and leader of the settlement. Taylor warns the travelers that while Terra Nova is a place of new opportunities and fresh beginnings, all is not as idyllic as it looks. Along with blue skies, large waterfalls and vegetation, the land is full of danger. This danger is not just from the man-eating dinosaurs. There is also a second group of people lead by Mira, who is opposed to Taylor and his leadership. This group, the Sixers, came to Terra Nova on the Sixth Pilgrimage. Many of the people on that pilgrimage had secret reasons for being there. \n\nThe series was given both good and bad reviews. Before it was being broadcast, most critics liked the series. Near the middle of the season, this opinion changed. Many critics did not like the way the characters acted with each other. By the end of the season, the opinion of the critics had changed again and had become more positive. \n", "id": "316561", "title": "Terra Nova (TV series)"}

An artificial fly is cast into the target area with a fly line and fly-fishing rod. This way, the fisherman or woman can catch a lot of fish, both freshwater and marine. Fly fishermen and women use special equipment, such as fly-fishing rod, fly-fishing reel, fly-fishing line, and pitfalls, which are made from natural or synthetic sling materials.\n\nFly fishing probably began in ancient Egypt, but its modern form goes all the way back to the England of the second half of the 19th century. The local fishermen caught fish with live and later artificial insects. This method began to spread to the rest of Europe. National and international competitions and championships were started. This has brought fly fishing to the attention of the public. \n\nLake fly fishing is done on backwaters and mostly on reservoirs, ponds and lakes. The actual hunt is done either from the bank or from the water, by fording or with the help of vessels like ships.\n\nRiver fly fishing is usually done in flowing waters. It is normally done by fording. The fisherman or woman stands in the water dressed in special waders and wading boots. Fishing from the bank is also possible but it is not done very often. \n\nSea fly fishing is done by fording as well as fishing from a boat.\n\nDry fly fishing is done with a floating line. The bait floats on the water. The fly often looks like hatched insects or other food on the water surface.\n\nWet fly fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The fly is underwater and looks like drowned or newly hatched insects. \n\nStreamer fishing is mostly done with sinking fly lines. The flies look like insects or other organisms.\n\nNymph fishing is done with all types of fly-fishing lines. The flies look like young insects.\n\nFly-fishing rod is a kind of fishing rod which is designed only for fly fishing. Its purpose is to give enough power to the fly-fishing line, which carries an artificial fly to the hunting area. \n\nThe fly-fishing line moves an artificial fly to the place of casting. It is only supposed to be used for fly fishing and with the fly-fishing rod and fly-fishing reel. It is not suitable for other ways of fly fishing because it would be damaged.\n\nThe fly-fishing reel is used for storing and backing the fly-fishing line. The fly line is stored in a coil. This coil revolves around its vertical axis in the reel. The fly-fishing line is reeled by moving the coil. The coil is secured with a handle.\n", "id": "316579", "title": "Fly fishing"}

The silver mining started in the second half of 13th century. Unfortunately, the exact date and place, where it all started, remains unknown. Because of that there are lots of legends about the discovery of silver. The most common legend tells a story of a monk named Anthony from the monastery in Sedlec. According to this legend \nthe monk found out three silver rods at the foot of the hill.\n\nThe peak of mining in Kutná Hora was reached in 14th century. During ages there were lots of mines, but only few of them have been preserved. Last mine was closed during 17th century.\n\nMines were formed by shafts – pits going underground. Their depth varied from 20 to 150 metres. \n\nMiners worked with simple tools. Only 50 dm3 of rock were extracted within a six-hour shift. This technology allowed them to reach depths ranging from 400 to 450 metres in 14th century. The deepest mine in 16th century was the Osel (donkey) mine, which reached the depth of 600 metres.\n\nMine was discovered in 1967 during a hydro-geological exploration of the heart of the city. Originally it was thought that the legendary Osel mine had been discovered. But further exploration proved that it is St. George mine.\n\nThe mine was established around 1330’s and remained operational until the end of 15th or beginning of 16th century.\n\nNowadays visitors may see 250 meters long tunnel, but in total there more than 800m of stopes, drifts or corridors.

The ADR was founded on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917 by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis, Georgia. Its borders were with Russia in the north, Democratic Republic of Georgia in the north-west, Democratic Republic of Armenia in the west, and Persian Empire (Iran) in the south. It had a population of 2.86 million. Ganja was the temporary capital of the Republic as Baku, which is the de jure capital, was under Bolshevik control.\n\nUnder the ADR, a the government was a parliamentary system in which a parliament, called the Milli Majlis (National Assembly of Azerbaijan) elected on the basis of universal, free, and proportional representation, was the highest political institution of state authority and the Council of Ministers was responsible before it. Fatali Khan Khoyski became its first prime minister. Besides the political party Musavat who had the majority in parliament, other political parties were Ehrar, Ittihad, Muslim Social-democrats as well as representatives of Armenian (21 out of 120 seats), Russian, Polish, Jewish and German minorities gained seats in the parliament. Some members supported Pan-Islamist and Pan-Turkist ideologies.\n\nAmong the important accomplishments of the parliament was to give women the right to vote, making Azerbaijan the first Muslim nation to give women equal political rights with men. Apart from this accomplishment, Azerbaijan made these reforms earlier than the United Kingdom and the United States. Another important accomplishment of ADR was the establishment of Baku State University, which was the first modern-type university founded in Azerbaijan.\n\nBy March 1920, it became clear that Soviet Russia would attack and invade Azerbaijan. The Soviet Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin said that the invasion was justified by the fact that Soviet Russia could not survive without the Baku oil fields, which was at that time the largest oil field in the world with more than half of the world's oil reserves. According to the common opinion in Moscow, Russian Bolsheviks were to \"help\" the Baku proletariat (workers) in overthrowing the \"counter-revolutionary nationalists\", meaning the government and the state of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\n\nAfter a major political crisis, the Fifth Cabinet of Ministers of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic resigned on April 1, 1920. On April 25, 1920, the Soviet Russian 11th Red Army crossed into Azerbaijan, entering Baku on April 27. They demanded the closing of the Azerbaijani parliament and set up their own Bolshevik government headed by Nariman Narimanov. To avoid bloodshed, the members of parliament had to agree with the demand and the ADR officially ended on April 28, 1920, giving way to the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Azerbaijan SSR) as its successor state. The Red Army met very little resistance in Baku from the Azerbaijani army, which was tied up on the Karabakh front. The first Communist government of Azerbaijan consisted almost entirely of native Azerbaijanis from the left-wing political factions of the \"Hummat\" and \"Adalat\" political parties.\n\nIn May 1920, there was a major rebellion against the occupying Soviet Russian 11th Red Army in Ganja, who wanted to restore the Musavatists to power. The rebellion was crushed by government troops by May 31. Leaders of the ADR either fled to the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which was the last independent Caucasian country that was invaded in 1921 by Soviet Russia, then to Turkey and Iran, or were captured by Bolsheviks, like Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was later allowed to emigrate (leave the country), or were executed (killed) like Gen. Selimov, Gen. Sulkevich, Gen. Agalarov, a total of over 20 generals, or assassinated by Armenian terrorists like Fatali Khan Khoyski and Behbudagha Javanshir. Most students and citizens travelling abroad remained in those countries never to return again to their country. Other important ADR military leaders like the former Minister of Defense General Samedbey Mehmandarov and deputy defense minister General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski (who was called \"the God of Artillery\" ) were at first arrested, but then released two months later thanks to efforts of Nariman Narimanov. Gen. Mehmandarov and Gen. Shikhlinsky spent their last years teaching in the Azerbaijan SSR military school.\n\nIn the end, \"the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918-20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.\" However, the founding of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was made easier by the fact that there was a certain popular support for Bolshevik ideology in Azerbaijan, among the industrial workers in Baku.\n\n", "id": "316607", "title": "Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan"}

Thunderstorms can happen anywhere with two conditions: the air near the Earth's surface must be warm and moist (with lots of liquid), and the atmosphere must be unstable. 100 lightning bolts hit the earth every second, and at any one moment, about 1,800 thunderstorms happen around the earth.\n\nThunderstorms are rare in cold weather. When they happen, it is called thundersnow.\n\nUsually there are more clouds in the afternoon than in early morning. This is because the ground has warmed up enough by the afternoon for strong winds to blow upward from the ground (these winds are called \"updrafts\"). If there is very little moisture, an updraft has to go much higher before the water vapor condenses into a cloud. Sometimes the air can rise up as high as 5,000 to 10,000 feet (1,524 to 3,048 m) before a small cumulus cloud can condense from the invisible water vapor.\n\nHigh, puffy little clouds do not change until a lot of moisture is added. This moisture helps the updraft. Moisture can add heat, which means the cloud will warm up inside and go up even faster. The moisture makes the cumulus cloud \"mushroom\" upwards and turn into a tall cumulus cloud. The winds inside this cloud are very strong. Thunder and lightning begins when the top of the cloud is 25,000 feet (7,280 m) high. The inside of the cloud is, by this time, cold enough so that the water drops are turned into ice crystals. A cumulus cloud stops growing when it hits the warm stratosphere. Some thunderstorms grow twice as high as Mount Everest!\n\nStrong upper winds in the stratosphere smooth and spread the top of the cloud. This make the cloud look like the top of a mushroom or an anvil. The ice crystals in the anvil cloud give it a fuzzy look. As a thunderstorm grows, water drops or ice crystals inside the cloud hit and mix with each other, getting bigger. The bottom of the cloud grows dark with water about to fall. When the drops become so heavy that the winds inside the cloud cannot keep them up any more, they fall from the cloud as rain or hail. Even as they fall the water drops grow by mixing with the smaller drops, and makes big raindrops. Hail becomes bigger inside the cloud. One thunderstorm cloud usually runs out of energy in about 30 to 50 minutes. But supercell thunderstorms can last for hours until they dissipate by outflow.\n\nThunderstorms are very active electricity. Lightning is a large electrical discharge that happens between two opposite charged surfaces.\n\nWhen lightning strikes, energy is let out. This energy moves to the air and makes air spread quickly and send out sound waves. Thunder is the sound that comes from the rapid spread of air along the lightning strike. Thunder is slower than lightning, because light is faster than sound.\n\nOnly about 10% of thunderstorms are thought severe. Severe thunderstorms cause high winds of more than , hail, flash floods, and tornadoes. Hailstorms damage crops, damage the metal on cars, and break windows. Sudden flash floods that happen because of heavy rains is the biggest reason for weather-related deaths.\n\nLightning, which happens with all thunderstorms, makes thousands of forest fires each year in the United States. Lightning also kills or injures hundreds of people a year in the United States.\n\nRegular thunderstorms begin when warm air near the ground mix with moist air, which makes an updraft (a wind that goes upward). A severe thunderstorm needs a strong \"up\"draft and a strong \"down\"draft. A strong updraft is made when, firstly, the ground is very hot; secondly, when the air is very moist; and thirdly, the air above is very cold. When the updraft gets stronger, so does the thunderstorm.\n\nFlash floods happen when slow-moving thunderstorms pour down much more water than usual in a small area. It rains so hard that the water can not soak into the ground fast enough, and the water rushes down the mountainsides or hills into streams and rivers. These streams and rivers cannot carry all the water, so it quickly floods. The most severe flash flood makes the water level rise dangerously in streams, dry places, or canyons. Flash floods can make terrible mud slides and can move very quickly. They can roll big rocks, tear out trees, and destroy buildings and bridges.\n\nFlash floods can also happen when two or more thunderstorms hit the same spot, one right after the other. They can happen when a dam bursts open or ice breaks up. Flash floods can also happen when it rains very hard on quickly melting snow.\n\nThunderstorms do not do only damage, however: they can be a great help to man and all living creatures. We get lots of water for many continents during the summer. Plants receive lots of life-giving rain when they need it. Without the thunderstorms, many continents would become dry. Fish would die, crops would fail, and animals would die.\n\nThunderstorms are also our natural air conditioners. Hot air at the surface rises up into the high atmosphere where it is put out into space. Clouds give us shades, and rain can cool down a hot day. Without thunderstorms, the earth would be as much as warmer. In the summer, dust, haze, and other pollutants come together in the lower atmosphere. When the air rises, either in cumulus clouds or in thunderstorms, spreads the pollution higher up into the atmosphere. Rain from thunderstorms washes away many of these pollutants out of the air.\n\nLightning in thunderstorms also helps keep the electrical balance between the earth and the atmosphere. Lightning is also fertilizer. When it splits through the sky, it changes nitrogen gas in the air to nitrogen compounds. These fall to the ground and are added to the soil. Nitrogen is one of the main ingredients in fertilizer. Ten percent of the nitrogen fertilizer needed for farming is made by lightning.\n\nSo, even though thunderstorms are dangerous, they can be a great help. They give summer water, cool the earth, and clean the air. Lightning balances the earth's electricity and helps fertilize the soil. And after a thunderstorm, sometimes there is a rainbow.\n\nSome tips to keep safe in a thunderstorm are:\n\n\n", "id": "316622", "title": "Thunderstorm"}

It is on the banks of the Chrudimka river, in the Bohemian-Moravian highlands on the border of the Iron Mountains. Hlinsko belongs to the Pardubice region. It has about 10,000 inhabitants. Hlinsko is about 590 meters away over the sea.\n\nIn the 11th century, there was created a potter’s camp on the route from Bohemia to Moravia. From there is taken name of the city, which comes from the word “hlína” (clay, material used by potters). First historical remark about Hlinsko comes from first half of 14th century.\n\nFrom this time, Hlinsko belongs to domination of Rychmburk, which belongs to Tas from Rychmburk, later to Vartenberk and next to Arnošt Flaška from Pardubice. In this century, city obtained reeve’s department.\n\nThere was an old merchant’s route passing through Hlinsko, which was drawed in the Klaudián’s map from year 1518. In 1718, clan Kinských bought Rychmburk’s domination.\n\nIn 1834, Hlinsko became independent on authorities. In 1850, there was created district in Hlinsko. In 1871 was finished construction of the railroad and began traffic on the road from Pardubice to Havlíčkův Brod (passing through Hlinsko).\n\nThere are many well-preserved people’s buildings in Hlinsko and its neighborhood already from half of 18th century. In part of Hlinsko it is Betlém, in neighborhood it is outdoor museum of people’s architecture in Veselý Kopec, Dřevíkov, Svobodné Hamry and Možděnice.

Lewis and Clark explored the Western United States with her, travelling thousands of miles from North Dakota to the Pacific Ocean between 1804 and 1806. \nSacagawea is well remembered today. When many people think about Lewis and Clark today, they also think about Sacagawea.\n\nIn 2000, the United States Mint issued the Sacagawea dollar coin in her honor, showing Sacagawea and her son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. The face on the coin was made to look like a modern Shoshone-Bannock woman named Randy'L He-dow Teton. This was because nobody knows exactly what Sacagawea looked like.\n\nIn 2001, she was given the title of Honorary Sergeant, Regular Army, by President Bill Clinton.\n\nNot much is known for sure about Sacagawea.\n\nAt about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by Toussaint Charbonneau, a Quebecer trapper living in the village. He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife. \n\nSacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–1805. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri. \n\nLewis wrote in his journal on November 4, 1804: \nCharbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later. Clark nicknamed her Janey. Lewis wrote about the birth of Jean Baptiste Charbonneau on February 11, 1805.\n\nIn April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in \"pirogues\". They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks. On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the Sacagawea River in her honor on May 20.\n\nBy August 1805, the corps had found a Shoshone tribe and was trying to trade for horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother Cameahwait.\n\nLewis recorded their reunion in his journal:\nAnd Clark in his:\nThe Shoshone agreed to trade horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the cold and barren Rocky Mountains. The trip was so hard that they were had to eat candles just to live. When they went down into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook camas roots to help them get their strength back.\n\nAs the expedition approached the mouth of the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast, Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to let the captains trade for a fur robe they wanted to give to President Thomas Jefferson. \n\nOn the trip back, they came near the Rocky Mountains in July 1806. On July 6, Clark wrote \"The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction...\" which is now Gibbons Pass. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea told Clark to cross into the Yellowstone River basin at what is now known as Bozeman Pass. This was later chosen as the best route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.\n\nWhile Sacagawea has been thought of as a guide for the expedition, she probably only gave directions a few times. Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to talk with the Shoshone. However, the most important thing she did for the group may have been being there during the hard journey, which showed they did not want to attack any Native Americans they came across. While traveling through what is now Franklin County, Washington, Clark noted, \"The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter,\" and, \"the wife of Shabono our interpreter we find reconsiles all the Indians, as to our friendly intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace.\"\n\nAfter the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to live in St. Louis, Missouri in 1809. \n\nSacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie \"Spirit Wind-Walker\" Butterfield, historical documents say that Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: \n\nAs further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:\n\"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.'

Lots of motorbikes projects was created illegally, but only one realized, Jawa 350 „Pérák“ After war was produce of motorbikes started again. „Pérák“ was first motorbike with Czech licence, all parts of this motorbike were from Czechoslovakia. It was technical a technology miracle of this season. \nIn 1952 was produced one of travelling motorbike Jawa 500 OHC, there was used four stroke engine. This motorbike is used by the police and the army. \nTo the 1960 JAWA cooperated with many countries, for example India, Turkey, Egypt. Firm IDEAL MOTORD in Majsur in India bought licences from Jawa mostly. \n\nIn 1970 were most produced motorbikes „BIZON“ series, and after that was created JAWA 634, which were modernized to model 640. JAWA produced a lot´s of models of mopeds, for example JAWA 50 types 20,21 named „pionýr“ or „pařez“ This motorbikes were mostly sell in SSSR. \nJawa 638-640 has engine 350ccm, it is robust and favourite motorbike in class motorbike.\nToday JAWA is sold in many European countries. The newest models are JAWA 660, JAWA 125 and 50 Dandy, JAWA 250, 350 and. Basic of motorbikes is really the same like 70 years ago, but it is very modernized, mainly motors. Today stronger four-stroke motors are used, two-stroke motors are used to 350ccm.\n", "id": "316684", "title": "Jawa Motors"}

It was built in 1307. It was built by order of Eliška Rejčka because the church of St. Klement was too small. The church was burned and rebuilt several times between the 14th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, the church was plundered by Swedish soldiers. In 1664, Pope Alexander VII blessed the church as a cathedral. The last repairs were done after World War II.\n\nThe cathedral has an old Gothic altar from the end of the 15th century. It also has an early baroque altar from the 17th century. There is a portrait of St. Antoním by Petr Brandla, a pastoforium made by Matej Rejsem and a pulpit by Josef Myslbek. Under the cathedral are 3 crypts. There is a legend about one of them. In the legend, Jan Žižka z Trocnova, a famous Hussite commander, was buried there for a short time. In the towers are 4 bells named Leopold, Klement, Václav and Michal.\n\nThere are services every day. On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, services are at 18:30. On Sunday, services are at 6:30, 9:30 and 11:00. There is a special service for children on Wednesdays at 17:30.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316702", "text": "Computer network\n\nIt is possible to connect a number of computers and other electronic devices to create a computer network. The computers and devices which are part of the network can \"talk\" to each other and exchange information. In addition to the computers and devices which are connected, other devices are often needed for the network to work correctly. Examples for such devices include hubs and switches. Different kinds of network can be connected to each other with a router. In general, networks that use cables to connect can operate at higher speeds than those using wireless technology.\n\nA Local Area Network (LAN) connects computers which are close together. Building a LAN is easier than connecting different networks (by a Wide Area Network). The largest Wide Area Network is the Internet.\n\nComputers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The \"local area network\" in a small business is usually connected to the \"corporate network\" of the larger company. These connections may allow access to the \"Internet\". For example, a shop may use it to show merchandise on its Web site through a web server, or to convert received orders into shipping instructions.\n\nA network must be connected with appropriate hardware. This can be wired or wireless. For a simple LAN, computers, media and peripherals are sufficient. WANs (wide area networks) and some large LANs (local area networks) need some additional devices like a bridge, gateway or router to connect different small or large networks.\n\nA network needs a communication protocol. Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use TCP/IP. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the 20th century, but use TCP/IP now.\n\nTo have network communication technology as one large model would be difficult to implement. As a result, we split up various components of the network into smaller modules or layers. The standard model of a network is the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model set by the International Organization Standard (ISO). Other network models exist, though they are all split into similar layers. Each layer uses the services that the layer below provides, while providing services for the layer above it. Each layer can only communicate with the same layer on the destination device. \"\n\nOSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is a 7-layer network model specified by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) norm and is widely used all around the world. The concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman, Honeywell information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN and CYCLADES networks and the work in IFIP WG6.1.\n\nThe physical layer defines electrical and physical specifications for devices. It also specifies modulated and baseband transmission.\nBaseband is digital data in their raw form (1001 1101 1010 0011). This allows very fast and reliable transmission over short distances; however, the media tend to make the bits interfere with each other, the range of baseband transmission is very limited. It becomes worse with increasing speed. Baseband technology is frequently used on LAN.\nTypical technology: Ethernet\n\nIn telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. The device that provides modulation of the baseband signal is called a modulator, and the device that provides demodulation of the modulated signal back to baseband is called a demodulator. Today, the modulator and demodulator are integrated into one device called Modem (modulator-demodulator). Frequently used on WAN, WLAN, WWAN.\n\nTypical technology: WI-FI, ADSL, cable TV connection (CATV)\n\nThe data link layer provides the functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and to detect and possibly correct errors that may occur in the physical layer.\n\nThe network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences from a source host on one network to a destination host on a different network using the IP address.\nAn Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. At present there are two versions of protocols in use – IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nThe transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end users, providing reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.\n\nCommonly united into one layer in simplified network models, its main purpose is to interact with applications, encrypting and establishing dedicated connections if necessary.\n\nLatency, incorrectly called ping, is a value that measures how much time packets need to travel to their destination. It is measured in miliseconds (ms). The tool that measures latency is called ping, commonly using special ICMP packets which are smaller than standard data packets so they do not weight the network by their presence.\nCapacity is a measure of transfer capacity of a network and is measured in bits per second (bps or b/s), today commonly Mbps or Mb/s. It shows us how many data units are transferred each second. At present, the average bandwidth is far higher than is necessary and it is not a limiting factor in most cases.\n\nBroadcast is a special transmission that is not meant for a single device but is addressed to all devices in specific network. It is mostly used to automatically issue IP addresses to devices by a DHCP server and to create an ARP table that maps the network and speeds up the traffic.\n", "id": "316702", "title": "Computer network"}

These groups were formed as a protection from logging. The most famous area with sequoia trees is Sequoia National Park. The park was made as the second national park, after the Yellowstone in 1980. The Sequoia National Park is managed with Kings Canyon National Park. Together, the two parks are called Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Several trees in Sequoia National Park have even been named, for example General Grant, the Grizzly Giant or General Sherman.\n", "id": "316757", "title": "Sequoia"}

It is located where the Trent and the Neuse rivers meet. The city is 112 miles (180 km) east of Raleigh and 87 miles (140 km) northeast of Wilmington. New Bern is the county seat of Craven County. New Bern is the birthplace of the international drink, Pepsi Cola.\n\nNew Bern was an Indian town named Chattoka. Swiss immigrants moved to New Bern in 1710. It was named after the capital of Switzerland: Bern. \"Bern\" is bear in the German language, and the flags of both towns have the drawing of a bear.\n\nNew Bern is the second oldest town in North Carolina. It served as the capital of the North Carolina colonial government and then briefly as the state capital until 1792. After the American Revolution, New Bern became rich and quickly developed a rich cultural life. At one time New Bern was called \"the Athens of the South.\" After Raleigh was named as the state capital, New Bern rebuilt its economy with the help of trade routes to the Caribbean and New England. It reached a population of 3,600 in 1815. During the 19th-century Federal period, New Bern was the largest city in North Carolina.\n\nNew Bern has four historic districts with homes, stores and churches dating back to the early eighteenth century. Close to the waterfront are more than 164 homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Also nearby are several bed and breakfast inns, hotels, restaurants, banks, antiques stores and specialty shops. Tryon Palace, the home of British governor William Tryon, was built in 1770. It was used as the original state capitol building of newly independent North Carolina. It burned down in the 1790s. People can now visit a replica, built from the original plans and on the original foundation. The Masonic Temple and the Athens Theater are both still very active today. The Masonic Theater is the oldest theater in America in continuous use.\n\nThe historic districts also are home to many of the town's 2,000 crape myrtles — New Bern’s official flower — and gardens. The district has flowering dogwoods and azaleas.\n\nUnion Point park is where the Neuse and Trent Rivers join. It is the city’s major celebration spot for events such as Neuse River Days and the Fourth of July. In 1979, the local government gave Swiss Bear Downtown Revitalization Corp — a nonprofit corporation of civic leaders — control of the failing downtown area. Today, art galleries, specialty shops, antiques stores, restaurants and inns have changed downtown and the waterfront into a social hub. Improvements are still being made. Built in 1995 through the efforts of Swiss Bear, James Reed Lane is a downtown mini-park and pedestrian walk-through on Pollock Street across from historic Christ Church. Private restoration efforts have returned many of the downtown buildings to their turn-of-the-last-century elegance.\n\n", "id": "316772", "title": "New Bern, North Carolina"}

The footprint is then compared to what natural resources there are to provide for people. The ecological footprint takes into account how much farm land, forest area, grazing land and sea area it takes to provide everything people use. More simply, footprint calculations answer the questions: how much nature do we have? And how much do we use?\n\nWhen analysing the world as a whole, humanity is using nature about 1.5 times faster than nature renews itself. It is like using 1.5 planet Earths. Since people consume differently around the world, it is also possible to calculate how many planet it would take if everybody around the world consumed like a particular population. For instance, if everybody consumed like the Germans, it would take nearly 3 planet Earths. Another estimate says \"the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capital on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of \"natural capital\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "316784", "title": "Ecological footprint"}

These goods and services may be needed around the entire world. A water footprint can be determined by math for any well-established group of users, or producers. It is measured by dividing the total amount of water used, by the water that became polluted, in the same area during the same amount of time. While the water footprint of an organization is a good indicator for its water consumption and pollution, it does not show how other water sources are affected. More studies will need to be done in order to determine the effect of the water footprint on water sources.\n\nEtymology\nThe water footprint concept was introduced in 2002 by A.Y. Hoekstra from UNESCO-IHE as an alternative indicator of water use.[2]. The concept was refined and accounting methods were established with a series of publications from two lead authors A.K. Chapagain and A.Y. Hoekstra from the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, now at WWF-UK and University of Twente respectively. The most elaborate publications on how to estimate water footprints are a 2004-report on the 'Water footprint of nations' from UNESCO-IHE [3] and the 2008-book Globalization of Water by A.Y. Hoekstra and A.K. Chapagain, published by Blackwell, 2008.

The two main species are both called 'trembling aspens' or 'quaking aspens' on account of their leaves.\n\nPopulus tremuloides is the American aspen. It is common in temperate and colder regions of North America. \n\nIt forms large stands (groups) of genetically identical trees (clones) connected by a single underground root system. These trees form through root sprouts coming off an original parent tree. The largest known fully connected aspen is a grove in Utah nicknamed 'Pando', and some experts call it the largest organism in the world, by mass or volume. It covers 0.43 km (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh .\n\nPopulus tremula is a species of poplar native to cool temperate regions of Europe and Asia, from the British Isles east to Kamchatka, north to inside the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and south to central Spain, Turkey, the Tian Shan mountain system, North Korea, and northern Japan. It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.\n\nIt is a hardy species which tolerates long, cold winters and short summers. Aspen is dioecious, so individual trees are either male or female (in contrast to most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree). Trees flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both the male and female trees producing catkins. Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds which are tufted with hairs. \n\nLike other aspens, its main method of reproduction is vegetative (asexual). It spreads extensively by root sprouts, which may be produced up to 40 metres from the parent tree. They form extensive clonal colonies. Large numbers of new shoots can be produced in this way, especially after a major disturbance such as fire.\n", "id": "316844", "title": "Aspen"}

In 1894, 26-year old Václav Klement (a bookseller in Mladá Boleslav) could not find any spare parts to fix his bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the makers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter. It was written in Czech. The letter asked the company to repair the bicycle. When Klement got his reply, it was in German. It said (in English): \"If you would like an answer to your inquiry, you should try writing in a language we can understand\". Klement was very unhappy at this. Even though he did not have any experience, he decided to start a bicycle repair shop. He and Václav Laurin opened this in 1895 in Mladá Boleslav. Before working with Klement, Laurin was a bicycle maker in the town of Turnov. Turnov was near to Mladá Boleslav. In 1898, after moving to their newly-built factory, the pair bought a Werner \"motorcyclist\". It was made by French manufacturer Werner Brothers. Laurin & Klement's first motorcyclette was powered by an engine on the handlebars. It drove the front wheels. It was dangerous and unreliable. Laurin had an accident on it, and lost one of his front teeth. To design a safer motorcycle, the pair wrote to German specialist Robert Bosch for advice. The pair's new motorcycle went on sale in 1899.\n\nIn 1900, when the company had 32 people working for them, motorcycles began being exported. 150 machines were shipped to London. Shortly after, the press said that they were the makers of the first motorcycle. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success. The company was set up both within Austria-Hungary and all over the world. By 1905 the company was making automobiles.\n\nAfter World War I, the Laurin-Klement company began making trucks. However, in 1924, the company looked for a partner after running into problems. It was bought by Škoda Works, a firearms maker. Most things made later were under the Škoda name. Škoda was successful again after an economic depression.

The original members were Kärtsy Hatakka, Sale Suomalainen and Jariot Lehtinen. Their name is a reference to popular Finish writer Mika Waltari – a favorite author of band’s guitarist Jariot Lethinen. \n\nWaltari is more famous in the rest of Europe than in Finland and the band members have very positive relationships to Czech Republic. They’ve collaborated with Czech punk rock band Wohnout and Kärtsy is a good friend of Lenka Dusilová. The band has collaborated with many other artists. They’ve made albums with Finnish ethno band Angelit, they hosted on Apocalyptica’s album and Tarja Turunen from Nightwish was a part of Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die! live performance.\n\nWaltari's music is well known for it’s destruction of rock and metal genre boundaries. Their heavy sound is often combined with elements of electronic music, pop, rap, disco, funk, grindcore and bits of many other genres and creates a fusion which can be described as avant-garde. The lead singer and bass guitarist, Kärtsy Hattaka, delivers very distinctive vocal part to their music and makes Waltari's sound even more unique and easily recognizable. \n\nWaltari’s lyrics are as diverse as their music. They’re about various range of topics including everyday misery, personal struggles, science fiction motives, and music industry philosophical questions. They have one thing in common – heavy irony, self-irony and sarcasm. \n\nWaltari started their musical career with demo records. The longest one was \"Monk Punk\". This album presents an interesting mixture of punk and funk music, but the first release which provided the band more positive reviews was the album called \"Torcha!\" and it was also the first one which combined bits of many musical genres. It also includes the cover of Madonna’s song \"Vogue\".\n\nNext two albums, \"So Fine\" and \"Big Bang\" were also very successful. They mainly concentrate on mixing heavy metal with techno, which was something fresh and innovative. Their biggest success among death metal fans yet came with the \"Yeah! Yeah! Die! Die!\" album, which is mixture of death metal and classical music. It also has a musical feeling to it, because it’s kind of an epic story from future sung in dialogues of various characters. \n\nNext album \"Space Avenue\" is more electronic and it has some pop feeling to it. Another one called \"Radium Round\" goes even further in that. It’s almost a pop/disco album with some metal elements. Waltari returned to more rock sound with albums like \"Rare Species\" and very successful \"Blood Sample\". Last two albums – \"Release Date\" and \"Below Zero\" are mainly focused on heavy sound with bits of progressive rock. \n\n", "id": "316896", "title": "Waltari"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316916", "text": "Multiple sclerosis\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a serious health condition that gets worse over time. In this disease, the body’s natural guard against illness (the immune system) damages fatty coverings called myelin sheaths around the axons of cells called neurons in the central nervous system. The disease makes people’s bodies, eyesight, speech, and minds work poorly. People with MS do not normally live as long as healthy people.\n\nIn healthy people, myelin sheaths help neurons work. Electric signals in neurons move quickly through long, narrow axons like electricity in a wire. The myelin is like the insulator around the wire that keeps the signal strong by keeping it from moving out of the wire before the end. A person with MS has myelin that is too thin or completely gone. Without the protective covering, the signals between neurons do not travel well. Because of this, the mind and body cannot work like they normally do.\n\nScientists and doctors do not know for certain the cause of MS, but they think some things put some people at a higher risk for MS:\n\nResearch about the causes of MS is still incomplete. Some scientists think that a relatively unknown pathogen called Chlamydia pneumoniae may cause MS. Also, some viruses can cause myelin damage, there are other viruses that have been shown to make people more likely to get MS. Even though scientists and doctors have theories, no one has found one cause that explains every case of the disease.\n\nQuite a few forms of MS exist, which can create difficulty in deciding how to manage the illness. The disease damages myelin. Sometimes, the body can do limited repairs to myelin. When this happens, symptoms (the problems caused by the disease) go away for a short time. This is called remission. When the body attacks the myelin again, the symptoms return and this is called relapse. The type of MS that has remissions and relapses is called Remitting-Relapsing MS. In less common cases, the body continues attacking myelin and the symptoms get worse rapidly, a form called \"Primary Progressive MS\". Sometimes a combination of the two types of disease can occur simultaneously.\n\nPeople with MS have many problems. Their muscles are usually weak, they may shake uncontrollably, they have trouble moving, and they have trouble balancing. People with MS often feel a great amount of pain and tire easily. Their speech and sight sometimes become very poor. Thinking and solving problems is more difficult for people with MS than for healthy people. \n\nInside the body, MS causes damage that cannot be seen or measured without special medical equipment. The immune system attacks either the fatty parts of the myelin or the protein parts of the myelin. The body may also attack the cells that produce the myelin sheath, called glial cells. When myelin is damaged or missing, large areas of axons affected by the damage are visible as scars or lesions in the central nervous system tissue that build up with repeated repair attempts by the body over time. Lesions appear in different areas of the central nervous system depending on what form of MS a person has.\n\nInflammation is an important part of MS symptoms. Inflammation occurs whenever an injury or illness is detected by the body. It is the first part of an immune system response. In MS patients, inflammation against myelin causes swelling and other harmful effects in the nervous system. Inflammation can happen due to infection by Chlamydia Pneumoniae. \n\nThe people who get MS are usually between 20 and 40 years old, although it can happen to older or, very rarely, younger people too. MS is significantly more common in areas of the world that are far away from the equator. Areas far from the equator get less sunlight than areas near the equator, and the human body requires sunlight to make vitamin D for itself. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused partly by too little vitamin D. People who move from one part of the world to another when they are children are more likely to develop MS than people who do not move long distances until later in life or who never move long distances. This observation supports the idea that MS is caused by infection from Chlamydia Pneumoniae early in life, because people who move from one natural environment to another can get unfamiliar illnesses which their immune systems are unable to fight.\n\nTo diagnose MS, or to tell if a person has it, a doctor will determine what kind of symptoms are present and how often they occur. The most common guidelines used for this are called the McDonald criteria, which define the symptoms of MS and how often they must occur in order to make a diagnosis. A doctor can also order tests to be done by a laboratory, which can determine how active the immune system is in the patient. A special machine called an MRI can photograph the inside of the central nervous system to show if the person has lesions from damaged myelin. Certain types of neurons can be checked to see how responsive they are. Neurons with damaged myelin around their axons will respond more slowly than normal neurons.\n\nOnce a person is diagnosed with MS, a doctor can help ease the symptoms. Scientists have not yet found a way to cure MS, or take it away entirely. The form of MS that comes and goes regularly can be treated more easily than other forms. Some treatments are used only during attacks to make the attacks easier on the patient or to help recovery after the attacks are over. Other treatments are used all the time to help make attacks happen less often. These kinds of treatments are usually injections or infusions directly into veins, but newer treatments can be taken daily by mouth instead. Some people seek other treatments outside of usual medicine, but these have not been shown in scientific studies to be effective.\n\n", "id": "316916", "title": "Multiple sclerosis"}

The first such machines were Jacquard looms controlled by punched cards. Machine tools for cutting metal were built in the 1940s and 1950s. They used punched tape instructions. Soon, the tools were changed, to use computers. Numerical control with computers is known as Computerized numerical control, or CNC.\n\nNowadays, it is possible to make a program that can run on such machine tools, based on a CAD drawing of the piece to be produced.\n\nAttempts to automate machines in the 19th century, for example copying-lathes, used cams. These are basically wheels that change the position of notches to control a machine.

It is part of a world-wide system of mid-ocean ridges. These ridges make up the longest mountain range in the world, all underwater except for short stretches like Iceland. On Iceland, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge reaches the surface.\n\nThe ridge separates oceanic tectonic plates, and moves the plates apart at about 2.5 cm per year.\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Ridge includes a deep rift valley which runs along the middle of the ridge along almost its entire length. At the rift, the boundary between tectonic plates, magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor. New magma emerges onto the ocean floor near the ridge axis. The crystallized magma forms new crust of basalt and gabbro.\n\nThe ridge was discovered during the expedition of HMS \"Challenger\" in 1872. A team of scientists on board discovered a large rise in the middle of the Atlantic. They were planning the future location for a transatlantic telegraph cable. The existence of such a ridge was confirmed by sonar in 1925 \n\nIn the 1950s, mapping of the Earth’s ocean floors showed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to have valleys and ridges. Its central valley is seismologically active and the epicentre of many earthquakes. Ewing and Heezen discovered the ridge to be part of a 40,000-km-long essentially continuous system of mid-ocean ridges on the floors of all the Earth’s oceans. The discovery of this worldwide ridge system led to the theory of seafloor spreading and general acceptance of Wegener's theory of continental drift and expansion as plate tectonics.\n\nThe ridge started forming in at the end of the Triassic period, and was responsible for the separation of the Americas from Africa and Europe with the breakup of Pangaea.\n\nThe ridge sits atop a geologic feature known as the Mid-Atlantic Rise which is a progressive bulge that runs the length of the Atlantic Ocean, with the ridge resting on the highest point of this linear bulge. This bulge is thought to be caused by upward convective forces in the asthenosphere pushing up the oceanic crust and lithosphere.\n", "id": "317110", "title": "Mid-Atlantic Ridge"}

This way of designing buildings came out of the rebuilding of Japan after World War II. Members of the group include: Kiyoshi Awazu, Noboru Kawazoe, Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa, Fumihiko Maki, Masato Otaka, and Kenzō Tange. They wrote a short book in English and Japanese called \"\"The proposals for a New Urbanism\"\" for the World Design Conference in 1960. Many Metabolist projects or designs were very large city plans called \"megastructures\". The members thought of cities as living things that changed over long periods of time.\n\nThese architects were interested in building housing for large numbers of people. They often planned buildings that could be changed. One example is the Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kurokawa (1972). Each apartment was a rectangular block with one round window. These blocks could be added, moved, or removed as needed. It was a \"\"plug-in building\"\". Kurokawa planned for new, better capsules to be added to replace old ones.

Kurokawa planned for new units to be built to replace old ones. As building technology improved, better units could be added. Also, units could be changed as people moved in or out.

Civil uprisings occurred in Bahrain and Syria. Major protests occurred in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco and Sudan. Minor protests occurred in Mauritania, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Western Sahara and Palestine. There were minor protests in countries that are not part of the Arab World, such as Iran and Israel.\n\nThere were border clashes in Israel, and protests in Iranian Khuzestan by the Arab minority occurred in 2011. Weapons and Tuareg fighters returning from the Libyan civil war had encouraged a conflict in Mali which has been described as \"fallout\" from the Arab Spring in North Africa. The sectarian clashes in Lebanon were described as a spillover violence of the Syrian uprising and hence the regional Arab Spring.\n\nThe protests shared some techniques of civil resistance in sustained campaigns involving strikes, demonstrations, marches, and rallies, as well as the effective use of social media to organize, communicate, and raise awareness in the face of state attempts at repression and Internet censorship.\n\nMany Arab Spring demonstrations were met with violent responses from authorities, as well as from pro-government militias and counter-demonstrators. These attacks were answered with violence from protestors in some cases. A major slogan of the demonstrators in the Arab world was \"Ash-sha`b yurid isqat an-nizam\" (\"the people want to bring down the regime\").\n\nSome observers compared the Arab Spring movements to the Revolutions of 1989 that occurred in Eastern Europe or the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states.\n\nThe first specific use of the term \"Arab Spring\" as used to signify these events may have started with the American political journal \"Foreign Policy\". Marc Lynch, referring to his article in \"Foreign Policy\", writes \"Arab Spring—a term I may have unintentionally coined in a January 6, 2011 article\". Joseph Massad on \"Al Jazeera\" said the term was \"part of a US strategy of controlling [the movement's] aims and goals\" and directing it towards American-style liberal democracy. Due to the electoral success of Islamist parties before protests began in many Arab countries, the events have also come to be known as \"Islamist Spring\" or \"Islamist Winter\".\n\nThe series of protests and demonstrations across the Middle East and North Africa has become known as the \"Arab Spring\", and sometimes as the \"Arab Spring and Winter\" even though not all the participants in the protests are Arab. It was sparked by the first protests that occurred in Tunisia on 18 December 2010 following Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in protest of police corruption and ill treatment. The protests also triggered similar unrest outside the region resembling a 'chain effect'.\n\n", "id": "317180", "title": "Arab Spring"}

Historically, it was known to Westerners as Canton, which is a misnomer, or a mistake in naming, since the name is an older English pronunciation for the entire region that the city is in, Guangdong. It is also called the City of Flowers. It is in the south of China and is one of the five biggest cities in China. In mainland China, Guangzhou is regarded as one of the three most popular cities with Beijing and Shanghai, which is called Bei-Shang-Guang for short. It is where the 16th Asian Games were held and it is famous for its food all over the world.\n\nGuangzhou is the core city of South China. It is on the north of Zhu Jiang Delta (Pearl River Delta), where the Dong Jiang River (East River), Xi Jiang River (West River) and Bei Jiang River (North River) join together. On its South is the South China Sea. With its geographical advantages, Guangzhou has been a very important port in South China for hundreds of years. Today, it is the biggest and most important port for air, sea, and trains in China. The area of Guangzhou is about . The north part and middle part of Guangzhou are hills. The west part and south part are plains that have a lot of rivers and streams. Guangzhou is in the subtropics monsoon climate region. It has a lot of sunshine and rain. The average temperature is from 21.4 to 21.9 °C (about 71 °F) and the lowest temperature in winter is about . The rainy season lasts for almost six months and the typhoons in summer also bring lots of rain. The average humidity is about 77 percent.\n\nGuangzhou has Baiyun Airport, which is one of the three most important parts of air transportation in the country. The passenger throughput ranks third in China and 19th in the world. It is also a very important harbor in China, second to Shenzhen in South China and the fourth one in the country. With the Jing-Guang Railway, Jing-Jiu Railway, Guang-Shen Railway and other railways, Guangzhou has become one of the four biggest railway passenger stations in China. A high speed railway has been built here.\n\nGuangzhou has been the city famous for business for hundreds of years. It has been open to the world for nearly 2000 years. After the Reform and Opening Up in 1979, Guangzhou has gained great economic achievement. For example, Guangzhou's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has grown about 14% per year. It ranks as the third economic city in China (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao). In addition, Guangzhou has become a city with a sound industrial foundation and developed tertiary-industry. In September of 1993, Guangzhou was accepted as a member of the World Association of Metropolises.\n\nThe most important elements of Guangzhou’s economy are light manufacturing sector and foreign trade. They are the main reasons for Guangzhou’s economic achievement and its attraction to appeal people from all over the world to begin their own business in this city. Every year, the China Import and Export Commodities Fair (Guangzhou Fair) is held here. It has the biggest conference and exhibition center, Guangzhou International Convention and Exhibition Center, in Asia. After 2000, Guangzhou began to change its industrial structure and increase its investment in the heavy manufacturing sector. Nowadays, the automobile industry, petrochemical industry, and the IT industry have been the three mainstay industries in Guangzhou.\n\nGuangzhou is a typical city for Lingnan Culture. The main characters of Lingnan Culture are open-mindedness, practical spirit and civilian consciousness. People here don’t adhere to traditional rules. They combine culture from different parts in the world with the local culture and are creating new culture to adjust to the modern world. This is very different from the Center Plains Culture in the north part of China. Guangzhou has its own opera, Guangdong Opera, and its own language, Cantonese. In Guangzhou Metro, you can hear the announcement for station not only in Chinese and English, but also in Cantonese. Besides, sotto portico is the typical construction for Lingnan Culture. A flowers market held every Spring Festival is famous around South China.\n\nThe education in Guangzhou began in the Western Han Dynasty. Now, Guangzhou is one of the cities with the most colleges and universities in the South China. It is one of the cities which has the most education resource in the country. The best comprehensive university here is Sun Yat-sen University. It is a university built in memory of Sun Yat-sen, who led the Xinhai Revolution and is regarded as the father of China.\n", "id": "317193", "title": "Guangzhou"}

These lamps produce light by sending electricity through an ionized gas. Most of these lamps use a noble gas, or a combination of noble gases, but they often contain other materials, such as mercury, sodium or metal halides. The gases in these lamps are ionized in operation. This means that there are free electrons. When an electric current is sent through the gas, electrons collide with atoms of the gas and the metals. This will mean that some reach a higher energy state. When they fall back into the lower energy state, they will emit the energy in the form of light. \n\nThe fluorescent lamp is probably the best known gas discharge lamp. Sodium vapor lamps are commonplace as streetlights.\n\nGas-discharge lamps have a long life and a high efficiency, but they are more complicated to manufacture, which makes them more expensive to buy than incandescent lamps. Due to their greater efficiency, gas-discharge lamps replacing incandescent light bulbs for many purposes in the late 20th century. Early in the 21st century, light-emitting diodes improved, with even higher efficiency. They began to replace some gas discharge lamps. \n", "id": "317217", "title": "Gas discharge lamp"}

It is one of her best-known songs because of being performed and recorded by Janis Joplin.\n\nShe was born in Montgomery, Alabama. She got her musical education in a Baptist church, where her father was a minister and her mother a choir singer. At the age of 14 she joined Sammy Green's Georgia-based Hot Harlem Revue and toured the south. She was also a self-taught drummer and harmonica player. She often played each instrument onstage.\n\n1948 she settled in Houston. In 1951 she was signing a recording contract with Peacock Records. For this label she recorded \"Hound Dog\" which became #1 in the Rhythm ´n Blues charts. Then she toured with Junior Parker and Esther Phillips. At the end of the 1950s her career faded.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317385", "text": "Ballistic coefficient\n\nIn ballistics, the ballistic coefficient (BC) of a bullet is a measure of its ability to overcome air resistance in flight. A high BC means the object will slow down less. It will have more of its speed left when it reaches the target. BC depends on mass, diameter, and drag coefficient. Ballistic coefficient has units of lb/in² or kg/m². BCs for bullets are normally stated in lb/in² by their manufacturers without referring to this unit. The values for BC can be as low as 0.12 and as high as 1.00 for commonly used bullets.\n\nA bullet with a high BC will travel farther than one with a low BC since it will keep its speed better, resist the wind better, and “shoot flatter” (see external ballistics).\n\nWhen hunting with a rifle, a higher BC is good for several reasons. A higher BC results in a flatter flight. The effect of mistakes in estimating the distance to the target is smaller for bullet with a higher BC. This is important when attempting an effective hit on a game animal. If the target animal is closer than estimated, then the bullet will hit higher than expected. On the other hand, if the animal is further than estimated the bullet will hit lower than expected. Such a difference in bullet drop can make the difference between a clean kill and a wounded animal.\n\nThis difference in flight path becomes more important at longer distances. Sometimes, the difference in two bullet designs fired from the same rifle can result in a difference between the two of over 30 cm (1 foot) at 500 meters (550 yards). A bullet with a high BC arrives at the target faster and with more energy than one with a low BC.\nSince the higher BC bullet gets to the target faster, it is also less affected by crosswinds.\n\nSporting bullets have BC’s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with high being the most aerodynamic, and low being the least. Very-low-drag bullets with BCs ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on special lathes using mono-metal rods. These special bullets often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.\n\nBullet makers often offer several weights and types for a given size. Heavy-for-caliber pointed (spitzer) bullets with a boat tail design have high BCs. Lighter bullets with square tails and blunt noses have lower BCs. \n\nIn the United States, hunting cartridges such as the .25-06 Remington (a 6.35 mm caliber), the .270 Winchester (a 6.8 mm caliber), and the .284 Winchester (a 7 mm caliber) are used when high BCs are desired.\nIn the larger sizes, the .338 Lapua Magnum and the .50 BMG are popular with very high BC bullets for shooting beyond 1000 meters. They have very high BCs. Other choices in the larger size are the .375 and .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .416 Barrett.\n\nDifferences in BC claims for exactly the same projectiles can be explained by differences in the air density used for these BC statements or differing range-speed measurements on which the stated G1 BC averages are based. The BC changes during a projectile's flight and stated BCs are always averages for certain distances and speeds. Some more explanation about the transient nature of a projectile's G1 BC during flight can be found at the external ballistics article. This article suggests that knowing how a BC was established is almost as important as knowing the stated BC value itself.\n\nTo find the correct BC (osome scientists would call it drag coefficients), Doppler radar-measurements are required. The normal shooting or aerodynamics person, however, does not have this expensive equipment. Weibel 1000e Doppler radars are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defense forces, and a few ammunition manufacturers to get exact real world data on the flight behavior of projectiles of interest.\n\nTest results came from many shots, not just a single shot. Any single bullet can have a very different BC than another. It is important to know the average behavior of a bullet. How different speed regimes affect several rifle bullets made by Lapua can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established BC data.\n\nMost ballistic mathematical models and hence tables or software assume that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not have any differences for wadcutter, flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, very-low-drag, etc. bullet types or shapes.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317402", "text": "Dr. Dre\n\nAndre Romelle Young (born February 18, 1964), known as Dr. Dre is an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur. He has had many records and songs throughout the years and is one of the most famous producers in hip-hop. He has made albums for many rappers through their careers, including \"Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent and Game\". As of 2011, \"Dr. Dre\" is ranked as the third richest rapper by Forbes and is worth two-hundred & fifty million dollars ($250,000,000). Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru and he later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella which made the use of swear words in rap songs in rap to tell about the violence of street life popular. During the 2000s, he produced music for other artists, while sometimes rapping with other artists' on their songs. Dr. Dre signed Eminem to his \"Aftermath\" record label in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2003 helping to make their albums with them. Rolling Stone magazine said Dr. Dre was one of the richest performers in 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre was also in movies such as Set It Off, and the 2001 movies The Wash and Training Day.\n\nBecause he liked Grandmaster Flash, he often went to a club called The Eve After Dark to see a lot of DJs and rappers performing live. He then became a DJ in the club, at first under the name \"Dr. J\", his favourite basketball player. At the club, he met DJ Yella for the first time. Soon afterwards he started using the name \"Dr. Dre\", half his old nickname, and half his first name, also calling himself as the \"Master of Mixology\". He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that was really popular in early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit \"Surgery\" would feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 tapes within Compton. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also did mixes for local radio stations, making the ratings for it's show \"Afternoon Traffic Jam\" go higher. Dr. Dre's earliest songs were released in 1994 on a CD called \"Concrete Roots\". \nHe was a diver in high school, but because he skipped school a lot, he was kicked off the team. After high school, he went to Chester Adult School in Compton because his mother told him to get a job or go back to school. After going to a broadcasting school for a little bit, he moved to his father's house, and then his grandparents house before going back to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.\n\nIn 1986, Dr. Dre met Ice Cube, who with Dr. Dre, made songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper Eazy-E. N.W.A and fellow West Coast rapper Ice-T are normally said to be the creators of gangsta rap. N.W.A favoured themes and explicit lyrics, offering real descriptions of violent, inner-city streets. With the hit \"Fuck tha Police\", the group's first full album Straight Outta Compton became a big hit, despite almost no radio airplay or concerts. The FBI sent Eazy-E a warning letter for the song's content.\n\nAfter Ice Cube left N.W.A in 1989 over money issues, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group's second album Efil4Zaggin (Niggas for life). He also produced tracks for other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including The D.O.C.'s 1989 album \"No One Can Do It Better\". In 1991, at a party in Hollywood, he slapped Dee Barnes of the TV show Pump it Up, feeling upset about a news report she did about the feud between them and Ice Cube. Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years' probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television.\n\nAfter an argument with Eazy-E over money, Dre left the group in 1991 under the advice of a friend, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a known strongman, was able to have Eazy-E release Dre from his contract and, start Death Row Records. In 1992 Dre released his first single with Snoop Dogg; \"Deep Cover\". Dr. Dre's first album was \"The Chronic\". Dre brought a new style of rap, both in terms of style and words.\nThe Chronic became really popular and had lots of big singles. Its sound was really popular with hip hop music for the early 1990s. In 1993, Dr. Dre also won a Grammy Award for \"Let Me Ride\". That year, Billboard magazine Dr. Dre was the eighth best-selling musical artist, \"The Chronic\" was the sixth best-selling album, and \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\" (the first single from the album) as the 11th best-selling single.\nBesides working on his own music, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg's first album Doggystyle. In 1994, Dr. Dre produced some songs on the soundtracks for the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case. He rapped with fellow ex-N.W.A member Ice Cube for the song \"Natural Born Killaz\" in 1995. For the film Friday, Dre recorded \"Keep Their Heads Ringin\"', which reached No.10 in the charts.\nIn 1995, just as Death Row Records signed 2Pac, Young left the label because of a contract dispute and he was worried that Suge Knight wasn't doing things legally. In 1996, he made his own label, Aftermath Entertainment, with Interscope Records. Death Row then suffered poor sales in 1997, after the death of 2Pac.\n\nDr. Dre released Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, released in 1996, with songs by Dr.dre new Aftermath Entertainment rappers. \"Been There, Done That\", was saying that he was bored of gangsta rap. Despite selling a lot of copies of the album, it was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996, Dre rapped \"Been There, Done That\" on popular American TV show, Saturday Night Live. \nDespite the mixed reception to his label's album, Dr. Dre was on two No.1 singles in the charts in 1996, they were \"California Love\" by 2Pac and \"No Diggity\" by Blackstreet. They were Dr. Dre's first No.1 songs since being with N.W.A.\nAftermath gained more popularity in 1998, Dr. Dre signed Eminem, a rapper from Detroit. Dre produced three songs and sung with him on two of them on Eminem's first album The Slim Shady LP. \"My Name Is\", the first single from the album, made Eminem famous. The album sold lots of copies. \n\nDr. Dre's second album, \"2001\", released in 1999, was his return to gangsta rap. It was at first called The Chronic 2000 as a sequel to his first album The Chronic, but was changed to 2001 after Death Row released an unrelated album called \"Chronic 2000: Still Smokin\" in 1999. The album has also been called by fans 'The Chronic 2001' and 'The Chronic 2'. The album featured a lot of guests, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. The album was really good, charting at number two and has since sold millions of copies. The album included popular hit singles \"Still D.R.E.\" and \"Forgot About Dre\", both of which Dr. Dre performed on Saturday Night Live in 1999. Dr. Dre won an award for Producer of the Year, in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube. In 2001, Dr. Dre was sued a few times.\n\nIn 2002, Dr. Dre said he was going to release a new album: Detox. The album has been being made since 2004 and was to be released in 2005. After loads of delays, the album was to be released in 2010. Producers confirmed to be working on the album are DJ Khalil, Nottz, Bernard \"Focus\" Edwards Jr., Hi-Tek, J.R. Rotem, RZA, Jay-Z, Warren G, and Boi-1da. Snoop Dogg said the album was finished in 2008 but it still wasn't released. Detox was then to be released in 2010. At the beginning of 2009, Dre was in the song \"\"Crack a Bottle\"\" by Eminem & 50 Cent. In a Dr Pepper advert in 2009, he played a small clip from Detox. 50 Cent and Eminem said in an interview with BET that Dr. Dre had around 12 songs for Detox. Detox is said to be released sometime in 2012. The first two singles, \"Kush\" and \"I Need a Doctor\", were released in 2010 and 2011. \"Kush\" has become a hit in the America and \"I Need a Doctor\" peaked at Number Four in the charts. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers will honour Dr. Dre with its Founders Award for inspiring other musicians.\nIn 2010, Dr. Dre said that an album of just music called The Planets is in its first stages of production; each song being named after a planet. Later that year, Dr. Dre showed support to long time friend Eminem, and appeared at his and Jay-Z's Tour, performing songs \"Still D.R.E.,\" \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang,\" and \"Crack a Bottle,\" with Eminem & 50 Cent. Wearing an \"R.I.P. Proof\" shirt (proof was a rapper who died, he was also a friend of Dre, Eminem & 50 Cent). The crowd the chanted \"DEEE-TOX,\" to which he replied, \"I'm coming!\" As if to say the album's release is not that long away. Dr. Dre was featured on the cover of a magazine in a 2011 issue. After Detox he will be one of the producers of Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins' album Still Cool. In 2012 Dre was announced to headline at a music festival called the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival taking place the weekends of April 13–15 and April 20–22 which featured a holographic 2Pac.\n\nDr. Dre has also founded the company Beats Electronics, LLC. It primarily makes headphones under the brand \"Beats by Dr. Dre\".\n\n", "id": "317402", "title": "Dr. Dre"}

Fiona was played by Cara Delizia.\n\nIn the series her singer mother homeschools her and they travel around the country by bus. In the series Fi's brother is skeptical of the occult. Their father was obsessed with it but died when Fi was only 3. Later on in the series Fi meets an entity called a will o' the wisp who seems to know her father and gives her information about him. He takes possession of her brother Jack's body in one episode until she expels him by discovering his name and saying it through a computer puzzle based on a hint he gives her. His name is Bricriu. Bricriu in a later episode takes possession of her mother's body and tries to prevent her from meeting a man who knows who killed her father. Bricriu lets slip to her that his allies in the spirit, although not Bricriu himself, murdered her father because of his investigations into their world. He finally meets Fi again in the first episode of season 3 and convinces her to give up interest in the occult in order to protect her family. Fi stopped appearing in the show after that episode. Fi met her father by time traveling to her third year in the episode Fountain. The first two seasons of the show, particularly the second, were dark. In the second season Fi even meets vampires. However, in the third season Disney decided to choose a lighter tone.

Accompanied on the guitar by her father, she danced in waterfront bars in Barcelona. A young person who saw her dance as a girl was the Spanish guitarist Sabicas (Agustín Castellón Campos). He later said \"I saw her dance and it seemed like something supernatural to me... I never saw anyone dance like her. I don’t know how she did it, I just don’t know!\". Sabicas accompanied her for many years. He recorded \"Queen of the Gypsies\" (1959) and \"Flamenco!\" with Amaya.\n\nIn 1929, she made her debut in Paris, to warm acclaims and admiration of her dancing skill. She moved to America in 1936, where she went on to act in several movies that broke box office records, including the \"Romeo and Juliet\" adaptation \"Los Tarantos\", and the short movie \"Danzas Gitanas\" (Gypsy dances). \n\nOne thing was strange about her: she often danced in trousers rather than the layered skirt traditional for female flamenco dancers. One theory is that she did this to give more scope to her footwork, which was exceptional, and rather like a flamenco male dancer. Apparently, in early flamenco, women did not do so much footwork, and male dancers used to fill in the steps while sitting on chairs, unseen in the wings. Her style has been described as repetitive because she always did the same dances: \"Carmen was a fabulous dancer, but limited\" (Antonio Ruiz Soler).\n\nShe was invited by Franklin Roosevelt to dance in the White House in 1944, and also by Harry S. Truman in 1953.\n\nAmaya is buried in the Cementiri del Sud-Oest on Barcelona's Montjuïc.\n\n", "id": "317415", "title": "Carmen Amaya"}

At that time, people did not have good rules to measure distances. They did not know algebra. So, they studied geometry by moving fixed length sticks around on a piece of paper.\n\nThe neusis construction (from Greek νεῦσις from νεύειν \"neuein\" \"incline towards\"; plural: νεύσεις \"neuseis\") fits a line element of given length (\"a\") in between two given lines (\"l\" and \"m\"), in such a way that the line element, or its extension, passes through a given point \"P\". That is, one end of the line element has to lie on \"l\", the other end on \"m\", while the line element is \"inclined\" towards \"P\".\n\nA neusis construction might be performed by means of a 'Neusis Ruler': a marked ruler that is rotatable around the point \"P\" (this may be done by putting a pin into the point \"P\" and then pressing the ruler against the pin). In the figure, one end of the ruler is marked with a yellow eye with crosshairs: this is the origin of the scale division on the ruler. A second marking on the ruler (the blue eye) indicates the distance \"a\" from the origin. The yellow eye is moved along line \"l\", until the blue eye coincides with line \"m\". The position of the line element thus found is shown in the figure as a dark blue bar.\n\nPoint \"P\" is called the pole of the neusis, line \"l\" the directrix, or guiding line, and line \"m\" the catch line. Length \"a\" is called the \"diastema\" (διάστημα; Greek for \"distance\").\n\"Neuseis\" have been important because they sometimes provide a means to solve geometric problems that are not solvable by means of compass and straightedge alone. Examples are the trisection of any angle in three equal parts, or the construction of a regular heptagon. Mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) freely used \"neuseis\". Slowly, the Greeks stopped using it.\n\nT. L. Heath, the historian of mathematics, thought that the Greek mathematician Oenopides (ca. 440 BC) was the first to put compass and straightedge constructions above \"neuseis\". Hippocrates of Chios (ca. 430 BC) may have spread the idea that mathematicians should avoid \"neuseis\" whenever possible. He came from the same island as Oenopides, and who was—as far as we know—the first to write a systematically ordered geometry textbook. One hundred years after him, Euclid also said bad things about \"neuseis\" in his very influential textbook, \"The Elements\".\n\nThe next attack on the neusis came when, from the fourth century BC, Plato's idealism gained ground. Under its influence, a hierarchy of three classes of geometrical constructions was developed. Descending from the \"abstract and noble\" to the \"mechanical and earthly\", the three groups were:\n\nIn the end, the Greek mathematicians thought that using a neusis was acceptable only when the two other, higher groups of constructions did not offer a solution. Neusis became a kind of last resort that was invoked only when all other, more respectable, methods had failed. Using neusis where other construction methods might have been used, was branded by the late Greek mathematician Pappus of Alexandria (ca. 325 AD) as \"a not inconsiderable error\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "317661", "title": "Neusis construction"}

It is usually added to the top a vowel to show how to say it. Acute accents are sometimes added to consonants too. Sometimes, the acute accent changes the sound of the whole word by giving it stress in a sentence. This accent is part of many modern languages that use Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets. The acute accent is one of many similar marks called diacritics.\n\nThe acute accent was first used in Ancient Greece. It told the speaker when to say a syllable with a high pitch. Another early accent mark was the apex. In Latin the apex marked long vowels.\n\nThe acute accent is mainly used to tell readers about the sound of vowels in words. Sometimes it is very important to the meaning because it shows the difference between two similar words. For example, \"resume\" may mean to start again, but \"résumé\" is a summary of someone's work and school experience. Some languages use the accent to show the same changes in sounds, but others use it differently. The acute accent may show:\n\nSome languages use the accent to actually make new letters. Both Faroese and Icelandic add the acute accent to all of their vowels to make new letters. These letters, á, í, ó, ú and ý (plus é in Icelandic) are separate letters with different pronunciations.

Examples in English include: \"attaché\", \"canapé\", \"cliché\", \"communiqué\", \"café\", \"décor\", \"fiancé\", \"passé\", \"toupée\" and \"touché\". However, sometimes writers forget or choose not to use the accent mark.\n\nSome languages such as Arabic, Persian, or Japanese do not use alphabets. Some writers use the acute accent to tell how the words should sound when words from these languages are written in English. This is more common in older books and less common today.\n\nThe ISO-8859-1 and Windows-1252 character encodings included \"á\", \"é\", \"í\", \"ó\", \"ú\", \"ý\". They also had how letters and accents looked when they were written as capital letters. Unicode has many more letters with the acute accent.\n\nTo make an accented letter in a Microsoft Office software (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), users hold the key and press the apostrophe key once. Then, let the key go, and press the letter they want.\n\nOn Apple Macintosh computers, users press \"option-e\" and then the vowel. Vowels can also be capitalised. For example, users make á by pressing \"option-e\" and then 'a'. Pressing \"Option-e\" and then \"Shift-a\" makes Á.\n\nOn Wikipedia, users make these symbols by clicking on a link in a box.

The legend revolves around Banasura, the great Asura king of ancient Tezpur, his beautiful daughter Usha and her friend Chitralekha. The princess saw a handsome prince in her dreams and fell in love with him. Chitralekha, a talented artist, not only painted his portrait from Usha's description but recognised him to be Aniruddha, the grandson of Lord Krishna and ruler of Dwarka. Using her magical powers, Chitralekha spirited Aniruddha away to the princess' boudoir where the two married each other according to Gandharva rites, without the knowledge of the king. When Banasura learnt of the clandestine romance, he imprisoned Aniruddha, which led to the arrival of Lord Krishna to rescue his grandson. A fierce battle followed and the entire city was drenched in human blood, hence the name Sonitpur or Tezpur, i.e. ‘the city of blood’ . \nThe story of eternal love between Usha and Aniruddha finds expression in many stories, novels, dramas, dance-dramas, movies.\n\nSir Edward A. Gait ( 1897) had made reference to the nine line inscription of Harjjar Varma in his ‘’A History of Assam.’’ The inscription is the first recorded history of Assam and dates back to 829 A.D. The inscription was found engraved on a massive\nstone some two kms away from Tezpur town situated near a temple called Rudrapad.\nSalastambha dynasty ruled Kamrupa from seventh to Tenth century A.D. The accurate boundary of their kingdom is debatable. But the erstwhile Darrang was certainly a part of the kingdom. They shifted their capital from Pragjyotishpur to Haruppeswara, or Hatappeswara- the present day Tezpur. The famous King of the dynasty Harjjar Varma, besides other things had excavated a large pond in 70 acres of land, later came to be known as Hajara Pukhuri ( Harjjara Pukhuri ).Pal dynasty ruled Haruppeswara till the 12th century. The most famous ruler of the Pal dynasty was Brahmapal.\nAfter the Pal dynasty’’ the royal dominance of the Koch Kings in the west and the Ahoms in the east started growing. During the 14th and 15th century a large part of the western bank of Brahmaputra from Singri in the west and Sootea in the east was ruled by the Bara-Bhuyans. The great saint poet Sri Sri Shankardeva belonged to Bara-Bhuyan family, who settled at Rowta in Darrang District. The Ahom King Suhungmung alias Dihingia Raja occupied the territories of the Bara-Bhuyans on the north in 1505 A.D.The Koch King Biswa Sinha rose to power in 1515 A.D. King Naranarayana who ascended the thorne in about 1540 A. D. divided his Kingdom into two parts. He had given the eastern part to the son of his brother Chilarai and the western part of the kingdom to his own son Lakshminarayana. But soon after their ascension as kings, fatricidal war broke out and Lakshminarayana sought refuge with the Mughals which eventually led to invasion of Kamrup by the Mughals. Balinarayana, one of the brothers of Pariksitnarayana fled away to Gorgaon to seek the help of the Ahom king Swargadew Pratapsingha. Pratapsingha christened Balinarayana as Dharmanarayana, made him the king of Darrang and declared war against the Mughals (1616-1637 A.D.). The Ahoms defeated the mighty Mughals in the Bharali war and re-occupied Darrang from the Mughals. King Dharmanarayana made supreme sacrifice in Singari war in 1638. His son Sundarnarayana ascended the throne and became the king of Darrang.(excluding Tezpur). On the other hand, the Ahoms ruled the eastern part of Darrang ( present Sonitpur) through Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, stationed at Kaliabor. The Ahom Kings resettled many people in the southern part of Brahmaputra.\n\nThe British annexed the then Assam into the Indian British Empire in 1826. After1826 the Lower Assam and the Central Assam (Darrang, Nagaon and Raha) were made one division which extended up to Biswanath. The division was placed under one Administrative Officer designated as the Principal Assistant to the Commissioner. The Upper Assam portion was left to the native rulers with supervisory control under a British political agent with political headquarters at Biswanath. Captain Neufville was the political agent for Upper Assam. Darrang Division was administered till 1833 from Guwahati.\nDarrang was converted into a district and Mangaldai was made the district Headquarter in 1833. But due to various reasons the British shifted the head quarter to Tezpur in 1835. The district comprised of two sub-divisions, Tezpur sadar sub-division and Mangaldoi sub-division with head quarter at Mangaldoi. The District of Darrang was divided in to six Revenue Circles under one Sub-Deputy Collector in each Circle. There was one Transferred area in the district at Charduar. An Asst. Political Officer was posted at Charduar under the Deputy Commissioner who acted as Political Officer.\nTezpur was a small township then. The British developed Tezpur as a small garrison township. Later, tea gardens were set-up throughout the district. The old steamarghat at Jahajghat, the Dak-Bungalow, the then Chummery compound at present Don-Bosco School campus, the Planters Club of Tezpur (Stations Club), the Jahajghat Railway Station, the Church of Ephiphany etc. and many tea gardens are some of the examples of the contributions of the British.\n\nThere is no specific information about the alignment of the people of the district in the earlier struggle for liberation waged by the princely and upper class people in Upper Assam from 1828 to 1857. But, with the spread of western education during the last part of the 19th century a new awakening surcharged the patriots of the land.\nFew years before the birth of the Indian National Congress in Bombay in 1885, the Tezpur Ryot Sabha was formed by a group of enlightened people primarily to protest against the enhancement of land revenue and to ventilate other public grievances .\nThe Tezpur Ryot Sabha sent Kali Krishna Barkakoti to as its delegate to the National Congress in 1885. It had played an active role in early period of the freedom struggle.\nThe All Assam Student Association formed in 1916 worked in the district under the leadership of Chandra Nath Sarma.\nIn June, 1921, the Tezpur District Congress Committee was formed under the presidency of Chandra Nath Sarma.\nIn August 1921, Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur and recorded his impression of the visit in Young India in the article \"From the Bank of Brahmaputra\".\nIn 1934 Mahatma Gandhi visited Tezpur again during the course of Civil Disobedience Movement.\nIn the final phase of British Period the Quit India Movement gained momentum with the slogan \"Do or Die\" in places like Tezpur, Sootea, Gohpur, Dhekiajuli and Jamuguri.\n\nOn 10th September 1942, at Gohpur a young girl led a procession of unarmed villagers under Congress flag. She was Kanaklata Barua – a girl from Barangabari village. As soon as Kanaklata unfurled the flag she and her companion Mukunda Kakati were gunned down by the armed Police. The saga of her heroic sacrifice is still remembered with pride.\nOn the same day at Dhekiajuli Police Station eleven unarmed villagers were gunned down by the armed Police while trying to hoist the tri-color at the Police Station - three of them were teen-aged girls- Tileswari, Numali and Khahuli .\nFinally, the British era had come to an end on 15th August \"1947\" when India gained her Independence in the midnight of 14th August.\n\nThe administration set up by the British continued even after Independence. Darrang district with head quarter at Tezpur continued as an important district of Assam. \nTowards 1961, Tezpur started to become a center of Trade and Commerce. A year later, in 1962, war broke out with China. The Chinese Army advanced up-to Sessa near Bhalukpung. People started fleeing from their homes. The war had left a bitter experience in the minds of the people of the district.\nIn 1983, Darrang district was bifurcated. Tezpur sadar sub-division was named as Sonitpur district with an outlying Sub-Division at Biswanath Chariali. Mangaldoi sub-division was named as Darrang district.\nOn 15th August, 2000, another Sub-Division namely Gohpur Sub-Division was carved out from the erstwhile Biswanath Sub-Division.\nTwo major events in the field of communication and education can be cited as landmarks in post-independence history of the district. The first one being the construction of Kalia Bhomora Bridge and its inauguration on 14th April,1987, by Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. The second one is the establishment of a Central University at Napaam named as Tezpur University.\nIn the cultural front one can very well name the trio of Assamese culture who were born in the district. The post independence era had seen their talents flourishing which had not only enriched the cultural horizon of the district but has also contributed to formation of a composite Assamese culture.\n", "id": "317675", "title": "Sonitpur"}

They are right next to one another in the civil parish of Sutton Courtenay, next to the town of Didcot in Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire), in the UK. The combined power stations feature a chimney which is one of the taller structures in the United Kingdom, and six hyperbolic cooling towers, which can be seen from much of the surrounding area.\n\nThis was the first power station here. It is the biggest one with the big cooling towers (that make the cooling water cooler and make lots of steam) that are in two groups. One group is northwest, the other group is southeast. The power station can make up to 2000 megawatts (2000 million watts - an 'average' lightbulb uses only 50 or 60 watts) at any one time. Didcot 'A' mainly burns coal, but can also burn oil, or in some cases gas. This power station can use some biomass such as wood. The fuel (coal, oil and so on) is first ground up in big mills if it is solid (similar to old flour windmills, but powered by electric motors) to give it a large surface area, and is then blown into a large boiler with lots of air. Here it is burnt to make very high pressure steam, which is used to turn a large steam turbine. This turbine is connected to a generator, which makes the electricity that is then sent out on the National Grid.\n\nThis is the second power station in Didcot and is run only on gas. It can put out almost 1500 megawatts and uses gas turbines (like in an airplane) and steam turbines (like in the old power station) together to be more efficient. This is called combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). It has smaller cooling towers that can't be seen as easily, but that make a more obvious cloud that appears to come from the ground.\n", "id": "317706", "title": "Didcot power station"}

It is used a lot in Asian cooking.\n\nThe English term sesame traces back to the Arabic \"simsim\", Coptic \"semsem\", and early Egyptian \"semsent\". \"Semsent\" was listed in the Ebers Papyrus, a 65-feet-long scroll listing ancient herbs and spices discovered by the famous German Egyptologist, Ebers. The earliest recorded use of a spice - sesame seed - comes from an Assyrian myth which claims that the gods drank sesame wine the night before they created the earth. Sesamum indicum, (indicum meaning \"from India\") is native to the East Indies. Usage dates back to 3000 B.C. Over 5,000 years ago, the Chinese burned sesame oil not only as a light source but also to make soot for their ink-blocks. African slaves brought sesame seeds, which they called benné seeds, to America, where they became a popular ingredient in southern dishes. Through the ages, the seeds have been a source of food and oil. Sesame seed oil is still the main source of fat used in cooking in the Near East and Far East.\n\nGood sesame oil has a strong smell when it is opened. The color should be bright brown or gold. It should be kept at . If it is too cold, the oil would be solid and lose its smell. Sesame oil can go bad if it is exposed to air and sunlight. Therefore it is better kept on a shelf or a sideboard. A dark brown bottle is better than a plain one, because the brown one can protect the oil from the sunlight better. The bottle should be closed tightly to keep air out.\n\nMany things affect the price. Oil content is the most important. Usually a bottle of sesame oil has 40~55%. The more oil content it has, the higher price it has. Another element is country of origin. Also if you buy it made from a factory it would cost less than oil made in a country house by a farmer.\n\n", "id": "317723", "title": "Sesame oil"}

The man is kissing the woman, who has green hair. Klimt has said he had obsession for the woman with redheads, and it was reflected in the woman in his painting.\n\nThe man and woman are on a flowery grassland. According to the psychoanalytical and biological distinction, Klimt expressed them in different ways. The man wearing a robe with black, white and gray rectangles is described in a rough way, while the woman is expressed with the smooth figures such as a circle, a curve, and flowery patterns. Her hair is also combined with flowers; it looks like she is surrounded with flowers.

In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. He got the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for combining quantum field theory and the statistical theory of critical phenomena of second-order phase transitions. In other words the prize was for his constructive theory of the renormalization group. In this theory he gave not only important, and even numerical, insights to the field of critical statics and dynamics in statistical physics, but indirectly also basic answers to the question: \"What is quantum field theory?\" and \"What does renormalization mean?\". He also gave a constructive answer to another important \"renormalization\" problem from solid-state physics, the Kondo effect.\n\nHe advocated that the federal government should buy supercomputers for science research. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (known now as the Cornell Theory Center, one of five national supercomputer center created by the National Science Foundation.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317823", "text": "Apex (diacritic)\n\nIn written Latin, the apex (plural: \"apices\") is a diacritic. It is close to the shape of an acute accent ( ´ ). The apex is used to show that a vowel is long and not short. That means that the vowel is pronounced for longer.\n\nThe shape and length of the apex can be different. It can even sometimes be different within the same writing. While pretty much all apices are made up of a line sloping up to the right, the line can be more or less curved, and is different in length from less than half the height of a letter to more than the height of a letter. Sometimes, it is put at the top with a hook, pointing out to the left. Rather than being centered over the vowel it changes, the apex is often drawn to the right.\n\nLater, it developed into the acute accent, which is still used in some languages to mark vowel length. In particular, Czech and Slovak, Hungarian, Irish, and (a long time ago) Icelandic.\n\nAlthough not really known by some modern Latinists, the sign was actually used a lot during classical and postclassical times. The reason why it is not usually noticed is probably because of its smallish size and the fact that it is usually quite thin. People who look carefully will soon start to notice apices in the exhibits of any museum, not only in many of the more formal epigraphic writings, but also in handwritten palaeographic things.\n\nForgetting the apex, modern Latin spelling has recently started marking long vowels by using the macron. The macron is a sign that had always been used, and still is, to mark metrically long \"syllables\" (more recently called \"heavy\" syllables). This has caused confusion between syllable and vowel length in Latin, and most western dictionaries still cannot describe the nature of Latin vowels properly because of this. To make even more confusion, the acute accent is sometimes used in Latin to mark stressed syllables, just like in Spanish, when the macron is not used.\n\nThe apex is often thought to be the opposite of another ancient Latin diacritic, the sicilicus, which is said to have been used above \"consonants\" to show that they should be pronounced as doubles. However, in his article \"Apex and Sicilicus\", Revilo P. Oliver says that they are the same sign, a \"geminationis nota\". This was used over any letter to show that the letter should be read twice. \n\nIf Revilo P. Oliver is right, the apex as a sign showing vowel length would have been made in the time when long vowels were written double. Then, when long vowels were not regularly written twice. \n\nHowever, Oliver's view that the two marks were the same has recently been challenged.\n\n", "id": "317823", "title": "Apex (diacritic)"}

A cappella can also have those 5 parts. A difference is with percussion. With musical instruments, percussion is done with musical instruments that you hit, such as drums. In an a cappella performance, a person makes the percussion sound. For a beatbox performance, performers make sounds like electric drums, synthesizer and electric guitar. Another part of percussion in a cappella performance is making classical drum sounds for tapping the beat.\n\nThe word a cappella is Italian for \"in the manner of the church\" or \"in the manner of the chapel\". It was first used in religious music. Gregorian chant is an example of a cappella singing.\n\nFor the first 1000 years of Christianity, all hymns in the church were sung without instrumental accompaniment. This style of singing came to be known as a cappella, meaning \"of the church\" or \"in the style of the church\".\n\nThere are several kinds of music in a cappella, such as barbershop, classical, contemporary, gospel, doo-wop, jazz, and world.\n\nA barbershop group has 4 people. The name of this genre came from the tradition that when many men gathered in a barbershop they would sing with no musical instruments. A barbershop quartet has four male voices or four female voices. Mixed barbershop quartets are also possible, usually with two male and two female voices. The voices parts are called bass, baritone, lead, and tenor. In music in the barbershop style, the melody (the \"tune\") is sung by the lead part.\n\nIn classical a cappella, people perform classical music such as 'a Turkish march', 'Overture William Tell', madrigal, etc.\n\nContemporary is the most popular kind of a cappella these days. For this kind, the \"bass\" line should be stronger, and the \"chorus\" (all the singers except for bass, percussion, and solo) should have variety. The percussion should make their sound more like drums. This genre is similar to 'doo-wop' but the \"chorus\" part is more complex and has a variety of sound effects.\n\nDoo-wop is also getting more popular because of its simple style.

Spanking normally means hitting the buttocks of another person with an open hand. Parents in some countries spank children and teenagers to punish them. In some other countries this is no longer allowed. Parents often hope that spanking will make the children obey them. From the past up to the present day, adults have spanked boys more than they have spanked girls.\n\nWhen a parent spanks their child, they usually strike the child's buttocks with their open hand. Sometimes they use other objects such as a belt or a wooden spoon. At times the child's buttocks may be clothed. At other times they may be bare. Often the parent makes the child lie across their lap. At other times, a parent might tell a child or teenager to bend over or lie face down across a bed.\n\nWhen children are asked how they feel when their parents spank them, many say that it makes them feel sad, angry, and afraid. Some young children in the United Kingdom whose parents spanked them said things like, \"“it feels like someone banged you with a hammer”\" and \"“it hurts and it’s painful inside – it’s like breaking your bones”\". \n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics is a group of medical doctors who work with children. They say that spanking is not a good way to help children learn how to behave.  They say that it can easily injure a small child. They say that spanking can lead to child abuse. They say that parents should never spank a child with an object.\n\nSome groups of people have said that spanking is violent and goes against human rights. They are people like lawyers, social workers, and politicians. Spanking a person under the age of 18 is now against the law in more than 40 countries. Some of those countries are Brazil, Germany, Israel, Argentina, Sweden, Netherlands, Spain, Poland, New Zealand, Kenya, and Costa Rica.\n\nDr. Elizabeth T. Gershoff is a scientist who studies spanking. She says that research done over many years shows that spanking does not work. She says that spanking does not teach children good behavior or to obey their parents. She says that children who are spanked obey their parents less as time goes on. Dr. Gershoff said that spanking is \"violent\" and should be stopped. In 2012, a group of Canadian scientists also looked at many years of research and found that spanking does not work. They said that over time, spanked children become more aggressive. Murray Straus is another scientist studying spanking of children. He has said that there is new research showing that spanked children commit more crimes when they grow up. He said that this was so even if their parents were \"loving\" to them.\n\nA small number of scientists have claimed that ordinary spanking does no harm. Other scientists say that \"over 100\" studies have shown that spanking can harm children. They say that spanking harms children's mental growth. They also say that children who are spanked grow up to have more mental illnesses. They say that no study has shown any good to come from spanking. Scientists at the University of Manitoba in Canada found that children who were hit even \"sometimes\" suffered more mental illnesses when they grew up. They could have different kinds of mental illnesses: long-lasting sad or discouraged feelings and a loss of pleasure and interest in life (depression), a lot of fear and worry (anxiety), racing thoughts that are hard to control and acting without thinking (mania), or a need to take drugs or alcohol to feel well (drug and alcohol abuse). Other scientists have discovered that spanking children often can make their brains grow less than they should. These children end up less able to think clearly.

This element can change its resistivity according to the voltage, but even after disconnection it remembers resistivity for unlimited time. It can work like analog memory or a resistive switch, which can have an infinite number of states.\n\nProfessor Leon Chua mathematically described this element in 1971.\nIn 2008 scientists from HP labs described a material that appeared to be a good candidate to construct the hypothetical memristor.\n\nThe fourth element can change its conductivity by the voltage, and after power interruption the amount of the resistivity stays the same. No combination of the other three circuit elements can replace a memristor. Only the memristor allows reconfiguring properties so it allows changing a whole electronic circuit. Analogy behaviour is similar to synapses in the brain.\n\nMemristors have great potential for use in computers. For example, computers today have to boot from hard drives because the data is erased from operating memory immediately after shutting down the computer. The process of booting takes much time and energy. Memristors could be used for loading data quicker because it remembers data even after power interruption.

Like all geosynchronous orbits, it has a period (time for one orbit) that is 24 hours. This means it goes around the Earth as fast as the Earth spins, and so it appears to stay above the same spot all the time. A person watching from Earth sees a satellite in a geostationary orbit as not moving, at a steady place in the sky. \n\nCommunications satellites and weather satellites often use these orbits, so that the satellite antennas that communicate with them do not have to move to track them. The ground atennas can be pointed permanently at a fixed position in the sky. This is cheaper and easier than having a satellite dish that is always moving to track a satellite. Each one stays above the equator at a set longitude (distance east or west).\n\nThe idea of a geosynchronous satellite for communication was first published in 1928 (but not widely so) by Herman Potočnik. The idea of a geostationary orbit became well known first in a 1945 paper called \"Extra-Terrestrial Relays — Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?\" by the British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, published in \"Wireless World\" magazine. The orbit, which Clarke first described as good for broadcast and relay communications satellites, is sometimes called the Clarke Orbit. Named after the author, the Clarke Belt is this part of space above the Earth - about above sea level, over the equator, where near-geostationary orbits may be implemented. The Clarke Orbit (another name for a geostationary orbit) is about around.\n\nThe satellite orbits in the direction of the Earth's rotation, producing an orbital period equal to the Earth's period of rotation, known as the sidereal day (very nearly 24 hours).\n\nThe orbit needs to be above the equator. Since all orbits are around the center of the Earth, if it was tipped above the equator (so that the satellite was straight above New York City, for example) it would need to swing an equal distance to the south pole on each orbit. It needs to spend an equal amount of time on each side of the equator. So if it is directly above the equator, it doesn't move north or south at all. (Geosynchronous orbits are like geostationary orbits, but also include those that go above and below the equator).\n\nThe height of the orbit is an exact distance, because the speed of the orbit depends on how far it is from the center of the Earth. An orbit is a balance between centripetal force against the Earth's gravity. Objects closer to Earth feel more gravity. So objects in low orbit (like the International Space Station or GPS satellites) go faster, and orbit the Earth very quickly, about 90 minutes or so for each orbit. Objects farther away take longer for each orbit. The moon for instance, takes about 29 days for each orbit.\n\nBecause this orbit is so high, it takes radio (and light) waves about 1/4 second to go up to the satellite and back to Earth. This means that a TV interview taking place between the office in one place, and reporter in a different country can have a gap of a half second (1/4 second to go from the office to the reporter, and a 1/4 second back to the office, where the signal is then sent to viewer). This half second delay can be noticed in many news broadcasts.\n\nAlso, when satellites reach the end of their life, it would be too expensive to bring them all the way back down to Earth to burn up in the atmosphere. It is much cheaper to put them a little higher (300 km) in a 'graveyard' orbit, where they will stay essentially forever. \n\n", "id": "317889", "title": "Geostationary orbit"}

Weevils are a family, the Curculionidae, which may be the largest beetle family, with about 45,000+ named living species. That makes it the largest family in the animal kingdom. In addition, the superfamily Curculionoidea has ten more families of closely related weevil-type beetles.\n\nThe family has some pests which damage plants of interest to humans. The most famous weevil is the boll weevil, which ruins cotton crops.\n\nThe \"Ips\" genus, feeding on Ponderosa pine, introduces a fungus to the tree. The fungus blocks resin canals, which leaves the weevil free to eat. Resin would normally wash the insects out; it is a defence mechanism. The fungus often kills the tree, and groups of dead trees are a focus for forest fires. In this way the insect is indirectly responsible for serious fires.\n\nThe maize weevil, \"Sitophilus zeamais\", is a major pest.

The traders involved travel by canoe over hundreds of miles to exchange their Kula valuables. These valuables can be in the form of red shells that are traded to the North of the Islands, or in the form of white-shell armbands, which travel to the South of the Islands. Therefore creating a ‘ring’ of moving valuables throughout the islands. The terms of trade change in different regions. For example, some traders have to exchange a white armband for a necklace or must trade a red shell for a white shell armband. There are also differences on who can take part in the trading process such as in the Trobriand Islands their chiefs mainly take part in the exchange process, whereas in Dobu, anyone can take part. \n\nThe Kula valuables are mainly traded for social status and recognition in the Island region. The people that an individual trades with become trusted trade partners, creating a strong, potentially life-long relationship between the exchange parties. These relationships need trust to be provided on both sides of the trade and also a mutual agreement of safety and support for each other. \n\nKula valuables are usually passed on to their trade partners after a certain amount of time, therefore the valuables are always moving around the Kula Ring. The person who originally owned the valuable has full ownership and rights over the item, so he can keep it, sell it or even break it. Every person who therefore receives the item, does not fully own it, as there is always a true owner. This creates a sense of responsibility over how the object is handled by other traders toward the original owner. However, the original owner is sometimes unknown, lost in the Kula Ring.\n\nThe ability to take part in the Kula Exchange is not immediately given to just anyone. An individual must “buy” into the system by getting involved in lower trade circles than the Kula. \n\nThe Kula valuables are rated by value and age and so are the relationships created through their exchange. Traders will often try to collect valuable and notorious Kula objects that will boost the status of the trader’s name in the Kula Ring. Kula Exchange is based on trust, strong social obligations and the cultural value system. Those who hold on too long to their Kula valuables gain a bad reputation in the system.\n\nThe Kula Exchange system determines many social hierarchies and authoritative positions among the trade islands. For example the chiefs living on the Trobriand Islands in the 1970s owned the most shells and also the most valuable shells. Therefore they were responsible for most of the organization and direction of the trade systems in their region. (The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea (1988) by Annette B. Weiner) Also, the ten most influential men among all the islands control about 90 per cent of the Kula items. With this amount of control and competition, relationships between traders become fragile and ruined by manipulation and deceit. (Malinowski, B. (1920). \"Kula; the Circulating Exchange of Valuables in the Archipelagoes of Eastern New Guinea\". Man (Man, Vol. 20) 20: 97–105).\n\n", "id": "317905", "title": "Kula"}

It originated from pagan times before Russia was converted to Christianity. At first, this holiday was a symbol of the spring solstice but nowadays it is considered a Christian holiday which goes right before the Great Lent. During Maslenitsa people enjoy almost any food, except meat. Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes. This doll is called “Maslenitsa” and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter. By burning “Maslenitsa” people say goodbye to winter and greet a warm spring.\n\nEvery day of Maslenitsa plays a great role. On Monday people greet the holiday with games such as sledding, snowballs, riding on swings and so on. Russian people believe that happiness and joy which they feel during this day will accompany them throughout a year. On Tuesday people play games and bake pancakes which are called \"blini\". Blini are the most popular food which is made during this holiday. These pancakes have a round form and symbolize the Sun and warmth. On Wednesday people usually visit their friends and relatives and treat each other with blini. On Thursday by tradition people try to drive away winter by riding on horses around the village or around the places they live. Friday is usually called “Mothers’-in-law evenings” because sons-in-law come to visit their mothers-in-law. On merry Saturday everyone goes to visit their relatives. All people drink and eat as much as they want and play different games. Sunday is the last day of the holiday. It is also called the \"Sunday of forgiveness\" because on this day everyone asks forgiveness from relatives and friends for offences and mistakes committed against them. The most appropriate answer is “God will forgive”. After that people usually sing songs, dance and at the end of the day they burn the doll.\n\nMaslenitsa is also considered as a family holiday because spring is a symbol of new life. People who marry during this time are considered as very strong and happy couples who will give a birth to many children. During Maslenitsa some people even “punish” those who did not marry yet by throwing them into snow.\n", "id": "317909", "title": "Maslenitsa"}

It is the subject-matter of toxicology.\n\nA central idea in toxicology is that almost everything is toxic when taken to excess. Effects are dose-dependent: even water can lead to 'water intoxication' when taken in too much. For even a very toxic substance such as elapid snake venom there is a dose below which there is no toxic effect. \n\nToxicity is species-specific. A dose which is toxic to one animal may not be toxic to another.\n\nAcute toxicity describes the bad effects of a substance that come either from a single exposure, or from many exposures in a short amount of time (usually less than 24 hours). To be known as \"acute\" toxicity, the bad effects should happen within 14 days of the substance thouching something.\n\nAcute toxicity is different from chronic toxicity. Chronic toxicity talks about the bad health effects from many exposures, often at lower levels, to a substance over a longer amount of time (months or years).\n\nIt is widely thought to be wrong to use humans as tests for acute (or chronic) toxicity research. However, some information can be picked up from investigating cases when humans accidentally make contact with the substance (e.g., factory accidents).

Later she remembers what he said and goes to learn pronunciation with a desire to be an upper class woman. \n\nHiggins decides to do an experiment with her. He deceives all the people at a party. It was making them believe that she is a duchess. After this success, Higgins suggests two options for Eliza. One is marrying based on her beauty. The other is running a flower shop with money from Colonel Pickering who is a rich man. Eliza refuses to do both of them and she leaves his home. Higgins and Colonel Pickering look for Eliza as soon as they know that she left. They find her in Mrs. Higgins’ house but Eliza refuses to go back. She says she would marry Freddy.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw is famous for giving audiences a twist by not doing what they expect. In comedy, people expect someone in a bad situation to be in a better one at the end. They expect a poor person to marry a rich man. They expect a villain to be punished. In \"Pygmalion\", the flower girl in the bad situation gets better in the end. This girl selling flowers on the street rises to the upper class. It was through changing her language.\n\nHowever, contrary to the audience's expectation, romance between flower girl and Professor Higgins doesn’t happen. She doesn’t marry a rich man. Also, George Bernard Shaw reflected his beliefs to reform the society in this play. \n\nIn the 20th century, there were many poor people on the street. Especially little girls worked all day for a tiny amount of money. The author had much interest in poor people and women’s freedom. And he believed speech was one of the things that separated rich and poor people. That is the starting point of \"Pygmalion\". He used the change of language as a means to rise to the upper class.\n\nIn mythology, Pygmalion was a sculptor who did not like women. He could not find a woman to love. And he decided to make a statue, Galatea. In the play, Pygmalion is compared to Professor Higgins. And Galatea is compared to Eliza. Pygmalion made Galatea to be his ideal woman. And Professor Higgins changed Eliza into a perfect upper class woman. He taught her everything from how to talk to how to behave in front of people. This process of making Eliza an upper class woman is criticized as playing with a live doll, as though she didn’t have her own soul. Higgins treats her as an object.\n\nAlso, the common expectation of audiences that women’s fate is determined by men is criticized. It is because of Eliza’s reaction after the success of pretending to be a duchess. She thought the two options suggested by Higgins would be selling herself. \n\nWhen she was selling flowers, at least she didn’t have to sell herself. She doesn’t want to rely on a rich man, but decides to marry a poor man, Freddy. She says she can make something of him.

As a result, the individual has two or more genetically different cell lines derived from a single zygote. \n\nMosaicism may result from:\n\nThe phenomenon was discovered by Curt Stern. In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination, normal in meiosis, can also take place in mitosis. When it does, it results in somatic (body) mosaics. These are organisms which contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissue.\n\nA genetic chimera is an organism composed of two or more sets of genetically distinct cells. Dispermic chimeras happen when two fertilized eggs fuse together. Mosaics are a different kind of chimerism: they originate from a single fertilized egg.\n\nThis is easiest to see with eye colours. When eye colours vary between the two eyes, or within one or both eyes, the condition is called \"heterochromia iridis\" (= 'different coloured iris'). It can have many different causes, both genetic and accidental. For example, David Bowie had the appearance of different eye colours due to an injury that caused one pupil to be permanently dilated.\n\nOn this page, only genetic mosaicism is discussed.\n\nThe most common cause of mosaicism in mammalian females is X-inactivation. Females have two X chromosomes (and males have only one). The two X chromosomes in a female are rarely identical. They have the same genes, but at some loci (positions) they may have different alleles (versions of the same gene).\n\nIn the early embryo, each cell independently and randomly inactivates one copy of the X chromosome. This inactivation lasts the lifetime of the cell, and all the descendants of the cell inactivate that same chromosome. \n\nThis phenomenon shows in the colouration of calico cats and tortoiseshell cats. These females are heterozygous for the X-linked colour genes: the genes for their coat colours are carried on the X chromosome. X-inactivation causes groups of cells to carry either one or the other X-chromosome in an active state.\n\nX-inactivation is reversed in the female germline, so that all egg cells contain an active X chromosome.\n\n\"Mosaicism\" refers to differences in the genotype of various cell populations in the same individual, but X-inactivation is an epigenetic change, a switching off of genes on one chromosome. It is \"not\" a change in the genotype. Descendent cells of the embryo carry the same X-inactivation as the original cells. This may give rise to mild symptoms in female 'carriers' of X-linked genetic disorders.\n\n", "id": "318047", "title": "Mosaic (genetics)"}

It is also the only Australian mammal restricted to an alpine habitat. Its prehensile tail, at ~14 cm, is longer than its 11 cm head and body length. Its diet consists of insects, fleshy fruits, nuts, nectar and seeds. \n\nThe mountain pygmy possum was first described as a Pleistocene fossil by Robert Broom in 1896. It was thought to be extinct until 1966, when a living specimen was discovered in a ski-hut on Mount Hotham.\n\nThree geographically isolated populations are known to exist. These populations have been shown to be genetically distinct. For most of the year, males and females live apart from each other.

This process operates at a pressure of 30–60 atm and a temperature of 150–200 °C. It gives a selectivity greater than 99%. It was developed 1960 by German chemists working at BASF. Chemists at Monsanto introduced a new catalyst system in 1966. Today, chemists make acetic acid by the Cativa process, a similar iridium-based process developed by BP Chemicals Ltd which is more economical and environmentally friendly. So, the Monsanto process is not used very much in industry.\n\nThe process has several steps, which repeat to remake the catalyst:\nThe catalytically active species is the anion cis-[Rh(CO)I] (1). The catalytic cycle has been shown to involve six steps, two of which do not involve rhodium: conversion of methanol to methyl iodide and the hydrolysis of the acetyl iodide to acetic acid. (These steps are in the middle of the above diagram.) The first organometallic step is the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to \"cis\"-[Rh(CO)I] to form the hexacoordinate species [(CH)Rh(CO)I] (2). This anion rapidly transforms, by the migration of a methyl group to the carbonyl ligand, affording the pentacoordinate acetyl complex [(CHCO)Rh(CO)I] (3). This five-coordinate complex then reacts with carbon monoxide to form the six coordinate dicarbonyl complex. (4) This decomposes by reductive elimination to form acetyl iodide (CHCOI) and regenerate the active form of the catalyst. Acetyl iodide is then hydrolyzed to acetic acid.\n\nThe reaction mechanism is first-order with respect to methyl iodide and the catalyst (1). Hence the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle has been proposed to be the oxidative addition of methyl iodide to the catalyst (1). Chemist think that this occurs with the rhodium center making a nucleophilic attack on the carbon of methyl iodide.\n\nThe Monsanto process for making acetic acid inspired chemists to invent a way to make Acetic anhydride. It is produced by carbonylation of methyl acetate.\n\nIn this process lithium iodide converts methyl acetate to lithium acetate and methyl iodide, which in turn affords through carbonylation acetyl iodide. Acetyl iodide reacts with acetate salts or acetic acid to give the product. Rhodium iodides and lithium salts are employed as catalysts. Because acetic anhydride is not stable in water, the conversion is conducted under water-free (anhydrous) conditions in contrast to the Monsanto acetic acid synthesis.\n\n", "id": "318070", "title": "Monsanto process"}

The type of group is not always the same; it could be based on a religion, a class or a social group. Often group endogamy is enforced by arranged marriages, this is a system based on benefits for the group rather than marriage for love.\n\nBy marrying a person with the same group characteristics, it means that the partners will have similar views or beliefs about something. Many people marry endogamously for reasons of compatibility, which can be due to choice. But there are also other reasons when there is less choice involved or there is disapproval if it is not followed.\n\nBy doing this it keeps the numbers of a group to a minimum and thus creates stronger group bonds. For example, when moving to another country, a Sikh family may actively look for other Sikh families to mix with in order to facilitate Sikh marriages. By merging, they create a stronger bond between their own communities and can be a way to deal with being a minority.\n\nIf a group has been marrying endogamously for a long period of time the gene pool may be smaller and there is a greater chance of genetic disease. For example, within the Jewish community Tay-Sachs disease is a common genetic disease.\n\n\n", "id": "318122", "title": "Endogamy"}

In other words, creating an alliance with another group.\n\nClaude Levi-Strauss, an anthropologist, argued that when two families are connected by the marriage of two people it creates more relationships for trading other things such as food.

Such an eruption releases ash and sulfur dioxide in huge quantities. They form aerosols of sulfuric acid. When they reach the stratosphere more sunlight is reflected, and some is absorbed by the stratosphere. These reactions heat up the stratosphere, but lead to a drop in the temperature on the ground. \n\nThe Siberian Traps, Emeishan Traps, and Deccan Traps are huge flood basalt provinces caused by volcanism. They are the cause, or part of the cause, of several mass extinctions, especially the Permian–Triassic extinction event. \n\nNuclear winter is a theory of similar effects which might be caused by a large-scale nuclear war.\n\nThe effects of recent volcanic eruptions on winters are modest in scale but historically their effects have been significant.\nMost recently, the 1991 explosion of Mount Pinatubo, a stratovolcano in the Philippines, cooled global temperatures for about 2–3 years.\n\nIn 1883, the explosion of Krakatoa (Krakatau) created volcanic winter-like conditions. The next four years after the explosion were unusually cold, and the winter of 1887 to 1888 included powerful blizzards. Record snowfalls were recorded worldwide.\n\nThe 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, a stratovolcano in Indonesia, occasioned mid-summer frosts in New York State and June snowfalls in New England and Newfoundland and Labrador in what came to be known as the \"Year without a Summer\" of 1816.\n\nA paper written by Benjamin Franklin in 1783 blamed the unusually cool summer of 1783 on volcanic dust coming from Iceland, where the eruption of Laki volcano had released enormous amounts of sulfur dioxide, resulting in the death of much of the island's livestock and a catastrophic famine which killed a quarter of the population. Temperatures in the northern hemisphere dropped by about 1 °C in the year following the Laki eruption.\n\nIn 1600, the Huaynaputina in Peru erupted. Tree ring studies show that 1601 was cold. Russia had its worst famine in 1601 to 1603. From 1600 to 1602, Switzerland, Latvia and Estonia had exceptionally cold winters. The wine harvest was late in 1601 in France, and in Peru and Germany wine production collapsed. Peach trees bloomed late in China, and Lake Suwa in Japan froze early.\n\nIn 1452 or 1453, a cataclysmic eruption of the submarine volcano named Kuwae.

No one method works for all objects and distances, so astronomers use a number of methods.\n\nA real \"direct\" distance measurement of an astronomical object is possible only for those objects that are close enough to Earth (within about a thousand parsecs). It is the larger distances which are the problem. Several methods rely on a standard candle, which is an astronomical object that has a known standard luminosity.\n\nThe ladder analogy arises because no one technique can measure distances at all ranges encountered in astronomy. Instead, one method can be used to measure nearby distances, a second can be used to measure nearby to intermediate distances, and so on. Each rung of the ladder provides information that can be used to determine the distances at the next higher rung.\n\nThe astronomical unit is the mean (average) distance of the Earth from the Sun. This we know quite accurately. Radar bounce off artificial satellites and inner planets provide the data, then the result is worked out by computer. \n\nParallax is the use of trigonometry to discover the distances of objects near to the solar system.\n\nAs the Earth orbits around the Sun, the position of nearby stars will appear to shift slightly against the more distant background. These shifts are angles in a right triangle, with 2 AU making the short leg of the triangle and the distance to the star being the long leg. The amount of shift is quite small, measuring 1 arcsecond for an object at a distance of 1 parsec (3.26 light-years)\n\nThis method works for distances up to a few hundred parsecs.\n\nObjects of known brightness are called \"standard candles\". Most physical distance indicators are standard candles. These are objects which belong to a class that has a known brightness. By comparing the known luminosity of the latter to its observed brightness, the distance to the object can be computed using the inverse-square law. \n\nIn astronomy, the brightness of an object is given in terms of its absolute magnitude. This quantity is derived from the logarithm of its luminosity as seen from a distance of 10 parsecs. The apparent magnitude is the magnitude as seen by the observer. It can be used to determine the distance \"D\" to the object in kiloparsecs (kiloparsec = 1,000 parsecs) as follows:\n\nwhere \"m\" the apparent magnitude and \"M\" the absolute magnitude. For this to be accurate, both magnitudes must be in the same frequency band and there can be no relative motion in the radial direction.\n\nSome means of accounting for interstellar extinction, which also makes objects appear fainter and more red, is also needed. The difference between absolute and apparent magnitudes is called the distance modulus, and astronomical distances, especially intergalactic ones, are sometimes tabulated in this way.\n\nTwo problems exist for any class of standard candle. The principal one is calibration, finding out exactly what the absolute magnitude of the candle is. \n\nThe second lies in recognizing members of the class. The standard candle calibration does not work unless the object belongs to the class. At extreme distances, which is where one most wishes to use a distance indicator, this recognition problem can be quite serious.\n\nA significant issue with standard candles is the question of how standard they are. For example, all observations seem to indicate that Type Ia supernovae that are of known distance have the same brightness. The possibility that the distant Type Ia supernovae have different properties than nearby Type Ia supernovae exists.\n\nWith few exceptions, distances based on direct measurements are available only up to about a thousand parsecs, which is a modest portion of our own Galaxy. For distances beyond that, measures depend upon physical assumptions, that is, the assertion that one recognizes the object in question, and the class of objects is homogeneous enough that its members can be used for meaningful estimation of distance.\n\nPhysical distance indicators, used on progressively larger distance scales, include:\n\n\nIn a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram the absolute magnitude for a group of stars is plotted against the spectral classification of the stars. Evolutionary patterns are found that relate to the mass, age and composition of the star. In particular, during their hydrogen burning period, stars lie along a curve in the diagram called the main sequence. \n\nBy measuring the properties from a star's spectrum, the position of a main sequence star on the H-R diagram can be found. From this the star's absolute magnitude is estimated. A comparison of this value with the apparent magnitude allows the approximate distance to be determined, after correcting for interstellar extinction of the luminosity because of gas and dust.\n\nIn a gravitationally-bound star cluster such as the Hyades, the stars formed at approximately the same age and lie at the same distance. This allows relatively accurate main sequence fitting, providing both age and distance determination.\n\nThis is not a complete list of methods, but it does show the ways astronomers go about estimating the distance of astronomical objects.\n", "id": "318262", "title": "Cosmic distance ladder"}

The organization has over 6.5 million members in the United States. Members are five to 19 years old, in approximately 90,000 clubs.\n\nThe goal of 4-H is to develop citizenship, leadership, responsibility and life skills of youth through experiential learning programs and a positive youth development approach. Many people think of 4-H as an agriculturally-focused organization as a result of its history. But 4-H today focuses on citizenship, healthy living, science, engineering, and technology programs.\n\nToday, 4-H and related programs exist in over eighty countries around the world. The organization and administration varies from country to country. Each of these programs operates independently. They cooperate in international exchanges, global education programs, and communications.\n\nThe 4-H motto is \"To make the best better\", while its slogan is \"Learn by doing\" (sometimes written as \"Learn to do by doing\").\n\nThe start of 4-H began around 1900, with the work of several people in different parts of the United States. The focal point of 4-H has been the idea of practical and hands-on learning, which came from the desire to make public school education more connected to rural life. Early programs tied both public and private resources together to benefit rural youth.\n\nDuring this time, researchers at agricultural experiment stations of the land-grant universities and USDA saw that adult farmers did not readily accept new agricultural discoveries, but educators found that youth would experiment with these new ideas and then share their experiences and successes with the adults. So, rural youth programs became a way to introduce new agriculture technology to the adults.\nA. B. Graham started one of the youth programs in Clark County, Ohio, in 1902, which is considered the birth of the 4-H program in the United States. The first club was called \"The Tomato Club\" or the \"Corn Growing Club\". T.A. \"Dad\" Erickson of Douglas County, Minnesota, started local agricultural after-school clubs and fairs also in 1902. Jessie Field Shambaugh developed the clover pin with an H on each leaf in 1910, and, by 1912, they were called 4-H clubs. The national 4-H organization was formed in 1914. When the United States Congress created the Cooperative Extension Service (CES) of the USDA by passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, it included within the CES charter the work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. By 1924, these clubs became organized as 4-H clubs, and the clover emblem was adopted.\n\nThe first 4-H camp was held in Randolph County, West Virginia. Originally, these camps were for what was referred to as \"Corn Clubs\". Campers slept in corn fields, in tents, only to wake up and work almost the entirety of each day. Superintendent of schools G. C. Adams began a boys' corn club in Newton County, Georgia, in 1904. However, the city of Jacksboro, Texas, also stakes a claim to having the first forerunner to 4-H in 1910.\n\n4-H membership hit an all-time high in 1974 as a result of its popular educational program about nutrition, \"Mulligan Stew\", shown in schools and on television across the country.\n\n", "id": "318318", "title": "4-H"}

In knob and tube wiring, wires were held to the wooden structure by ceramic \"knobs\", and were protected by ceramic \"tubes\" when they went through a piece of wood. Wires were held to the knobs by another piece of non-conducting wire. A material called loom protected the wire when it entered a junction box, which usually contained an outlet, switch, or light fixture. Splices were soldered together and wrapped in cloth electrical tape. The insulation on knob and tube wiring was usually cotton cloth soaked in asphalt. To prevent short circuits, the hot and neutral wires were kept far apart. This is not necessary on modern wiring because modern insulation alone is enough to prevent short circuits. Knob and tube wiring did not have a ground wire and therefore did not have three-prong outlets. Most electrical codes allow the use of a GFCI to update knob and tube outlets to three-prong without installing any new wire.\n\nKnob and tube wiring used cloth insulation. Over time this insulation can wear out, become brittle, and fall off, leaving bare wire. The ceramic knobs and tubes provide some protection because even if the insulation does fall off, the bare wire can not touch the wooden structure. The insulation is also somewhat flammable. Some knob and tube insulation contained asbestos, which reduced the risk of fire, but can cause cancer. Unlike modern wiring, splices were not contained in a protective box. If a splice failed, it could make a spark and start a fire. The fuse boxes usually had no protection from using an incorrect fuse. An incorrect fuse could cause the wiring to overheat and become damaged or start a fire. Another problem is that when a fuse blew, people who didn't know or didn't care about the hazards would sometimes replace it with a coin or a ball of foil if a replacement fuse wasn't available, leaving no overload protection at all. These issues can be partially corrected by installing a modern circuit breaker panel with arc fault circuit interrupter breakers. There was also no ground wire. Knob and tube can be updated with a GFCI to add the equivalent of grounding. There is generally no need to replace knob and tube wiring if it is in good condition.\n\nUnlike modern wiring, knob and tube supply and return wires were not always alongside each other. In the oldest installations, several branch circuits could share the same neutral wire, which can cause overloads. To prevent overloads in this layout, the neutral wires were protected with fuses. If a neutral fuse blew or was removed, it could create a dangerous condition where the power appeared to be off, but was in fact still present. Three-way switches could also be wired in such a way that the outer ring of a lamp socket, which is normally connected to neutral, could be connected to hot, which is an electric shock hazard.\n\n", "id": "318374", "title": "Knob and tube wiring"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318375", "text": "Post-postmodernism\n\nPost-Postmodernism is a general term used to describe new developments emerging from Postmodernism. It is a positive idea that faith, sincerity and trust can be better for society Postmodern irony. Postmodernism is a way of thinking about culture and thought. It often challenges the certainty and authority of vital areas of our lives. However, as an almost sixty year-old term many do not think it is relevant to how we live our lives now and suggest a positive, earnest look at the world we live in. The term Post-Postmodernism was initially coined by seminal cultural theorist Alice Sanders in her magnum opus 'The Shadow of the Rainbow'.\n\nModernism began in the late 19th Century as a rejection of tradition and an attempt to see the world differently. It is associated with the Enlightenment. Events such as World War 2 and the Great Depression made many feel Modernism had failed. This led to Postmodernism, which is cold and skeptical of the grand narrative of Western Society. This grand narrative is explained by Jean-François Lyotard as something. Postmodernism is a very broad term that cannot be defined by specific themes. It is an all-encompassing way of thinking.\n\nPostmodernism is seen as a theory for explaining 20th Century culture. With the 20th Century now behind us and a new century beginning, many have suggested that Postmodernism is outdated in our current world. Advances such as the Internet, Mobile Phones and Television have changed the way we live, making the world a smaller place but also making communication and interaction with things around us less intimate. Post-Postmodernism takes this as a key reason why a return to sincerity and authentic expression is the way forward for the 21st Century.\n\nPost-Postmodernism is a very new idea that is still forming. There are many different ideas about how Post-Postmodernism could evolve and shape culture.\n\nZygmunt Bauman uses the term Liquid Modernity to refer to the freedom of ideas, information and people. It draws upon the global nature of society. Distinct cultures, ideas and categories are meeting and fusing in the 21st Century. It has been called \"a world of fragmented and incommensurate identities and personae\". Liquid Modernity is a powerful reaction to Postmodernism as it states that through privitisation and the global economy, we are now free to determine our own existence and path in the world.\n\nIn 2010 Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin Van Den Akker wrote an article called 'Notes on Metamodernism' that characterised life today as an oscillation between the realism of Postmodernism and the idealism of Modernism. They believe the two can work together, and that modern culture is based on navigating these oppositions. They list as opposing forces that a big variety of artists, theorists and creatives constantly alternate between.\n\nJesse Thorn's public radio show The Sound of Young America put forward the phrase 'New Sincerity'. Thorn says that some people and things in modern life are so entertaining and genuine that they can only be enjoyed sincerely, without irony. Using Evel Knievel as an example, he says: \"Here is a real man who feels at home as Spidey on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind.\" New Sincerity is a popular culture movement that shares many ideas with post-postmodernism.\n\nGerman-American Slavist Raoul Eshelman wrote in his book \"Performatism, Or the End of Postmodernism\" that many new cultural documents present viewers with simple, identifiable characteristics that are powerful. By making us aware of the artificial and set conditions of a piece of work, he believes we can have a genuine, sincere experience. His main example is the film American Beauty.\n\nAs an art movement, Altermodernism is a reaction to what Nicolas Bourriaud calls 'the standardisation of culture'. It was first discussed at the Altermodern Tate Triennial. In his manifesto Bourriaud says that \"Increased communication, travel and migration are affecting the way we live\". He calls contemporary existence \"a cultural landscape saturated with signs\". This means that we are overloaded with information and overlapping of cultures and ways of living. Bourriaud believes art is a way to create new pathways and find meaning in modern society.\n", "id": "318375", "title": "Post-postmodernism"}

This reacts to extended periods of too much current. \n\nSome advanced circuit breakers monitor current electronically, and shut the power off when an electronic sensor detects too much current.

This short story is one of the series which was published in his 1914 series. \n\nA Painful Case tells of the loneliness and isolation of two characters, Mr. James Duffy and Mrs. Emily Sinico. He is a lonely person who meets a woman by accident. Every morning he goes to work from his isolated suburb of Dublin by tram. In the afternoons, he goes to Dan Burk’s and eats his lunch there; a bottle of larger beer and a few arrowroot biscuits. At four o’clock, he is free. He has done the same work for four years, so his daily routine never changes. His evenings are always spent playing his landlady's piano or roaming around the city. He doesn’t have friends or companions; he enjoys his own spirituality by himself. He visits his family and relatives only at Christmas or for a funeral, but only when someone in his family dies. His only hobby is to attend an opera or a concert since he is a fan of Mozart.\n\nOne evening, Mr. Duffy attends a concert in the Rotunda and notices a lady sitting next to him; Mrs. Sinoco. When she comments about the small audience, he sees this as an invitation to talk to her. She is attractive and looks intelligent. In a few weeks, he meets her again at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace. This time, he has an opportunity to be close to her, while she is paying attention to her daughter. During their conversation, he figures out that she has a husband, but he doesn’t feel cautious of her. They then meet a third time by accident, and he asks her to meet him again. After that, they begin to see each other often, in her house. \n\nHe lends his books and music to her and shares his intellectual life. They are becoming close and spend more time together at her house. They talk about personal matters. They stay together until dark. They seem to have many things in common. One night, in a moment of excitement, she presses his hand to her cheek. He is surprised by this because she has misunderstood that he has the same feelings for her. He is confused by how she interpreted his words. After this incident, he doesn’t visit her for a week and then sends mail asking to meet her. In the end, they agree they cannot meet again and so they stop talking.\n\nAfter four years, Mr. Duffy has returned to his normal life. However, he avoids concerts because he is afraid of seeing her. One night he reads in a newspaper of her death; “Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening.\" After reading the painful news, he is disgusted by it. To him, she seems crude for having gotten drunk and then dying in such a shameful manner. He goes out to the pub thinking of the memory of her hand touching him. While he is drinking, he struggles with two images of her; the lonely drunkard and the intelligent woman he was close to. He realizes that she is now just a memory. He wonders if he could have done something for her. He now realizes he loves her, but it is too late. Now, he thinks of their lonely lives. He knows that his life will continue in the same pattern until he dies. As he walks, even though it is extremely cold, he feels that she is there with him; it seems that he could even hear her voice, since his memory of her is so strong. He looks down at the wall of the park and he sees lovers lying there. He feels that he is an outcast from human life. The lovers are aware that he is there and they wish he would leave.\n\nWhen Mrs. Sinico showed interest, Mr. Duffy ignored her emotions. Perhaps, his cold-headedness broke her heart. She thought she was close to him, so she opened up to him, while he only thought of her as a friend. She desired love and caring because she was lonely, even though she was married with a child. He didn’t realize until she was gone, that he would be alone until his death.\n", "id": "318412", "title": "A Painful Case"}

Today, the Dalits, formerly known as “Untouchables”, have increasingly adopted the term “Dalit” as their way out of the social segregation imposed by the caste system.\n\nUntouchability, is an ancient form of discrimination based upon caste. It is not merely the inability to touch a human being but also an attitude towards a minority group translated into various physical acts, norms and practices.\n\nThe Dalit status carries with it the stigma of “untouchability” because it is associated with menial, degrading tasks immediately connected with their traditional occupations which include unclogging sewers, disposing of dead bodies and cleaning latrines.\n\nThe discrimination against the Dalits takes various forms such as:\n\nThe rate of literacy among the Dalits, as per 1991 census, was 37.41% as compared to 57.69% for non-Dalits.\nUntouchability in schools has contributed to drop-out and illiteracy levels for Dalit children. The 1991 census of India reported that Dalit communities were one of the least literate social groups in the country, with only 30% of Dalit children recognized to have basic reading and writing skills.\n\nHalf of India's Dalit children are undernourished, 21% are 'severely underweight', and 12% die before their 5th birthday. Between 1998-1999 at least 50% of Dalit women suffered from anemia. High morbidity and child mortality are firmly linked to their low quality of life imposed by poverty, educational status and discrimination.\n\nThere have been many attempts to neutralize the caste-based discrimination. In the 1930s, the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi began to change attitudes towards the Dalit minority. In 1949 ‘Untouchability’ was outlawed by the Indian constitution and Indian law does not permit the practice of a caste system. Discrimination against the Dalit minority has become an important human rights and political issue. Even so, in rural areas the Dalits are still facing the consequences of the slow and steady decline of discrimination.\n\nToday, the Dalit movements (The Dalit Panther Movement, the Dalit Mahasabha and the Dalit Sangharsh Samithi) which have emerged during the 20th century continue to struggle for equality and implementation of Communal Award. The progress of the past few decades shows hope for an improved level of equality within Indian society. In 1997, Kocheril Raman Narayanan, became the\nfirst Dalit to have been elected President on India. Another important political figure was Mayawati Kumari, the leader of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which represents the Dalits. She has been elected four times as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.\n\nThe National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR) established in 1998 by Dalit human rights activists, is one of many organisations committed to the elimination of caste discrimination. It's main objectives are \"“to hold the State accountable for all Human Rights violations committed against Dalits; to sensitize civil society by raising visibility of the Dalit problem; and to render justice to Dalit victims of discrimination and violence.”\"\nThe International Dalit Solidarity Network, which was established in 2000, is another organisation concerned about caste discrimination and similar forms of discrimination based on work and descent. It has emerged as a network of national solidarity groups from affected countries such as those in South Asia and even West Africa.\n\n", "id": "318437", "title": "Dalit"}

As of January 1, 2007, Fermilab is operated by the Fermi Research Alliance, a joint venture of the University of Chicago, Illinois Institute of Technology and the Universities Research Association (URA). Fermilab is a part of the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor. \n\nFermilab's Tevatron was a landmark particle accelerator; at in circumference, it was the world's second largest energy particle accelerator (CERN's Large Hadron Collider is 27 km in circumference), until being shut down on September 30, 2011. In 1995, two teams at Fermilab (CDF and DØ, detectors which utilize the Tevatron) announced the discovery of the top quark.\n\nIn addition to high energy collider physics, Fermilab is also host to a number of smaller fixed-target and neutrino experiments, such as MiniBooNE (Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment), SciBooNE (SciBar Booster Neutrino Experiment) and MINOS (Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search). The MiniBooNE detector is a diameter sphere which contains 800 tons of mineral oil lined with 1520 individual phototube detectors. An estimated 1 million neutrino events are recorded each year. SciBooNE is the newest neutrino experiment at Fermilab; it sits in the same neutrino beam as MiniBooNE but has fine-grained tracking capabilities. The MINOS experiment uses Fermilab's NuMI (Neutrinos at the Main Injector) beam, which is an intense beam of neutrinos that travels through the Earth to the Soudan Mine in Minnesota.\n\nA large piece of land was reserved for Fermilab, but much of the equipment is underground. The Fermilab scientists decided to use the land surface as an experiment in restoring Illinois original prairie. They also started a farm to raise al herd of American bison. The Fermilab Nature Areas is a separate non-profit group that administers these programs.\n\nAsteroid 11998 Fermilab is named in honor of the laboratory.\n\nBetween World War II and the 1960s, the federal government funded different particle accelerators at competing universities to build high-energy physics experiments. Most notable were the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), which sent particles in a straight line, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at SUNY Stoney Brook and the Cornell University synchrotron, which sent particles around in a circle to have the same magnets work on the particles many times. By the 1960s, the cost of building bigger atom smashers were too high to fund each individual campus, and the size of ring for the next circular accelerator would be too large to fit on an existing college campus. So, the federal government decided to start a new location to be run by physicists from several universities. They held a competition to pick a site, but politicians fought for it to be in Illinois.\n\nWeston, Illinois was a community next to Batavia. It was a subdivision of pre-fabricated homes started in the early 1960s. Sales were very slow, so the land developers tried to attract Fermilab to be a new employer on the edge of the new town. However, it turned out that the amount of land needed would swallow up the entire town. So, the town voted to sell all of the land, including the houses that had been built to Fermilab. The town then dissolved.\n\nThe laboratory was founded in 1967 as the National Accelerator Laboratory; it was renamed in honor of Enrico Fermi in 1974. The lab's first director was Robert Rathbun Wilson. Wilson made many of the sculptures on the campus. He is attributed as being responsible for it being finished ahead of time and under budget. The high rise laboratory building on the site, the unique shape of which has become the symbol for Fermilab, is named in his honor, and is the center of activity on the campus.\n\nBefore the new buildings could be finished, the scientists moved into the Weston houses and also moved all of the farm houses on Fermilab to that location for use as office space. They renamed Weston, \"Fermilab Village.\" It still houses visiting scientists.\n\nWilson brought in the team that had built the Cornell synchrotron to help build the original 200 GeV accelerator. Two important inventions made this accelerator obsolete: superconducting magnets and using the same acclerator ring to send two groups of particles around in opposite directions so that when the collide they would have twice the energy.\n\nAfter Wilson stepped down in 1978 to protest the lack of funding for the lab, Leon M. Lederman took on the job. It was under his guidance that the original accelerator was replaced with the Tevatron accelerator. The new accelerator was capable of colliding proton and an antiproton at a combined energy of 1.96 TeV. Lederman stepped down in 1988 and remains Director Emeritus. The on-site science education center (which serves students and the general public) was named in his honor.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1998, the lab was run by John Peoples. From that time until June 30, 2005, the lab was run by Michael S. Witherell. On November 19, 2004 Piermaria Oddone, formerly of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, was announced as Fermilab's newest director. Oddone began his term as director July 1, 2005.\n\nFermilab continues to participate in the work in the LHC including serving as a Tier 1 site in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. The State of Illinois is funding a new Illinois Accelerator Research Center building at Fermilab for scientists and industrial partners.\n\nThe first stage in the acceleration process takes place in the Cockcroft–Walton generator. It involves taking hydrogen gas and turning it into H ions by introducing it into a container lined with molybdenum electrodes: a matchbox-sized, oval-shaped cathode and a surrounding anode, separated by 1 mm and held in place by glass ceramic insulators. A magnetron is used to generate a plasma to form H near the metal surface. A 750 keV electrostatic field is applied by the Cockcroft–Walton generator, and the ions are accelerated out of the container. The next step is the linear accelerator (or linac), which accelerates the particles to 400 MeV, or about 70% of the speed of light. Right before entering the next accelerator, the H ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H ions (protons).\n\nThe next step is the booster ring. The booster ring is a 468 m circumference circular accelerator that uses magnets to bend beams of protons in a circular path. The protons coming from the Linac travel around the Booster about 20,000 times in 33 milliseconds so that they repeatedly experience electric fields. With each revolution the protons pick up more energy, leaving the Booster with 8 GeV. The Main Injector is the next link in the accelerator chain. Completed in 1999, it has become Fermilab's \"particle switchyard\" with three functions: it accelerates protons, it delivers protons for antiproton production, and it accelerates antiprotons coming from the antiproton source. The final accelerator was the Tevatron. It was the second most powerful particle accelerator in the world (CERN's Large Hadron Collider being the most powerful). Traveling at almost the speed of light, protons and antiprotons circle the Tevatron in opposite directions. Physicists coordinate the beams so that they collide at the centers of two 5,000-ton detectors DØ and CDF inside the Tevatron tunnel at energies of 1.96 TeV, revealing the conditions of matter in the early universe and its structure at the smallest scale. The Tevatron is being converted into a museum.\n\nThe linear accelerator also has a medical treatment facility. Doctors treat people with cancer by shooting protons or neutrons from the accelerator into their tumors.\n\n\n", "id": "318562", "title": "Fermilab"}

The HBT can handle signals of much higher frequencies, (up to several hundred GHz) than BJT. HBT is commonly used in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly radio-frequency (RF) systems, and in applications requiring a high power efficiency, such as RF power amplifiers in mobile phones. The idea of using a heterojunction is as old as the conventional BJT, dating back to a patent from 1951.\n\nThe principal difference between the BJT and HBT is in the use of different semiconductor materials for the emitter and base regions, making a heterojunction. This limits the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high doping density to be used in the base. The high doping density reduces the base resistance while maintaining gain. The efficiency of the heterojunction is measured by the Kroemer factor.\n\n", "id": "318569", "title": "Heterojunction bipolar transistor"}

According to South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are 223,322 Koreans or people of Korean ancestry in Canada. This is the fourth-largest population of Koreans outside of Korea (after Koreans in Japan and ahead of Koreans in Russia). Also, the government of South Korean guessed that there are more than 100,000 Koreans living in Canada illegally.\n\nThe first Koreans who came to Canada were Christians. They were sent by Canadian missionaries to study Christianity in Canada. Not many stayed in Canada though; and in 1965, the total Korean population of Canada was only about 70 people. However, after 1966's change of Canadian immigration laws, South Korean immigration to Canada grew. Between 1970 and 1980, 18,148 Koreans immigrated to Canada, and another 17,583 came in the 1990s. In the late 1990s, South Korea became the fifth-largest source of immigrants to Canada. Toronto has the most Koreans in Canada, but Vancouver has the highest growth rate of Koreans. They have increased 69% since 1996. Montreal has the third-most Korean immigrants at this time. In 2001, More Koreans went to Canada than to the United States. The number of temporary residents also grew after the Canadian government made visas not necessary; South Korea sent the most international students to Canada in the late 1990s. Many of the Koreans who came to Canada, came from the Korean population in China.\n\nIn the 1990s, many Koreans came to Canada because unemployment was high and income growth was low. It was the opposite in the United States at this time. They also came because the Canadian dollar was very weak, so they could get a lot of Canadian money from their Korean money. In the USA, they could get less American dollars. So they had more money if they came to Canada Lastly, in Korea at the time there was lots of anti-American feelings, and also many local native teachers came from Canada, so Koreans knew Canadians very well. .\n\nMany Koreans in Canada are well educated, and many new immigrants and their children are skilled workers such as—doctors, professors, engineers, computer technicians—or businessmen.\n\nKorean Canadians are usually one of three types: first generation immigrants, the “1.5” generation who began their schooling in Korea but moved to Canada in their childhood or teen years, and the second generation born in Canada. Each group is very unique, but Korean Canadians are very loyal to their Korean culture. They do this by local culture activities, university and alumni groups, seniors’ groups, language schools and business contacts. Vancouver and Toronto have Korean-language newspapers, and Korean television and radio programs. Korean dance, music art, as well as martial arts and Korean cuisine, are very popular in Canada.\n\nToday, many Korean Canadians are Christians, and often attend Korean churches. A small number are Buddhist or are not religious. \n\nStatistics were researched in 2007 by the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The statistics showed that among Koreans living in Canada, 86,084 are Canadian citizens, 72,077 are permanent residents, 20,738 people have student visas, and 19,271 other people are temporary residents. The Canada 2001 Census said that there are 101,715 Canadians of Korean descent, but Korean community leaders and the media think that there are more than this. A big group could be temporary students studying English. According to the Canada 1996 Census, 53.6% of Korean immigrants to Canada graduated from University, compared to 23% of other Canadians. However, because Canadian employers prefer degrees from Canada, Korean immigrants often do jobs that are not what they studied in Korea; 40% worked in family-owned businesses, and their average income is only 67% of other Canadian's income.\n\n", "id": "318575", "title": "Korean Canadian"}

These teeth were used for crushing shellfish. Placodonts are in the Order Sauropterygia, the group that includes Plesiosaurs. Placodonts were mostly between in length, up to a maximum long. They are found in marine sediments of the Middle and Upper Triassic, 235–250 million years ago.\n\nThe first specimen was discovered in 1830, and they have since been discovered throughout central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and China.\n\nThe earliest forms like \"Placodus\", which lived in the early to middle Triassic, looked rather barrel-shaped. Later placodonts had bony plates on their backs which protected their bodies while feeding.\n\nBy the Upper Triassic, these plates had grown so much that placodonts of the time such as \"Henodus\" and \"Placochelys\" looked like the sea turtles of modern day more than their ancestors. Other placodonts like \"Psephoderma\" developed plates as well, but in a different articulated manner that resembled the shells of horseshoe crabs and trilobites more than those of sea turtles. All these adaptations are examples of convergent evolution, as placodonts were not related to any of these animals. \n\nBecause of their dense bone and heavy armour plating, these creatures would have been too heavy to float in the ocean and would have used a lot of energy to reach the water surface. For this reason, and because of the type of sediment found with the fossils, it is suggested placodonts lived in shallow waters and not in deep oceans.\n\nThe placodonts ate shellfish. Their front teeth stuck out: they would be used to dig up the shellfish, and pull them from any attachment to the substrate. Inside their mouth, the teeth were large and flat: they were used to crush the shells.\n\nTheir diet consisted of marine bivalves, brachiopods, and other invertebrates. \n", "id": "318582", "title": "Placodont"}

Before becoming the United States Secretary of Energy, he was a professor of physics and molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was also the director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. \n\nBefore teaching at Berkeley, he was a professor of physics at Stanford University. He has argued for more research into alternative energy and nuclear power. He thinks the world should shift away from fossil fuels to help with climate change. For example, he discusses a global \"glucose economy\". This is a form of a low-carbon economy, in which glucose from tropical plants is shipped around like oil is today.\n\nChu was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He has ancestry from Taicang, Jiangsu. He attended and graduated from Garden City High School. He received both a B.A. in mathematics and a B.S. in physics in 1970 from the University of Rochester. He went on to earn his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1976.\n\nHe wrote a paper on gravitational redshift published in \"Nature\" (463, 926–929) in Feb 2010 and a second one co-authored in July 2010.\n\nUnder his leadership in 2010 the Department of Energy updated the water usage regulations on toilets and showers.\n\nHis nomination to be Secretary of Energy was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on January 20, 2009. On January 21, 2009, Chu was sworn in as Secretary of Energy in the Barack Obama administration. \n\nIn March 2011 Chu said that federal regulators should not delay approving licenses for construction for planned U.S. nuclear power plants because of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. \"I think those things can proceed\", Chu told reporters on Capital Hill, referring to construction license applications pending at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn August 2011, Chu praised an advisory panel’s report on curbing the environmental risks of natural-gas development. Chu responded to the panel’s report on hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing breaks up rock to get more oil and gas out of the ground. The report recommendations include: greater data collection of air and water data, “rigorous” air pollution standards and mandatory disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. “The report ... recommends a range of tools for implementing these measures, including regulation, continuous improvement in best practices by industry, and ongoing research and development,” Chu said in a statement. “I will be working closely with my colleagues in the Administration to review the recommendations and to chart a path for continued development of this vital energy resource in a safe manner,” he added.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have accused Chu for changing a US$535 million federal loan to Solyndra, an energy company.

The North Sea is not an inland sea, but it does sit on continental shelf, and so is epeiric (that is what the word means). The Hudson Bay is often considered an epeiric sea because its depth averages 100ft (30 m) whereas, for example, the Bay of Bengal is 2,600 metres deep. So epeiric seas are on the continental plate, as are inland seas. The inland seas, however, are more enclosed.\n\nThe Amazon basin originally emptied into the Pacific Ocean when South America and Africa were part of Gondwana.\n\nAfter the breakup of Gondwana, the Amazon found its exit blocked by the rise of the Andes about 15 million years ago (mya). A great inland sea developed, at times draining north through what is now Venezuela before finding its present eastward outlet into the South Atlantic. Gradually this inland sea became a vast freshwater lake and wetlands where sediment flattened its profiles and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. Over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, live today in the freshwaters of the Amazon, which is also home to a freshwater dolphin. In 2005 fossilized remains of a giant crocodile, estimated to have been 46 ft (14m) in length, were discovered in the northern rainforest of Amazonian Peru.\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea looks like a clear-cut example of an inland sea, but its deepest point is 5,267 m (17,280 ft) in the Calypso Deep of the Ionian Sea. The Mediterranean is a genuine sea which has been squashed almost out of existence by the movement of Africa against the European tectonic plate. It was formerly part of the ancient Tethys Ocean, which surrounded the old global supercontinent of Pangaea. So the Mediterranean is different from those inland seas which sit on top of continental plates.\n\nThe Black Sea, on the other hand, is a genuine inland sea because it sits on continental plates which have subsided.\n\nA vast inland sea extended from the Gulf of Mexico deep into present-day Canada during the Cretaceous. It split the continent of North America into two halves, Laramidia and Appalachia, for most of the mid- and late-Cretaceous period. It was 2,500 feet (760 m) deep, 600 miles (970 km) wide and over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) long.\n\nThe Sundance Sea existed in North America during the mid to late Jurassic period of the Mesozoic Era. It was an arm of what is now the Arctic Ocean, and extended through what is now western Canada into the central western United States. The sea receded when highlands to the west began to rise. The sedimentary rocks which formed in and around the Sundance Sea are often rich in fossils.\n", "id": "318636", "title": "Inland sea"}

It was created by Ken Tyrrell. The team started racing in 1958 and started building its own cars in 1970. The team had its best success in the early 1970s. During that time, it won three drivers' championships and one constructors' championship with Jackie Stewart. The team never did as well again, but it kept winning races through the 1970s and into the early 1980s. It won its final win at Detroit in 1983. The team was bought by British American Tobacco in 1997. It finished its last season as Tyrrell in 1998.\n\nTyrrell Racing was created in 1958. It used Formula Three cars for Ken Tyrrell and local stars. Tyrrell stopped being a driver in 1959. He did not think that he was good enough as a driver. He began to run a Formula Junior operation. He used the woodshed owned by his family business, Tyrrell Brothers, to do the work on the cars. During the 1960s, Tyrrell moved through the lower levels of formula racing. John Surtees and Jacky Ickx raced for their first times with his team. The team's most famous partnership was with Jackie Stewart. Stewart first signed up in 1963. \n\nTyrrell ran the BRM Formula 2 operation during 1965, 1966 and 1967. During this time, Stewart was signed to the Formula One team. Tyrrell then signed a deal to run Formula 2 cars made by French company Matra.\n\nWith the help of Elf and Ford, Tyrrell moved to Formula One in 1968. He started as a part of Matra International. It was made up of Tyrrell's own team and the French auto maker Matra. Stewart was expected to race very well. He won several Grands Prix in the teams Matra MS10. The car's most unusual feature was the use of aviation-styled structural fuel tanks. These let the car to be around 15 kg lighter. Although it was lighter, it was still stronger than the cars it was racing against. The FIA thought that the technology was not safe. They chose to not let it be used in 1970. They said that rubber bag-tanks had to be used instead.\n\nFor the 1969 championship, the Matra team chose to not compete in Formula One. Instead of competing, Matra worked with Ken Tyrrell's 'Matra International' team. They built a new DFV powered car with structural fuel tanks, even though it would only be able to be used for a single season. Stewart won the 1969 title easily driving the new Cosworth-powered Matra MS80. Stewart's title was the first won by a French chassis. It was the only one won by a chassis built in France. It was a very special event for a team and a constructor that had only entered Formula One the year before.\n\nIN 1970, Matra merged with Simca. For the 1970 season, Tyrrell was asked by Matra to use Simca's V12 in place of the Cosworth. Simca was a subsidiary of the American company Chrysler which was competition for Ford. Stewart tested the Matra V12. He did not think it was as good as the DFV. Ford gave Tyrrell a large part of the money they needed to race. The team also got money for the French petroleum company Elf. Elf had an agreement with Renault that did not allow them to provide money to anyone who was partnered with Simca. Because of this, Ken Tyrrell had to buy a March 701 chassis as temporary solution while making his own car in secret.\n\nTyrrell was still sponsored by French fuel company Elf, and Tyrrell would keep the traditional French blue racing colours for most of the rest of the time the company existed. Tyrrell and Stewart ran the March-Fords throughout 1970 with mixed success. During this time, Derek Gardner worked on the first Tyrrell built Grand Prix car at the woodshed in Ockham, Surrey.\n\nThe Tyrrell 001, which looked like the MS80, was first seen in . It earned Stewart a pole position in the Canadian GP. The car had problems in all of its 3 race starts. The nearly identical Tyrrell 003 won both Drivers' and Constructors' Championships in . Stewart's had health problems dealing with a stomach ulcer in 1972 and did not race. He was well in 1973 and raced again. He finishing 1st in the Championship. On October 6, 1973, Tyrrell's other driver was killed in practice for the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. Stewart, who was to stop racing at the end of the season, and Tyrrell decided they did not want to keep racing. Without their best driver, Tyrrell were never serious World Championship contenders again.\n\nThe team did still win some races during the 1970s with Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler. Most notable of these was Scheckter's win at the 1976 Swedish Grand Prix. They finished first and second in that race using an unusual Derek Gardner designed Tyrrell P34 car. The P34 was the first (and only) successful six-wheeled F1 car. They replaced front wheels with smaller wheels mounted in banks of two on either side of the car. The design was no longer used after Goodyear refused to make the small tires needed for the car.\n\nIn 1977, the Turbo era started in Grand Prix racing. By the mid-1980s, normal (non-turbo) cars could not race as well. Without the enough money, Tyrrell was the last team with the Cosworth DFV. All other teams had changed to turbocharged engines. It was the start of two decades of bad times for Tyrrell. The last win for the classic Cosworth Ford DFV engine was by a Tyrrell car, Michele Alboreto at the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix. It was also Tyrrell's last Grand Prix win.\n\nTyrrell had money problems in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s, Tyrrell had problems with his health as well. In 1998 and in the face of dwindling form and ill health, he sold his team to British American Tobacco. The team became British American Racing. The last race for Tyrrell was the 1998 Japanese Grand Prix, where Ricardo Rosset failed to qualify and team-mate Toranosuke Takagi ended the race on lap 28 after a collision with Esteban Tuero's Minardi.\n\n\"*\" In 1968 and 1969 Tyrrell ran the works-supported Matra team, hence were not eligible for Constructors' Championship points themselves.

It split North America into two halves for most of the mid- and late-Cretaceous Period. It was up to deep, wide and over long.\n\nSea level was high in the Cretaceous, and the middle part of North America sank down. A shallowly-subducting plate pulled on the bottom of the lithosphere, causing it to move down. The sea entered both north and south, and came and went during the course of the Cretaceous. Widespread carbonate deposition suggests that the Seaway was warm and tropical, with abundant calcareous algae. The shrunken, regressive phase of the Western Interior Seaway is sometimes called the Pierre Seaway.\n\nThe Western Interior Seaway was a shallow sea filled with abundant marine life. This included predatory marine reptiles such as plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs that grew up to 18 meters long. Other marine life included sharks such as \"Squalicorax\" and the giant shellfish-eating \"Ptychodus mortoni\" (believed to be 10 meters long). There were advanced bony fish such as the massive 5-meter long \"Xiphactinus\" – a fish larger than any modern bony fish. Other sea life included invertebrates such as molluscs, ammonites, squid-like belemnites, and plankton including coccolithophores that secreted the chalky platelets that give the Cretaceous its name, foraminiferans and radiolarians.\n\nThe Western Interior Seaway was home to early birds also, including the flightless \"Hesperornis\" which had stout legs for swimming through water and small wing-like appendages used for marine steering rather than flight; and the tern-like \"Ichthyornis\", an early avian with a toothy beak. \"Icthyornis\" shared the sky with large pterosaurs such as \"Nyctosaurus\" and \"Pteranodon\". \"Pteranodon\" fossils are very common and it was likely a major component of the surface ecosystem, though it was only found in the southern reaches of the Seaway.\n\nOn the bottom, the giant clam \"Inoceramus\" left common fossilized shells in the Pierre Shale. This clam had a thick shell paved with \"prisms\" of calcite deposited at right angles to the surface, giving a pearly luster in life. Paleontologists suggest that its giant size was an adaptation for life in the murky bottom waters, where a correspondingly large gill area would have allowed the animal to cope with oxygen-depleted waters.\n", "id": "318754", "title": "Western Interior Seaway"}

This is done by combining known facts. No assumptions are made when doing a direct proof. Lemmas and theorems are used to prove direct proofs.\n\nA statement that can be proved with a direct proof is usually in the form \"if \"p\", then \"q\".\" Here, \"p\" and \"q\" are facts. To solve a statement like this, every case where \"p\" is true must be considered.\n\nFor example, this statement can be solved with a direct proof: \"if x and y are even integers, then x+y is an even integer.\" Since x and y are even, then we can say that \"x=2m\" and \"y=2n,\" where \"m\" and \"n\" are integers. (This is a lemma.) We can also say that \"m+n\" is an integer, because adding two integers gives an integer. (This is another lemma.) Then we can say that \"x+y=2m+2n=2(m+n)\". Since \"m+n\" is an integer, we can say \"2(m+n)=2k\", where \"k=m+n\". We know that any integer times 2 is an even integer. We can then say that any two even integers added together give an even integer.\n\nDirect proofs are used in mathematics, logic, and computer science. The opposite of a direct proof is an indirect proof (also called a \"proof by contradiction\".)\n\n", "id": "318792", "title": "Direct proof"}

This form of criticism uses reason, rather than revelations to study texts. There are four primary types of Biblical criticism: form, traditional, higher and lower criticism.\n\nConservative Christians, as well as much of Orthodox Judaism and Karaite Judaism, support the idea that the Bible is historically accurate.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318949", "text": "Nucleophile\n\nA nucleophile is a species that donates an electron-pair to an electrophile to form a chemical bond in a reaction. All molecules or ions with a free pair of electrons can be nucleophiles. This pair of electrons is called lone pair. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they fit the definition of Lewis bases. \n\nNucleophilic describes the attraction of a nucleophile to the nuclei. Nucleophilicity, sometimes referred to as nucleophile strength, refers to a substance's nucleophilic character and is often used to compare the attraction of atoms.\n\nNeutral nucleophilic reactions with solvents such as alcohols and water are called \"solvolysis\". Nucleophiles may take part in nucleophilic substitution reactions. In those reactions, a nucleophile becomes attracted to a full or partial positive charge.\n\nThe terms \"nucleophile\" and \"electrophile\" were introduced by Christopher Kelk Ingold in 1929, replacing the terms \"cationoid\" and \"anionoid\" proposed earlier by A. J. Lapworth in 1925.\n\nThe word nucleophile is derived from nucleus and the Greek word φιλος, philos for love.\n\nIn general, within a row across the periodic table, the more basic the ion (the higher the pK of the conjugate acid) the more reactive it is as a nucleophile. In a given group, polarizability is more important in the determination of the nucleophilicity. In other words, the easier it is to distort the electron cloud around an atom or molecule, the more readily it will react. For example, the iodide ion (I) is more nucleophilic than the fluoride ion (F).\n\nExamples of nucleophiles are anions such as Cl, or a compound with a lone pair of electrons such as NH (ammonia).\n\nIn the example below, the oxygen of the hydroxide ion donates an electron pair to bond with the carbon at the end of the bromopropane molecule. The bond between the carbon and the bromine then undergoes heterolytic fission, with the bromine atom taking the donated electron and becoming the bromide ion (Br). This is a S2 reaction occurs by backside attack. This means that the hydroxide ion attacks the carbon atom from the other side, exactly opposite the bromine ion. Because of this backside attack, S2 reactions result in a reversal of the configuration of the electrophile. If the electrophile is chiral, it typically keeps its chirality, though the S2 product's configuration is flipped as compared to that of the original electrophile (Walden inversion). \n\nAn ambident nucleophile is one that can attack from two or more places, resulting in two or more products. For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN) may attack from either the S or the N. For this reason, the S2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN often leads to a mixture of RSCN (an alkyl thiocyanate) and RNCS (an alkyl isothiocyanate). Similar mixtures will happen in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis.\n\nAlkyl metal halides are carbon nucleophiles found in the Grignard reaction, Blaise reaction, Reformatsky reaction, and Barbier reaction, organolithium reagents, and anions of a terminal alkyne.\n\nEnols are also carbon nucleophiles. The formation of an enol is catalyzed by acid or base. Enols are ambident nucleophiles, but, in general, nucleophilic at the carbon atom next to the carbons with double bond (alpha carbon atom).\nEnols are commonly used in condensation reactions, including the Claisen condensation and the aldol condensation reactions.\n\nExamples of oxygen nucleophiles are water (HO), hydroxide anion, alcohols, alkoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and carboxylate anions.\n\nOf sulfur nucleophiles, hydrogen sulfide and its salts, thiols (RSH), thiolate anions (RS), anions of thiolcarboxylic acids (RC(O)-S), and anions of dithiocarbonates (RO-C(S)-S) and dithiocarbamates (RN-C(S)-S) are used most often.\n\nIn general, sulfur is very nucleophilic because of its large size, which makes it readily polarizable, and its lone pairs of electrons are readily accessible.\n\nNitrogen nucleophiles include ammonia, azide, amines, and nitrites.\n\n", "id": "318949", "title": "Nucleophile"}

It takes place when Shrek and Fiona's children are still infants.\n\nShrek (Mike Myers) is quietly living in the swamp with his family when the Christmas season arrives. Donkey (Eddie Murphy) convinces Shrek to tell Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to expect a special Christmas surprise. Shrek goes to the local bookstore in Far, Far Away to try to find a present for Fiona. Because he does not know what Christmas is all about, the shopkeeper (Marissa Jaret Winokur) gives Shrek a copy of the book \"Christmas For Village Idiots\". It is a step-by-step guide to celebrating the holiday.\n\nShrek does what the book say to do by decorating the house and getting a tree. He plans to have a quiet Christmas Eve with his family. Donkey brings the entire \"family\" to the swamp. This ruins Shrek's plans.\n\nShrek tries to tell his own version of \"A Visit from St. Nicholas (The Night Before Christmas)\". Gingy, Donkey, and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) interrupt and each tell their own version of a Christmas story. Donkey tells of floats coming to the swamp.

In a fight over the book, all of Shrek's decorations, furniture and the tree are destroyed. Shrek gets angry and tells everyone to leave the house.\n\nIn a bad mood, Fiona and Shrek have a talk. After they talk, she takes the children and leaves the swamp to go and apologize to their friends. Shrek feels very bad that Christmas Eve did not go as he hoped it would.\n\nFiona finds their friends and explains to Donkey what Shrek had wanted for Christmas. Shrek joins them and tells them he is sorry for getting mad. Donkey is surprised to learn that this is Shrek's first Christmas, because \"ogres don't celebrate anything.\" Donkey says he is sorry for being annoying. He says that Christmas never goes as planned and according to his mother, \"'Christmas ain't Christmas until somebody cries', and that's usually me.\"\n\nAfter a snowball fight, the friends return to the swamp. Shrek tells his story. It is about Ogre Claus, not Santa Claus. Soon they hear bells. They go outside to see Santa and his reindeer. Gingy runs back inside screaming in fear.\n\n\n\"Shrek the Halls\" was produced by DreamWorks Animation at the PDI/DreamWorks studio. Gary Trousdale directed the special at first, but he was later replaced by Mark Baldo. The movie was produced by Teresa Cheng, Gina Shay and Aron Warner. The screenplay was written by Bill Riling, Theresa Cullen, Gary Trousdale and Sean Bishop.\n\n\"Shrek the Halls\" was released on DVD in the United States on November 4, 2008.

Religious symbolism has an effect when it affects both the intellect and the emotions. The choice of actions and objects for symbolism is very small. This makes it hard to chose a symbol that other religions and traditions do not use.\n\nElemental symbols were often used by the early Church. Water is an important symbol to Christians. Water is symbolic in baptism. It may also mean cleansing or purity. Fire symbolizes both the Holy Spirit and light. It is often used in the form of a candle flame. The sources of these symbols comes from the Bible. Examples include the \"tongues of fire\" that symbolized the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, Jesus' description of his followers as \"the light of the world\", and \"God is a consuming fire\" found in .\n\nThe fish was the most important symbol to early Christians. The symbolic fish was familiar to Christians from the earliest times. It can be seen in Roman monuments such as the Capella Greca and the Sacrament Chapels of the catacomb of St Callistus. The fish was used as a Christian symbol in the first decades of the 2nd century. The symbol may come from the miracle Jesus is said to have performed by multiplying loaves of bread and fishes on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. Its popularity is thought to mainly come from an acrostic made of the first letters of five Greek words \"Iesous CHristos THeou Yios Soter\". These form the Greek word \"Ichthys\" which means fish. \"Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter\" translates as \"Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour\".\n\nThe cross is one of the most well known symbols in the world. It was used as a symbol from the earliest times. This is shown in arguments against Christianity shown in the \"Octavius\" of Minucius Felix\n\nIn the early 3rd century, Clement of Alexandria, used the phrase \"\" (the Lord's sign) to mean the cross. He used the phrase when discussing that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, ΤΙΗ) in was a foreshadowing of the cross and Jesus. T is the Greek number fore 300. ΙΗ, the first two letters of Jesus's name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, means 18. Tertullian called the Christian believers \"crucis religiosi\", \"i.e.\" \"devotees of the Cross\". In his book \"De Corona\", Tertullian tells how it was a tradition for Christians to trace the sign of the cross on their foreheads.\n\nThe crucifix was not used until the 5th century. French Medievalist historian M.-M. Davy has described in great details Romanesque Symbolism as it developed in the Middle Ages in Western Europe.\n\nAncient people believed that the flesh of a peafowl did not decay after death. It became a symbol of immortality. This symbolism was used by early Christianity. Many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season in the east.\n\nSome of the oldest symbols in the Christian church are the sacraments. The number of sacraments is different in each denominations. All denominations have Eucharist and baptism. Others which may or may not be used are ordination, unction, confirmation, penance and marriage. The rites are seen as a symbol of the spiritual change or event that takes place. In the Eucharist, the bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus. In Roman Catholicism, they become the \"actual\" Body of Christ and Blood of Christ through Transubstantiation. This represent salvation brought by the death of Jesus. The rite of baptism is symbolic of the cleansing of the sinner by God. Where baptism is by immersion, it symbolizes spiritual death and resurrection. Different groups believe the sacraments mean different things. Some Protestant denominations think they are only symbolic. Roman Catholics, Orthodox, some Anglicans, and some Lutherans feel that, by the power of God, the sacraments have an actual effect.\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "319051", "title": "Christian symbolism"}

This terminology came into use with cladistics. The term is used in evolution and classification to mean the group which gave rise to later forms. It is a term which works at any level: a basal species gives rise to derived species, and a basal group gives rise to derived groups.\n\n'Derived' is the correct term in biology for \"specialised\" or \"advanced\". It is used for groups which have evolved from a more basal group. A derived trait is a trait that is present in an organism, but was absent in the last common ancestor of the group being considered. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist \"Entamoeba histolytica\" is a result of their secondary loss.\n\n\n\nIn the last example, note that apes are \"derived\" from monkeys but \"basal\" with respect to our own genus. The status of being basal or derived is relative, though living species can only be derived.

Generally, electronic dance music is created by producers and composers, and is then used by DJs, or disc jockeys, in the above settings. Electronic dance music takes many forms and styles. As a genre, it is generally up-tempo music created by electronic software and machines, such as synthesizers, drum machines, keyboards, samplers, sequencers and computers. Occasionally, the term \"techno\" is used to describe electronic dance music in general, despite being a generalisation as techno is a distinguishable subgenre of EDM.\n\nBeing quite a generic term, EDM has a variety of 'origins' and derivations. EDM can be said to stem from a fusion between regular dance music and electronic music. One notable example can be Donna Summer's 1977 single \"I Feel Love\", which combined elements of disco with electronic music. The innovative blend helped trigger several major EDM genres, such as Hi-NRG, Eurodance and techno music. Giorgio Moroder, who co-wrote the song and was also one of its producers, additionally created some of the earliest forms of electronic dance music. Kraftwerk are also credited as influencing electronic music. Whilst a lot of electronic dance music originates from disco, this is not the case for all EDM.\n\nThe song which has been credited as bringing EDM into mainstream popular music is Madonna's 1998 single \"Ray of Light\". Whilst it is attributed as helping bring the genre mainstream, electronic dance music existed and had enjoyed popularity years before the single's release; house music, for instance, had been popular in the United States since the early 1990s (its popularity can also be attributed to another Madonna single, 1990's \"Vogue\"). \n\nThere are different types of EDM, each varying in style and sound.

Because of this, the island was shown on a map. Later, the islands were removed from maps. Some islands are described and later on change their name, or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island. Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion. Such islands still exist. Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria-Theresa Reef in the South Pacific. Because they are far away from ships' routes, their existence can not be proved so far. In the year 1908, Robert Peary claimed to have found a lost continent, called Crocker Land. \n\nPeople such as João Vaz Corte-Real were rewarded for finding islands that turned out to be phantom islands. In the case given, the phantom island was Bacalao. The island showed up on maps in the early 16th century. Baccalieu Island is probably named after the phantom island.\n\nSome phantom islands were later \"found\". That way Baja California was first thought to be an island. Later, people found it was in fact a peninsula. Thule was discovered in antiquity; in modern times, people who found it may have talked about Norway, the Orkney Islands, Shetland or Scandinavia. Other interpretations include Iceland, Greenland, or the island Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea.\n\nOther phantom islands may exist because of mistakes in navigation, or optical illusions, such as superior mirage. One example of this is New South Greenland, which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823, and has not been seen since. \n\nSome phantom islands may have existed, but they have been destroyed, or are no longer above the water line.

It is a solid material that is almost as light as air. It is the world's lightest material. Its melting point is 1200 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to crocidolite asbestos. Aerogel is the best thermal insulator available and can be used in construction in place of fiberglass insulation. It allows better insulation with less material, although it is much more expensive than fiberglass. It is also brittle, making it more difficult to install than fiberglass. Most aerogel is not water-resistant, and even small amounts of water can destroy it. It is also safer than fiberglass or asbestos because it is not known to cause cancer if inhaled into the lungs.

The U.S. Census Bureau 2005 estimate for the county was 28,212 people. Its county seat is Crawfordville. Wakulla County is part of the Tallahassee, Florida, Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nIn 1528, Panfilo de Narvaez found what would be Wakulla County. He had left Tampa, Florida and was camping where the Wakulla River and St. Marks River joined together. Narvaez felt this was a good place to build a fort. In 1539, Hernando de Soto followed with his soldiers. They created San Marcos de Apalache.\n\nThe area was an active place in the early 19th century. A former British officer named William Augustus Bowles led 400 Creek Indians in an attack to take control of San Marcos. This angered Spain. A Spanish flotilla got to the area about 5 weeks later. The Spanish took control of San Marcos. In 1818, General Andrew Jackson attacked (Wakulla) and took control of San Marcos. Two British people, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, were said to have started Indian raids. They were found guilty of the crime and killed. This caused large diplomatic problems between the United States and England. In 1821, Florida was became a part of the United States. San Marcos controlled by U.S. troops. In 1824, the fort was no longer used. Control of it was given to the Territory of Florida. By 1839, the fort was returned to the U.S. A federal marine hospital was built. The hospital helped people with yellow fever in the area.\n\nWakulla County was created from Leon County in 1843. It may be named for the Timucuan Indian word for \"spring of water\" or \"mysterious water.\" This is because of Wakulla County's best natural attraction, Wakulla Springs. Wakulla Springs is one of the world's largest freshwater springs. In 1974, the water flow was measured at per day. This is the greatest recorded flow ever for a single spring.\nAt one time, the town of Port Leon was a very busy cotton-shipping hub. It had a railroad that carried over 50,000 tons of cotton a year. This cotton was sent to ship which mostly went to Europe. Port Leon was the sixth-largest town in Florida. 1,500 people lived there. A hurricane and its storm surge destroyed the town. New Port (today known as Newport) was built two miles (3 km) up river. It never did as well as Port Leon.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Wakulla County was blockaded from 1861-1865. Confederates took control of San Marcos de Apalache. They changed the name to Fort Ward. The Battle of Natural Bridge stopped the Union force that tried to take Fort Ward and nearby Tallahassee. Tallahassee was the last Confederate state capitol that the Union had not captured. The Union forces were not able use all their soldiers. They still had more soldiers than the Confederates. The Confederates chose to fight at a place where the St Marks River goes underground. This was the \"Natural Bridge' the battle was named for. The Confederates had over a day to get ready for the battle. The Union could not win and left. Most of the people who died in the battle were African-American soldiers fighting for the Union. A celebration was held in Tallahassee. It was stopped when a telegram arrived telling them about General Lee's surrender at Appomattox.\n\nFrom the early 1900s to 1966, Wakulla was very poor. It had no doctor and no dentist. There were only a small number of stores in the county. The county newspaper was printed just once a month on a mimeograph machine. Today, Wakulla has several doctors and dentists, There are several supermarkets and retailers. The county has a golf resort and a very good seafood business.\n\nThe county has a total area of . (or 82.46%) of this area is land and (or 17.54%) is water. Wakulla County is part of the Tallahassee Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 22,863 people, 8,450 households, and 6,236 families living in the county. There were 38 people for each square mile (15/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 86.10% White, 11.51% Black, 0.59% Native American, 0.25% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.29% from other races, and 1.23% from two or more races. 1.94% of the people were Hispanic or Latino of any race.\n\n\n\nWakulla County is unusual in that it has almost no municipal population. The two very small municipalities have about 3 percent of the people. The county seat, Crawfordville, is the only unincorporated county seat of Florida's 67 counties.\n\nThere are no Interstate highways in Wakulla County. Several large roads do go through the area. These include U.S. Route 98 and U.S. Route 319. Other important roads in the county include State Road 267, State Road 363 and County Road 375.\n\nThere are currently no railroads in Wakulla County. In the past, the Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railroad passed through Sopchoppy moving between Tallahassee and Carrabelle. The use of this railroad ended in 1948, The Tallahassee Railroad, the first railroad in Florida, stopped being used in 1983.\n\nThe Wakulla County Airport (2J0)is south of Panacea. It is a small public-use airport. The airport has with a single , north-south turf runway.\n\nSt. Marks is a small commercial seaport. In the past, it had some importance in the oil industry. It is currently used mainly by commercial fishermen. \n\n\n\n", "id": "319167", "title": "Wakulla County, Florida"}

Weston was a competitor of Thomas Edison in the early days of electricity generation and distribution.\n\nBorn in Oswestry, Shropshire, England, in 1850 to a merchant family, Weston first studied medicine but grew interested in chemistry. He emigrated to the United States after receiving his medical diploma in 1870. He then found a job in the electroplating industry. He saw the need for a constant source of current. He developed an interest in power generation and invented several dynamos and generators. He eventually co-founded the Weston Electric Light Company in Newark, New Jersey and later got the contract to light the Brooklyn Bridge. Weston was a founding member of the board of trustees of what later became the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Some of his inventions, instruments, and writings are maintained at the university's library and at its Weston Museum. Weston was president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1888-89.\n\nHe invented two alloys, constantan and manganin. Weston developed measurement instruments for electrical current—the modern foundation for the voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter. In 1888, he formed the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation which was known for its voltmeters, ammeters, wattmeters, ohmmeters, frequency meters, transformers, and transducers. Weston developed a method for producing a \"true\" permanent magnet. Weston conceived of and built a magnetic speedometer. Weston also developed the dashboard ammeter for Harley-Davidson motorcycles. \n\nWeston invented and patented the saturated cadmium cell in 1893. The cathode in the cell is an amalgam of cadmium with mercury. The anode is of pure mercury, and the electrolyte is a solution of cadmium sulphate. The Weston cell is a wet-chemical cell that produces a highly stable voltage suitable as a laboratory standard for calibration of voltmeters. The temperature coefficient was reduced by shifting to an unsaturated design, the predominant type today. When the Weston cell became the International Standard for EMF in 1911, Weston waived his patent rights.\n\nWeston died in Montclair, New Jersey in 1936. He got 309 United States patents during his life.\n\n\nWeston's son Edward Faraday Weston (1878–1971) received several patents regarding exposure meters, also manufactured by the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation and widely distributed since the 1930s, and established the system of the Weston film speed ratings for the measurement of film speeds.\n\n\n\n", "id": "319188", "title": "Edward Weston (chemist)"}

It was thought to be about 150 km north-northeast of Bouvet Island. \n\nJean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier discovered Bouvet Island in 1739. In 1808, James Lindsay of the \"Snow Swan\" discovered Bouvet Island again, and named it \"Lindsay Island\". The next time, George Norris of the \"Sprightly\" sighted Bouvet on 10 December 1825. He landed on 16 December, and took possession of the island, which he named Liverpool Island, for King George IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nBetween December 13 and December 16, Norris sailed the waters northeast of Bouvet Island, where he discovered another island. It was much smaller, and the sea around it was much rougher. Three miles southeast of the newly discovered island, he found three rocks. In his log, he named the newly found island Thompson Island, and the rocks \"chimneys\", because of their form. He also marked the position of his discoveries on a map. Unfortunately, the positions of the islands on the map did not match those written down in the log. In 1853 the discoveries of Thompson Island, Bouvet Island, and the Chimneys showed up on an official map of the British admiralty. \n\nIn 1893, Captain Joseph J. Fuller reported another sighting of Thompson Island, on his ship, \"Francis Allyn\".\n\nThe Valdivia expedition wanted to find the exact position of Bouvet and Thompson Island, in November 1898, but was unable to find Thompson Island.\n\nIn 1915, a German ship, the \"Meteor\", gave a depth of the sea of 1579 m at the position where Thompson had been reported. If Thompson ever existed, it is probable that it disappeared in a volcanic eruption sometime in the 1890s.\n\nThe Norwegian Arctic Expedition (1928/29) failed to find Thompson Island, and declared it did not exist.\n\nThompson Island continued to appear on maps published as late as 1943.\n\nThe only person to have seen Thompson Island was probably Norris.

He and Baruch S. Blumberg won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976. They got the Nobel for work on kuru. Kuru is the first human prion disease shown to be infectious. \n\nGajdusek's father, Karol Gajdusek, was from Büdöskö, Kingdom of Hungary, now Smrdáky, Slovakia. He was an ethnic Slovak who was a butcher. His mother's parents from Debrecen, Hungary. Gajdusek was born in Yonkers, New York. He graduated from the University of Rochester in 1943. Gajdusek studied physics, biology, chemistry and mathematics. He got an M.D. from Harvard University in 1946. His postdoctoral research was done at Columbia University, the California Institute of Technology, and Harvard. In the early 1950s, Gajdusek was drafted into the military as a research virologist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. In 1954 he went to work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. In Australia, he began the work that led to his getting the Nobel Prize.\n\nGajdusek's best-known work was on kuru. This disease was affecting many people among the South Fore people of New Guinea in the 1950s and 1960s. Gajdusek felt there was a connect between the spread of the disease and the funerary cannibalism by the South Fore people. He lived among the Fore and studied their language and culture. He also performed autopsies on people who died of kuru.\n\nGajdusek thought that kuru was spread by the ritualistic eating of the brains of dead family members. He proved this idea by infecting primates with the disease and showing that it had an very long incubation period of several years. When the cannibalism was stopped, kuru stopped spreading in just one generation. This was the first time it was shown that a non-inflammatory degenerative disease could be spread in humans.\n\nGajdusek was not able to identify what exactly spreads kuru. Other research by Stanley Prusiner and others led to the finding of proteins called prions that caused these disease and other similar diseases. \n\nSome people in the medical community, do not think that cannibalism was still practiced when Gajdusek did his research. Willam Arens, an anthropologist, says that Gajdusek never saw cannibalism himself. Researchers who worked with the Fore in the 1950s say that cannibalism was stopped in 1948. This was almost a decade before Gajdusek went to New Guinea. Many other researchers, including Robert Klitzman, S. Lindenbaum, R. Glasse, and researchers at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research have made reports that say that the cannibalism still happened. \n\nGajdusek became head of the laboratories for virological and neurological research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1958. He was made a part of the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.\n\nDuring his trips in the South Pacific, Gajdusek had brought 56 children back to live with him in the United States. He gave them the chance to have high school and college education. Later, as an adult, one of these children said that Gajdusek molested him as a child. \n\nGajdusek was charged with child molestation in April 1996. This was based on things in his own diary and what the victim told police. He said this was true in 1997 and was sent to jail for 12 months. After he got out of jail in 1998, he went to Europe. He never returned to the United States and lived in Amsterdam, Paris, and Tromsø. Gajdusek openly admitted molesting boys and his approval of incest.\n\nGajdusek died December 12, 2008 in Tromsø, Norway, at the age of 85.\n\n", "id": "319286", "title": "Daniel Carleton Gajdusek"}

After 1966, the East Germans were a separate team. They won a total of 519 medals at the Olympics.\n\nGermany was divided after World War II. Three separate states were created. German athletes tried to take part in the 1948 games but the Allies did not let this happen. Finally, in 1949, the National Olympic Committee for Germany was founded in the Western Federal Republic of Germany. The IOC accepted it as both of the larger two larger German states. The small, French-occupied Saarland and its NOC were separate until after 1955.\n\nEast German authorities of the \"Nationales Olympisches Komitee für Ostdeutschland\" did not send their athletes to the 1952 games in an all-German team. The wanted a team of their own. This was not allowed by the IOC.\n\nEast Germany agreed to take part in the 1956 Games. German athletes from the East and West Germany took part in the games in 1956, 1960 and 1964 as the United Team of Germany. This team was just called Germany at the time.\n\nThe GDR renamed their NOC to \"Nationales Olympisches Komitee der DDR\" in 1965. It was accepted by the IOC in 1968. At this point East Germany sent its own team to the Games.

From 1976 to 1988, they won the second most medals in each of their three summer Olympics, behind the Soviet Union. They did much better than the West Germany. In five winter games, they placed second four times and first in the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\nMany think that doping (mainly anabolic steroids) allowed East Germany to a world leader in sports for two decades. They won a large number of Olympic and world gold medals but many athletes failed doping tests or were believed to be taking performance enhancing drugs. In many cases where doping was believed to happen, no proof was found so most of records and medals won by East German athletes still stand. Aside from doping, East Germany soent a lot of money on sporta - mainly Olympic sports. They did this for prestige, propaganda and rivalry with West Germany. The government did a lot of work to find and train athletes and coaches that they believed would do very well. This made it hard say that it was doping rather than very good performance that was the reason for them winning so much.\n\nIn 1990, the German reformed back into Germany. The \"NOC of the GDR\" joined the \"NOC of Germany\" on 17 November 1990. The German athletes took part in the Olympic Games in a single team again from 1992 forward. During the first decade after this, athletes from the Eastern part of Germany still won a large number of Germany's medals.

Often referred to merely as Late Baroque, the Rococo developed from the Baroque artistic movement. Whilst it kept several characteristics of the original style, including elaboration and ornate themes, it was also more playful and asymmetrical. The Rococo is associated with the reign of French king Louis XV (Louis XIV is associated with the Baroque, whilst Louis XVI with Neoclassicism, albeit his style started off as Rococo at the beginning of reign). Rococo's popularity was at its height towards the middle of the 18th century, fading out by the end in favour of Neoclassicism. \n\nRococo art and architecture was feminine, graceful, florid and ornate. Creamy and pastel-like colours were used for paintings, unlike the darker shades in Baroque art. Religion and politics were no longer necessarily the core theme of Rococo art, unlike the Baroque, and everyday life became more commonly represented. In such a way, Rococo art revolved around themes such as love, romance, fun, landscapes, and mere portraits. Additionally, Far Eastern themes became popular in Rococo, especially Chinoiserie. Famous Rococo artists include Boucher, Watteau and Fragonard, amongst several others.\n\nThe Rococo has been the focus of much discussion, analysis and criticism by art historians throughout history. It has been criticised over the years for being over-the-top, superficial and frivolous; in such a way, the term has even been used derogatively in various points of history.

It uses a magnetic field to turn the particles in the circle and the electric field to accelerate the particles. The components are carefully synchronized with the travelling particle beam. Mark Oliphant invented the proton synchrotron. Vladimir Veksler was the first to publish the idea. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron.\n\nThe synchrotron is an improvement over the cyclotron where the particles travel in a spiral pattern. A cyclotron uses a constant magnetic field and a constant-frequency applied electric field. (One of these is varied in the synchrocyclotron). Both of these fields are varied in the synchrotron to change the path from a spiral to a circle. By increasing these parameters appropriately as the particles gain energy, the diameters of the path can be held constant as the machine accelerates the particles. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin circular pipe torus. It is easier to use some straight sections between the bending magnets and some bent sections within the magnets giving the torus the shape of a round-cornered polygon. A path of large effective radius can be constructed using simple straight and curved pipe segments, unlike the disc-shaped chamber of the cyclotron type devices. The shape also requires the use of multiple magnets to bend the particle beams. Straight sections are required at spacings around a ring for both radiofrequency cavities, and in third generation setups space is allowed for insertion of energy extraction devices such as wigglers and undulators. Most synchrotrons use two types of magnets: dipole magnets to bend the particle beam and quadrupole magnets to focus the beam.\n\nThe maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the strength of the magnetic field(s) and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path. So, over time, physicist have built accelerators with bigger magnets and larger circles to reach higher particle energy levels.\nIn a cyclotron, the maximum radius is quite limited as the particles start at the center and spiral outward. So, the entire path must be a self-supporting disc-shaped vacuum chamber. Since the radius is limited, the power of the machine becomes limited by the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of an ordinary electromagnet the field strength is limited by the saturation of the core (when all magnetic domains are aligned the field may not be further increased to any practical extent). The arrangement of the single pair of magnets the full width of the device also limits the economic size of the device.\n\nSynchrotrons overcome these limitations, using a narrow beam pipe which can be surrounded by much smaller and more tightly focusing magnets. The ability of this device to accelerate particles is limited by the fact that the particles must be charged to be accelerated at all, but charged particles under acceleration emit photons (light), thereby losing energy. The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle. More powerful accelerators are built by using large radius paths and by using more numerous and more powerful microwave cavities to accelerate the particle beam between corners. Lighter particles (such as electrons) lose a larger fraction of their energy when turning. Practically speaking, the energy of electron/positron accelerators is limited by this radiation loss, while it does not play a significant role in the dynamics of proton or ion accelerators. The energy of those is limited strictly by the strength of magnets and by the cost.\n\nParticles are injected into the main ring at substantial energies by either a linear accelerator (linac) or by an intermediate synchrotron which is in turn fed by a linear accelerator. The \"linac\" is in turn fed by particles accelerated to intermediate energy by a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator.\n\nParticles are designed to leave the linac at a specified speed (\"injection velocity\") for entry into the synchrotron. The operators calculate the magnetic field strength needed to steer particles with the injection velocity on the path of the synchrotron. The operators give the electromagnets enough current to create the right amount of magnetic field strength.\n\nStarting from that initial magnetic field strength, the magnetic field is then increased. The particles pass through an electrostatic accelerator driven by a high alternating voltage. At particle speeds not close to the speed of light the frequency of the accelerating voltage can be made roughly proportional to the current in the bending magnets. A finer control of the frequency is performed by a servo loop which responds to the detection of the passing of the traveling group of particles. At particle speeds approaching light speed the frequency becomes more nearly constant, while the current in the bending magnets continues to increase. The maximum energy that can be applied to the particles (for a given ring size and magnet count) is determined by the saturation of the cores of the bending magnets (the point at which increasing current does not produce additional magnetic field). One way to obtain additional power is to make the torus larger and add additional bending magnets. This allows the amount of particle redirection at saturation to be less and so the particles can be more energetic. Another means of obtaining higher power is to use superconducting magnets, these not being limited by core saturation.\n\nWhen the particles have reached their maximum energy, they are steered out of the synchrotron and aimed at a target. Early synchrotrons used stationary targets. In order to double the energy of a collision, physicists in the 1970s began to collide two particle beams travelling in the opposite direction instead of just one beam and a stationary target. To have two beams that are travelling in the synchrontron in opposite directions, they used particles with the same mass but with the opposite sign. For example, electrons and positrons or protons and antiprotons.\n\nOne of the early large synchrotrons, now retired, is the Bevatron, constructed in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power, in the range of 6.3 GeV (then called BeV for billion electron volts; the name predates the adoption of the SI prefix giga-). A number of heavy elements, unseen in the natural world, were first created with this machine. This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced by the machine.\n\nAnother early large synchrotron is the Cosmotron built at Brookhaven National Laboratory which reached 3.3 GeV in 1953. The first Cornell University synchrotron was built before 1950 with a power of 300 MeV.\n\nUntil August 2008, the highest energy synchrotron in the world was the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in the United States. It accelerates protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collides them together. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), has roughly seven times this energy (so proton-proton collisions occur at roughly 14 TeV). It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built. The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions (such as lead) up to an energy of 1.15 PeV.\n\nThe largest device of this type seriously proposed was the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), which was to be built in Texas. This design, like others, used superconducting magnets which allow more intense magnetic fields to be created without the limitations of core saturation. Its planned ring circumference was 87.1 kilometres (54.1 mi) with an energy of 20 TeV per beam of protons. Construction was begun in 1991 but later cancelled in 1994. The project had been poorly managed. Some people say that the end of the Cold War resulted in a change of scientific funding priorities that contributed to its ultimate cancellation.\n\nWhile there is still potential for yet more powerful proton and heavy particle cyclic accelerators, it appears that the next step up in electron beam energy must avoid losses due to synchrotron radiation. This will require a return to the linear accelerator, but with devices significantly longer than those currently in use. There is at present a major effort to design and build the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will consist of two opposing linear accelerators, one for electrons and one for positrons. These will collide at a total center of mass energy of 0.5 TeV.\n\nHowever, synchrotron radiation also has a wide range of applications (see synchrotron light) and many 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotrons have been built especially to harness it. The largest of those 3rd generation synchrotron light sources are the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) near Chicago, USA, and SPring-8 in Japan, accelerating electrons up to 6, 7 and 8 GeV, respectively.\n\nSynchrotrons which are useful for cutting edge research are large machines, costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to construct, and each beamline (there may be 20 to 50 at a large synchrotron) costs another two or three million dollars on average. These installations are mostly built by the science funding agencies of governments of developed countries, or by collaborations between several countries in a region, and operated as infrastructure facilities available to scientists from universities and research organisations throughout the country, region, or world. More compact models, however, have been developed, such as the Compact Light Source.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "319345", "title": "Synchrotron"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319362", "text": "System of linear equations\n\nIn mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables. \n\nMathematicians show the relationship between different factors in the form of equations. \"Linear equations\" mean the variable appears only once in each equation without being raised to a power. A \"system\" of linear equations means that all of the equations are true at the same time. So, the person solving the system of equations is looking for the values of each variable that will make all of the equations true at the same time. If no such values can satisfy all of the equations in the system, then the equations are called \"inconsistent.\"\n\nFor example,\nis a system of three equations in the three variables formula_2, formula_3, formula_4. A \"solution\" to a linear system is an assignment of numbers to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A solution to the system above is given by\nsince it makes all three equations valid:\n\nIn mathematics, the theory of linear systems is a branch of linear algebra, a subject which is fundamental to modern mathematics. Computer algorithms for finding the solutions are an important part of numerical linear algebra, and such methods play a prominent role in engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science, and economics. A system of non-linear equations can often be approximated by a linear system (see linearization), a helpful technique when making a mathematical model, computer model, or computer simulation of a relatively complex system. For complex systems, there are many equations and many variables, not just two or three. In many cases, the number of equations and variables in the system are the same. In some cases, there are more variables than equations, and the solution will be a range of different values rather than one exact solution.\n\nThe simplest kind of linear system involves two equations and two variables:\nOne method for solving such a system is as follows. First, solve the top equation for formula_2 in terms of formula_3:\nNow substitute this expression for \"x\" into the bottom equation:\nThis results in a single equation involving only the variable formula_3. Solving gives formula_13, and substituting this back into the equation for formula_2 yields formula_15:\nThis method generalizes to systems with additional variables.\n\nVery often, all the coefficients are written in the form of a matrix A, which is called a coefficient matrix.\nIn much the same way, the variables can be written in the form of a vector:\nThis makes it possible to write \nMathematically, the vector defined above is a 1-by-n matrix. The system of equations can then be solved using the multiplication operation defined on matrices. A, x and b are all part of the same algebraic field.\n\nThere a three cases when looking for solutions to a system of linear equations:\n\nThere are two categories of methods for solving a system of linear equations. Iterative methods use many steps to get a solution, direct methods only need one step:\nExamples for iterative methods are:\n\nThere are examples such as geodesy where there many more measurements than unknowns. Such a system is almost always overdetermined and has no exact solution. Each measurement is usually inaccurate and includes some amount of error. Since the measurements are not exact, it is not possible to obtain an exact solution to the system of linear equations; methods such as Least squares can be used to compute a solution that best fits the overdetermined system. This least squares solution can often be used as a stand-in for an exact solution. \n\nSolving a system of linear equations has a complexity of at most O (n). At least n operations are needed to solve a general system of n linear equations. The best algorithm known to date was developed by Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd and dates from 1990. It has a complexity of n Unfortunately, it is of little practical use.\n\nUsing computers to solve systems of linear equations is used every day. For example, it is used in weather forecasting models. Hot dog factories use it to make small changes in the receipe as food ingredient prices change. College cafeterias use it to figure out how much food to cook based on past experience when the cafeteria gives students the choice between multiple entrees.\n\n\n", "id": "319362", "title": "System of linear equations"}

A group of economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson), attempted to interpret and formalize Keynes' writings, and to synthesize it with the neo-classical models of economics. This model, the IS/LM model, is nearly as influential as Keynes' original analysis in determining actual policy and economics education. It relates aggregate demand and employment to three variables, that is, the amount of money in circulation, the government budget, and the state of business expectations. This model was very popular with economists after World War II because it could be understood in terms of general equilibrium theory. Their work has become known as the neo-classical synthesis. It created the models that formed the core ideas of neo-Keynesian economics. These ideas dominated mainstream economics in the post-war period, and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.\n\nIn the 1970s a series of developments occurred that shook neo-Keynesian theory. The developed world suffered from slow economic growth and high inflation at the same time (stagflation). Also, the work of monetarists like Milton Friedman cast doubt on neo-Keynesian theories. The result was a series of new ideas to bring tools to Keynesian analysis that would be capable of explaining the economic events of the 1970s. The next great wave of Keynesian thinking began with the attempt to give Keynesian macroeconomic reasoning a microeconomic basis. The new Keynesians helped create a \"new neo-classical synthesis\" that currently forms the mainstream of macroeconomic theory. Following the emergence of the new Keynesian school, neo-Keynesians have sometimes been referred to as Old-Keynesians.\n", "id": "319400", "title": "Neo-Keynesian economics"}

Johnson Museum of Art (\"The Johnson Museum\") is an art museum in Ithaca, New York. It is in the Arts Quad on the main campus of Cornell University. It is best known for its unusual concrete facade. The museum has more than 32,000 pieces of art. Each year, over 80,000 people go to the museum. It shows over 20 special exhibitions each year.\nCornell president Deane Waldo Malott started the University Art Museum in 1953. The A. D. White House was changed to hold Cornell's art collections. The current museum was built in 1973. It is named after Herbert Fisk Johnson, Jr.. Johnson was head of S.C. Johnson & Sons of Racine, Wisconsin (\"Johnson Wax\"). He was a former member of the university's Board of Trustees. He graduated in 1922. His son also served as a trustee.\n\nThe Johnson Museum of Art was designed by architect I.M. Pei. Many people say it looks like a sewing machine from the side. Its fifth floor bridges over the open aired sculpture garden. It was made so that it would not block the view of Cayuga Lake. It has a very good view of the lake from its north and west sides. It also has a room for meetings on the sixth floor. This room was used for many years by Cornell's Board of Trustees.\n\nThe location of the museum caused many architectural problems. There was a limited amount of space to build. Also, the building could not have a large affect on the view of the lake or the Arts Quad. It is also located on the knoll where tradition said Ezra Cornell chose the site for his university, at the north end of the Stone Row of Morrill, McGraw, and White Halls. The design wanted to visually anchor the north end of Library Slope. The final design was a narrow tower and a bridge. Critics have said it looks like a giant sewing machine.\n\nOne part of the design, which was never built, was an underground Asian art gallery. It would have included windows that opened into the Southern face of Fall Creek Gorge.\n\nThe building was awarded the American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1975. The building's design was used on the cover of \"Scientific American\" as an early example of computer graphics.\n\nIn 2011, a new wing opened to help hold the museum's increasing collection. The new part mirrored the plans drawn up by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. The architect in charge was John L. Sullivan III. He graduated Cornell in 1962. The project cost $22 million. This included some changes to the main building. The money for the project came from large grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Kresge Foundation. The Asian art storage area was moved from the center of the fifth floor to the lower level of the section. This allows them to make the public gallery space on the fifth floor larger. Galleries in the new wing will be used to show contemporary art. The upper level of the new section includes an outdoor Japanese garden. The plans wanted a tunnel under Campus Road to be added. It would have gone through the wall of the Fall Creek gorge. This was not done because of environmental issues.\n\nThe permanent collection has more than 32,000 works of art. Most notable is the George and Mary Rockwell Asian Art collection. There are also a large number of works by American artists. These artist include Stuart Davis and Robert Rauschenberg. There is also many works by members of the Hudson River School and the American Impressionists to contemporary art. The Collection of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs has more than 15,000 works. These include works by Berenice Abbott, Robert Frank, Alfred Stieglitz, and Garry Winogrand. The fifth floor observation level holds the museum's large Asian collection. The permanent collection also includes works from Africa, pre-Columbian America, and Oceania. It range from ancient to contemporary societies. Its collection has two windows from Frank Lloyd Wright's Darwin D. Martin House.\n\nClasses for credit are taught by Cornell's academic departments, not by the museum. The museum does work with the teachers. It has gallery sessions for some classes. It also has gallery tours and course-related exhibitions that are run by the faculty. The museum also hosts thematic tours for local school student field trips. Over 7,000 schoolchildren go to the museum each year. The Johnson Museum Club is a Cornell student group that promotes student awareness of the Johnson Museum's collections, exhibitions, and resources. It hosts concerts, scavenger hunts and other events.\n\n", "id": "319432", "title": "Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art"}

Also, the phrase may mean the pre-planned process through which a leader takes over from another because of death, resignation, or removal\n\nSuccession becomes a chronology which has developed during time which has passed—like a list of popes or list of Emperors of Japan.\n\nSuccession histories are unique, but not always obvious. For example, Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611) was only the third Swedish king named Charles.\n\nPope Francis is the 266th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church. Saint Peter is listed as the first of 266 popes.\n\nAcross the span of centuries, there have been problems with the list and order of succession after St. Peter. For example: During the Western schism in the 14th century, there was more than one pope at the same time. Each had notable international support. Only some are included on the chronology of today's list.\nAt that time, European leaders had to choose to support one pope or the other. \n\nAkihito is the 125th Emperor of Japan. Emperor Jimmu is listed as the first of 125 emperors.\n\nAcross time, there have been difficulties with the list and order of succession after Jimmu. For example: During the Nanboku-chō period in the 14th century, there was more than one emperor at the same time. Each had notable support. Only some are included in today's list\n\nFor 500 years, the Imperial chronology included Emperor Kōgon, Emperor Kōmyō, Emperor Sukō, Emperor Go-Kōgon and Emperor Go-En'yū. In the 19th century, these men were removed from the list. At the same time, Emperor Go-Murakami, Emperor Chōkei and Emperor Go-Kameyama were added.\n\nThe \"order of succession\" or \"line of succession\" is a formal plan which determines who inherits a future role or a position in a hierarchy after death or other cause creates a vacancy or an opportunity for succession.\n\nMany countries have developed formal succession planning. In contrast, Kim Jong-il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea selected his youngest son as the \"Dear Successor\" or \"Great Successor\". The process which led to this choice is not known.\n\nIn some countries including Sweden since 1980, the Netherlands since 1983, Norway since 1990, Belgium since 1991, Denmark since 2009, and the United Kingdom since 2015, the eldest child of a monarch is expected to become the next monarch. This is known as \"full\" or \"equal\" as primogeniture.\n\nIn many countries including Spain and Japan, special preference is given to male children. This is known as \"male primogeniture.\"\n\nIn the United States, the line of succession is explained in the \"Presidential Succession Act of 1947\". If the president cannot fullfil his duties, the Vice President is expected to take his place; and then the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is next.\n", "id": "319442", "title": "Order of succession"}

The radiation can be artificially produced for scientific and technical purposes by specialized particle accelerators, typically by accelerating electrons. Once the high-energy electron beam has been generated, it is directed into auxiliary components such as bending magnets and insertion devices (undulators or wigglers) in storage rings and free-electron lasers. \nThese supply the strong magnetic fields perpendicular to the beam which are needed to convert the high-energy electron energy into light or some other form of electronmagnetic radiation.\n\nSynchrotron radiation may occur in accelerators either as a nuisance in particle physics experiments, or on purpose for many laboratory uses.\nElectrons are accelerated to high speeds in several stages to achieve a final energy that can be in the GeV range. In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), proton bunches also produce the radiation at increasing amplitude and frequency as they accelerate in the vacuum field, making photoelectrons. The photoelectrons then make secondary electrons from the pipe walls with increasing frequency and density up to 7x10. Each proton may lose 6.7keV per turn due to this phenomenon. So, both electron synchrotrons and proton synchrotrons can be a light source.\n\nThe major applications of synchrotron light are in condensed matter physics, materials science, biology and medicine. Many experiments using synchrotron light probe the structure of matter from the sub-nanometer level of electronic structure to the micrometer and millimeter level. This is important in medical imaging. An example of a practical industrial application is the manufacturing of microstructures by the Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding (LIGA) process.\n\n", "id": "319446", "title": "Synchrotron light source"}

The difference is that the discs are rotated by a key instead of a dial.\n\nWhen the key is put into the lock, it rotates a set of discs with notches on them to different positions depending on the depth of the cuts in the key. The right key will line up a set of notches in a straight line, allowing a bar to fall into the notches, opening the lock. The wrong key will not put the notches in a straight line, and the bar will not fall, preventing the lock from opening. On high-end disc-detainer locks (such as Abloy), there are usually \"false\" notches on the disc as well. These feel like the real notch to someone trying to pick the lock, but do not allow the bar to fall. This makes it nearly impossible to pick the lock.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=319599", "text": "Black powder rocket motor\n\nA black powder rocket motor pushes a model rocket using black powder. Black powder in the rockets is made of charcoal, sulphur, and potassium nitrate. The amount of each part can be changed to change how fast the black powder burns. The black powder burns very fast. The hot gases move fast as they leave the back of the rocket. This pushes the rocket forward.\n\nBlack powder rocket motors were made in a simple form by the Chinese. They were first written about in the early 13th century. The rocket motors have gotten better over the years. They have several uses. Some can be used as weapons. Some have cameras to take pictures from a height to get information. Some are also used just for fun.\n\nBlack powder rocket motors are only made in small sizes. If they are bigger there is a bigger chance of exploding. They also do not perform as well if they are bigger. They are made in different sizes called classes. The classes are 1/4 A through E. If the motor needs to be bigger than this, a different type of fuel is used. This is called a composite fuel. Some examples of composite fuels are ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate.\n\nBlack powder is the oldest type of mixed rocket fuel. It was used in rockets even before it was used in guns. The three main parts of black powder are charcoal, sulphur, and saltpetre (or potassium nitrate). The Chinese were making black powder as early as 1045, which is about 1000 years ago. In the early thirteenth century (about 800 years ago) the Chinese turned black powder into a way to power weapons. Before that it was only used for fun. The first recorded use of rockets as military weapons was in 1232. The Chinese ‘arrows of fire’ were fired from a sort of catapult. The black powder was packed in a closed tube that had a hole in one end for escaping hot gases. The tube was mounted on a long stick so it was more balanced.\n\nBlack powder had a very low specific impulse. The way rockets were made got more advanced, but only on paper. People had not really built a much better rocket yet. They only had ideas and sketches of better models. In 1591 a Belgian, Jean Beavie, wrote about and drew the important idea of rockets that had more than one stage. This is called Multistaging. This means that the fuel is burned through in more than one step. This is the answer to escaping earth’s gravity and going into space.\n\nBy 1600, rockets were being used in some parts of Europe. They were used against cavalry, which is a group of fighting soldiers on horseback. By 1688, rockets weighing over 120 pounds had been built and fired in Germany. These German rockets could carry 16-pound warheads.\n\nDuring the late 1700s, a London lawyer, Sir William Congreve, wanted to try to make rockets better. He did many experiments with different fuels and cases. His experiments were careful and orderly. He improved how far rockets could go, how stable they were, and how accurate they were. The British army used Congreve's new rockets to help them in the Napoleonic wars.\n\nIn 1939 researchers at the California Institute of Technology were trying to make a motor to help launch aircraft. They mixed black powder with common road asphalt to make the first composite motor. This was the beginning of the composite motor. It also ended the use of black powder for big rockets.\n\nBlack powder rocket propellant is a lot like old fashioned gunpowder. It has one different part called a binder. The binder is usually a substance called Dextrin. One common model rocket engine company is Estes Industries. Their motors are made with black powder propellant. Black powder propellant must be pressed very tightly to work well. If it is not packed tightly, it will burn too fast and might explode. A simple way of combining the parts to make black powder rocket propellant is: 75% potassium nitrate, 10% sulphur, and 15% charcoal. This is the most common way of making it. Dextrin may be added as a binder (usually between 0 and 5%). Extra (coarse) charcoal or metal powders (5 - 10%) may be added to make a spark trail. Adding these extras might change how fast the fuel burns.\n\nThrust is how hard of a push the rocket produces. Burn time is how long the fuel in the motor takes to burn while pushing gases out of the back of the rocket. The impulse of a rocket motor is the area under the thrust-time curve. This means the impulse is a number for how much force the rocket makes and for how long. The impulse of a black powder motor is used to tell what size class it is in. Motors are divided into classes from 1/4A to E. These classes hold rockets with impulses from 0 to 40 Ns (Newtons*seconds). Other kinds of model rocket motors can be named up to an ‘H’, which is up to 320 Ns.\n\nFigures from tests of Estes rocket motors are used in the following examples of rocket motor performance.\n\nFor miniature black powder rocket motors (13 mm diameter), the maximum thrust is between 5 and 12 N, the total impulse is between .5 and 2.2 Ns, and the burn time is between .25 and 1 second. For Estes ‘regular size’ rocket motors (18 mm diameter), there are three classes: A, B, and C. The A class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 9.5 and 9.75 N, a total impulse between 2.1 and 2.3 Ns, and a burn time between .5 and .75 seconds. The B class 18 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 12.15 and 12.75 N, a total impulse between 4.2 and 4.35 Ns, and a burn time between .85 and 1 second. The C class 18mm motors have a maximum thrust from 14 – 14.15 N, a total impulse between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between 1.85 and 2 seconds.\n\nThere are also 3 classes included in Estes large (24 mm diameter) rocket motors: C, D, and E. The C class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 21.6 and 21.75 N, a total impulse of between 8.8 and 9 Ns, and a burn time between .8 and .85 seconds. The D class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 29.7 and 29.8 N, a total impulse between 16.7 and 16.85 Ns, and a burn time between 1.6 and 1.7 seconds. The E class 24 mm motors have a maximum thrust between 19.4 and 19.5 N, a total impulse between 28.45 and 28.6 Ns, and a burn time between 3 and 3.1 seconds.\n\n", "id": "319599", "title": "Black powder rocket motor"}

It is also a ward within the council constituency of Selly Oak and home to the Bournville Centre for Visual Arts. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has claimed that it is \"one of the nicest places to live in Britain\".\n\nOriginally the area that was to become Bournville consisted of a few scattered farmsteads and cottages, linked by winding country lanes, with the only visual highlight being the Georgian built Bournbrook Hall.\n\nThe bluebell glades of Stocks Wood were said to be a relic of the Forest of Arden and there are Roman remains nearby.\n\nHaving taken over their father John Cadbury's expanding business in 1861, the Quakers George and Richard Cadbury needed to move their cocoa and chocolate factory from Bridge Street in central Birmingham to a greenfield site to allow for expansion.\n\nCadbury were reliant on the canals for milk delivery, and on the railways for cocoa deliveries from the ports of London and Southampton. They therefore need a site which was undeveloped and had easy access to both canal and rail. The brothers noticed the proposed development of the Birmingham West Suburban Railway, which would extend from central Birmingham south along the path of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal into the then green fields of southern Birmingham and the villages of northern Worcestershire.\n\nIn 1879, they moved their business to Bournbrook Hall, to the south of Birmingham. The location was chosen as it was regarded as cleaner, healthier and more amenable to longer-term expansion plans. Although rural, it was also already serviced by the new Stirchley Street railway station, which itself was located right next to the canal.\n\nThe Cadburys named the area 'Bournville' after the Bourn Brook (now known as The Bourn); with 'ville' being French for 'town', this set Bournville apart from the local area (some people wrongly believe Bournville was originally known as Bournbrook - Bournbrook exists as a separate area to the north of Bournville). Then Cadburys began to develop their factory in the new suburb. Loyal and hard-working workers were treated with great respect and relatively high wages and good working conditions; Cadbury also pioneered pension schemes, joint works committees and a full staff medical service.\n\nIn 1893, George Cadbury bought 120 acres (0.5 km²) of land close to the works and planned, at his own expense, a model village which would 'alleviate the evils of modern more cramped living conditions'. By 1900, the estate included 313 cottages and houses set on of land, and many more similar properties were built in the years leading up to the World War I, with smaller developments taking place later on in the 20th century. These almost 'Arts and crafts' houses were traditional in design but with large gardens and modern interiors, and were designed by the resident architect William Alexander Harvey. These designs became a blueprint for many other model village estates around Britain. It is also noteworthy that, because George Cadbury was a temperance Quaker, no public houses have ever been built in Bournville although, since the late 1940s, there has been a licensed members' bar at Rowheath Pavilion.\nThe Cadburys were particularly concerned with the health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built in accordance with the instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924. At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically for the benefit of the Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury's also built the Bournville indoor swimming baths on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for 'girls' and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nIn 1900, the Bournville Village Trust was set up to formally control the development of the estate, independently of George Cadbury or the Cadbury company. The trust focused on providing schools, hospitals, museums, public baths and reading rooms. As Bournville is a conservation area, another job of the Bournville Village Trust is to accept or reject plans for building extension and modification.\n\nAn almost campus feel evolved, with a triangular village green, infant and junior schools, the School of Art and the Day Continuation School (originally intended for young Cadbury employees) and a host of events such as fêtes and Maypole dances. The carillon and a Quaker meeting house are also beside the village green.\n\nThe trust continues to exercise an international influence on housing and town planning generally. Now containing 7,800 homes on 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land with 100 acres (0.4 km²) of parks and open spaces, Bournville remains a popular residential area of Birmingham.\n\nCadbury is still one of Birmingham's main employers, making all manner of chocolate products.\n\nThe dark chocolate Bournville Plain is now manufactured in France and sold in the UK.\n\nCadbury also named their brand of malted drinks Bournvita after Bournville.\n\nThe ward is served by three councillors, all of whom are Conservative; Bill Evans, Nigel Dawkins and Timothy Huxtable.\n\nBournville has adopted a Ward Support Officer with the current holder of the title being Karen Stevens.\n\n\n", "id": "319741", "title": "Bournville"}

Its difference from ethnography is the high degree of subjectivity that is introduced to the study, and the fact that the perspective of the author shows personal involvement with the subject much more than participant observation invites.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, auto-ethnography has been gaining impact and is being used more and more. However, it still constitutes an issue of controversy and is, sometimes, criticized because of its individualistic and subjective nature, which is seen as potentially undermining of its scientific credibility. That is, the author’s personal involvement with the events and society he/she describes and analyzes is sometimes considered as something that clouds his/her objectivity. It remains, however, questionable whether auto-ethnography should be judged on the same terms as traditional ethnography, as one may argue that they have different purposes altogether, and that a subjective point of view is advantageous and what auto-ethnography has to add to traditional methods.\n\nMaréchal defines auto-ethnography as “a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing”. In the 1970s it was more simply defined as “insider ethnography”, referring to the fact that the group of study is the ethnographer’s own.\n\nThe most significant element that auto-ethnography introduces to the study of culture and society is the shift from a depersonalized, “seen from a vantage point” and neutrally distanced narrative to a storyline with which the audience can engage morally, aesthetically, and intellectually, and, thus, co-participate in the events described. Especially for ethnographers who use multiple informants, auto-ethnography introduces an alternative way of writing where “the distinction between ethnographer and ‘others’ is unclear”, thereby challenging “imposed identities and boundaries”.\n\nHowever, auto-ethnographers should avoid some dangerous pitfalls that could undermine the credibility and usefulness of their work. Chang identifies the following: \"(1) excessive focus on self in isolation from others; (2) overemphasis on narration rather than analysis and cultural interpretation; (3) exclusive reliance on personal memory and recalling as a data source; (4) negligence of ethical standards regarding others in self-narratives; and (5) inappropriate application of the label autoethnography\".\n\n", "id": "319886", "title": "Auto-ethnography"}

Rites of passage celebrate and protect the person or people who are changing. They communicate shared ideas of socially expectable behavior and responsibility, and they signify the transformation from one social status (e.g. coming of age), place (e.g. crossing a national border), condition (e.g. recovering from sickness), time (e.g. celebrating the new year), to the next.\n\nThe French social scientist Arnold van Gennep (23 April 1873 – 7 May 1957) most famously defined the concept of rites of passage in his book \"\" (\"The Rites of Passage\"), first published in 1909. Van Gennep studied ethnographic reports from various parts of the world that described rites of passage. He concluded that they are universally structured even if the rites of passage themselves differ significantly in character between societies and cultures.\n\nRites of passage are ordered into three phases.\n\n\nBy acknowledging the various ways different societies and cultures perform rites of passage we observe cultural diversity. Learning about rites of passage cross culturally can help us to understand others and ourselves. An awareness of cultural diversity is essential to form an open-minded, tolerant and accepting view of people who are not from the same society or culture as our own.\n", "id": "319901", "title": "Rites of passage"}

The term totem comes from an Ojibwe word meaning “a relative of mine”. It was first written about in 1791 by a trader, James Long. It has been recorded across native tribes of America, Africa and Australia. It has been the subject of much research into ethnic groups. Usually, totems of a kinship group will be animals or plants. They will be represented in sacred objects and will belong exclusively to them.\n\nTotemism was considered a primitive religion by many European thinkers in the 1800s. It was thought to be related to beliefs about food and incest taboos. In 1869, John Ferguson McLennan said that \"there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief\". Early thinkers had the idea that beliefs in totemism came from indiginous clans being uneducated about the difference between humans and animals. This is not still talked about as true in modern discussions on totemism.\n\nTotem poles are carved with symbols on large trees, mostly cedar or spruce, by native northwest North American clans. Totem poles are also found in Alaska. They are not for worship, but early missionaries had them burned down. This was a mistake because the poles just tell stories about the clan they belong to. Eagles or ravens are carved at the highest level. Lower down the pole are carved beavers, foxes, bears and frogs. A carving of a person is located on top. He is the watchman, who warns about approaching danger in the village.\n\nÉmile Durkheim said in 1915 that totemism was just a way of thinking about groups in society. Durkheim decided this because he spent time working with Aboriginal Australian clans. Each clan had its own totem, which could be any natural feature such as animals, plants or rivers. These totems and symbols of them were worshiped and protected. This was because only as long as the totem was healthy would the clan stay healthy. Durkheim decided that the worship of the totems was a type of self-worship for the clan. \n\nClaude Lévi-Strauss published \"Totemism\" in 1962. In this book he says that totemism is a way that humans tend to classify people into similar groups. Once a population has made rules like exogamy (marrying outside the group) it becomes important to keep the clan different from others. But humans themselves do not have different features like wolves or birds do, so giving the identity of an animal to the clan makes its member distinctly different. This makes social boundaries.\n\n", "id": "319907", "title": "Totemism"}

However, there is no exact, universally agreed, definition of the term \"discrete mathematics.\" Many times, discrete mathematics is described less by what is included than by what is excluded: continuously varying quantities and related notions.\n\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deals with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\n\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in discrete steps and store data in discrete bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. In turn, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems, such as in operations research.\n\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from continuous mathematics are often employed as well.\n\n", "id": "319970", "title": "Discrete mathematics"}

In 2010, the number of people recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 56,315. It is the county seat of Marion County, and the principal city of the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in the 2010 census had a population of 331,298.\n\nOcala is found near the old site of Ocale or Ocali, a major Timucua village and chiefdom during the 16th century. The city of Ocala today borrowed the name from the village. The name is believed to mean \"Big Hammock\" in the Timucua language. Hernando de Soto passed through Ocale during his famous journey through what is today the southeastern United States in 1539. Ocale is not mentioned in any later accounts; it seems to have been abandoned in the wake of de Soto's attack.\n\nIn 1827 the U.S. army outpost of Fort King was built near the current site of Ocala as a buffer between Seminoles and white settlers. The fort saw service during the Second Seminole War and was later used as the first courthouse for Marion County in 1844. Fort King was the beginning of the current city of Ocala, which was established in 1846. Greater Ocala is known as the \"Kingdom of the Sun\". Rail service reached Ocala in June 1881, encouraging economic development. Two years later, much of the Ocala downtown area was destroyed by a fire on Thanksgiving Day, 1883. Buildings were rebuilt with brick, granite and steel rather than lumber. By 1888, Ocala was known state-wide as \"The Brick City\".\n\nIn December 1890, the Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, an early version of the Populist Party held its national meeting in Ocala. At the meeting, the Alliance adopted a platform that would become known as the \"Ocala Demands\". This platform included removal of national banks, low interest government loans, free and limitless coinage of silver, reclamation of excess railroad lands taken by the government, a graduated income tax, and direct election of United States senators. Most of the \"Ocala Demands\" were to become part of the Populist Party platform.\n\nOcala was an important center of citrus production until the Great Freeze of 1894-1895.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Ocala increased in fame as a center for tourism in Florida. Important attractions included the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, Wild Waters water park, and the now-defunct Western-themed Six Gun Territory, all in nearby Silver Springs, Florida. (See Six Gun Territory Gallery.) Silver Springs is a nature theme park that surrounds the headwaters of the Silver River, the largest artesian spring formation in the world.\n\nThe first thoroughbred horse farm in Florida was created by Carl G. Rose in 1943. Earlier, in 1916, Rose had come to Florida from Indiana to oversee the first asphalt road ever constructed in the state. When he ran into problems with the asphalt, he tried to work with one of Florida's abundant resources: limestone. He also realized that the limestone would be a good source of nutrition for raising strong horses, so he took a gamble in 1943 and bought acreage along State Highway 200 at $10 per acre, which became Rosemere Farm. The next year one of his horses, Gornil, won at Miami's Tropical Park, making him the first Florida-raised thoroughbred to win a Florida race. Close on Rose's heels, the entrepreneur Bonnie Heath soon set up his own thoroughbred horse farm and produced the state's first Kentucky Derby winner. Both of these men have major highways named after them in Ocala. Bonnie Heath Farm is now owned and operated by his son Bonnie Heath, III, and his wife Kim. Rosemere Farm was sold long ago, and Ocala's Paddock Mall and Central Florida College were built on the site.\n\nIn 1956, the Ocala area Thoroughbred market received a raise when Needles became the first Florida-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. In 1978, Marion County-bred and -raised Affirmed won the Triple Crown. Today, Marion County is one of the major thoroughbred centers of the world, with over 1,200 horse farms in total and about 900 thoroughbred farms totaling some . Ocala is well known as the horse capital of the world, one of only five cities (four in the USA and one in France) allowed under Chamber of Commerce guidelines to use this title based on yearly money produced by the horse industry. There are some 44,000 jobs created by the breeding, training and related support brought about by the horse industry that generates over $2.2 billion in yearly money. Ocala and \"Postime Farms\" also support one of the biggest horse shows in the country. H.I.T.S or \"Horses in the Sun\" is a Dressage/Jumper event lasting about two months and brings with it some 6 to 7 million dollars to the local Marion county economy each year. There are over 100 different breeds aside from thoroughbreds including the Tennessee Walker, Paso Fino, Morgans, SaddleBreds, Drafts, and the American Quarter Horse. Other horse events in the area include cowboy mounted shooting by the Florida Outlaws, as well as endurance rides, barrel races, \"extreme\" cowboy events, jumper shows, trick shows, parades, draft pulls, and more.\n\nOcala began undergoing rapid growth in the 1970s with the development of the Interstate 75 and the founding of Disney World, located some southeast.\n\nIn the last decades of the twentieth century, the greater Ocala area experienced one of the highest growth rates in the country for a city its size. The population of Marion County in 2000 was over 250,000, up from under 100,000 in 1975. Much of the county's growth is attributable to the area's growing popularity as a retirement destination, primarily in two areas southwest and south of the city: the SR 200 corridor and The Villages, respectively.\nMany historic homes are preserved in Ocala's large housing Historic District, established in 1984. A focus of this district is East Fort King Street, featuring many excellent examples of Victorian architecture. Ocala structures on the National Register of Historic Places include the Coca Cola Building, the E. C. Smith House, East Hall, the Marion Hotel, Mount Zion A.M.E. Church, the Ritz Historic Inn, and Union Train Station.\n\nThe original Fort King site itself was called a National Historic Landmark in 2004.\n\nOcala is governed by a five member board of councilors and a mayor, all of which are chosen without caring about their party. Its charter was written in the council-manager form, leaving the mayor with few powers other than refusing legislation passed by the council and tending to some duties involving the police department. The city manager handles most leadership and money issues. Although a small majority of the city's voters are Democrats, Ocala's politics match those of the rest of Marion County in that all of its elected legislators - with one exception - are registered Republicans. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain carried both the city and the county, the second one by a landslide, even though they lost Florida as a whole to Barack Obama by a narrow margin.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The surrounding farms are famous for their thoroughbred horses, in terrain similar to Kentucky bluegrass. Ocala is also known for nearby Silver Springs, Florida, site of one of the largest artesian spring formations in the world and Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, one of the earliest tourist attractions in Florida.\n\nThe long Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida until it joins the St. Johns River near Palatka, Florida.\n\nMarion County is also home to the Ocala National Forest which was established in 1908 and is now the second largest national forest in the state. The Florida Trail, also known as the Florida National Scenic Trail, cuts through Ocala National Forest.\n\nSilver River State Park was established in the early 1990s to preserve the areas around the Silver River to the east of Ocala near Silver Springs.\n\nOcala has two main seasons: the dry season (October–May) and the wet season (June–September). During the dry season, there is almost endless sunshine with very little rain. In January, the morning low temperatures are often in the 30s and 40s, but the cloudless sunny weather typically warms the dry air up to near 70 by the afternoon. During the wet season, afternoon thunderstorms are a daily thing. These storms are often severe (unofficially, Ocala is known to have more cloud-to-ground lightning per square mile than any other city in the world). The typical morning low temperatures during the wet season are in the 70's and typical daytime high temperatures are in the 90s. Due to the city being relatively far away from the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Ocala's summertime temperatures are often the highest in the state while winter temperatures are often the lowest compared to other cities on the peninsula. Also, Ocala's distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico means the city has more days of sunshine than Florida's coastal cities. This is, in part, why the Ocala/Marion County area is called \"the kingdom of the sun.\" The last snowfall of any significance fell on December 24, 1989, when the city was struck by an ice and snow storm. However, the morning of January 9, 2010, there was a dusting of snow on the ground in city center. A plume of record cold air mixed with moisture caused wintry precipitation to erupt across northern and central Florida.\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 56,315 people, 23,103 households, and 13,456 families residing in the city. There were 26,764 housing units, of which 23,103 were occupied (86.3%). The racial makeup of the city was 70.7% White, 20.9% African American, 0.3% Native American, 2.6% Asian, 2.9% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.7% of the population. \n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $30,888, and the median income for a family was $38,190. Males had a median income of $29,739 versus $24,367 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,021. About 13.2% of families and 18.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.6% of those under age 18 and 9.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\nOcala is the headquarters of Emergency One, a worldwide designer and manufacturer of fire rescue vehicles.\n\nOcala is home to the College of Central Florida. It also has one of 21 campuses of Rasmussen College, an Higher Learning Commission regionally accredited post secondary institution.\n\nOcala is home to Trinity Catholic High School, which holds the record for the longest high school football championship game in Florida history, going into triple overtime.\non January 6, 2011, the mayor declared January 6 as Trinity Catholic Celtics Day, in honor of this feat.\n\nOcala, Florida was home Belleview Bulldogs in the FCSL before it folded in 2008. It is also home to one of the largest youth football leagues in the state in the MCYFL. Ocala is hosting the regional events for the Junior League in the Little League World Series in August 2010.\n\nIn 1995, Ocala was named an All-America City Award winner.\n\nOcala has two sister cities:\n\nSeveral major highways pass through Ocala, including Interstate 75, U.S. Highway 27, U.S. Route 301, and U.S. Highway 441. Ocala was on the western leg of the historic Dixie Highway.\n\n\nOcala International Airport provides general aviation services to the community. Ocala Suntran provides bus service throughout select parts of the city. One of the major hubs for Suntran is the former Ocala Union Station, which served Amtrak trains until November 2004.\n\nOcala is the home for the Ocala Symphony Orchestra. The Ocala Symphony Orchestra, Inc., a non-profit organization, began in 1975, when a group of musicians and citizens set out to create a symphonic orchestra for the area. In the fall of 1976 a four-concert subscription season was initiated - a format that continues to this day. The Ocala Symphony Orchestra was later incorporated in the State of Florida and recognized by the IRS as a 501c3 non-profit corporation.\n\nAlso, the Ocala Civic Theatre is located in Ocala, and it presents professional-quality, live productions at an affordable price. Ocala Civic Theatre produces more than twelve fully staged productions each season, in addition to hosting touring companies. The Theatre offers a year-round education program that reaches over 1000 students each year. Both skills classes and performance classes are offered to students ages 4–18. This volunteer-based organization is one of the largest community theaters in the state and serves more than 50,000 Marion, Citrus and Lake County residents each season.\n\n", "id": "320005", "title": "Ocala, Florida"}

It was built from 1987 to 1993. 210 scientists and staff currently work there.\n\nThe ALS is a national user facility. The ALS makes intense light for scientific and technological research. It is one of the world's brightest sources of ultraviolet and soft x-ray beams. Each year over 2000 researchers go to the ALS from universities, industries, and government laboratories around the world. ALS is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences.\n\nThe ALS has over forty beamlines. They do a wide range of science at the same time as each other. Any qualified scientist can ask to use the ALS beamlines. Proposals are reviewed by others. The proposals which most people agree on are allowed to use the ALS. The ALS does not charge money to use if the user's research is made public.\n\nThe Advanced Light Source's current director is Roger Falcone.\n\nPhysicists in Berkeley California began working on accelerating subatomic particles in the 1920s. In 1929, Ernest O. Lawrence built the first cyclotron to accelerate subatomic particles. During World War II, a laboratory there was a part of the Manhattan Project. They were given money from the military. In 1942, Lawrence hired Arthur Brown, Jr. (designer of the Coit Tower in San Francisco) to design a new round building to hold Lawrence's new 4.67 m (184 in) cyclotron. That building, with expansions, is the one which the ALS is in today. The laboratory was a part of the United States Atomic Energy Commission until 1977 when it was moved to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nPhysicists kept on improving particle accelerators by increasing their energy. The designers wanted higher energy to study smaller building blocks of matter. From the start, physicists realized that as charged particles spun around, they gave off electromagnetic radiation. In the early 1950s, other scientists started to use this radiation for experiments unrelated to the \"atom smashing\" collisions that were the primary goal of the machines. Particle accelerators shifted from cyclotrons to synchrotrons where the particles traveled in a circle rather than in a spiral path. Construction costs increased as synchrotrons got bigger to the point that many nations joined to build just one very big synchrotron in Europe (CERN) to conduct atom smashing experiments. Other synchrotron labs, such as the Lawrence Berkeley Lab did not have enough energy to discover new particles. So, they switched to using their machines as a source of electromagnetic radiation. Instead of tuning the machine to make particles travel faster, they learned how to wiggle the particle beam to give off particular frequencies of light. In the 1980s and 1990s, scientists wanted to redesign synchrotrons to generate brighter light (more intense electromagnetic radiation) than ever before. These designs were called \"third generation synchrotrons.\" The ALS was the first third generation synchrontron put into operation.\n\nWhen the Advanced Light Source was first proposed in the early 1980s by former Lawrence Berkeley Lab director David Shirley, skeptics dubbed it \"Shirley's Temple\" and doubted the use of a synchrotron tuned to make soft x-rays and ultraviolet light. According to former ALS director Daniel Chemla, \"The scientific case for a third-generation soft x-ray facility such as the ALS had always been fundamentally sound. However, getting the larger scientific community to believe it was an uphill battle\"\n\nIn the 1987 Reagan administration budget, President Ronald Reagan allocated $1.5 million for the construction of the Advanced Light Source.\n\n", "id": "320020", "title": "Advanced Light Source"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320029", "text": "Undulator\n\nAn undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger \ninstallation, a synchrotron storage ring. It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations. So the electrons give off energy as electronmagnetic radiation. The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. The light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.\n\nThe important dimensionless parameter \n\nformula_2 \n\nwhere \"e\" is the particle charge, \"B\" is the magnetic field, \"formula_3\", \"formula_4\" is the electron rest \nmass and \"c\" is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion. For \nformula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. When K is much bigger than 1, the device is no longer called an \"undulator\"; it is called a wiggler.\n\nPhysicist think about undulators both using classical physics and relativity. This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box. An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that the side lobes may be ignored. \n\nUndulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator that repeat N times (N periods), the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. The intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine wave with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced in proportion to 1/N. When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively. So, the undulator stays dark. The same is true if the electrons come as a bead chain. Because the bunch of electron spreads out the more times that they travel around the synchrotron, physicists want to design new machines that throw out the electron bunches before they have a chance to spread out. This change will produced more useful synchrotron radiation.\n\nThe polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.\n\nIf the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity.\nIn the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. \n\nPhysicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance.\n\nThe first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953. One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation. Their total frequency range was from visible light down to millimeter waves. The Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper.\n\nD. T. Attwood's page at Berkeley: Soft X-Rays and Extreme Ultraviolet Radiation.

He had previously predicted judgment days on May 21, 1988, and September 6, 1994.\n\nHis prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a massive publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted responses from both atheist and Christian organizations.

However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at the Family Radio while working from home.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320151", "text": "Surface integral\n\nIn mathematics, a surface integral is a definite integral taken over a surface (which may be a curve set in space). Just as a line integral handles one dimension or one variable, a surface integral can be thought of being double integral along two dimensions. Given a surface, one may integrate over its scalar fields (that is, functions which return numbers as values), and vector fields (that is, functions which return vectors as values). \n\nSurface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism. \n\nConsider a surface \"S\" on which a scalar field \"f\" is defined. If one thinks of \"S\" as made of some material, and for each x in \"S\" the number \"f\"(x) is the density of material at x, then the surface integral of \"f\" over \"S\" is the mass per unit thickness of \"S\". (This is only true if the surface is an infinitesimally thin shell.) One approach to calculating the surface integral is then to split the surface in many very small pieces, assume that on each piece the density is approximately constant, find the mass per unit thickness of each piece by multiplying the density of the piece by its area, and then sum up the resulting numbers to find the total mass per unit thickness of \"S\".\n\nTo find an explicit formula for the surface integral, mathematicians parameterize \"S\" by considering on \"S\" a system of curvilinear coordinates, like the latitude and longitude on a sphere. Let such a parameterization be x(\"s\", \"t\"), where (\"s\", \"t\") varies in some region \"T\" in the plane. Then, the surface integral is given by\n\nwhere the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of x(\"s\", \"t\").\n\nFor example, to find the surface area of some general functional shape, say formula_2, we have\nwhere formula_4. So that formula_5, and formula_6. So, \nwhich is the formula used for the surface area of a general functional shape. One can recognize the vector in the second line above as the normal vector to the surface.\n\nNote that because of the presence of the cross product, the above formulas only work for surfaces embedded in three dimensional space.\n\nConsider a vector field v on \"S\", that is, for each x in \"S\", v(x) is a vector.\n\nThe surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field; the result is a vector. For example, this applies to the electric field at some fixed point due to an electrically charged surface, or the gravity at some fixed point due to a sheet of material. It can also calculate the magnetic flux through a surface.\n\nAlternatively, mathematicians can integrate the normal component of the vector field; the result is a scalar. An example is a fluid flowing through \"S\", such that v(x) determines the velocity of the fluid at x. The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through \"S\" in a unit amount of time. \n\nThis illustration implies that if the vector field is tangent to \"S\" at each point, then the flux is zero, because the fluid just flows in parallel to \"S\", and neither in nor out. This also implies that if v does not just flow along \"S\", that is, if v has both a tangential and a normal component, then only the normal component contributes to the flux. Based on this reasoning, to find the flux, we need to take the dot product of v with the unit surface normal to \"S\" at each point, which will give us a scalar field, and integrate the obtained field as above. This gives the formula\n\nThe cross product on the right-hand side of this expression is a surface normal determined by the parametrization.\n\nThis formula \"defines\" the integral on the left (note the dot and the vector notation for the surface element).\n\nVarious useful results for surface integrals can be derived using differential geometry and vector calculus, such as the divergence theorem, and its generalization, Stokes' theorem.\n\nThe discussion above defined the surface integral by using a parametrization of the surface \"S\". A given surface might have several parametrizations. For example, when the locations of the North Pole and South Pole are moved on a sphere, the latitude and longitude change for all the points on the sphere. A natural question is then whether the definition of the surface integral depends on the chosen parametrization. For integrals of scalar fields, the answer to this question is simple, the value of the surface integral will be the same no matter what parametrization one uses.\n\nIntegrals of vector fields are more complicated, because the surface normal is involved. Mathematicians have proved that given two parametrizations of the same surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, both parametrizations give the same value for the surface integral. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, the value of the surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization; but, when integrating vector fields, we do need to decide in advance which direction the normal will point to and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction. \nAnother issue is that sometimes surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface; this is true for example for the surface of a cylinder (of finite height). The obvious solution is then to split that surface in several pieces, calculate the surface integral on each piece, and then add them all up. This is indeed how things work, but when integrating vector fields one needs to again be careful how to choose the normal-pointing vector for each piece of the surface, so that when the pieces are put back together, the results are consistent. For the cylinder, this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body, then for the top and bottom circular parts the normal must point out of the body too. \nLast, there are surfaces which do not have a surface normal at each point with consistent results (for example, the Möbius strip). If such a surface is split into pieces, on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen, and the pieces are put back together, the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled. This means that at some junction between two pieces will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions. Such a surface is called non-orientable. Vector fields can not be integrated on non-orientable surfaces.\n\n\n", "id": "320151", "title": "Surface integral"}

It is near the junction of the Newell and Sturt Highways, on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River. In 2006 there were 3,961 people living in Narrandera. \n\nNarrandera is a river town with a long history. Captain Charles Sturt, the famous explorer, was the first European to see the area that later became known as Narrandera. However Sturt, who passed through on 12 December 1829, was not the first explorer to see the Murrumbidgee River. The upper Murrumbidgee, the \"Big Water\", was first discovered in April 1821, by Charles Throsby. The name \"Narrandera\" probably comes from Wiradjuri word \"nharrang\", meaning \"frill-necked lizard\".\n\nThe Narrungderra were the local indigenous people. They were all but destroyed by settlement, disease brought by European settlers, and clashes with the settlers. The last major battle between the indigenous people and European settlers took place near Massacre Island, and is said to have left only one survivor.\n\nNarrandera is first recorded as a pastoral station or \"run\" (Narrandera Run) in 1848. The property was owned by Mr Edward Flood covered about . \n\nThe township developed in the early 1860s. Gillinbah Post Office opened nearby on 1 March 1859 and was replaced by the Narrandera office in 1861. A Gillenbah office was open from 1881 to 1892 and from 1906 to 1941.\n\nThe Borough of Narrandera began on 17 March 1885. The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985.\n\nThe town of Narrandera is at the centre of a productive farming region. Its attractive tree-lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it.\n\nThe Narrandera Memorial Gardens include the unusual Hankinson Fountain. Manufactured by the Royal Doulton Company of England, the ceramic fountain is one of only two known in the world, the other in India. It was given to the people of Narrandera by Alderman and Mrs Hankinson in 1922 in honour of locals who served in World War I. The Hankinson Fountain was smashed by an act of vandalism in 1971 and was restored by Charles Pearce.\n\nTo the east of Narrandera farmers grow cereal crops, sheep and wool. To the west, is the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) fed by water from the Burrinjuck Dam. The MIA is a region where farmer grow rice and other cereals with irrigation, as well as citrus, wine grapes and potatoes. \n\nThe town also has number of historic attractions, such as a fig tree on the corner of King and Cadell Streets, which is thought to be 150 years old; and the Mon Repos, a residence built in a Queen Anne-style, which was built in the 1890s.\n\nNarrandera's Irrigation Canal which carries water to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area flows through the town. It begins west at Berembed Weir where water is taken from the Murrumbidgee River. The canal follows the natural bed of Bundidgerry Creek and in places is very wide and has no levee banks. Lake Talbot was formed in 1924 when the bank of the Irrigation Canal gave way, flooding the river flat between the canal and Bundidgerry Hill. The shallow lake was allowed to remain and became an important recreational feature of the town. The eastern end of the lake is used by water skiiers. The western end is a wetland habitat for native fauna. A wetland has been made near Lizard Drive, only from the Murrumbidgee River. The Narrandera Wetland is a collection point for storm water run-off from the town.\n\nNarrandera is well served for transport. The Sturt Highway and the Newell Highways cross just south of Narrandera. Interstate buses pass daily - note that the destination can be listed as Jillenbah.\nThe Narranderra-Leeton airport is 5 km west of town. Regional Express (REX) operate several turboprop return services daily to Sydney, an hour and 10 minutes (approx) flying time away.\nNarrandera's railway station is serviced by the weekly Sydney to Griffith XPlorer. It stops on the way to Griffith at 2:33pm on Saturdays and stops on the way back to Sydney at 8:45am on Sundays. CountryLink buses carry passengers daily to and from Wagga, to meet Sydney and Melbourne bound train services.\n\nThe book Jessica by Bryce Courtenay has Narrandera as the main town near the place where the book is set.\n\nNotable citizens from Narrandera include:\n\n", "id": "320182", "title": "Narrandera, New South Wales"}

The old club Jüdischen Turnvereins zu Graz was dissolved in 1917. Jewish officials were against the club. The club was highly accepted by the young football players.\n\nIn 1921, the football section took part in the 2.Klasse of the Styrian football championship. The first classes of the federal states were the highest, because at that time there was no Austrian-wide championship. The champion of Viennas highest league was considered Austrian champion. They played in blue and white jerseys with the Star of David on the breast. It was difficult for them to play because they had no ground of their own. Due to the antisemitism of that time other clubs often did not allow them to use their grounds. In 1923, they leased an own ground.\n\nIn the 1921/22 season, they reached the first place and were promoted to the 1. Klasse. In the 1. Klasse, the club was again confronted with antisemitism. The Deutscher Sportverein Leoben and Turnverein Leibniz did not want to play against a Jewish club. They were disqualified. During the years in the first class Hakoah often reached places on top of the table. \n\nIn 1935, the club was relegated to the 2. Klasse. The reason for this was that some players went to other clubs and some ended their career because antisemitism grew at that time. The club also lost its ground which was only leased. The contract was not prolonged. In the Second Class, they gained again strength but the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany ended its history.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320280", "text": "Beamline\n\nIn particle physics, a beamline is the path in a particle accelerator of the particles.\n\nIn materials science, physics, chemistry, and molecular biology a beamline leads to the experimental endstation utilizing particle beams from a particle accelerator, synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron, or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor.\n\nIn particle accelerators the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a cement housing. The beamline is usually cylindrical metal. Typical names include, \"beam pipe\", and/or a blank section called a \"drift tube\". This entire section must be under a good vacuum in order to have a the beam travel for a long distance.\n\nA survey and alignment crew carefully align the beamline segments by using a laser tracker. All beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation.\n\nRegarding synchrotrons, a beamline is the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron light source. A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography. Scientists also use synchrotron light in many other ways.\n\nA large synchrotron laboratory will have many beamlines, each optimized for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station.\nA typical beamline at a modern synchrotron will be 25 to 100 m (82 ft to 328 ft) long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines at the start of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.\n\nThe beamline elements are located in radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. People are not allowed to enter hutches when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. Hutches have complex safety systems with redundant interlocking functions to make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is turned off by dumping the electron beam circulating in the synchrotron. So, opening one door will shut down all of the beamlines in the facility.\n\nExperimenters use the following elements that are used in beamlines for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station:\n\n\nThe combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or liquid nitrogen. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions.\n\nAn experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline. Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons. The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from the sample under study.\n\n\n", "id": "320280", "title": "Beamline"}

Really, collimated light will disperse a little as it travels over distance.

The divergence of high-quality laser beams is commonly less than 1 milliradian, and can be much less for large-diameter beams. Laser diodes emit less collimated light due to their short cavity, and therefore higher collimation requires a collimating lens.\n\nSynchrotron light is very collimated. It is produced by bending relativistic electrons around a circular track.\n\nThe light from stars (other than the Sun) can be considered collimated for almost any purpose, because they are so far away they have almost no angular size.\n\nA perfect parabolic mirror will bring parallel rays to a focus at a single point. Conversely, a point source at the focus of a parabolic mirror will produce a beam of collimated light. Since the source needs to be small, such an optical system cannot produce much optical power.

The law was a direct answer to the \"Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.\", , a U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not at the date of the most recent paycheck, as a lower court had ruled.\n\nA first bill to amend the statutory limitations period and supersede the \"Ledbetter\" decision was introduced in the 110th United States Congress but was never enacted, as after having been passed by the House it failed to survive a cloture vote in the Senate due to the opposition of most of the Republican Senators. \n\nDuring the campaign for the 2008 elections, the Democrats criticized Republicans for defeating the 2007 version of the bill, citing Republican presidential candidate John McCain's opposition. Then-candidate Barack Obama supported the bill.\n\nAfter the 2008 election gave the Democratic Party control of both the House and Senate, a new version of the bill was introduced in the first session of the 111th United States Congress and quickly passed both bodies. It became the law signed by the new President Obama after he took office on January 20.\n\nLilly Ledbetter, a production supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal-pay lawsuit seeking back pay for pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She worked for that company for many years without learning that she was paid much less than the men holding the same job. She filed the lawsuit six months before her early retirement in 1998. The District court said her lawsuit was filed on time, but the Court of Appeals said her lawsuit was too late. Ledbetter appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was filed too late because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice Samuel Alito. The minority position explained by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.\n\nThe \"Ledbetter\" decision was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed. These cases involved not only Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but also the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Fair Housing Act, Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act and Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nThe case had never received much attention before going to the Supreme Court, but the Court's ruling ignited legal groups on the left and Democrats that took action to transform the \"Ledbetter\" case into a rallying issue for the left. Some activists saw Lilly Ledbetter as an ideal standard-bearer in their attempt to persuade the public that the Supreme Court was moving too far to the right. \n\nAmong the first to criticize the Court's decision was Marcia Greenberger, president of the National Women's Law Center, that saw in the ruling a \"setback for women and a setback for civil rights\" and called Ginsburg's opinion a \"clarion call to the American people that this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction.\" Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, also condemned the decision, saying, “If employers can keep the discrimination hidden for a period of time, they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable.” On the other side, the majority's findings were applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce, that called it a \"fair decision\" that \"eliminates a potential wind-fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims.\"\n\nThe House Democrats were fast to react. On June 12, the caucus spoke against the Supreme Court decision. Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburg's minority opinion, which invited the Congress to take action by amending the law, the Democrats announced their intention to intervene: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with \"Ledbetter\", clearly putting that \"a key provision of the legislation will make it clear that discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made, but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision, including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck\", as said by Rep. Miller.\n\nRepublicans immediately opposed the bill as drafted, with Education and Labor Committee ranking member Howard McKeon raising the issue that companies would be held liable for actions taken by managers who weren't leading the company anymore: \"At the end of the day, such a loophole conceivably could allow a retiring employee to seek damages against a company now led by executives who had nothing to do with the initial act of discrimination\".\n\nThe issue divided lawyers. The American Bar Association passed a resolution supporting the new bill. Other lawyers, such as Neal Mollen, argued that extending the term limit would put a strain on the chances of an adequate defense for the employers, as to defend themselves one \"has to rely on documents and the memory of individuals, and neither of those is permanent. If a disappointed employee can wait for many years before raising a claim of discrimination ... he or she can wait out the employer, that is ensure that the employer effectively unable to offer any meaningful defense to the claim\".\n\nOrganizations that supported the bill included the: American Civil Liberties Union, AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, American Rights at Work, American Library Association, People For the American Way, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, National Employment Lawyers Association, Hadassah, National Women's Law Center, National Network to End Domestic Violence, Center for Inquiry - Washington DC\nAmerican Association of University Women, Alliance for Justice, Legal Momentum, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, National Partnership for Women and Families, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Moms Rising, National Organization for Women, American Association of Retired Persons, Women's Voices, Women Vote Action Fund, 21st Century Democrats, 9to5, National Association of Working Women, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Women Employed.\n\nOrganizations that opposed the bill include the: U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Eagle Forum, Society for Human Resource Management, National Association of Manufacturers, American Bakers Association, College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, Associated Builders and Contractors, and American Housing & Lodging Association.\n\nThe bill ( and ) was defeated in April 2008 by Republicans in the Senate who cited the possibility of frivolous lawsuits in their opposition of the bill and criticized Democrats for refusing to allow compromises.\n\nThe bill was re-introduced in the 111th Congress (as and ) in January 2009. It passed in the House of Representatives with 247 votes in support and 171 against. The vote was nearly perfectly split along party lines, with only three Republicans voting in favor (Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, Don Young of Alaska and Chris Smith of New Jersey) and three Democrats voting nay (Travis Childers of Mississippi, Allen Boyd of Florida, and Parker Griffith of Alabama).\nThe Senate voted 72 to 23 to invoke cloture on S. 181 on January 15, 2009.

In such a way, genres which traditionally fall within the categories of arena rock tend to be (yet not always) loud and anthemic; arena rock is most traditionally associated with heavy metal, progressive rock, hard rock, glam metal or pop rock genres. Often, yet not always, arena rock is categorised as being more mass-scale, commercially appealing, and radio-oriented music. Due to the often commercial nature of arena rock, it is occasionally called corporate rock.\n\nArena rock is generally associated with the grand shows that artists and groups within the style would hold. At these performances, large sound systems, and often elaborate lighting, additional effects and fireworks, would be included. The 1970s and 80s were a major period in arena rock.\n\nWhilst arena rock has seen large popularity over the years, especially from the 1960s to the 1980s, it has also been criticised for its often commercial and extravagant nature, especially with regards to the shows and concert tours that arena rock bands and artists would have. To some extent, genres such as pub rock, punk rock, indie rock and alternative rock grew as a reaction against the nature and aesthetic of arena rock, opting for a less commercial and over-the-top style.\n\nFamous bands associated with arena rock include Queen, Kiss, Aerosmith, Journey, and Styx, amongst several others.\n\n", "id": "320316", "title": "Arena rock"}

King was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died at 7:05 that evening. He was a prominent leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement who was known for his use of nonviolence and civil disobedience.\n\nJames Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was arrested and charged with King's murder. He was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee State Penitentiary. He died in prison at the age of 70.\n\nThe King family and others believe that a United States government conspiracy killed King, as Loyd Jowers said in 1993. They believe that Ray was a scapegoat. In 1999, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers for $10,000,000. During the trial, both the King family and Jowers gave evidence accusing the government of a conspiracy. The government agencies that were accused could not defend themselves or respond, because they were not named as defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury concluded that Jowers and \"others were part of a conspiracy to kill King.\"\n\nKing had clearly made enemies in his rise to fame. The Ku Klux Klan did what they could to hurt his reputation, especially in the South. Even the FBI kept a close eye on him. \n\nOn the evening of April 4, 1968, King was standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee. He was planning to lead a protest march to support garbage workers that were on strike. At 6:01 p.m., King was shot. The bullet entered through his right cheek, and travelled down his neck. It cut the major vein and arteries in his neck before stopping in his shoulder. Unconscious, he fell violently backwards onto the balcony. \n\nKing was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital. His heart had stopped. Doctors cut open his chest and massaged his heart to try to keep blood and oxygen pumping through his body. However, King never became conscious again. He died at 7:05 p.m. According to Taylor Branch, King's autopsy showed that though he was only 39 years old, he had the heart of a 60-year-old man. \n\nCivil disorder, including riots, happened after King's murder in at least 110 U.S. cities. Washington, Chicago, and Baltimore had the most damage.\n\nOn June 10, 1968, James Earl Ray was arrested in London at Heathrow Airport. Ray was extradited to the United States and charged with killing King. On March 10, 1969, Ray told the court he was guilty, and was sentenced to 99 years in the Tennessee state penitentiary. Ray later tried many times to take away his guilty plea and be tried by a jury, but he was unsuccessful.\nThe United States House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations was created in 1976 to look into the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., and the shooting of Governor George Wallace. The Committee investigated until 1978, and put out a final report in 1979. About the King assassination, the Committee decided:\nIn 1999, Coretta Scott King, King's widow, and the rest of King's family won their wrongful death lawsuit against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\" (other people who were part of the conspiracy). Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury of six whites and six blacks found Jowers liable for King's murder. They also found that governmental agencies were part of the assassination plot.\n\nJames Earl Ray died in prison on April 23, 1998, at the age of 70.\n\nIn 2000, the Department of Justice completed the investigation about Jowers' claims.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320333", "text": "Magnetic reluctance\n\nMagnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuits. It is like resistance in an electrical circuit, but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy. As an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance. It is a scalar, \nextensive quantity, like electrical resistance.\n\nReluctance is usually represented by a curly capital R.\n\nThe term was coined in May 1888 by Oliver Heaviside. The notion of “magnetic resistance” was first mentioned by James Joule and the term \"magnetomotive force” (MMF) was first named by Bosanquet. The idea for a magnetic flux law, similar to Ohm's law for closed electric circuits, is attributed to H. Rowland.\nThe total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the \"magnetomotive force” (MMF) in a passive magnetic circuit to the magnetic flux in this circuit. In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal MMF and magnetic flux. (see phasors)\n\nThe definition can be expressed as:\n\nwhere\n\nIt is sometimes known as Hopkinson's law and is analogous to Ohm's Law with resistance replaced by reluctance, voltage by MMF and current by magnetic flux.\n\nMagnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by Maxwell's equations, but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials. It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance. Air and vacuum have high reluctance. Easily magnetized materials such as soft iron have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force (pull).\n\nThe reluctance of a uniform magnetic circuit can be calculated as:\n\nor\n\nwhere\n\nThe inverse of reluctance is called \"permeance\".\n\nIts SI derived unit is the henry (the same as the unit of inductance, although the two concepts are distinct).\n\n\n\n\nReluctance can also be applied to:\n\n", "id": "320333", "title": "Magnetic reluctance"}

It is now one of Maxwell's equations, which form the basis of classical electromagnetism.\n\nThe law relates magnetic fields to electric currents that produce them. A scientist can use Ampere's law to determine the magnetic field associated with a given current or current associated with a given magnetic field, if there is no time changing electric field present.\nIn its original form, Ampère's Circuital Law relates the magnetic field to its electric current source. \nThe law can be written in two forms, the \"integral form\" and the \"differential form\". The forms are equivalent, and related by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem. It can also be written in terms of either the B or H magnetic fields. Again, the two forms are equivalent (see the \"proof\" section below).\n\nAmpère's circuital law is now known to be a correct law of physics in a magnetostatic situation: The system is static except possibly for continuous steady currents within closed loops. In all other cases the law is incorrect unless Maxwell's correction is included (see below).\n\nIn SI units (the version in cgs units is in a later section), the \"integral form\" of the original Ampère's circuital law is:\n\nor equivalently,\nwhere\n\nSee below for further explanation of the curve \"C\" and surface \"S\". There are a number of ambiguities in the above definitions that require clarification and a choice of convention.\n\nFirst, three of these terms are associated with sign ambiguities: the line integral formula_5 could go around the loop in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise); the vector area dS could point in either of the two directions normal to the surface; and \"I\" is the net current passing through the surface \"S\", meaning the current passing through in one direction, minus the current in the other direction—but either direction could be chosen as positive. These ambiguities are resolved by the right-hand rule: With the palm of the right-hand toward the area of integration, and the index-finger pointing along the direction of line-integration, the outstretched thumb points in the direction that must be chosen for the vector area dS. Also the current passing in the same direction as dS must be counted as positive. The right hand grip rule can also be used to determine the signs.\n\nSecond, there are infinitely many possible surfaces \"S\" that have the curve \"C\" as their border. (Imagine a soap film on a wire loop, which can be deformed by moving the wire). Which of those surfaces is to be chosen? If the loop does not lie in a single plane, for example, there is no one obvious choice. The answer is that it does not matter; it can be proven that any surface with boundary \"C\" can be chosen.\n\nBy the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, this equation can also be written in a \"differential form\". Again, this equation only applies in the case where the electric field is constant in time; see below for the more general form. In SI units, the equation states:\n\nwhere\n\nThe electric current that arises in the simplest textbook situations would be classified as \"free current.\" For example, the law can apply to the current that passes through a wire or battery. In contrast, \"bound current\" arises in the context of bulk materials that can be magnetized and/or polarized. (All materials can to some extent.) \n\nWhen a material is magnetized (for example, by placing it in an external magnetic field), the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms, but behave as if they were orbiting the nucleus in a particular direction, creating a microscopic current. When the currents from all these atoms are put together, they create the same effect as a macroscopic current, circulating perpetually around the magnetized object. This magnetization current J is one contribution to \"bound current\". \n\nThe other source of bound current is bound charge. When an electric field is applied, the positive and negative bound charges can separate over atomic distances in polarizable materials, and when the bound charges move, the polarization changes, creating another contribution to the \"bound current\", the polarization current J.\n\nThe total current density J due to free and bound charges is then:\n\nwith J the \"free\" or \"conduction\" current density.\n\nAll current is fundamentally the same, microscopically. There are often practical reasons for wanting to treat bound current differently from free current. For example, the bound current usually originates over atomic dimensions, and one may wish to take advantage of a simpler theory intended for larger dimensions. The result is that the more microscopic Ampère's law, expressed in terms of B and the microscopic current (which includes free, magnetization and polarization currents), is sometimes put into the equivalent form below in terms of H and the free current only. For a detailed definition of free current and bound current, and the proof that the two formulations are equivalent, see the \"proof\" section below.\n\nTwo issues regarding Ampère's law are important. First, there is an issue regarding the continuity equation for electrical charge. There is a theorem in vector calculus that states the divergence of a curl must always be zero. Hence \n\nand so the original Ampère's law implies that \n\nBut in general \n\nwhich is non-zero for a time-varying charge density. An example occurs in a capacitor circuit where time-varying charge densities exist on the plates.\n\nSecond, there is an issue regarding the propagation of electromagnetic waves. For example, in free space, where \n\nAmpère's law implies that \n\nbut instead \n\nTo treat these situations, the contribution of displacement current must be added to the current term in Ampère's law. \n\nJames Clerk Maxwell conceived of displacement current as a polarization current in the dielectric vortex sea, which he used to model the magnetic field with water (hydrodynamically) and with mechanical systems (mechanically). He added this displacement current to Ampère's circuital law at equation (112) in his 1861 paper \"\" .\n\nIn free space, the displacement current is related to the time rate of change of electric field.\n\nIn a dielectric the above contribution to displacement current is also present, but a major contribution to the displacement current is related to the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Even though charges cannot flow freely in a dielectric, the charges in molecules can move a little under the influence of an electric field. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate under the applied field, causing an increase in the state of polarization, expressed as the polarization density P. A changing state of polarization is equivalent to a current.\n\nBoth contributions to the displacement current are combined by defining the displacement current as:\n\nwhere the electric displacement field is defined as:\n\nwhere ε is the electric constant, \"ε\" the relative static permittivity, and P is the polarization density. Substituting this form for D in the expression for displacement current, it has two components:\n\nThe first term on the right hand side is present everywhere, even in a vacuum. It doesn't involve any actual movement of charge, but it nevertheless has an associated magnetic field, as if it were an actual current. Some authors apply the name \"displacement current\" to only this contribution.\n\nThe second term on the right hand side is the displacement current as originally conceived by Maxwell, associated with the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. \n\nMaxwell's original explanation for displacement current focused upon the situation that occurs in dielectric media. In the modern post-aether era, the concept has been extended to apply to situations with no material media present, for example, to the vacuum between the plates of a charging vacuum capacitor. The displacement current is justified today because it serves several requirements of an electromagnetic theory: correct prediction of magnetic fields in regions where no free current flows; prediction of wave propagation of electromagnetic fields; and conservation of electric charge in cases where charge density is time-varying. For greater discussion see Displacement current.\n\nAmpère's equation was extended by including the polarization current, thereby remedying the limited applicability of the original Ampère's circuital law.\n\nTreating free charges separately from bound charges, Ampère's equation including Maxwell's correction in terms of the H-field is (the H-field is used because it includes the magnetization currents, so J does not appear explicitly, see H-field and also Note):\n\n(integral form), where H is the magnetic H field (also called \"auxiliary magnetic field\", \"magnetic field intensity\", or just \"magnetic field\", D is the electric displacement field, and J is the enclosed conduction current or free current density. In differential form,\n\nOn the other hand, treating all charges on the same footing (disregarding whether they are bound or free charges), the generalized Ampère's equation (also called the Maxwell–Ampère equation) is (see the \"proof\" section below):\n\nin integral form. In differential form,\n\nIn both forms J includes magnetization current density as well as conduction and polarization current densities. That is, the current density on the right side of the Ampère–Maxwell equation is:\n\nwhere current density J is the \"displacement current\", and J is the current density contribution actually due to movement of charges, both free and bound. Because , the charge continuity issue with Ampère's original formulation is no longer a problem. Because of the term in \"ε∂E / ∂t\", wave propagation in free space now is possible.\nWith the addition of the displacement current, Maxwell was able to hypothesize (correctly) that light was a form of electromagnetic wave. See electromagnetic wave equation for a discussion of this important discovery.\n\nIn cgs units, the integral form of the equation, including Maxwell's correction, reads\nwhere \"c\" is the speed of light.\n\nThe differential form of the equation (again, including Maxwell's correction) is\n\n\n\n", "id": "320337", "title": "Ampère's circuital law"}

It was created in 1954. The Acadey is an accredited college for the undergraduate education of people who want to be officers for the United States Air Force. The college is north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County. The Academy's goal is \"to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become officers of character, motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation.\" It is the youngest of the five United States service academies. The Academy had its first graduation in 1959. Graduates of the Academy's four-year program get a Bachelor of Science degree. Most become second lieutenants in the United States Air Force.\n\nThe Academy is one of the largest tourist attractions in Colorado. More than a million people visit it each year. Students are called \"cadets\".\n\nThe Air Force Academy is one of the most selective colleges in the United States. \"U.S. News and World Report\" recently ranked it tied for 5th place in the category Undergraduate Engineering Programs. \"Forbes\" magazine, in 2009, ranked the Academy the #2 public college in the United States and the #7 college overall in its \"America's Best Colleges 2009\" publication. People wanting to study at the Academy are judged on their academic achievement, leadership, athletics and character. They must pass a fitness test, pass a medical examination, and be nominated by the member of Congress where they live. Recent classes have had about 1,400 cadets. Normally, under 1,000 of the cadets will graduate. The cost of going to the Academy, Housing and food are paid for by the U.S. government. Cadets are paid monthly while at the Academy but they must be a part of the military for a number of years after they graduate.\n\nThe program at the Academy is based on the Air Force's core values. These are \"\"Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do\"\". They are also based on four \"pillars of excellence\": military training, academics, athletics and character development. Cadets study military training and large curriculum in engineering, humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, military studies and physical education. All cadets take part in athletics. The academy has a character development and leadership curriculum.\nThe National Security Act of 1947 started the Air Force within the United States military. Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington made an agreement where up to 25% of West Point and Annapolis graduates could ask to become officers in the new Air Force. This was only meant to happen for a short time. Disagreements between the parts of the military led to the creation of the Service Academy Board. It was created by Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. In January 1950, the Service Academy Board was controlled by Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the president of Columbia University at the time. The board said that the two U.S. service academies were not able to train enough officers for the Air Force. They decided that an air force academy was needed. President Eisenhower signed a law on 1 April 1954 to begin building the Air Force Academy.\n\nOn 7 October 1975, President Gerald R. Ford signed a law that let women study at the United States service academies. On 26 June 1976, 157 women went to the Air Force Academy. . On 28 May 1980, 97 of them finished the program and graduated from the Academy. They made up about 10% of the graduating class. Women now make up about 20% of the classes.\n\nThe first Honor scandal happened in 1965. A cadet who was leaving the Academy said that more than 100 cadets had been part of a cheating ring. One hundred and nine cadets had to leave the Academy. Cheating scandals were at the Academy again in 1967, 1972, 1984, 2004. and 2007. After each scandal, the Academy tried to learn why the cheating took place. They also looked at complaints that the academic system put too much pressure on the cadets. Changes were made to try to reduce the events from happening again. \n\nIn 2005, there were complaints that some Evangelical Christian cadets and staff were trying to convert others to their religion at the Academy. Because of this and how the Air Force deals other religious issues, Academy graduate Michael L. Weinstein filed a lawsuit against the Air Force.\n\n\n", "id": "320340", "title": "United States Air Force Academy"}

When the Doctor returns, Amy is nineteen years old. She is working as a kissogram. Amy helps the Doctor save Earth from the Atraxi. Because of the unusual condition of the TARDIS, Amy does not see the Doctor again for two years. He asks her to travel with him. She says she will go with him, but only if he will bring her back by the next morning. She does not tell him that her wedding is the next day.\n\nAt the end of \"Flesh and Stone\", Amy tells the Doctor about her wedding to Rory. Because of \"pre-wedding jitters\", she tries to seduce him. The Doctor then finds Rory and takes him and Amy to 16th century Venice. At this point in time, Rory travelling with them. In \"Amy's Choice\", Amy has to deal with her feelings for the Doctor and Rory. She sees how much she loves Rory. At the end of \"Cold Blood\", Rory is killed and removed from history by the cracks in the universe. Amy no longer remembers him. The Doctor takes Amy to her favourite places because he feels guilty about Rory. In 19th century France, Amy forms a friendship with painter Vincent Van Gogh. Van Gogh shows a romantic interest in Amy. In \"The Pandorica Opens\", Rory is found in 102 AD as a Roman centurion. Amy starts to remember him.,As she remembers, it is shown that the centurion Rory is only an Auton—living plastic that looks and acts like Rory. It was made from Amy's memories to trap the Doctor. Rory tries to fight his programming but fails. He shoots and kills Amy. Amy's body is put in the Pandorica. It is a \"perfect prison\". It was built to keep any person trapped in it alive forever. Auton Rory guards the Pandorica while Amy is inside. She is kept inside while her body is healed. In 1996, the Pandorica is finally opened, and she is set free, by the younger Amy Pond.\n\nThe Doctor learns that Amy is connected to the cracks in the universe. He sees that they come from a temporal explosion on the date of her wedding. He talks to Amy about her house. He tells her that it is too big for only her and her aunt. Amy learns that her family had been erased by the crack in her wall. She had forgotten them. The Doctor helps her remember them. He uses the Pandorica to reset the universe and finds the sleeping Amelia on the night they met. He tells her the story of how he borrowed the TARDIS from his own people. He tells her that it is \"old and new,\" and \"big and small\" and \"the bluest blue that there is\". He then steps into the crack in her wall to closes the cracks forever. Amy wakes up on her wedding day and is reunited with her parents. She marries Rory. At the reception, she sees that River Song's diary about time spent with the Doctor is now empty. This causes Amy to start remembering things. She says that her \"Raggedy Doctor\" was real and her memory of him brings him back to reality. After this, Amy and Rory choose to go with the Doctor again. They are dropped off at a \"honeymoon planet\" between the end of \"The Big Bang\" and the start of \"Death of the Doctor\". Part of their honeymoon is on an interstellar cruise ship that the Doctor stops from crashing into a populated planet.\n\nIn the 2011 series, after an unknown amount of time, Amy and Rory return to the present. They go back to living a normal life until Amy gets an anonymous \"TARDIS blue\" invitation to the Utah desert. In the desert, she and Rory find the Doctor. He has aged almost 200 years since they left the TARDIS. They learn that River Song was also invited to this place. They group sees the Doctor's killed by an astronaut. They learn that the older Doctor also invited a younger version of himself. They travel with him to 1969 Washington, D.C. to investigate strange things involving the Silence. The silence is an alien race who cannot be remembered. After a person met one of the silence, they would forget everything about them as soon as they could no longer see them. While there, Amy tells the Doctor she is pregnant. She later shoots a person in an astronaut suit trying to save the future Doctor's life. She sees that the person in the suit is just a little girl. When the Doctor asks Amy later about the pregnancy, she tells him that she was wrong. The Doctor tries to learn more but learns nothing. In \"Day of the Moon\", Amy finds strange pictures of the astronaut girl in an old orphanage. In one of the pictures, She is holding a baby. She sees the little girl again as well as two Silence. Amy is kidnapped by the Silence. She is set free by the Doctor, Rory, and River a few days later.\n\nDuring the first six episodes, Amy keeps having strange visions of a woman in an eye-patch. The woman keeps saying that \"she must be dreaming\". In \"The Almost People\" it is shown that the Amy with the Doctor is actually an avatar version. It was created with \"the Flesh\" brought to life by Amy's consciousness. The Doctor destroys it and he and Rory go to find the real Amy. She is, at that time, beginning to have her baby. Amy gives birth to her daughter Melody Pond. In \"A Good Man Goes to War\", the baby is kidnapped by the eye-patched woman, Madame Kovarian. Korvarian replaced the baby with a \"Flesh\" version. It is shown at the end of the episode that the name Melody Pond, when translated into an alien language is River Song. River is Amy and Rory's daughter. \"Let's Kill Hitler\" shows how Melody had regenerated into Mels. Mels was the childhood friend of Amy and Rory. Amy named her daughter after Mels. The episode does not show her true identity until she regenerates into River Song after being shot by Hitler. The episode also shows how Amy and Rory fell in love. In \"The God Complex\" the Doctor has to break Amy's faith in him. He learns that she is the reason they are brought to a prison for a being that kills by feeding on faith. The Doctor says goodbye to Rory and Amy after giving them a house and car. In \"Closing Time\" Amy makes a cameo appearance. It is shown that she has become a model and the face of Petrichor perfume.\n\nIn \"The Wedding of River Song,\" Amy leads a secret organisation. Rory works for her. The Doctor and River meet again in an alternate reality after River stopped the Doctor being killed by the astronaut. Amy remembers all of her past with the Doctor but cannot remember Rory. Amy finally remembers Rory when she saves him from the Silence. She kills Madame Kovarian for taking away Melody. Reality is restored when the Doctor and River marry. Amy and Rory are back at home. They have had no contact with the Doctor since \"The God Complex,\" but they still remember the alternate events. Later River tells Amy that the Doctor did not die in Utah and is in fact alive.\n\nIn December 2011, the BBC's Steven Moffat confirmed that Amy and Rory would be leaving the series in 2012 in \"heartbreaking\" circumstances.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" executive producer and main writer Steven Moffat came up with the name for the character. In an interview with Kat Angus of \"Dose\" magazine, \"Doctor Who\" writer Russell T Davies said, \"So when the new series starts next year with the new Doctor, you don’t just get Matt Smith coming on, you also get Karen Gillan as his new companion. I think Amy Pond will be hugely welcomed, because ... I think he does need someone. A lot of these stories prove that. There’s been a huge, empty space on the TARDIS for a long time now and I think her arrival will be every bit as big as Matt’s. It’s really exciting, and everything I’ve heard about Karen is that she’s brilliant. It’s one of our plans that I’m most pleased with, actually. We’ve held off on companions for a long time, so you’ll get rewarded with a great, big, strong character in Amy Pond, when she arrives. I think that plan’s been good.\" Gillan said in an interview with the \"Radio Times\" that she was to play Amy Pond with her natural Scottish accent, She auditioned for the part in both her natural accent and with an English one. Gillan has said that she feels using her Scottish accent better fits the character.\n\nGillan, like some of the people who had been the Doctor's companion before her, had already been on \"Doctor Who\" in a smaller role. Gillan was a soothsayer in the episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\". It was broadcast in 2008.\n\nSteven Moffat said of the casting for the character, \"We saw some amazing actresses for this part. But when Karen came through the door, the game was up - she was funny, clever, gorgeous and sexy. Or Scottish, which is the quick way of saying it. A generation of little girls will want to be her. And a generation of little boys will want them to be her too.\" \"Doctor Who\" executive producer Piers Wenger agreed, \"We knew Karen was perfect for the role the moment we saw her. She brought an energy and excitement to the part that was just fantastic.\"\n\nGillan said she was happy to have been cast in the role. She says, \"I am absolutely over the moon at being chosen to play the Doctor's new companion. The show is such a massive phenomenon that I can't quite believe I am going to be a part of it. Matt Smith is an incredible actor and it is going to be so much fun to act alongside him – I just can't wait to get started.\" The role of the young Amelia was played by Gillan's 10-year-old cousin, Caitlin Blackwood. Gillan asked producers to let her cousin play the part, but Blackwood still had to audition. On set was the first time Gillan and Blackwood had actually met each other.\n\nWhen \"The Eleventh Hour\" was first shown, two viewers quoted in \"The Telegraph\" said that Amy's character was too \"sexy\" for a family programme like \"Doctor Who\". Executive producer Piers Wenger said that Amy was meant to be \"feisty and outspoken and a bit of a number. Amy is probably the wildest companion that the Doctor has travelled with, but she isn’t promiscuous.\"\n\nIn an online poll, with 3,000 people, taken in late 2010, Amy Pond was listed as the fifth most popular companion.\n\n", "id": "320373", "title": "Amy Pond"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320398", "text": "Terrazzo\n\nTerrazzo is a building material that has the cross-section of polished rock chips decorating its appearance.\nIt is a composite material made up of chips surrounded by a binder. It is poured in place or precast. It is used for floors or walls. It consists of marble, quartz, granite, glass or other suitable chips, sprinkled or unsprinkled, and poured with a binder that is cement-like, chemical or a combination of both. Terrazzo is cured, ground and polished to a smooth surface. Sometimes, it is finished to produce a uniformly textured surface that is not flat.\n\nTerrazzo artisans create walkways, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 cm to 10 cm) deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a 1-inch (2.54 cm) layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a lightweight roller over the entire surface.\n\nIn the 1970s, polymer-based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin-set terrazzo. Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin. Today, most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo. The advantages of this material over cement-based terrazzo include: a wider selection of colors, 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch (.63 cm to .95 cm) installation thickness, lighter weight, faster installation, impermeable finish, higher strength, and cracking less. The disadvantage of epoxy resin based terrazzo is that it can only be used inside, not outside buildings. Epoxy-based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors. Cement-based terrazzo will not.\n\nIn addition to marble aggregate blends, other aggregates have been used such as mother of pearl and abalone shell. Recycled aggregates include: glass, porcelain, concrete and metal. Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips or off site by water-jet cutting.\n\nWhen the terrazzo is thoroughly dry (or cured in the case of thin-set terrazzo), helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder, which is somewhat like a floor polisher, only much heavier. Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand-troweled for a smooth, uniform surface. Terrazzo contractors then clean, polish, and seal the dry surface for a finish that shines.\n\nVenetian construction workers invented terrazzo for use as a low cost flooring material using leftover marble chips from upscale jobs. The workers would usually set them in clay to surface the patios around their living quarters. Consisting originally of marble chips, clay, and goat milk (as the sealer), production of terrazzo became much easier after the 1920s and the introduction of electric industrial grinders and other power equipment.\n\nNewly-set terrazzo will not look like marble unless it is wet. So, they used the goat's milk to act as a sealer and preserving the wet and marble-like look.\n\nArchaeologists use the word \"terrazzo\" to describe the floors of early neolithic buildings (PPN A and B, ca. 9,000–8,000 BC) in Western Asia, that are constructed of burnt lime and clay, colored red with ochre and polished. The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance.\nThe use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements, predates the use of pottery by almost a thousand years.\nIn the early Neolithic settlement of Cayönü in eastern Turkey ca. 90 m² of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevali Cori measure about 80 m². They are 15 cm thick, and contain about 10-15 % lime.\n\nOther sites with terrazzo floors include Nevali Cori, Göbekli Tepe, Jericho, and Kastros (Cyprus).\n\nTerrazzo flooring is an original recycled product, created centuries ago by Venetian workers using the waste chips from slab marble processing. Today Terrazzo continues to provide environmentally friendly durability and low maintenance, typically lasting the life of the building. With no volatile organic compounds (VOC), it earns further point on indoor air quality ratings. Recycled content is still a standard feature of modern terrazzo. \n\nTerrazzo aggregates, binders and finished flooring systems can contribute to U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) credits, under the LEED-NC rating system, version 2.2. \n\nThe evaluation of a construction product for its environmental impact considers the longevity of the material, the composition, recycled materials, maintenance requirements, embodied energy, and lifetime environmental impact. \n\nDurability is at the core of green construction. Terrazzo flooring can be refinished repeatedly, reusing instead of replacing materials. It can be restored to its original luster at a fraction of the cost of replacement. Even century-old floors have generally proven need little more than minor repairs and refinishing to return them to their original beauty.\n\nTerrazzo flooring (both cement and thin-set epoxy) also requires only minimal, low-cost maintenance. Routine maintenance should be no more than dry and damp mopping, with an occasional spray buffing. Waxing or chemical cleaners only serve to cloud or damage the finish. Annual stripping and resealing can be done with water-based products. \n\nTerrazzo is composed of naturally occurring aggregates, recycled glass or plastic and processed cement or epoxy binders. The binders constitute 25-30 percent of the volume of a floor; the remainder is composed of aggregates, pigments and fillers. \n\nPost-consumer recycled glass or post-industrial stone from slab granite and marble processing increase the amount of recycled content in Terrazzo, along with recycled aluminum divider strips.\n\nBoth cement-based and thin-set epoxy Terrazzo systems are made of zero VOC materials. Terrazzo produces little or no off-gassing over the life of a cured floor. The non-porous Terrazzo finish resists microbial growth and moisture. \n\nThe potential for local sourcing is another environmental strength of Terrazzo. Manufactured on site, Terrazzo installations generally produce minimal post-commercial waste and save on transportation costs. \n\nOn typical projects, Terrazzo can realistically contribute to five LEED credits: MRcr4 (2), MRcr5 (2) EQcr4 (1). Terrazzo may also potentially contribute to MRcr1 (1), and in extreme cases, ldcr1 (1), for a total of eight points.\n\n", "id": "320398", "title": "Terrazzo"}

It educates officers mostly to join the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The campus is on the former grounds of Fort Severn where the Severn River flows into Chesapeake Bay. It is about east of Washington, D.C. and southeast of Baltimore, Maryland. The entire campus is a National Historic Landmark. The campus has many historic sites, buildings, and monuments.\n\nCandidates for admission generally must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a congressman. The candidates lacking in academics can potentially receive a nomination to the Naval Academy Preparatory School located in Newport, Rhode Island. Students are officers-in-training and are called \"Midshipmen\". The Navy pays for the Midshipmen's college expenses in exchange for the students serving in the military upon graduation. About 1,300 \"plebes\" enter the Academy each summer for the orientation program, this class consists of not only high school students but also enlisted Sailors and Marines. Only about 1,000 Midshipmen graduate after the four years. Graduates are usually commissioned as Ensigns in the Navy or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps, and occasionally as officers in the US Air Force, US Army, and U.S. Coast Guard.

It is mainly done by people who do not agree with what the religion says and what it believes. The criticism often come from agnostics, skeptics, materialist philosophy, people who follow other religions, or by Buddhists who want change.\n\nCriticisms include some beliefs that are only found in some Buddhist cultures and institutions. These are not all true to original Buddhist principles. Sam Harris, a New Atheism supporter, and believers in Buddhist meditation say that many followers of Buddhism treat it as a religion in the wrong way. They say that their beliefs are often \"naive, petitionary, and superstitious\". (\"Petitionary\" means making a petition, or a request, as when asking for help.) They think this stops the followers from living the true Buddhist principles.\n\nSome critics say that Buddhist followers and leaders have been interested in property and money. They think that they are corrupt and are more interested in wealth and power rather than Buddhist principles. There have been many sex scandals involving teachers in Western Buddhist groups.\n\nMichael Jerryson believes that Buddhism has been connected to government since its start. He thinks that the inability to understand the idea of a country without Buddhism leads to a kind of religious nationalism. He feels this is found in many Buddhist conflicts. In medieval Southeast Asia, there were many Buddhist states. These included the Pagan Kingdom, the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. In Sri Lanka, modern monks often took part in the politics of the country. They did this even though the Buddha only believed in helping others make their own choice in the government. Peace activists such as A. T. Ariyaratne have also used Buddhism for ways of doing things.\n\nEast Asian Mahayana Buddhists also often get money from the government. The Zen priest Brian Daizen Victoria wrote in his book \"Zen at War\" that Buddhist groups justified Japanese militarism. He said that they helped the Japanese Army on the battlefield. Because of the book, several groups said sorry for their actions. \n\nAfter the 2008 problems in the Tibetan area of the PRC, China claimed that the Dalai Lama helped to create the problems and violence. A Chinese spokesperson said that a large number of guns and explosives had been found in monasteries in the capital of Tibet.\n\nBuddhism has been criticized because it treats women as less than men. This mainly deals with women monks. Most schools of Buddhism have more rules for bhikkuni (nuns) than bhikku (monk). Buddhists say that in the time of the Buddha, nuns had more problems like their safety. Monks often traveled around in the forest and between cities. Because of this, more rules were created for nuns, for instance: nuns are not allowed to travel alone.\n\nAt the 2007 Hamburg congress, The Dalai Lama said that men and women have equal rights, but at times, culture affects how things are done.\n\n\n", "id": "320460", "title": "Criticism of Buddhism"}

He served on both federal and Iowa state courts. He wrote an important book on the power of states about municipal governments.\n\nDillon was born in Northampton, Montgomery County, New York. He studied medicine at the University of Iowa at the age of 19. Shortly after beginning to work as a doctor, he switched to studying law, and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1852. He was elected as the Scott County prosecutor after a brief private practice in 1853, and was then elected to a judgeship in Iowa's 7th Judicial Circuit in 1858. He joined to the Iowa Supreme Court in 1862 and served until 1869, when he was appointed by President Grant to the United States Circuit Court.\n\nWhile Dillon was a federal judge, he wrote \"Municipal Corporations\" (1872), which was one of the earliest books to present the subject, and people still study it today. He was also the author of \"Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts\" and \"Municipal Bonds\", both in 1876. On February 17, 1876, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions. After leaving the Circuit Court, Dillon was a professor at Columbia Law School from 1879 until 1882, where he taught real estate and equity. He then taught at Yale Law School from 1891 until 1892. While at Yale, he also was the president of the American Bar Association. Dillon then returned to private practice until his death in 1914 in New York City.\n\nA memorial fountain to Dillon was built in downtown Davenport, Iowa in 1918. Sculptor Harry Liva carved it out of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style.\n\nDillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855 – 1918), also became a lawyer in Iowa, and a Master of Chancery in federal court. Dillon's sister was the grandmother of baseball manager Casey Stengel.\n\nThe theory of state preeminence over local governments was called the \"Dillon Rule\" in an 1868 case: \"Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. As it creates, so may it destroy. If it may destroy, it may abridge and control.\" \"Clinton v Cedar Rapids and the Missouri River Railroad\",(24 Iowa 455; 1868). As opposed to the Dillon Rule, the Cooley Doctrine expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination. In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated: “[L]ocal government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away.” \"People v. Hurlbut\", (24 Mich 44, 95; 1871).\n\nIn \"Municipal Corporations\" (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that the state legislature expressly gives to them. This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as the \"Dillon Rule\". It says that municipal governments only have the powers that are expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those that are necessarily implied from that grant of power, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning. If the legislative grant of power is unclear, it should be read narrowly. Courts should assume that the legislature did not mean to give a power unless that power was clearly spelled out in a law. However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable.\n\nHundreds of U.S. court decisions to the present day have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights. Critics of the rule say that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and so undermines democracy, and even that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures. It has also been suggested that Dillon's approach came from the view at that time that cities were inherently corrupt political organs. Corruption was widespread during his time, especially considering the extensive business ties and even investments of numerous cities and their leaders in the late 19th century. Today, most states in the United States follow the Dillon Rule. This is true even though most people no longer believe that cities have corruption problems.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States cited Dillon's book \"Municipal Corporations\" and fully adopted Dillon's emphasis on state power over municipalities in \"Merrill v. Monticello,\" 138 U.S. 673 (1891), reaff'd. \"Hunter v. Pittsburgh\", 207 U.S. 161 (1907), which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the wishes of the majority of Allegheny residents to be a separate city. The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's separation of public, municipal corporations from private ones.\n\n", "id": "320561", "title": "John Forrest Dillon"}

At Cornell, he was good at asking people for money. Rawlings started several new positions and programs to support undergraduate education. Cornell built of several new dormitories and centralized the location of freshmen dormitories on campus (initially protested by Al Sharpton and others due to alleged racial implications). Rawlings promoted stronger undergraduate admission standards. Rawlings began initiatives in certain areas of science and engineering that he considered important to the future (such as bioinformatics, computational biology, computer and information sciences, genomics, and materials science), and began plans for Weill Hall, a large new life sciences building. He encouraged cooperation between the humanities and social sciences.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320574", "text": "1994 San Marino Grand Prix\n\nThe 1994 San Marino Grand Prix (known as the 14° Gran Premio di San Marino by the people putting on the race) was a Formula One motor race held on 1 May 1994 at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy. It was the third race of the 1994 Formula One season. Some things that happened at this race proved to be a major turning point in both the 1994 season, and in the development of Formula 1 itself, especially safety.\n\nDuring the race weekend, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and three-time world champion Ayrton Senna died in different accidents. Other incidents saw driver Rubens Barrichello hurt and a few mechanics and spectators injured. BBC Television commentator Murray Walker described it as \"the blackest day for Grand Prix racing that I can remember\".\n\nMichael Schumacher won the race. In the press conference after the race, Schumacher said that he \"couldn't feel satisfied, couldn't feel happy\" with his win following the events that had happened during the race weekend. Nicola Larini scored the first points of his career when he finished in second position. Mika Häkkinen finished third.\n\nThe race led to a bigger focus on safety in Formula One as well as the reforming of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association after 12 years of not running, and the changing of many track layouts and car designs. Since the race, many regulation changes have been made to slow Formula One cars down, and newer tracks, such as Bahrain International Circuit, have large run-off areas to slow cars before they collide with a wall.\nSenna was given a state funeral in his home country of Brazil, where around 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Italian prosecutors charged six people with manslaughter in connection with Senna's death, all of whom were later found to be not guilty. The case took more than 11 years to conclude due to an appeal and a re-trial following the original not guilty verdict.\n\nOn Friday 29 April, during the first qualifying session to determine the starting order for the race, Rubens Barrichello, a driver for Jordan, hit a kerb at the \"Variante Bassa\" corner at 140 miles an hour (225 kilometres an hour), launching him into the air. He hit the top of the tyre barrier, and was knocked unconscious. His Jordan rolled several times after landing before stopping slowly upside down. Doctors teams treated him at the crash site, and he was taken to the medical centre. He returned to the race meeting the next day, although his broken nose and a plaster cast on his arm forced him to sit out the rest of the race weekend. Ten years after the incident, Damon Hill, who drove for the Williams-Renault team at the time, described the feeling after the crash: \"We all brushed ourselves off and carried on qualifying, reassured that our cars were tough as tanks and we could be shaken but not hurt.\"\n\nTwenty minutes into the final qualifying session, Roland Ratzenberger failed to negotiate the \"Villeneuve curva\" in his Simtek; he then hit the concrete barrier wall almost head-on and was injured a lot. Although the survival cell (a part of the car) stayed largely together, the force of the crash caused a basal skull fracture. Ratzenberger, in his first year as a Formula One driver, ran over a kerb at the \"Acque Minerali\" corner on his previous lap, causing a fault in his front wing. Rather than come back to the pitlane, he continued on another fast lap. Going at 190 miles an hour (306 kilometres an hour) his car's front wing failed, leaving him unable to control it.\n\nThe session was stopped whilst doctors attended to Ratzenberger. The session was started approximately 25 minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital it was announced that Ratzenberger had died as a result of his injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend death since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his book about himself, Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that \"Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder.\" Watkins tried to stop Senna from racing on the next day, asking \"What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing,\" but Ayrton said that, \"Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on.\"\n\nSenna would start on pole position, ahead of championship leader Michael Schumacher. Gerhard Berger qualified in 3rd, and Senna's team-mate Damon Hill started from fourth position. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid.\n\nAt the start of the race, J.J. Lehto's Benetton did not move. Pedro Lamy, starting from further back on the grid, had his view of the car blocked by other cars and hit the back of Lehto's car, causing bodywork and tyres to fly into the air. Parts of the car went over the safety fencing designed to protect spectators at the start-line causing nine people to be hurt but not very much. The incident caused the safety car to come out on track, with all the drivers still in the race staying in the same place behind it while going at a slower speed. During this period, as a result of going at slower speeds, tyre temperatures dropped. At the drivers' briefing before the race, Senna, along with Gerhard Berger, had expressed concern that the safety car (which only came into F1 in 1993) did not go fast enough to keep tyre temperatures high. Once the track was reported clear of pieces of car, the safety car went back into the pit lane and the race started again, with a rolling start. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the \"Tamburello corner\", and after slowing from 190 miles an hour (306 kilometres an hour) to 131 miles an hour (211 kilometres an hour), hit the concrete wall.\nAt 2:17 p.m. local time, a red flag was shown to show that the race was stopped and Sid Watkins came to the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under a red flag cars must slow down and make their way back to the starting grid until they are told what to do next. This protects race marshalls and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows for medical cars to get to the crash quicker. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the Larrousse team made a mistake and allowed one of their drivers, Érik Comas, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshalls slowed him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at \"pretty much full speed\". Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as \"the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life\". Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so upset at what he saw that he withdrew from the race. The pictures shown of Senna being treated on the world feed (supplied by host broadcaster RAI) were very graphic, and the BBC switched to their own camera focused on the pit lane. BBC commentator Murray Walker has frequently talked about how upsetting it was to have to talk to viewers while avoiding all mention of the distressing pictures he could see on the world feed. Senna was lifted from the wrecked Williams and flown to Maggiore Hospital in nearby Bologna. Medical teams continued to treat him during the flight. Thirty-seven minutes after the crash, at 2:55 p.m. local time, the race was restarted.\n\nThe results of the restarted race would be determined by the aggregate results of the stopped first race and the second race. From the restart, Gerhard Berger took the lead on track but Schumacher still led the race due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped. Schumacher took the lead on track on lap 12, and four laps later, Berger retired from the race with handling problems. Larini briefly took the lead as Schumacher pitted but the order was restored when Larini took his own pit stop.\n\nTen laps from the end the rear-right wheel came loose from Michele Alboreto's Minardi as it left the pit lane, striking two Ferrari and two Lotus mechanics, who were left needing hospital treatment.\n\nMichael Schumacher won the race ahead of Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen, giving him a maximum 30 points after 3 rounds of the 1994 Formula One season. It was the only podium finish of Larini's career, and the first of just two occasions when he scored world championship points. At the podium ceremony, out of respect for Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna, no champagne was sprayed.\n\n\n", "id": "320574", "title": "1994 San Marino Grand Prix"}

An Act of Congress () started it in 1967. The idea for a center came from the Judicial Conference of the United States. \n\nThe Center main activities are:\n\n\nThe law sets who serves on the Center's Board of Directors. The Chief Justice of the United States is \"ex officio\" chair of the Center's board. The board also has the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and seven judges elected by the Judicial Conference. The Board appoints the Center's director and deputy director; the director appoints the Center's staff. Since its founding in 1967, the Center has had ten directors. Judge Jeremy Fogel became director in 2011. He was appointed U.S. district judge for the Northern District of California in 1998 but has been resident in Washington, D.C., since becoming director. The deputy director is John S. Cooke.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren and other members of the judiciary wanted a separate agency that would conduct research and educational programs for the federal courts. They hoped that a separate agency would build the judiciary’s institutional independence. They recommended starting the Federal Judicial center to Congress. They hoped that regular programs of research and education would improve the efficiency of the federal courts and relieve the backlog of cases in the lower courts.\n\nThe Center is governed by its own board. The Federal Judicial Center offered the courts the benefits of independent social science research and educational programs designed to improve judicial administration. \n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, the Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office increasingly commissioned research projects to examine problems of judicial administration at the same time that they organized educational programs to help judges manage growing and complicated caseloads. These research and educational programs, however, received no permanent staff or funding. Support for an institutionalized program of judicial research and education increased after adding 60 new district judge positions in 1961 showed that the number of judges alone would not solve all of the problems of overworked courts. Many judges and lawyers asked for a way to bring improved research and education to the courts. \n\nThe Center includes several offices and divisions.\n\nThe Director's Office is responsible for the Center's overall management and its relations with other organizations. Its Office of Systems Innovation and Development (OSID) provides technical support for Center education and research. Communications Policy and Design (CPD) edits, produces, and distributes all Center print and electronic publications, operates the Federal Judicial Television Network, and through the Information Services Office maintains a library of materials on judicial administration.\n\nThe Research Division undertakes empirical and exploratory research on federal judicial processes, court management, and sentencing and its consequences, often at the request of the Judicial Conference and its committees, the courts themselves, or other groups in the federal system. James B. Eaglin is the current director of the research division. \n\nThe Federal Judicial History Office develops programs relating to the history of the judicial branch and helps courts with their own judicial history programs.\n\nThe Education Division holds educational sessions for federal judges and court staff. Bruce Clarke is the current director of the Education Division.\n\nThe Interjudicial Affairs Office caries out the Center's statutory mission to provide information about federal courts to officials of foreign judicial systems and to acquire information about foreign judicial systems that will help the Center perform its other missions.\n\nThe Center's board consists of: \n\n\nA nonprofit organization, the Federal Judicial Center Foundation, solicits support for the Center.\n\n", "id": "320626", "title": "Federal Judicial Center"}
