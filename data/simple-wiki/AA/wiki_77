Liberty Hyde Bailey, an American botanist was the first to use the term, in 1918. Bailey noticed that the classification Linné introduced for plants was not useful for classifying plants which came from human cultivation and selection. He called the plants which grow in the wild without human selection indigens. A cultigen was: \" ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown... [It has] such characters as to separate it from known indigens, and is probably not represented by any type specimen or exact description\". The point is that a cultigen cannot always be placed in the traditional Linnean system of botanical classification.\n\nBailey later changed his definition to \"Plant or group known only in cultivation; presumably originating under domestication; contrast with indigen\", which is the definition used above. Examples of cultigens are maize and cabbage.\n\nCultigen and cultivar may be confused with one-another. Cultigen is a general-purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well (see introductory text above). Cultivar is a formal classification category in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP).\n\nAlthough in his 1923 paper Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species and so he established a new classification category for these, the cultivar, generally assumed to be a contraction of the words “cultivated” and “variety”. He defined cultivar in his 1923 paper as: \nThis definition and understanding of cultivar has changed over time.\nThe definition has been discussed:\n", "id": "331012", "title": "Cultigen"}

Some of his early works include the ballet \"Acis and Galatea\" (1905) and \"The Dying Swan\" (1907), which was a solo dance for Anna Pavlova, choreographed to the music of Saint-Saëns' \"Le Cygne\". \n\nIn 1909, Sergei Diaghilev invited Fokine to become the choreographer of his Ballets Russes in Paris. Fokine broke off the collaboration in 1912, jealous of Diaghilev's close relationship with Vaslav Nijinsky. He moved to Sweden in 1918 and later established his home in New York City, where he founded a ballet school and continued to appear with his wife, Vera Fokina. He became a United States citizen in 1932. Fokine died in New York on 22 August 1942.\n\nFokine staged more than 70 ballets in Europe and the United States. His best known works were \"Chopiniana\" (later revised as \"Les Sylphides\"), \"Le Carnaval\" and \"Le Pavillon d'Armide\". Among his works for the Ballets Russes were \"The Firebird\", \"Petrushka\", \"Le Spectre de la Rose\" and \"Daphnis et Chloé\". Also, for the Ballets Russes, he created a ballet out of Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Scheherazade\". His pieces are still performed by the leading ballet troupes of the world. \n\n\n", "id": "331171", "title": "Mikhail Fokine"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331172", "text": "Lasseter's Reef\n\nLasseter's Reef was a legendary rich gold deposit that was said to be in remote central Australia. A prospector, Harold Bell Lasseter, claimed to have discovered the site in 1897. But Lasseter forgot the exact location of it. He died when he went back into the desert to look for it again. The gold's location remains a mystery—nobody even knows whether it really exists.\n\nLasseter told the story in 1929. He said that he had found the gold near the border of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This area at the time was uncharted (no maps had been made of it). When he came out of the desert, he spent the next thirty years trying to get people to fund an expedition to go back and look for it. But people ignored him because people were already making fortune from the gold rush at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Nobody wanted to risk going into unchartered desert.\n\nBut during the Great Depression, people became interested. Lasseter got enough money for an expedition to relocate the gold. But the expedition was hard—there were long distances involved, no maps to guide them, and it was very hard to find water. When the expedition party became lost, the people who went with Lasseter called him a liar. They left him, but Lasseter continued, with one other man. The man later said that Lasseter became crazy in the desert, and he too left him.\n\nNow alone, Lasseter continued in the desert, but eventually became exhausted and dehydrated. He died from exhaustion and malnutrition in early 1931. He was on his way to Uluru or Kata Tjuta. His body was found in March 1931 by a bushman. The story of Lasseter's expedition is known from the stories of his travelling group. The later part of the story is known from Lasseter's diary, which was found on his body. No maps showing the location of the fabled gold reef were ever found. The tale of the reef has become legend. It is probably the most famous \"lost mine\" legend in Australia.\n\n", "id": "331172", "title": "Lasseter's Reef"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331180", "text": "Le Spectre de la rose\n\nLe Spectre de la rose () is a short ballet. It is about a young girl who dreams of dancing with the spirit of a souvenir rose from her first ball. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer wrote the ballet story. He based it on a verse by Théophile Gautier. \n\nThe dances were designed by Michel Fokine. The music is Hector Berlioz's 1841 orchestration of Carl Maria von Weber's piano music \"Afforderung zum Tanz\" (). Léon Bakst designed the original sets and costumes. \n\nThe ballet was first presented in Monte Carlo on 19 April 1911. Nijinsky danced The Rose and Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl. It was a great success. \"Spectre\" became internationally famous for the leap (jump) Nijinsky made through a window at the ballet's end. \n\nIn 1911, Ballet Russes producer Sergei Diaghilev hoped to present Nijinsky's ballet \"L'Après-midi d'un faune\" (). It was not ready for the stage, so he needed another ballet to take its place. That ballet was the idea of writer Jean-Louis Vaudoyer. In 1910, he had sent an idea for a ballet to Ballets Russes set and costume designer Léon Bakst. His idea was based on \"Le Spectre de la rose\", a verse by Théophile Gautier, and \"Afforderung zum Tanz\", a work for piano by Carl Maria von Weber. Diaghilev liked Vaudoyer's idea. He thought it could easily take the place of \"Faune\". He put Vaudoyer's idea into development at once. Diaghilev liked the idea of a ballet based on Gautier's \"Spectre\" because it could be tied to the centennial of Gautier's birth.\n\nIn 1819, Carl Maria von Weber wrote a work for piano called \"Afforderung zum Tanz\". He also wrote a program for this work about a young man and woman who meet, dance, and part at a ball. The quiet music at the opening of \"Afforderung\" leads to some beautiful (and busy) waltz tunes before the work ends with the opening music. In 1841, Hector Berlioz orchestrated \"Afforderung\". This version of the music was used for a short ballet in Weber's opera \"Der Freischütz\" at the Paris Opéra. It was the Berlioz version that was used for the ballet \"Le Spectre de la rose\".\n\nMichel Fokine completed the dance in three or four rehearsals. He later wrote that the ballet was almost an improvisation. Grace Robert writes in \"The Borzoi Book of Ballets\" that \"Spectre\" is a \"pas de deux\", but not the sort of \"pas de deux\" that looks back to complex 19th-century technique and virtuosity. Instead, it is a forward-looking, modern dance of continuous movement and expressiveness. \n\nFokine dropped the \"port de bras\" (position of the arms) of classical ballet in designing the dances for Nijinsky. He used instead curving, tendril-like movements of the arms and fingers. Nijinsky became an androgynous character in this ballet, one showing masculine power in his legs and a feminine delicacy in his arms. Some of his gestures, Ostwalt writes in \"Nijinsky: A Leap into Madness\", \"lent a feminine aura (an invisible force)\" to the character.\n\nNijinsky's silk elasticated costume was designed by Léon Bakst. The costume was covered with silk rose petals. Nijinsky was stitched into the costume for every show. After every show, the wardrobe mistress would touch up the petals with her curling iron. Nijinsky's make-up was an important part of the costume design. Romula de Pulszky, later to be his wife, wrote that he looked like \"a celestial (heavenly) insect, his eyebrows suggesting some beautiful beetle\". Ostwald writes that Nijinsky's costume was like a ballerina's. Sometimes, petals would become loose and fall to the stage. Nijinsky's servant Vasili would collect the petals and sell them as souvenirs. It was said that he built a large house called Le Château du Spectre de la Rose with the profits from the sale of the petals.\n\nThe ballet became famous for Nijinsky's leap through one of the two large windows at the back of the stage. The height of the leap was an illusion though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would fly on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the next to the last chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.\n\nThe curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl comes into the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has come home from her first ball. She holds a rose as a souvenir of the evening. She drops into a chair and falls asleep. The rose falls from her fingers to the floor. The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.\n\n\"Spectre\" was first presented on 19 April 1911 by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the Théâtre de Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo. Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl and Nijinsky danced The Rose. Grace Robert writes that \"Spectre\" was an \"immediate success\". Diaghilev was surprised; he thought \"Spectre\" a trifle not worth notice, but the little ballet became one of the most loved productions of the Ballets Russes. \n\nMany dancers attempted to match Nijinsky as The Rose, but failed. After all, the ballet had been designed for Nijinsky's very special talents. The Young Girl has been called \"the forgotten woman of ballet\", and, as time passed, the part became routine. By the middle of the 20th century, \"Spectre\" had become nothing but a stunt ballet: people paid only to see the leap through the window.\n\n\"Spectre\" was one of the first ballets Rudolph Nureyev danced in the West after leaving Russia. This was for German television in 1961. He first danced The Rose on stage (24 times) in New York City for the Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev program in 1979. \"Spectre\" was the last ballet Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn danced together. That was in June 1979, when the ballerina was 60. He danced The Rose in Paris in 1981 and 1982, and last danced the part in August 1987 at the London Coliseum with the Nancy Ballet.\n\nThe ballet was first seen in Australia in 1936 when it was part of the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet program. In 1962, Margot Fonteyn danced The Young Girl as part of her 1962 tour of Australia. In 2006, The Australian Ballet presented the ballet as one of three showing the work of Fokine.\n\n", "id": "331180", "title": "Le Spectre de la rose"}

It is also called Docker River in English. It is about 670 km southwest of Alice Springs, and 8 km from the border with Western Australia. In the 2006 census, Kaltukatjara had a population of 355. All of the residents are either Pitjantjatjara, Ngaatjatjarra or Ngaanyatjarra Aboriginal people.\n\nKaltukatjara is located on the western bank of an ephemeral watercourse called Docker River. It is surrounded by the Petermann Ranges. From the town, the Great Central Road leads eastward to Yulara (196 km) and westward to Warburton (288 km).\n\nWhile the roads in the town are sealed, roads out of the town are gravel and can be closed for up to a week if it rains. There is an air strip about 4 km north of the town. Power is supplied by three large generators. The water supply is pumped from two underground bores which are about 5 km from the town. Facilities in Kaltukatjara includes both a primary and secondary school, a health clinic, community store, and an old people's home. There is also a Lutheran church.\n\nKaltukatjara was originally established as an outstation in 1968. It was established so that the Aboriginal people living in missions such as Areyonga could live closer to their homelands. It was also to encourage people to move out of the Ayers Rock–Mt Olga National Park. The settlement was named \"Docker River\" after the stream that flows through the community. This stream was given its name by the explorer Ernest Giles when he travelled through the area in 1872.\n\nIn 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed in the Northern Territory. The Kaltukatjara community was given freehold title over a large block of land in the Territory's southwest corner (see Petermann Aboriginal Land Trust). This allowed families living at Kaltukatjara to spread out over the surrounding country and set up smaller camps on their own ancestral homelands. This movement was part of a larger trend called the \"outstation movement\". The first two outstations established were Tjuntinanta and Punritjanta. By the end of 1978, a total of 11 outstations had been established. There were 16 by the end of 1981.\n\nThe area in which Kaltukatjara is located is known as '. It contains several old sacred sites associated with the (Mulga Seed Dreaming). Part of this Tjukurpa, which is restricted to men, extends east through Uluṟu, where the Wintalyka men became involved in a feud with the Mala people. According to the legend, the Mala had travelled from the north to perform ceremonies at Uluṟu with a sacred artefact. On learning of this artefact, the Wintalyka men invited the Mala men to attend ceremonies at Kikingkura, but the Mala refused. Feeling insulted, the Wintalyka decided to punish the Mala by conjuring an evil spirit to haunt them. At Pulpaiyala, a soakage close to what is now Kaltukatjara, they conjured ', a great and terrifying spirit resembling a dingo. Kurpany chased the Mala men from Uluṟu and off across the desert to the south.\n\nKaltukatjara is governed by Kaḻṯukatjara Community Council, a local government council with 12 members. The community also serves about 30 outstations, most of which are not permanently occupied. They are spread over a large area around the Petermann Ranges. Only two outstations are funded by the council: Tjauwata, about 5 km to the east, and Kunapula, about 46 km southeast. Most of the outstations on the eastern side of the border are owned by Pitjantjatjara families.

It was one of the first big-prize giveaway television programs. \"Queen for a Day\" had its launch on the radio on April 30, 1945. It ran on the radio until 1957. The program then ran on television's NBC from 1956 to 1964. The program is something of an early \"reality show\". The program was so popular that NBC increased its running time from 30 minutes to 45 minutes. \n\nThe format was simple. Host Jack Bailey interviewed four women contestants. Each told of her personal troubles. These troubles might involve a terminally sick child at home, a husband disabled and out of work, or the need for a hearing aid or a new washing machine. The audience chose the winner by applauding their favorite. She who received the greatest amount of applause as registered by the \"applause meter\" was Queen for a Day. The winner was crowned, escorted by attendants to a throne, and given not only what she wanted, but juicy prizes like high-end appliances, upscale fashions, and exotic vacation trips as well. Mark Evanier, veteran television writer, writes that \"Queen for a Day\" was \"one of the most ghastly shows ever produced\" and further stated it was \"tasteless, demeaning to women, demeaning to anyone who watched it, cheap, insulting and utterly degrading to the human spirit.\"\n", "id": "331281", "title": "Queen for a Day"}

The releaser, or sign stimulus triggers an innate releasing mechanism in the receiver. The receiver then does its response, the fixed action pattern (FAP).\n\nThis kind of system is inherited by both animals. Example: a fledgling bird does its releaser, say it squawks and opens its beak wide, showing bright red inside throat. This triggers the adult to cough up food stored in its gullet. Both 'partners' are behaving instinctually with inherited behaviours: these are not learnt during life. A FAP can truly be said to be 'hard-wired': a specific stimulus nearly always results in the same behavioral response.\n\nAnother behavious system is the 'dances' of water birds such as the Great Crested Grebe. They pair for life, and 'dance' whenever a pair meet up after an absence, and on other occasions. The dances are quite complex, and were first described fully by Julian Huxley. Here the meeting is the releaser, and both partners do the fixed action pattern. The function of the system is a little unclear, but it has something to do with reinforcing the pair's bond.\n\nIt is not necessary for both partners to benefit, nor to be of the same species. Some moths instantly fold their wings and drop to the ground if they encounter bat ultrasonic signals. This helps helps the moths, but obviously not the bats. In turn, some bats turn of the sound blips when they hear a moth, and glide in the last few feet. This also is an inherited behaviour.\n", "id": "331302", "title": "Releaser"}

A six-time Pro Bowl selection, Owens holds or shares several National Football League records, and features in the all-time top-five in several receiving categories, including yards and touchdowns. Owens played college football for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.\n\nOwens is also well known for the controversy he brings on and off the field. At one point, there were rumors that he attempted suicide, which Owens denied. Owens is now broke.\n\nOwens played college football for the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He wore #80 to honor Jerry Rice, whom Owens loved to watch as a child. Owens caught 38 passes for 724 yards and eight touchdowns during his sophomore year, and 34 passes for 357 yards and three touchdowns during his junior year. Owens faced double coverage every week during his senior year, and so only had 43 receptions for 667 yards and one touchdown. He also played in the Senior Bowl.\n\nIn his NFL career (lasted from 1996 to 2010), Owens showed much talent on the five teams he played for. However, he sparked even more controversy (arguments). Owens was known for his trash-talking, over-the top touchdown celebrations (often more to rub it in on the opponent than to fire his own team up), and off-field drama, where he has help several shirtless workouts, hosts a reality show (The T.O. Show), and has modeled for clothing companies. Despite all the attention he got, Owens has never won a Super Bowl. Owens is the only player to have scored on all 32 teams in the league. (He has actuall scored on them all at least twice.)\n\nOwens was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2nd Round of the 1996 NFL Draft. This united Owens with Jerry Rice. Owens's first career score came on a 45-yard touchdown from Steve Young against the Cincinnati Bengals to tie the game in a win. Owens later emerged as the #1 threat in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2000, Owens mocked (teased) the Dallas Cowboys after scoring twice from quarterback Jeff Garcia. Since the Cowboys were at home, Owens stood in celebration on the Dallas star twice. It resulted in Cowboys runningback Emmitt Smith slamming his helmet into the turf to get even after he himself scored. Owens scored for a second time, and went back to the star. However, defensive back George Teague knocking Owens off. Owens was called for unsportsmanlike conduct and was suspended for a week by his head coach, while Teague was ejected by the officials.\n\nLater moments with the 49ers included Owens grabbing pom-poms from 49ers cheerleaders and cheering with them, and taking a sharpie out of his sock to sign a touchdown ball.\n\nAfter a spat with some 49ers front office members, Owens and the team decided to part ways after the 2003 season. Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb wanted Owens to be an Eagle, as did many Eagles fans. Owens was actually traded to the Baltimore Ravens, but Owens challenged the 49ers' right to make the trade and made it clear he did not want to go to Baltimore. Owens eventually won the case, and was sent to the Philadelphia Eagles after the Ravens, 49ers, and Eagles agreed to a rare 3-team trade.\n\nOwens had a great season in 2004 on the field (caught 14 TDs), despite a broken leg by Cowboys safety Roy Williams. Owens's main celebration was copying the dance of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis in a win against the Ravens. T.O. helped the Philadelphia Eagles to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIX. However, Owens's controversy was at its high point. He had several feuds with McNabb and the Eagles managament. He was suspended b Phili for most of the 2005 season. That was the last of Owens's time with the Eagles.\n\nOwens signed a three year contract with the Dallas Cowboys in 2006. Owens (and star QB Tony Romo) enjoyed a good three years. Notable touchdown celebrations while with the Cowboys were sleeping on a ball and grabbing a fan's popcorn to dump down his facemask. The only other form of controversy while Owens was with the Cowboys was when he spit in the face of cornerback DeAngelo Hall, who had, according to Owens, been \"\"in his face all day.\" Owens was fined, but the two players made up with the help of Deion Sanders. Owens produced well through the rest of his time in Dallas, but was released after the 2008 season.\n\nOwens signed with the Buffalo Bills in 2009. He played fairly well during his lone season in Buffalo. He also caught a 98-yard touchdown pass, a career long. Owens, however, did not produce as Buffalo hoped when the payed him, and so he was not resigned. However, Owens was credited for not complaining at all publicly, especially since it would have been very easy because the Bills were doing so poorly.\n\nWith the Cincinnati Bengals, Owens and friend Chad Ochocinco, who had the same kind of touchdown celebrations, were on the same team. Owens led the Bengals (including Ochocinco) with 983 receiving yards, but was injured and missed the last two games of the 2010 season. Owens was not cleared to play until October of 2011. No one wanted to sign him.\n\nOwens signed with the Allen Wranglers of the Indoor Football League for their spring season of 2012. He was also their co-owner. Owens caught three touchdowns in his first game for the Wranglers. However, reports surfaced during this time that Owens was broke.\n\nTerrell Owens was born to L.C. Russel and Marilyn Heard in Alexander City, Alabama. When Terrell was very young, he lived with his mother and grandmother. He grew up with three other siblings. He enjoyed watching football, especially his favorite player, Jerry Rice. However, Owens’ grandmother did not allow him to play sports until high school. (Owens attended Benjamin Russell High School, where he did very well in football, baseball, and basketball.)\n\nTerrell Owens is married and is now a father to sons Terique, Atlin, plus daughters Kylee, and Dasha.\n\n", "id": "331405", "title": "Terrell Owens"}

A burnout is the fastest way to raise tire temperature before a race. It also cleans the tires of any debris and lays down a layer of rubber near the starting line for better traction. Drag race tracks sometimes use specially-reserved, wet-surface areas (burnout boxes) for burnouts.\n\nBurnouts are also common in informal street racing, usually for show value. As with all street racing activities, burnouts on public property are illegal in most countries but the severity of punishments vary. In New South Wales, for example, police have the power to confiscate the offending vehicle for 3 months for a first offense. \n\nIn March 2010, British Formula 1 World Champion, Lewis Hamilton had his Mercedes car impounded for allegedly performing a burnout in Melbourne, Australia while leaving the Albert Park Grand-Prix Circuit.\n\nBurnouts are also sometimes performed by winning drivers at the end of NASCAR races to celebrate their victory.\n\nBurnouts in front wheel drive vehicles are likely to result in damage to the wehicle.  They are usually achieved by holding the emergency brake (e-brake) to lock up the rear tires while flooring the gas pedal.  \nTo burnout in a rear wheel drive vehicle the driver usually has to press the gas and brake pedals at the same time.  The brake pedal will require modulation The goal is to allow the rear tires to spin while holding the car in place with the front wheels remaining motionless. At a certain point of balance, the front brakes will prevent the car from moving forward while the rear brakes will have insufficient grip to keep the wheels from spinning, because engine power is transferred to the rear wheels only.\n\nIt is possible to make rear-wheel drive burnouts easier by installing \"line locks\", devices which allow fluid pressure on the front brakes to be maintained while releasing the pedal to free the rear brakes. This is useful in a manual transmission vehicle, where it can be quite difficult to manipulate the clutch, brake and gas pedals simultaneously. Line locks also reduce wear to the rear brakes, a common problem otherwise.\n\nBurnouts are most difficult to perform in four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive cars, as they have better traction than FWD or RWD vehicles. It requires significantly more powerful engines to break all four tires loose at the same time and the tires will spin for only a short while before all four gain traction.\n\n", "id": "331410", "title": "Burnout"}

The phrase \"Krazy Kat\" originated there. It was the mouse's way of describing the cat. The strip is set in Herriman's vacation home of Coconino County, Arizona. \"Krazy Kat\" is mixture of offbeat surrealism, innocent playfulness, and poetic, idiosyncratic language. \n\nThe strip focuses on the curious love triangle between Krazy Kat, a carefree, simple-minded cat; Ignatz Mouse; and police dog, Offissa Bull Pupp. Krazy has an unrequited love for the mouse. Ignatz despises Krazy. He throws bricks at Krazy's head. Krazy thinks this is a sign of the Mouse's affection. Krazy utters grateful replies such as \"Li'l dollink, allus f'etful\".

Critic Gilbert Seldes wrote at length about the strip in 1924, calling it \"the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America today.\" Poet E. E.

His five volume \"Mécanique Céleste\" (Celestial Mechanics) (1799–1825) was a key work. In it, he changed the geometric study of classical mechanics to one based on calculus, which meant it could tackle a wider range of problems. In statistics, the so-called Bayesian interpretation of probability was mainly developed by Laplace. \n\nHe invented Laplace's equation, and pioneered the Laplace transform which is used in many branches of mathematical physics. The Laplacian differential operator, widely used in mathematics, is also named after him.\n\nLaplace's view on the origin of the Solar System is still ours today. He recognised, like Newton, that the key force in the Solar System was gravitation. Gravitation caused the coming together of gas and small particles into one central mass (which became the Sun) with other smaller groups (the planets), held to the central star by gravitation.\n\nLaplace proved that the small irregularities in planetary motion were self-correcting, and that the solar system as a whole was stable. This meant the solar system was going to exist in the present state for a very long time. He worked out some problems in the moon's orbit, and how the moon caused tides.\n\nLaplace also came close to getting the concept of the black hole. He pointed out that there could be massive stars whose gravity is so great that not even light could escape from their surface (see escape velocity). Laplace also speculated that some of the nebulae revealed by telescopes may not be part of the Milky Way and might actually be galaxies themselves. Thus, he anticipated Edwin Hubble's major discovery 100 years in advance.\n\n", "id": "331617", "title": "Pierre-Simon Laplace"}

Towns on the lake include: Yellowknife, Hay River, Behchoko, Fort Resolution, Lutselk'e, Hay River Reserve, Dettah and N'Dilo.\n\nNorth American Aboriginal Peoples were the first people to live around the lake. They built communities including Dettah, which still exists today. British fur trader Samuel Hearne explored the area in 1771 and crossed the frozen lake. He named it Lake Athapuscow. This was a misunderstanding of the name Athabaska. In 1897-1898, the American frontiersman Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones traveled to the Arctic Circle.\n\nIn the 1930s, gold was discovered there, and the city of Yellowknife was founded. It became the capital of the Northwest Territories. In 1967, an all-season highway was built around the lake, originally an extension of the Mackenzie Highway but now known as Yellowknife Highway or Highway 3. On January 24, 1978, a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite, named Kosmos 954 fell from orbit and broke apart. The satellite had an on board nuclear reactor.

He was one of the first to explore the study of mankind as an aspect of natural history. He used comparative anatomy to classify human races, of which he listed five.\n\nBlumenbach divided the human species into five races in 1779. Later he based them on the anatomy of the human skull. Blumenbach's work included the description of sixty skulls published as \"Decas craniorum\" (Göttingen 1790–1828). This was a founding work for other scientists.\n\nHe called the five races (1793/1795): \n\nHe did not think other races were inferior to the Caucasian race, and were potentially good members of society. \n\nAnatomical study led him to the conclusion that 'individual Africans differ as much, or even more, from other individual Africans as Europeans differ from Europeans'. Furthermore he thought that Africans were not inferior to the rest of mankind 'concerning healthy faculties of understanding, excellent natural talents and mental capacities'.\n\"Finally, I am of opinion that after all these numerous instances I have brought together of negroes of capacity, it would not be difficult to mention entire well-known provinces of Europe, from out of which you would not easily expect to obtain off-hand such good authors, poets, philosophers, and correspondents of the Paris Academy; and on the other hand, there is no so-called savage nation known under the sun which has so much distinguished itself by such examples of perfectibility and original capacity for scientific culture, and thereby attached itself so closely to the most civilized nations of the earth, as the Negro.\"\nThese ideas were far less influential. His ideas were adopted by other researchers and encouraged scientific racism. Blumenbach's work was used by many biologists and comparative anatomists in the nineteenth century who were interested in the origin of races: Wells, Lawrence, Prichard, Huxley and William Flower are good examples of his influence on human biology.\n\nRegarding human origins, Blumenbach believed the first humans had originated in Asia.\n", "id": "331650", "title": "Johann Friedrich Blumenbach"}

It was a very popular movie. It was also a very controversial movie. The movie showed African Americans and White anti-racists in a bad way. It also showed slavery and the Ku Klux Klan as good things. The movie was praised by President Woodrow Wilson. He said it was \"history written in lightning\". The NAACP boycotted the movie. Griffith responded to all the criticism with another movie, \"Intolerance\". This movie showed the dangers of prejudice. The movie did not make as much money as \"The Birth of a Nation\", but the critics liked it. Many of Griffith's later movies were critical successes. They did not make a lot of money.

By 1936, the Popular Front creates the \"\"sections d’aviation populaire\"\" (SAP), in order to democratize the flight training for young people and then to train more crew for the French military aviation. In 1946, the \"\"service de l’aviation légère et sportive\"\" (SALS) is created, which purpose is essentially to provide available aircraft and instructors for flying clubs.\n\nIn 1955, SALS becomes the \"\"service de la formation aéronautique et des sports aériens\"\" (SFASA), in 1959 the \"\"service de la formation aéronautique, du travail aérien et des transports\"\" (SFATAT), in 1964 it is renamed the \"\"service de la formation aéronautique\"\" (SFA) and finally the \"\"service de la formation aéronautique et du contrôle technique\"\" (SFACT) in 1976. These designations reflect the successive changes in the organization of the civil aviation administration, but also the direct involvement of the State, in flight training. Thus \"national centers\" will be created, in 1945, for the gliding activities (Challes-les-Eaux, Beynes, Pont-Saint-Vincent, etc.), and then for the flight in piston aircraft (Carcassonne in 1945, Saint-Yan in 1947), and even skydiving (Biscarosse in 1953).\n\nOver the years, the French civil aviation administration gradually withdraw from its activities in the field of gliding and skydiving.\nIn 1959, the center of Saint-Yan welcomes the first course of airline pilot students (EPL, \"Elève Pilote de ligne\", in English airline pilot student), ushering in a new mission of the SEFA : the training of airline pilots. The national centers were attached to the service of the civil aviation administration in charge of training. The creation of a single management structure was needed.\nThus was created the SEFA in 1993, bringing together under one organization all the necessary needs to implement the tasks entrusted by the DGAC. The direction of the SEFA moved to Muret in 1996, bringing together all central services previously scattered between Saint-Cyr-l'École and Paris.\n\nFinally, on the 1st of January 2011, the SEFA is merged with the French Civil Aviation University in order to create the biggest European aviation school.

In a win over North Texas, Flynn threw 7-of-7 for 139 yards and 3 TDs, all in the fourth quarter. In the 2005 SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, starting quarterback Russell was injured. Flynn finished the game. He was then made the main quarterback for the Tigers in the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl against the University of Miami Hurricanes. In that game, he led the Tigers to a 40-3 win over Miami.\n\nFlynn played in seven games as a junior. He completed 12 of 20 passes for 133 yards over the season. He had 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Both TDs came in a 49-0 win against Kentucky on October 14, 2006.\n\nWhen Russell was drafted by the Oakland Raiders, Flynn finally became a starter as a fifth-year senior. He started every game that season except the SEC Championship in which he was injured.\n\nFlynn threw a 22 yard TD pass to Demetrius Byrd to win the game against Auburn on October 20, 2007 with 1 second remaining on the clock. LSU won the game 30 - 24.\n\nHe then led the Tigers to a 4th quarter comeback against Alabama State University. The Tigers then beat Louisiana Tech the following weekend and became the #1 team in the nation. The next week the Tigers beat Ole Miss. In his final game at Tiger Stadium, the Tigers lost to Arkansas State University. With this loss, it was not likely the team could win the national title. However, LSU, without Flynn, beat Tennessee for the SEC Championship. This win by LSU and losses by Missouri State University and West Virginia State University let LSU go to the championship game in New Orleans.\n\nOn January 7, 2008, Flynn led LSU to a BCS National Championship. They beat Ohio State 38-24. Flynn was named offensive MVP of the game.\n\nFlynn was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 7th round (209th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft. On July 23, he was signed to a four-year contract through the 2011 season. He is now Green Bay's second-string quarterback. He won the back-up role to Aaron Rodgers by beating out fellow rookie and second-round pick Brian Brohm. The battle for the second-string position became the most interesting battle in camp. Flynn was seen as being less talented than Brohm because of Brohm's larger size, and better arm and foot speed.\n\nOn December 19, 2010, Flynn made his first NFL start against the New England Patriots because starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers was hurt. Flynn threw three touchdown passes. He threw one each to John Kuhn, James Jones and Greg Jennings against New England. He also threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Kyle Arrington. The Packers lost the game 31-27. Flynn completed 23 of 37 passes for 254 yards in the loss, and was praised for his good work\n\nOn January 1, 2012, the Packers were the #1 seed and rested most of their starting players., Matt Flynn started the final game of the season against the Detroit Lions. He threw for 480 yards and 6 touchdowns in the 45-41 victory. both of these statistics set all-time Green Bay Packers records, and got many other teams interested in signing Flynn as a starter.\n\nFlynn was signed by the Seattle Seahawks in mid-March of the 2012 offseason to a 3-year deal worth up to $26 million and $10 million guaranteed.\n\ntte\".

Lillian Gish's character is rescued from certain death on an icy river. \"Way Down East\" is the fourth highest grossing silent movie in movie history.

In \"Way Down East\", Griffith's psychotic nuttiness, for once, didn't get in the way of a good [movie].\"\n\nCritic Dennis Schwartz likes \"the strong emotional performances of the diminutive Lillian Gish\". He decides that \"this old-fashioned bucolic soap opera doesn't translate well to modern-times. It's quintessential Griffith melodrama, a mix of opposing forces between those favoring Bible morality and the wealthy hedonists who mock God with their amorality ... [the movie] has an irritating moralistic Bible flavor in supporting monogamy ...

He was a popular star of the silent movie era. In 1933, MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer fired the gay actor because he did not want to enter into a marriage of convenience. Haines never returned to movies. Instead, he started a successful interior design business with his lifelong male partner Jimmie Shields. \n\nHaines was born Charles William Haines on January 2, 1900 in Staunton, Virginia. He sang in the choir of Trinity Episcopal Church. He spent much time in the local movie theater. Haines ran away from home at 14 with his boyfriend. They opened a dance hall in Hopewell, Virginia. The Haines family found their son. He returned home to help support his sick father. He found his way to New York City. He joined the gay community in Greenwich Village. He did some modelling. He was discovered by a talent scout who sent him to Hollywood.\n\nHaines played bit parts in silent movies. His first good role was in \"Three Wise Fools\" in 1923. The critics liked him. MGM began promoting him as a future star. He generally played arrogant young men who are humbled at the end of the movie. \n\nHe took a trip to New York in 1926. He met James \"Jimmie\" Shields, probably as a pick-up on the street. Haines convinced Shields to move to Los Angeles. He promised to get Shields work as an extra. The two were soon living together. They viewed themselves as a committed couple.\n\nIn 1933 he was arrested in a YMCA with a sailor he had picked up in Los Angeles. MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer told Haines to choose between a marriage with a woman or Jimmie Shields. Haines chose Shields. They stayed together for almost 50 years. Mayer fired Haines and ended his contract. \n\nHaines had many movie hits. He was a top-five box office star from 1928 to 1932. A 1930 survey of film exhibitors listed Haines as the top box office attraction in the country. \"The Marines are Coming\" was his last movie. It was made in a Poverty Row studio in 1934. Haines was blacklisted in Hollywood for moral corruption.\n\nHaines and Shields began careers as interior designers and antique dealers. Hollywood celebrities went to their businesses. In 1936, neighbors accused the two men of seeking sex with their son. Members of the Ku Klux Klan dragged Haines and Shields from their home. They were beaten. Their close friends wanted them to prosecute. They declined. Haines served in World War II. The couple settled into the Hollywood community in Brentwood. Their business made money and they retired in the early 1970s. \n\nHaines and Shields remained together for the rest of their lives. Joan Crawford described them as \"the happiest married couple in Hollywood.\" Haines died from lung cancer in Santa Monica, California at the age of 73. Soon afterward, Shields, who suffered from what many believe to have been Alzheimer's disease, put on Haines' pajamas, took an overdose of pills, and crawled into their bed to die. They were buried side by side in Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Haines Designs is still in operation. Its main offices are in West Hollywood with showrooms in New York, Denver, and Dallas. Haines's life story is told in the 1998 biography \"Wisecracker: The Life and Times of William Haines, Hollywood's First Openly Gay Star\" by William J. Mann. Haines's designs are the subject of Peter Schifando and Haines associate Jean H. Mathison's 2005 book \"Class Act: William Haines Legendary Hollywood Decorator\".

The history of batik is really expressive. There are a lot of techniques available for the artist to have the opportunity to explore a unique process in an exciting way.\n\nTo make a batik, they use the cloth as the paper, and they just start drawing hot wax over the cloth. And they said if we repeated the process, it will be more colorful. For the first step, make sure the cloth is washed. Batik patterns are drawn with pencil and later drawn again using a hot wax. The very common thing that people use is the pen-like instrument called a tjanting. After the cloth is dry, the areas keep their original color, and it also shows the pattern between the areas that have the color and do not have the color. It gives them a pattern. Then the artist repeats the process once for each color. A very traditional type of batik, called written batik, is drawn using only a tjanting. The cloth needs to be drawn on both sides and put in a color bath three or four times. The process may take up to a year.\n", "id": "332136", "title": "Batik"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332239", "text": "Machinima\n\nMachinima ( or ) is a type of animation and digital moviemaking style. It is the use of 3D computer graphics with a 3D video game or computer game to create the 3D animation. The creator who is making the video will record in-game animation and edit it with voice recordings. Machinima can be script-driven, meaning the cameras, characters, and effects are scripted for playback in real time. Unlike other types of animation, the scripting is driven by events and not keyframes.\n\n\"Machinima\" limits the controls of other animation types. This is according to Machinima.org. For example, \"Machinima\" videos can be shot live or scripted in real time. So it becomes much faster to produce than traditionally animated movies.\n\n\"Machinima\" productions can remain close to their gaming roots and feature stunts or other portrayals of gameplay. Popular genres include dance videos, comedy, and drama. Alternatively, some filmmakers attempt to stretch the boundaries of the rendering engines or to mask the original 3-D context. The Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences (AMAS), a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting machinima, recognizes exemplary productions through Mackie awards given at its annual Machinima Film Festival. Some general film festivals accept machinima, and game companies, such as Epic Games, Blizzard Entertainment and Jagex, have sponsored contests involving it.\\\n\nThe AMAS defines machinima as \"animated filmmaking within a real-time virtual 3-D environment\". In other 3-D animation methods, creators can control every frame and nuance of their characters but, in turn, must consider issues such as key frames and in-betweening. Machinima creators leave many rendering details to their host environments, but may thus inherit those environments' limitations. Because game animations focus on dramatic rather than casual actions, the range of character emotions is often limited. However, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that a small range of emotions is often sufficient, as in successful Japanese anime television series.\n\nAnother difference is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. Real-time engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film \"\", every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; real-time needs would likely force them to be treated as a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with real-time animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.\n\nLike live action, machinima is recorded in real-time, and real people can act and control the camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host environment may allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create a scene from the 1942 live-action film \"Casablanca\". Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.\nBerkeley sees machinima as \"a strangely hybrid form, looking forwards and backwards, cutting edge and conservative at the same time\". Machinima is a digital medium based on 3-D computer games, but most works have a linear narrative structure. Some, such as \"Red vs. Blue\" and \"The Strangerhood\", follow narrative conventions of television situational comedy. Nitsche agrees that pre-recorded (\"reel\") machinima tends to be linear and offers limited interactive storytelling; he sees more opportunities in machinima performed live and with audience interaction. In creating their improvisational comedy series \"On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack\" and talk show \"Tra5hTa1k with ILL Will\", the ILL Clan blended real and virtual performance by creating the works on-stage and interacting with a live audience. In another combination of real and virtual worlds, Chris Burke's talk show \"This Spartan Life\" takes place in \"Halo 2\"s open multiplayer environment. There, others playing in earnest may attack the host or his interviewee. Although other virtual theatrical performances have taken place in chat rooms and multi-user dungeons, machinima adds \"cinematic camera work\". Previously, such virtual cinematic performances with live audience interaction were confined to research labs which had powerful computers. \n\nMachinima can be less expensive than other forms of filmmaking. Strange Company produced its feature-length machinima film \"BloodSpell\" for less than £10,000. Before using machinima, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum of Rooster Teeth Productions spent US$9,000 to produce a live-action independent film; in contrast, the four Xbox game consoles used to make \"Red vs. Blue\" in 2005 cost $600. The low cost caused a product manager for Electronic Arts to compare machinima to the low-budget independent film \"The Blair Witch Project\", without the need for cameras and actors. Because these are seen as low barriers to entry, machinima has been called a \"democratization of filmmaking\". Berkeley weighs increased participation and a blurred line between producer and consumer against concerns that game copyrights limit commercialization and growth of machinima.\n\nComparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual platforms like Second Life have indicated that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre has resulted in the involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a juror for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.\n\nKelland, Morris, and Lloyd list four main methods of creating machinima. From simple to advanced, these are: relying on the game's AI to control most actions, digital puppetry, recamming, and precise scripting of actions. Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating the realization of a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced \"The Strangerhood\" using \"The Sims 2\", a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.\n\nIn digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each crew member controls a character in real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured from the perspectives of one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the \"Halo\" series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts \"This Spartan Life\" in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series \"On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack\" and Rooster Teeth Productions' \"Red vs. Blue\". In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.\n\nA technique common in cut scenes of video games, scripting consists of giving precise directions to the game engine. A filmmaker can work alone this way, as J. Thaddeus \"Mindcrime\" Skubis did in creating the nearly four-hour \"The Seal of Nehahra\" (2000), the longest work of machinima at the time. However, perfecting scripts can be time-consuming. Unless what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing is available, as in \"\", changes may need to be verified in additional runs, and non-linear editing may be difficult. In this respect, Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd compare scripting to stop-motion animation. Another disadvantage is that, depending on the game, scripting capabilities may be limited or unavailable. Matinee, a machinima software tool included with \"Unreal Tournament 2004\", popularized scripting in machinima.\n\nWhen \"Diary of a Camper\" was created, no software tools existed to edit demo files into films. Rangers clan member Eric \"ArchV\" Fowler wrote his own programs to reposition the camera and to splice footage from the \"Quake\" demo file. \"Quake\" movie editing software later appeared, but the use of conventional non-linear video editing software is now common. For example, Phil South inserted single, completely white frames into his work \"No Licence\" to enhance the visual impact of explosions. In the post-production of \"\", Rooster Teeth Productions added letterboxing with Adobe Premiere Pro to hide the camera player's head-up display.\n\nMachinima creators have used different methods to handle limited character expression. In the \"Halo\" video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game \"Neverwinter Nights\". Similarly, Atussa Simon used a \"library of faces\" for characters in \"The Battle of Xerxes\". In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" and Valve Corporation's FacePoser for \"Half-Life 2\". Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film \"Berlin Assassins\". It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film \"Not Just Another Love Story\".\n\n", "id": "332239", "title": "Machinima"}

Warner Bros. released a remake in 3D on April 2, 2010. Many big stars were in the movie including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Ursula Andress.\n\nKing Acrisius of Argos (Donald Houston) has his daughter Danaë (Vida Taylor) imprisoned in a tower, out of jealousy for her beauty. However, Zeus (Laurence Olivier), king of the Greek gods, impregnates her and the product of this affair is Perseus. Fearing that his grandson will one day grow up to kill him, Acrisius has both mother and child set out to sea in a wooden chest, in the hopes of killing them. However, out of revenge, Zeus has Acrisius killed and orders the sea god Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) to release the last of the Titans, a giant humanoid sea monster called the Kraken, to destroy Argos. Meanwhile, Danaë and Perseus miraculously survive and land on the island of Seriphos, where Perseus grows into a young man.\n\nCalibos (Neil McCarthy) is a young man who is the son of the sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith) and due to be married to Andromeda (Judi Bowker), daughter of Queen Cassiopeia (Siân Phillips) and heiress to the throne of Joppa; however, he has killed off every living thing in the Wells of the Moon (which he was entrusted to guard), among them Zeus' sacred herd of winged horses (except for Pegasus). To punish him, Zeus transforms Calibos into a monstrous satyr and has him exiled by his people. In retribution, Thetis transports the adult Perseus (Harry Hamlin) to an abandoned amphitheatre in Joppa where he encounters the aged poet Ammon (Burgess Meredith) from whom he learns that Andromeda is under a curse and is unable to marry unless her suitors can correctly answer a riddle; those who fail are burned at the stake. To aid his son, Zeus sends Perseus an invisibility helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood), a magic sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress) and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). Wearing the helmet, Perseus manages to capture Pegasus and follows Andromeda to learn the next riddle. Calibos nearly kills Perseus, but he escapes, losing his helmet in the process and also managing to sever Calibos' hand.\n\nWith the help of Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith), Perseus presents himself as a suitor and correctly answers the riddle, presenting Calibos' severed hand and winning the hand of Andromeda in marriage. When Calibos finds his mother cannot act against Perseus, he commands her to take vengeance on Joppa. When Cassiopeia compares her daughter's beauty to that of Thetis', the enraged goddess demands that Andromeda must be sacrificed to the Kraken or Joppa will be destroyed. \n\nWhile Perseus tries to find a way to conquer the Kraken, Pegasus is captured by Calibos' henchmen. Zeus commands Athena to give her owl Bubo to Perseus, but she convinces the gods' blacksmith Hephaestus (Pat Roach) to create a golden replica instead, who leads Perseus to a trio of hags called the Stygian Witches (Flora Robson, Anna Manahan and Freda Jackson), who have one tooth and eye between them. By taking their magic eye, Perseus forces them to reveal that the only way for the Kraken to be killed is by killing the gorgon, Medusa, who lives on an island at the edge of the Underworld. The group continues on their journey, minus Andromeda and Ammon, who return to Joppa. \n\nWhile on the Gorgon's island, Perseus and his companions are attacked by Dioskilos, Medusa's two-headed hellhound. During the fight, one of the party is killed by the beast, before he is eventually slain by Perseus. He leads his two remaining allies into the gorgon's lair, where Medusa herself kills the two men, shooting one of them with an arrow and petrifying the other. Perseus uses his shield's reflective side to deceive Medusa and decapitates her. He collects her head, but his shield is dissolved by the gorgon's caustic blood. \n\nAs Perseus and his party set to return they are attacked by Calibos, who punctures the bag containing Medusa's severed head, and three giant scorpions called Scorpiochs rise out of the blood. They attack Thallo, who managed to kill one of the scorpions, who Calibos later kills. Perseus slays the two remaining scorpions and Calibos, and later grieves for Thallo. Weakened from his fight, Perseus sends Bubo to rescue the captive Pegasus. Bubo succeeds in freeing the horse and he also manages to destroy Calibos' camp. Perseus manages to reach the Joppa amphitheater, but collapses from exhaustion. Andromeda is chained to the cliffs near Joppa and the Kraken is summoned. Bubo arrives and diverts the monster's attention until Perseus (whose strength was secretly restored by Zeus) arrives, mounted on Pegasus. In the battle, he uses Medusa's head to turn the Kraken to stone, causing to crumble into pieces. Perseus then throws Medusa's head into the ocean, frees Andromeda and subsequently marries her.\n\nThe gods predict that Perseus and Andromeda will live happily for the rest of the lives and have children. Zeus also forbids the gods from pursuing vengeance against them. The constellations of Perseus, Andromeda, Cassiopeia and Pegasus are created in their honor. \n", "id": "332258", "title": "Clash of the Titans"}

He led the way in the use of special effects, multiple exposures, time-lapse photography, dissolves, and hand-painted colour in his work. His movies include \"Conquest of the Pole\", \"A Trip to the Moon\", and \"The Impossible Voyage\". These movies involve strange, surreal voyages, like those in Jules Verne's books. These movies are among the most important early science fiction movies. Méliès's \"The Haunted Castle\" is an early horror movie.\n\nMéliès was born in Paris, France in 1861. He liked drawing and playing with a puppet theater as a child. He went to the theater often as a young man. About 1888, Méliès bought the Théatre Robert-Houdin and worked there as a magician. He became obsessed with moviemaking after seeing a movie by Antoine Lumière in 1895. In May 1896, he acquired his own movie camera and set up a movie studio. At the end of 1896, he formed a new company, Star Film.\n\nMéliès began making movies that were three to nine minute long. He wrote, designed, filmed, and acted in nearly all of his movies. He liked putting magic tricks into his movies. While filming a street scene one day, the camera stopped briefly. When Méliès looked at the movie later, he noticed that at the moment of the break, the bus he had been filming suddenly disappeared and new vehicles replaced it. Making items appear and disappear by stopping and starting the camera would become one of his most commonly used movie tricks. \n\nIn 1902, Méliès produced his first masterpiece, \"A Trip to the Moon\". It was inspired by several works of the time that speculated about life on the moon. H.G. Wells and Jules Verne wrote about space travel, for instance, and Offenbach composed an opera about a trip to the moon. \"Trip\" was a huge success in France. Méliès hoped to make a fortune showing it in the United States. Thomas Edison and other moviemakers made copies of \"Trip\" however, and made money on Méliès's work.

It is about north of Uluṟu. The lake is 180 km long and 10 km wide. It is the largest salt lake in the Northern Territory. Because of the dryness of the area, the lake is usually a dry salt crust. When it rains enough, water flows through it towards the east. It eventually connects to the Finke River. Lake Amadeus holds up to 600 million tonnes of salt. The groundwater soaks into the ground, and the lake supports several reliable springs.\n\nThe first European to find the lake was the explorer Ernest Giles in 1872. He had seen Kata Tjuta from far away and was making his way there. The lake blocked his path. He could not go over it because the dry lake bed was not able to hold the weight of his horses. He described the lake as \"an infernal lake of mud and brine\". Giles was going to name it \"Lake Ferdinand\" after Baron Ferdinand von Mueller. But Mueller asked Giles to instead name it after King Amadeus I of Spain. Amadeus had honoured Mueller a few years before.\n\nLake Amadeus is on Aboriginal land, and is covered by the Katiti and Petermann Aboriginal Land Trusts.\n", "id": "332429", "title": "Lake Amadeus"}

He is remembered for his role in the horror movie \"Nosferatu\" (1922).\n\nSchreck was born in Berlin-Friedenau, on 6 September 1879. He received his training at the \" (the State Theatre of Berlin). He completed his studies in 1902. He made his stage debut in Meseritz and Speyer. He then toured Germany for two years appearing at theatres in Zittau, Erfurt, Bremen, Lucerne, Gera, and Frankfurt am Main. Schreck then joined Max Reinhardt's company of performers in Berlin. Many of Reinhardt's troupe made a significant contribution to movies.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1922, Schreck appeared at the Munich Kammerspiele. He had a role in the expressionist production of Bertolt Brecht's debut, \" (\"Drums in the Night\"). He played the \"freakshow landlord\" Glubb. During this time he also worked on his first movie \"Der Richter von Zalamea\". In 1921, he was hired by Prana Film for their first and only movie, \"Nosferatu\". The company declared itself bankrupt after the movie was released. They did not want to pay copyright infringement costs to \"Dracula\" author Bram Stoker's widow. Schreck portrayed Count Orlok in the movie. The character was very similar to Count Dracula.\n\nIn 1923, Schreck was still in Munich. He appeared in a 16-minute (one-reeler) slapstick, \"surreal comedy\" written by Bertolt Brecht entitled ' (\"Mysteries of a Barbershop\"). Schreck appeared as a blind man in the film ' (\"The Street\") the same year.\n\nSchreck's second collaboration with \"Nosferatu\" director F. W. Murnau was the 1924 comedy \"\" (\"The Grand Duke's Finances\"). Murnau did not like the final product.\n\nIn 1926, Schreck returned to the Kammerspiele in Munich. He continued to act in movies. He made the transition to \"talkies\". He died in 1936 in Munich of a heart attack. On 19 February 1936, Schreck had just played The Grand Inquisitor in the play \"\". That evening he felt unwell. The doctor sent him to the hospital where he died early the next morning His obituary praised his role as The Miser in Molière's comedy play. He was buried on 14 March 1936 at Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof in Berlin.\n\nSchreck was married to actress Fanny Normann. She appeared in a few movies. She was often credited as Fanny Schreck. The word \"schreck\" is also the German word for \"fright\", or \"terror\". Because of this, many authors who were unaware of Schreck's on-stage credits (and ignorant of the rather sparse details of his personal life) speculated that there was really no such person, and that Schreck was, in fact, some well-known actor who had chosen to adopt a pseudonym for his role in \"Nosferatu\". One of the prime \"suspects\" was Alfred Abel; however, a careful examination of the photographs of these two actors is sufficient to dispel such notions.\n\nSchreck's contemporaries recalled he was a loner with an unusual sense of humor. He was skilled in playing grotesque characters. One reported he lived in \"a remote and strange world\". He was said to spend time walking through dark forests.\n\nThe person and performance of Max Schreck in \"Nosferatu\" has been fictionalized by actor Willem Dafoe in E. Elias Merhige's \"Shadow of the Vampire\". In a sort of secret history, \"Shadow\" posits that Schreck actually \"was\" a vampire.\n\nScriptwriter Daniel Waters created the character Max Shreck for the film \"Batman Returns\" and compared him to the character Max Schreck played in \"Nosferatu\". \"Variety\" claimed the name was an in-joke. Shreck was a character created exclusively for the movie, absent from the comics, and serves as one of the main antagonists.\n\n\n", "id": "332455", "title": "Max Schreck"}

Cyrus's silly friend Monty (William Austin) notices Betty. She uses him to get closer to Cyrus. \n\nWhen she finally gets Cyrus's attention, she convinces him to take her on a date to Coney Island. He has a wonderful time. He tries to kiss her on the way home. Betty Lou slaps his face. She hurries out of his car and into her flat. She then peeks out her window at him as he drives away.\n\nBetty bravely proclaims herself as an unmarried mother to protect her sickly roommate Molly (Priscilla Bonner) from having her baby taken away by a couple of meddling welfare workers. Monty arrives at just the wrong moment, forcing Betty to continue the charade with him. He tells Cyrus. Although he is in love with her, Cyrus offers her an \"arrangement\" that includes everything but marriage. Betty Lou, shocked and humiliated, refuses, quits her job, and resolves to forget Cyrus. When she learns from Monty about Cyrus's misunderstanding, she fumes, and vows to teach her former beau a lesson.\n\nWhen Cyrus hosts a yachting excursion, Betty Lou makes Monty take her along, masquerading as \"Miss Van Cortland\". Cyrus at first wants to remove her from the ship, but he cannot long resist Betty Lou's \"it\" factor; he eventually corners her and proposes marriage, but she gets him back, by telling him that she'd \"rather marry his office boy\", which accomplishes her goal, but breaks her heart. \n\nHe then learns the truth about the baby, and leaves Monty at the helm of the yacht to go find her. Monty crashes the yacht into a fishing boat, tossing both Betty Lou and Adela into the water. Betty Lou saves Adela, punching her in the face when she panics and threatens to drown them both. At the end of the movie, she and Cyrus reconcile on the anchor of the yacht, with the first two letters of the ship's name, \"Itola\", between them.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332512", "text": "Aboriginal land rights in Australia\n\nAboriginal land rights in Australia are the special set of rights given to Indigenous Australians to own land. There are many different types of land rights laws. They all allow the government to grant land to indigenous (native) Australians under many different conditions (terms). Land rights schemes are in place in the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. Under these laws, the title to the land is normally given to a community or ethnic group, not an individual. Usually, land that has been granted in a land rights claim can not be sold, traded, or mortgaged. Grants will be normally require that the land be passed down to future generations through inheritance.\n\nThe passing of Aboriginal land rights laws in Australia was caused by many important Aboriginal protests. It was not until the 1970s, though, that there came an \"organised\" movement for the recognition of Aboriginal land rights.\n\nOn 1 May 1946, more than 800 Aboriginal stockmen in the Pilbara region of Western Australia went on strike. They demanded wages for their work. They were joined by other Aboriginal workers from the towns of Port Hedland and Marble Bar. The strike ended in 1949.\n\nIn 1963, the government turned part of the Yolngu people's traditional lands (in Arnhem Land) into a bauxite mine. The Yolngu started a petition (now called the Yirrkala bark petitions) to demand the rights to these lands. The petition was turned into a legal case. Mining went ahead anyway, and the legal case went on for 41 years. The Yolngu were finally made a part of the agreement between the government and the mining company in 2011.\n\nIn 1964 and 1965, students from the University of Sydney formed a group called the Student Action for Aboriginals. They travelled into New South Wales country towns to research segregation between native and non-native people. They led protests to get people to know about the issue of Aboriginal civil rights. It became known as the Freedom Ride movement. At the time, Aboriginal people were not counted in the census and their civil rights were different to white citizens. This changed in 1967, when a referendum gave Aborigines the same rights as white Australians.\n\nThe Wave Hill walkoff was in August 1966. A total of 200 Gurindji stockmen and servants at Wave Hill cattle station went on strike to demand wages and the return of some of their traditional lands. The strike went for nine years. The demand was not met, but the Gurindji stayed camped on their traditional country. They chose to break the state's law but obey their own. It raised popular support for Aboriginal land rights. Supporters in the cities rallied for the Gurindji and eventually they won title to part of their land.\n\nIn 1973, an Aboriginal Land Rights Commission was created in the Northern Territory. This royal commission said that the government should recognise Aboringal Land Rights, and gave advice for passing laws on it. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam took the advice and brought a Land Rights Bill to parliament. It was changed by the next prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, and passed by the Governor-General on 16 December 1976.\n\nIn 1976, the Territory government passed the first Aboriginal land rights law in the country. It allowed Aboriginal people in the Territory to claim rights to land that their ancestors had lived on before the arrival of white people. Groups that made claims had to show proof of their traditional (historical) association with the land. This ended up giving almost 50% of land in the Northern Territory (around ) to native groups. Before this act, there had been many \"indigenous reserves\" in the Northern Territory. This land was owned by the government and set aside for Aboriginal people to live on until they were assimilated into white society. When the act was put into effect, the old \"reserves\" were given to the Aboriginal groups living on them without them having to make a claim.\n", "id": "332512", "title": "Aboriginal land rights in Australia"}

He was drafted by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He played college football at Michigan.\n\nIn 2005, as a freshman, Manningham had 27 receptions for 433 yards and six touchdowns, including the game-winning catch as time expired in the game against Penn State, handing the Lions their only loss that season.\n\nManningham finished 2006 with a total 38 receptions 703 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week two weeks in a row, first against Notre Dame and then against Wisconsin.\n\nManningham had a total of 72 receptions for 1,174 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2007.\n\nAfter the 2007 season, Manningham opted to forgo (forget, not do) his eligibility for his senior year in 2008 and entered the NFL Draft. He finished his career at Michigan with 137 receptions for 2,310 yards and 27 touchdowns. Those marks (in order) placed him ninth, fifth, and fourth in school history.\n\nManningham was selected in the third round (95th overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.\n\nDuring rookie training camp, Manningham said that he looked forward to playing with fellow former Michigan Wolverine Amani Toomer, who was with New York at the time. Manningham signed a four-year deal worth up to $2.3 million as a rookie.\n\nManningham has been working on his punt return abilities and competed for the punt returner spot in 2009.\n\nManningham kicked off the 2009 NFL season by catching three passes for 58 yards and a touchdown en route to the Giants' 23-17 win over the Washington Redskins. He followed this up by catching 10 passes for 150 yards and a juggling sliding catch for a touchdown in the Giants' 33-31 win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nManningham became the starting wide receiver opposite Steve Smith after fellow receiver Domenik Hixon was injured in a Week 2 game against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nManningham let Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks take much of his playing time, and Manningham was only the #3 wideout in 2011.\n\nOn February 5, 2012, Manningham made a catch in the fourth quarter of Superbowl XLVI to set up the win against the Patriots. Trailing by 2 points with 3 minutes 46 seconds remaining, the Giants started the winning drive. Eli Manning lofted a long pass down the left sideline to Mario Manningham, who kept his feet inbounds by inches with two defenders around him. The Giants went on to beat the New England Patriots 21-17. Manningham ended the game with 5 catches for 73 yards. Most people think that he will not return to the Giants.\n\nManningham had reportedly been removed from \"multiple teams'\" draft boards due to alleged marijuana use in college. Mario denied testing positive at first, then sent a letter to all 32 teams saying he lied. Manningham claimed he failed two drug tests. Bob McGinn of the \"Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel\" reported that Manningham scored a 6 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam. This along with several other problems caused his draft value to drop.\n\n", "id": "332517", "title": "Mario Manningham"}

It was distributed by United Artists. It premiered on May 13, 1919. \n\nIt tells the story of a young girl who is abused by her alcoholic father. She meets a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. The movie is based on Thomas Burke's short story \"The Chink and the Child\". \n\nIn 1996, \"Broken Blossoms\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nCheng Huan (Richard Barthelmess) leaves his native China. He \"dreams to spread the gentle message of Buddha to the Anglo-Saxon lands.\" His idealism fades in London’s brutal and gritty inner-city. He meets and grows devoted to the \"broken blossom\" Lucy Burrows (Lillian Gish). She is the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of prizefighter Battling Burrows (Donald Crisp).\n\nAfter being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in the beautiful and exotic room above Cheng's shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. When Lucy’s father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts, he drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her brutal father.\n\nBy the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, it is too late. Lucy’s lifeless body lies on her bed as her father drinks in another room. Cheng gazes at Lucy’s youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence. Her father enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling Burrows lunges for Cheng with a hatchet. Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy’s body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the stomach.\n\nThe most-discussed scene in \"Broken Blossoms\" is the \"closet\" scene. Gish writhes in the claustrophobic space like a tortured animal who knows there is no escape. Critic Richard Schickel writes, \"It is heartbreaking – yet for the most part quite delicately controlled by the actress. Barthelmess reports that her hysteria was induced by Griffith’s taunting of her. Gish claims that she improvised the child’s tortured movements on the spot and that when she finished the scene there was a hush on stage. Griffith then exclaimed, 'My God, why didn’t you warn me you were going to do that?'”. The scene also demonstrates Griffith's ability to create an aural effect with only an image. Gish's screams apparently attracted such a crowd outside the studio that people needed to be held back.\n", "id": "332518", "title": "Broken Blossoms"}

It is a prequel to \"Monsters, Inc.\" that has Sulley and Mike at university before they became friends. It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their voice-roles as Sulley, Mike, and Randall for the movie.\n\n\nA second movie of \"Monsters, Inc.\" had been planned since 2005. Following disagreements between then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner and then-Pixar owner Steve Jobs, Disney (who at the time owned the rights to make sequels to all of Pixar's films until the movie \"Cars\" was released) announced that a sequel to \"Monsters, Inc.\" would be made by Circle 7 Animation. Circle 7 were also working on an early draft of \"Toy Story 3\" at the time.\n\nThe movie was originally going to be named \"Monsters, Inc. 2: Lost in Scaradise\". The movie would have been about Mike and Sulley visiting the human world to give Boo a birthday present. However, they find out that she had moved to a different house. After getting trapped in the human world, Mike and Sulley split up after disagreeing on what to do (Sulley wanting to look for Boo, Mike wanting to find a way to get back to Monstropolis).\n\nScreenwriters Rob Muir and Bob Hilgenberg were hired to write the script. They storyboarded an early draft of the script.\n\nA sequel made by Pixar was officially announced in 2010. The movie was originally planned to be released on November 16, 2012. However, it was later changed to November 2, 2012 (eleven years to the day after the release of its predecessor) to avoid direct competition with \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2\". On April 5, 2011, it was announced that the film's release date had been pushed back farther to June 21, 2013 due to the success of Pixar movies that are released in the summer. This is according to Disney distribution executive Chuck Viane. It will be the studios' fourteenth feature film.\n\nIn early 2011, there were claims that \"Monsters, Inc. 2\" was going to be a prequel which focuses on Sulley and Mike's studies at the University of Fear, where they start off as rivals but soon become best friends. This is similar to how Woody and Buzz Lightyear start off in the first \"Toy Story\". On March 29, 2011, it was confirmed that the movie will indeed be a prequel and the new title \"Monsters University\" was shown. The movie will be directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae. It was also announced that John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi will be reprising their roles. New voice cast includes Dave Foley, Julia Sweeney, Joel Murray, and Peter Sohn.\n\nOn August 12, 2011 Billy Crystal went to a 20th anniversary screening of \"City Slickers\". When he was asked about his return to the role of Mike Wazowski he said, \"That's why I'm a little hoarse. I spent five-and-a-half hours today for our fourth session on \"Monsters Inc. 2\".\" Crystal has said that he and co-star John Goodman are having a blast together and describes the script as \"really great\" and \"hilarious\". Crystal also gave little details of the story of the movie. He described, \"It's college pranks with monsters. And I wear a retainer.

For example, Sodium is a metal element that can bond with many other elements, like chlorine (forming common table salt: NaCl), or hydrogen and oxygen (Sodium hydroxide). The reason for this is that the way that atoms bond with each other is similar to a jigsaw puzzle: Only the proper shape can fit into the empty space made by the other pieces. However, with atoms, it's a bit different. For each element, the atom carries a certain number of electrons in orbit around its nucleus. Sometimes these orbits are split into levels, and only a certain number of electrons can fill each orbit before moving to a higher orbit. \n\nSometimes, an orbit level is not filled all the way and can only be filled with electrons from another element with a smaller number of electrons in a higher level. When the atoms bond together, the electrons are traded between the two equally and create a very strong bond.\n\nHowever, there are a few elements that cannot bond with many other elements, because they have orbits that are already filled, or nearly filled, equally. (Like a finished jigsaw puzzle) These elements can sometimes be poisonous to a human, and cannot be removed easily (for example, mercury.)

For humans in particular, see human gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe canal (or tube) is in bilaterian animals. It carries food through digestion and excretion. Into the tube come various digestive enzymes. Gut flora also help digestion.Intestinal flora helps in production of vitamins. Muscular movements pass the material down the tube. The gut usually has an exit, the anus, by which the animal disposes of solid wastes. Some small animals have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means, for example through the mouth.\n\nAnimals that have guts are classified as either protostomes or deuterostomes, as the gut evolved twice, an example of convergent evolution. They are distinguished by the development of their embryos. Protostomes develop their mouths first, while deuterostomes develop their mouths second. Protostome include arthropods, molluscs, and annelids, while deuterostomes include echinoderms and chordates. \n", "id": "332616", "title": "Alimentary canal"}

It has cilia and a diffuse nervous system. The animal is up to long, and has been found off the coasts of Sweden, Scotland and Iceland.\n\nThe association of specimens of \"Xenoturbella\" with mollusc larva has led many to suggest that they are molluscivores.

He was the son of King Frederick V of Denmark and Louise of Great Britain. \n\nHe lost his mother at the age of three. His stepmother, Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, did not take an interest in him, and preferred her own son, Frederik. Christian suffered from epileptic seizures. His educator, Count Detlev of Reventlow, educated him very severely, locking him up in dark chambers for hours at times. Starting at an early age, Christian showed signs of mental illness. At age 17, he was married to his cousin, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Caroline Matilde bore a son, the future King Frederick VI of Denmark. \n\nWhen he became king, his cabinet ruled, much like in his father's time. The cabinet was led by Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff. When he toured Europe, he met Johann Friedrich Struensee, a medical doctor, who was influenced by the ideas of Enlightenment. Struensee soon gained influence at the court. Struensee initiated a number of liberal reforms. He also became the lover of queen Louise, who Christan neglected. In the year 1771, Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark was born. People think that Struensee was probably her father. Struensee was executed on 28 April 1772 outside the gates of Copenhagen. The queen was banned from the court. One of the last decrees of Struensee was to create the town of Christiansfeld, where people from the Moravian Church found shelter.\n\nAfter the execution, Ove Høegh-Guldberg led the kingdom, supported by Queen Juliane and her son. Many of Struensee's reforms were undone. Andreas Peter Bernstorff stepped down in 1780. In the year 1784, Christian's son Frederick took power, reigning in the place of his father. Frederick was influenced by Enligtenment, and made a number of reforms; for example, the abolition of serfdom. Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann was made minister of finances. Together with Christian Ditlev Reventlow they boosted trade. Von Bernstorff returned to power in 1784, and was a strong supporter of the neutrality of Denmark. There was an economic boom.\n\nChristian VII died in 1808 as a result of a stroke.\n", "id": "332633", "title": "Christian VII of Denmark"}

The son of a general from County Waterford in Ireland, he regarded himself as Anglo-Irish. \n\nHe served in the Indian rebellion, the Expedition to Abyssinia and the Second Anglo-Afghan War before leading British Forces to success in the Second Boer War. He also became the last Commander-in-Chief of the Forces before the post was abolished in 1904.\n\nRoberts was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions on 2 January 1858 at Khudaganj. The citation reads:\n\nIn an important speech in Manchester on 22 October 1912 Roberts warned of the threat posed by Germany:\n\nIn the year 1912, just as in 1866 and just as in 1870, war will take place the instant the German forces by land and sea are, by their superiority at every point, as certain of victory as anything in human calculation can be made certain...We may stand still. Germany always advances and the direction of her advance, the line along which she is moving, is now most manifest. It is towards...complete supremacy by land and sea.\n\nHe claimed that Germany was making enormous efforts to prepare for war and ended his speech by saying:\n\nGentlemen, I say, “Arm and prepare to acquit yourselves like men, for the day of your ordeal is at hand”.\n\nThis speech was much criticised in the liberal and radical press, such as the \"Manchester Guardian\". Much later, a historian said: \"At this distance of time the verdict upon Lord Robert's Manchester speech must be that, in speaking out clearly on the probability of war, he was doing a patriotic service comparable to Churchill's during the Thirties\".\n\nRoberts died on November 14, 1914. He died of pneumonia. He got sick when he was visiting British troops. Few non-royal people in four centuries have been given a State Funeral in the United Kingdom. Roberts was one of them.\n\nRobert's son, Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts, died in 1899 in the second Boar War, and received the VC.

It was the last of seven tropical storms and three hurricanes. Floyd developed on 9 October just off the east coast of Nicaragua. It then became a tropical storm. After this, it moved northward and crossed western Cuba. Because a cold front was approaching, Floyd suddenly turned to the northeast. Late on 12 October it became a hurricane near the Florida Keys. It moved through the south of Florida. It produced two tornadoes and caused some damage. The hurricane also produced rip tides. This killed one person in southern Texas. Floyd was a hurricane for only twelve hours. After this, because of the cold front, it became weak. It passed through the Bahamas before becoming extratropical. It dissipated on 14 October.\n\nHurricane Floyd originated from a low pressure area in the Gulf of Honduras on October 5. It drifted eastward in the next few days. Then, it moved southward. It moved to a place off the east coast of Nicaragua. On October 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight confirmed that an organized circulation was formed. This showed that the year's thirteenth tropical depression had developed. It drifted more to the south. Then the depression turned to the north and later northwest. This was because a ridge was formed to its east. With an anticyclone over it, the depression gradually organized. It then became stronger and was named Tropical Storm Floyd on October 10.\n\nAfter it became a tropical storm, Floyd accelerated to the north in the western Caribbean Sea. This was because a cold front was approaching. It steadily became more intense. The storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October 12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall in the United States between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Suddenly, the storm moved sharply northeastward. It went into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. The Hurricane Hunters gave reports which said Floyd got the status of a hurricane on October 12 for a short time. Around the same time, the nearby cold front created a low pressure area. This cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was decreasing very fast over the center due to the front. Soon after this, Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery. But surface observations showed it passed just south of Miami. The storm turned extratropical. It went to a process called extratropical transition, meaning it was changed from tropical storm to an extratropical one. This happened as it weakened over the Bahamas. Floyd was no longer a tropical cyclone by late on October 18. The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day.\n\nAround when Floyd first became a tropical storm, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Swan Islands and Grand Cayman. Soon after this, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the northeast Yucatán Peninsula. The storm caused heavy rainfall along the coast after this warning was issued. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for Cuba west of Havana. To prepare themselves for the storm, Cuban officials in Pinar del Río Province evacuated 100,000 people, as well as 40,000 head of cattle. International flights were also canceled for a day when Floyd was passing. Floyd passed over Western Cuba as a tropical storm. But it left no serious damage or killed anyone in the country. \n\nWhen Floyd was a tropical storm located over Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for the Florida Keys. The southwest Florida coast to Venice also got a warning. It was the first warning in the state related to the storm. It was issued as the National Hurricane Center anticipated Floyd to become more intense into a hurricane. It was also issued because there was not much time left for this. A tropical storm watch, and then a warning, was issued for eastern Florida too. But the track became more easterly after this. So, a hurricane warning was issued for southeastern Florida. It was also issued for the northwestern Bahamas. Officials in southern Florida closed schools due to the storm. A few flights were canceled at Miami International Airport. About 100 F-4 and F16 fighter jets were transported out of Homestead Air Force Base to safer places. The American Red Cross opened 55 shelters in 10 Florida counties. They had 2,000 people at some point. This was mainly in Lee County. People in the hurricane's path prepared by buying supplies from supermarkets, keeping the gas in their vehicles full and keeping loose outside items safe.\n\nFloyd was the first named storm to strike southern Florida in two years. The last one was Hurricane Bob in 1985. While passing south of Florida, Floyd produced its strongest winds over water away and from land. The strongest wind in the Florida Keys was 59 mph (94 km/h) at Duck Key. But wind gusts were stronger. The Air Force station on Cudjoe Key reported an unofficial gust of 92 mph (152 km/h). Rainfall directly from Floyd's rainbands was very low, about . But, the interaction between the hurricane and the approaching cold front caused much heavier rainfall. It reached as far north as Daytona. The highest rainfall was in Fort Pierce. Floyd created a waterspout that moved ashore in Rock Harbor. It damaged a few boats and homes. The hurricane produced rip tides. They went far west as the Texas coast. It killed one person along South Padre Island.\n\nAcross southern Florida, the hurricane left minor damage of around $500,000 (1987 USD). This was largely due to falling of trees and damaging of power lines. There was also minor crop damage in Dade County. The rainfall flooded roads in southern Florida. This caused several vehicles to fail on the Florida Turnpike. After affecting Florida, Floyd caused minor wind damage in the Bahamas. In the country, the highest reported gust was . This was at Freeport, Grand Bahama. Freeport International Airport reported sustained winds of from the remnants of Floyd.\n", "id": "332821", "title": "Hurricane Floyd (1987)"}

These stories were first published in \"The New Yorker\" magazine. Later, they were published in the novel \"5135 Kensington\". \n\nThe movie was directed by Vincente Minnelli. He met Garland on the set. Later, they married. The critics liked the movie. In 2005, Richard Schickel wrote, \"It had wonderful songs [and] a sweetly unneurotic performance by Judy Garland ... Despite its nostalgic charm, Minnelli infused the piece with a dreamy, occasionally surreal, darkness and it remains, for some of us, the greatest of American movie musicals.\"\n\nThe movie was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Color, Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Best Music, Song (\"The Trolley Song\") and Best Writing, Screenplay. In 1994, the movie was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. \n\nThe American Film Institute ranked the movie 10th on AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals. Two songs from the movie made AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs (\"The Trolley Song\" at #26 and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" at #76).\n\n", "id": "332964", "title": "Meet Me in St. Louis"}

In this day, women are told to go topless in public.\n\nIn the United States, each state has its own laws. New York State Supreme Court said that women can go topless in public. Later, police arrested a woman (in 2005) in New York City for walking along a street without wearing a shirt. She sued (started a court case against) the city for violating the New York State Supreme Court rule that women can go topless in public. The city finally paid her $29,000 because she was right and the police were wrong.\n\nIn two provinces in Canada (Ontario and British Columbia) women can be topless in public.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333041", "text": "Judy Garland as gay icon\n\nAmerican actress and songstress Judy Garland is a gay icon. She rose to iconic status in the 1950s. At that time, gays admired her talent as a performer, and her value as a camp figure. She was often parodied in drag revues. Her struggles with drugs, booze, and personal relationships during her glory days mirrored similar struggles among urban closeted gays during the same era. Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\" may be the foundation stone of her iconic status. Following her death in 1969 and the Stonewall riots, Garland's status as a gay icon began to slip. Young gay men embraced their sexual orientation with pride rather than shame, and could or would not identify with Garland's melodramatic victimhood and emotionalism.\n\nJudy Garland was born Francis Ethel Gumm in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 1922. Her parents were vaudevillians who operated a movie theatre that featured vaudeville acts. Judy was a toddler when she joined her two older sisters in singing \"Jingle Bells\" from the stage of her parents' theatre. The sisters performed as The Gumm Sisters for the next few years. The Gumms moved to Lancaster, California in 1926 when Judy's father was rumored to be making sexual advances to young male theatre ushers. \n\nThe Gumm Sisters continued to perform successfully. They made their movie debut in 1929. In 1934 they changed their name to The Garland Sisters. Judy was signed by MGM in 1935 and made many movies including the Andy Hardy series with Mickey Rooney and \"The Wizard of Oz\". Judy was given amphetamines and barbiturates to keep up with the hectic pace of moviemaking. She became addicted to drugs.\n\nJudy was insecure about her appearance. Her feelings were exacerbated by cruel studio executives. In April 1947 she had a nervous breakdown and was placed in a sanitarium. In July she tried to commit suicide. She was released from the studio in 1950, but found a new lease on life performing on the concert stage. Her personal life was troubled with drugs and alcohol. She was married five times, four marriages ending in divorce. She died in London in 1969 of an accidental drug overdose. Thousands attended her funeral in New York City.\n\nGay identification with Garland as a tragic figure was being discussed as early as 1967. \"Time\" magazine reviewed Garland's 1967 Palace Theatre engagement in New York City, and wrote that a \"disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual.\" The review goes on to say that \"[t]he boys in the tight trousers\" (a phrase \"Time\" repeatedly used to describe gay men) would \"roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats\" during Garland's performances. \n\n\"Time\" tried to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual. Psychiatrists thought that \"the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria\". They speculated that \"Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her.\"\n\nWilliam Goldman wrote in \"Esquire\" magazine about the same Palace engagement. He too disparages the gay men in attendance. He dismisses them as \"fags\" who \"flit by\" chattering inanely. He also advances the tragic figure concept. He suggests that \"if [homosexuals] have an enemy, it is age. And Garland is youth, perennially, over the rainbow.\" He wrote, \"Homosexuals tend to identify with suffering. They are a persecuted group and they understand suffering. And so does Garland. She's been through the fire and lived – all the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone – brothers and sisters, \"she knows.\"\"\n\nGay movie scholar Richard Dyer has defined camp as \"a characteristically gay way of handling the values, images and products of the dominant culture through irony, exaggeration, trivialisation, theatricalisation and an ambivalent making fun of and out of the serious and respectable.\" Garland is camp, he asserts, because she is \"imitable, her appearance and gestures copiable in drag acts\". He calls her \"ordinariness\" in her early MGM movies camp in their \"failed seriousness\" and her later style \"wonderfully over-the-top.\" \n\nGarland herself acknowledged her camp appeal during her lifetime. She once said, \"When I die I have visions of fags singing 'Over the Rainbow' and the flag at Fire Island being flown at half mast.\" Fire Island is a resort community that lies off Long Island. It has a large LGBT presence. The Island is also referenced in Garland's last movie \"I Could Go On Singing\". The movie is described as \"her most gay film\" and as the movie most aware of its gay audience.\n\nAnother connection between Garland and LGBT people is the slang term \"Friend of Dorothy\". This term likely derives from Garland's portrayal of Dorothy Gale in \"The Wizard of Oz\". It became a code phrase gay people used to identify each other. Dorothy's journey from Kansas to Oz \"mirrored many gay men's desires to escape the black-and-white limitations of small town life ... for big, colorful cities filled with quirky, gender-bending characters who would welcome them.\" \n\nIn the movie, Dorothy immediately accepts those who are different. The Lion identifies himself through song as a \"sissy\" and exhibits stereotypically \"gay\" (or at least effeminate) mannerisms. The Lion is seen as a coded example of Garland meeting and accepting a gay man without question.\n\nIt has been said that Garland's death and funeral, held in New York City in June 1969, helped inspire the Stonewall riots. However, some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved \"were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their next meal would come from.\" In a 2009 interview, gay historian David Carter stated that this connection was based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in the \"Village Voice\" the next day. There was certainly an awareness and appreciation of Garland among Stonewall Inn patrons. Because the bar had no liquor license, it was passed off as a bottle club and patrons were required to sign in. Many used pseudonyms and \"Judy Garland\" was among the most popular.\n\n\"Time\" magazine would write decades later: \"The uprising was inspirited by a potent cocktail of pent-up rage (raids of gay bars were brutal and routine), overwrought emotions (hours earlier, thousands had wept at the funeral of Judy Garland) and drugs. As a 17-year-old cross-dresser was being led into the paddy wagon and got a shove from a cop, she fought back. She hit the cop and was so stoned, she didn't know what she was doing—or didn't care. Garland's daughter Lorna Luft points to the connection with pride, saying that her mother was a \"huge, huge advocate of human rights\" and that Garland would have found the rioting appropriate.\n\nThe rainbow flag, a symbol of the LGBT community, may have been inspired, in part, by Garland's signature song \"Over the Rainbow.\" Garland's performance of this song has been described as \"the sound of the closet,\" speaking to gay men whose image \"they presented in their own public lives was often at odds with a truer sense of self that mainstream society would not condone.\"\n\nJudy Garland's father and other significant people in her life were gay. Garland's father Frank Gumm would apparently seduce or at least keep company with very young men or older teens. He would move on when told to leave or before his activities could be discovered. Garland's husband Vincente Minnelli was generally known to be a closeted bisexual. Garland liked to visit gay bars with openly gay friends Roger Edens and George Cukor, to the chagrin of her handlers at MGM.\n\n\n", "id": "333041", "title": "Judy Garland as gay icon"}

Another version is where players try to hit each other's marbles out of a target zone.\n\nMarbles were found in the ancient civilisations of Mohenjo-daro, Ancient Egypt and Rome.\n\nMarbles has been played in Tinsley Green, West Sussex, England for many centuries: \"TIME\" magazine traces its origins to 1588.\n\nThe British and World Marbles Championship have been held at Tinsley Green every year since 1932. The first championship in 1932 was won by a team from the Black Horse public house in nearby Charlwood.\n\nTraditionally, the marbles-playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: it was thought playing after that brought bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship each Good Friday. German teams have been successful several times since 2000. Often, local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages also take part. \n", "id": "333164", "title": "Marbles (game)"}

It is usually called the rolled R, rolling R, or trilled R. The sound of this consonant is formed by placing the tip of your tongue against the ridge just behind the top row of your teeth. This is what is meant by \"alveolar\". The sound is then made by vibrating your tongue against that ridge. This makes it a trill consonant.\n\nThe International Phonetic Alphabet represents dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills with the symbol ⟨⟩. The X-SAMPA symbol of it is r.\n\nQuite often, we use ⟨⟩ in phonemic transcriptions (especially those found in dictionaries) of languages like English and German. They have rhotic consonants that are not an alveolar trill. This is because typing the r will be easier in the orthographies of these languages.\n\nIn many Indo-European languages, this sound is at least occasionally allophonic with an alveolar tap , particularly in unstressed positions. Exceptions to this include Catalan, Spanish, Albanian and some Portuguese dialects, which treat them as separate phonemes.\n\nThese are some examples where the alveolar trill occurs in various languages:\n\nSome languages have a \"voiceless alveolar trill\". In the normal alveolar trill, the vocal cord vibrates. In voiceless alveolar trill, the vocal cord does not vibrate. We do not often use voiceless alveolar trill, but we often use the voiced alveolar trill. We can find it in Ancient Greek, where it was spelled ⟨⟩; this sound has combined with in Modern Greek.\n\nIn Czech, there are two different alveolar trills. Besides the normal trill, written r, there is another, written ř. This is found in words such as \"rybáři\" ('fishermen'), ('four'), and the common surname \"Dvořák\". The way it is pronounced is similar to but the tongue is raised; it is partially fricative, with the frication sounding rather like , though not so retracted. Thus in the IPA it is written as ⟨r⟩ plus the raising diacritic, ⟨⟩. (Before the 1989 IPA Kiel Convention, it had a dedicated symbol ⟨⟩). It is normally voiced, but there is a voiceless allophone as with many other Czech consonants.\n\nListen: \n", "id": "333317", "title": "Alveolar trill"}

The area not part of any organized borough is called the \"unorganized borough.\"\n\nFor the 1970 census, the US and state made the unorganized borough into 11 census areas. Each is roughly the same as an election district. However, these areas are solely for statistical analysis and presentation. They have no government of their own. Boroughs and census areas are both treated as county-level equivalents by the Census Bureau. \n\nSome areas in the unorganized borough receive limited public services directly from the Alaska state government, usually law enforcement from the Alaska State Troopers and educational funding. \n\nSix consolidated city-county governments exist—Juneau City and Borough, City and Borough of Haines, Sitka City and Borough, Yakutat City and Borough, Wrangell City and Borough, and the state's largest city, Anchorage. Though its legal name is the \"Municipality of Anchorage,\" it is considered a consolidated city-borough under state law. \n\nThe Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 55-2,3,4 codes, used by the United States Census Bureau to uniquely identify states and counties, is provided with each entry. Alaska's code is 02, which when combined with any county code would be written as 02XXX. The FIPS code for each county links to census data for that county.\n\nThe Unorganized Borough is part of the U.S. state of Alaska not in any of its 18 organized boroughs. It is over half of Alaska's area, 970,500 km² (374,712 mi²), an area larger than any other US state. As of the 2000 census 13% of Alaskans (81,803 people) live here.\n\nUnique among the United States, Alaska is not entirely subdivided into organized county equivalents. In 1970, the United States Census Bureau divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas to facilitate census taking in the large unorganized area.\n\n\n", "id": "333456", "title": "List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska"}

It was first shown on television on 30 April 1995. The episode was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss and the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode features many cultural references, including Carole King's song \"Jazzman\", the actor James Earl Jones and the \"Kimba the White Lion/The Lion King\" controversy.\n\nBart Simpson gets a stomachache after accidentally eating a jagged metal Krusty-O with his breakfast cereal. Lisa is the only one who believes him, however. Homer and Marge send him to school anyway. Bart struggles through the test. After finally convincing Mrs. Krabappel that he is actually ill, she lets him go and see the nurse. Bart collapses on the medical room floor. He is then taken to Springfield General Hospital where he undergoes surgery from Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick. It seems Bart has appendicitis. \n\nWhile visiting Bart in the hospital, Lisa meets her hero, jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy, in a bed in another ward. Later, Bleeding Gums gives Lisa his saxophone for her school recital. It starts off terribly (owing to most of the orchestra having their appendixes removed so they could miss school), but Lisa gets up and performs a solo routine, becoming the star of the show. Returning to the hospital the next day, Lisa becomes sad to learn that Bleeding Gums has died. Lisa is the only person who attends Bleeding Gums's funeral, and she vows to make sure that everyone in Springfield knows the name Bleeding Gums Murphy. Bart, meanwhile, sues Krusty the Clown and is given a $100,000 settlement. However, after Bart's attorney Lionel Hutz takes his \"legal fees\", Bart is left with only $500, though Bart seems to be okay with it.\n\nLisa is still sad. She decides that the best way to honor Bleeding Gums' memory is by having his album played at the local jazz station. Lisa spots it in the Android's Dungeon store for $250, but after hearing that Bleeding Gums is dead, Comic Book Guy doubles the price to $500. Bart then walks in with his $500 and, after remembering that Lisa was the only one who believed him about his stomach ache, Bart decides to buy the album with his money, and Lisa thanks him for it. When the station plays one of Bleeding Gums's songs, Lisa is disappointed because the station's tiny range still prevents anyone from hearing it. Lightning then strikes the antenna, giving it extra power and projecting it into every radio in Springfield. Lisa is finally satisfied. After proclaiming \"that was for you Bleeding Gums,\" she turns to leave, but not before Bleeding Gums is seen from heaven to tell Lisa that she had made \"an old jazz man happy\". After saying a final goodbye, Lisa and Bleeding Gums jam to \"Jazzman\" one last time.\n\nThe title of this episode is a play on both the song 'Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk and the movie of the same also about an unhappy jazz musician. \n\nBleeding Gums Murphy appears to Lisa in a cloud near the end of the episode with Darth Vader, Mufasa, and James Earl Jones saying \"This is CNN\". Despite the fact that all three characters were voiced by Jones, the characters in this scene were impersonated by cast member Harry Shearer; Jones himself guest starred in two episodes before. Additionally, Mufasa accidentally saids \"Kimba\". He corrects himself by saying \"Simba\". This is a reference to controversy regarding \"The Lion King\"'s similarity to the anime show \"Kimba the White Lion\". Lisa and Bleeding Gums play Carole King's song \"Jazzman\" in this scene and in the hospital earlier in the episode. Bleeding Gums has to leave at the end of the scene because he has a date with the jazz singer Billie Holiday. for the TV Show \"ER\". \n\nBleeding Gums appears on an episode of \"The Cosby Show\". This is a reference to Cosby often getting jazz musicians he liked to appear on the show; in the episode, Cosby is voiced by \"The Simpsons\" regular Dan Castellaneta. Lionel Hutz' \"crack team of lawyers\" Robert Shaporo and Albert Dershman are parodies of Robert Shapiro and Alan Dershowitz, two of the defense attorneys at the O.J. Simpson murder case. The three drive away in a white Ford Bronco, the same car O.J. Simpson drove in his televised low-speed pursuit before his arrest.\n\nThis was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, who were writers on \"The Critic\" and were big fans of \"The Simpsons\", were happy to be able to write an episode. The original story was based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. The main story of the episode's first act sees Bart get appendicitis from eating a jagged metal Krusty-O. Mike Reiss's father, being a doctor, \"sort of\" acted as the medical consultant on this episode. He stated that \"you can't get\" appendicitis from eating a piece of metal, but the writers decided to do it anyway. In his flashback, Murphy is shown as having a \"$1,500 a day Fabergé egg habit\"; Jean \"didn't realize just how expensive\" Fabergé eggs actually were, so the joke does not make much sense.\n\nThis episode was the first to have a recurring character killed off on the show. The writers and production team felt that it would be a good, emotional storyline, which, through Lisa, could focus on the theme of sadness. They decided that it could not be one of the main characters; Jean joked that \"we wouldn't want it to be someone like Mr. Burns, that we'd obviously want to see in the show again\". But later Jean decided on Bleeding Gums Murphy, a character introduced in \"Moaning Lisa\", an episode of season 1; a flashback to \"Moaning Lisa\" is featured in the episode. \n\nMurphy was a fairly minor character, only appearing in 2 episodes of the show, but he appeared in the show's opening sequence and remained there after this episode, until the opening was re-designed in season 20. Moore's first ever job on the show was in the animation department for \"Moaning Lisa\" so he \"appreciated\" being able to direct this episode. Reiss stated \"I had been polling for years to kill Marge's mom but this was a better idea\". Actor Ron Taylor returned to guest star as Murphy in the episode. Comedian Steve Allen also made his second guest appearance on the show, who had also appeared in the episode \"Separate Vocations\" before.\n\n\"'Round Springfield\" finished 60th on its American broadcast in the ratings for the week of April 24 to April 30, 1995. It received a Nielsen rating of 8.2. The episode was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Mike Reiss and Al Jean thought that the episode would \"get a ton of awards\", and joked that this was why they opted to receive a story credit, which they usually would not. Ultimately it did not win any awards. \n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, who were the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\" found that it was \"a real tear-jerker\" and praised Grampa believing everything he saw was death. Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict rated the episode a \"B\". Adam Finley of \"TV Squad\" liked the episode. He liked its many \"great moments\" including \"Steve Allen pimping his books on TV: \"How to Make Love to Steve Allen\"; \"Happiness is a Naked Steve Allen\"; \"Journey to the Center of Steve Allen\"; \"The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen\"\" and \"Moe running a \"retox\" clinic right next to a detox clinic\". \n\nOn the bad review side, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode \"dull\" stating that \"some of the moments connected to Bart's illness are funny,\" but that he \"really hate[s] that \"Jazzman\" song\" and dislikes \"the Bleeding Gums parts.\"\n\nIn the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the janitor Groundskeeper Willie to be used as a French teacher. Expressing his disdain for French people, he exclaims to his class: \"Bonjour, you cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys.\" This quote, particularly the phrase \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", has since been more widely used. It was used particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq, having been popularized by the right-wing \"National Review\" journalist Jonah Goldberg, to describe European and especially French opposition to military action. It was once noted that the phrase was \"made acceptable in official diplomatic channels around the globe\". Ben Macintyre has written that the phrase is \"perhaps the most famous\" of the show's coinages and since Goldberg's usage it \"has gone on to become a journalistic cliché.\" \n\nIt has subsequently been used by the \"New York Post\" (as \"Surrender Monkeys\") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early 2008. Articles in the \"Daily Mail\" have used the phrase in reference the French's \"attitude problem\", and the \"muted\" European reaction to the death of Osama Bin Laden, while \"The Daily Telegraph\" has cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. The term has been used in books by commentator Laura Ingraham, and academics Stuart Croft, Stephen Chan, and Paul L. Moorcraft and Philip M. Taylor. Ned Sherrin included the quote in the \"Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations\"; it was introduced in the third edition in 2005. It is also included in the \"Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\". Douglas Coupland's 2009 novel \"Generation A\" refers to Groundskeeper Willie's use of the phrase.\n\nThe line was \"probably\" written by Ken Keeler during one of the episode's re-write sessions, although none of those present on the episode's DVD audio commentary could remember for sure. The writers were surprised it became as widely used as it did and never meant it as a political statement, merely as an \"obnoxious\" joke for Willie. The French dub of the show uses the line \"singes mangeurs de fromage\", eliding the word \"surrender\".\n\n", "id": "333502", "title": "'Round Springfield"}

The army had been sent into the area to take the guns owned by the Lakota.\n\nDuring the 1890's, a Native American shaman, named Wovoka, began teaching people about his visions for the future. He said the living would join with the dead, and the prairies would be covered in new soil. This would bury the European settlers, and life would return to the way it had been with lots of bison and other animals to hunt. To make this happen, he told people they would have to perform the Ghost Dance. The dancers wore brightly colored shirts with pictures of bison and eagles. They believed the shirts had magic powers which would protect them from bullets. The Ghost Dance caused a lot of excitement in the Sioux camps. European settlers were worried by these beliefs and the sight of wild and crazy people dancing in the snow.

He played a large role in the takedown of the Girondins. Corday believed in the Girondins' cause. In 1847, writer Alphonse de Lamartine gave Corday the nickname \" (the Angel of Assassination).\n\nCharlotte Corday was born in Saint-Saturnin-des-Ligneries, Orne in Normandy, France in 1768. Corday was from a family of minor aristocrats.\n\nWhen Corday was a girl, her older sister and their mother, Charlotte Marie Jacqueline Gaultier de Mesnival died.

She loved their speeches and liked many of the Girondins she met in Caen very much. She decided that she needed to do what the Girondins were doing. She thought that they were the party that would save France from the radicalism of the Jacobins. The Jacobins believed that France would be saved only by terrifying the people into obedience. They believed that violence was the only way. Corday and the Girondins did not agree with this approach. Corday decided to kill Marat, because she believed he was the most radical.

However, Marat did not attend meetings anymore, because of a skin disease. She changed her plan and went to his home. The first time she came, Marat's wife, Simonne Evrard, did not let her come in. When she came back in the evening, Marat let her in. She gave him the names of Girondins in Caen, and he wrote them down. Then, she stabbed him with the knife she had bought.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333674", "text": "Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)\n\nThe 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge was the first version of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Washington. The bridge was built over the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It opened on July 1, 1940. The bridge collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. At that time, it was the third longest suspension bridge in the world in terms of main span length. The Golden Gate Bridge and the George Washington Bridge were the only bridges that were larger.\n\nConstruction of the bridge started in September 1938. After the deck was built, the wind caused it to move vertically. Because of this, the people building it gave it the nickname Galloping Gertie. The movement was seen even when the bridge opened to the public. Many things were tried to stop the bridge from moving. None of these things worked. The bridge's main span collapsed under winds on the morning of November 7, 1940.\n\nBecause of World War II, the bridge could not be built again at that time. The towers and cables of the bridge were still in place. These and the rest of the bridge were taken apart and sold as scrap metal. In 1950, a new Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in the same place. It used the first bridge's tower pedestals and cable anchorages. The parts of the bridge that fell into the water are now an artificial reef.\n\nThe bridge's collapse had lasting effects on science and engineering. In many physics books, it is used to show resonance. Its collapse also helped increase research in the field of bridge aerodynamics-aeroelastics. This has affected the designs of all the world's large long-span bridges built since 1940.\n\nPeople wanted a bridge built between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula since the late 1800s. In 1889, the Northern Pacific Railway wanted to build a trestle there. The Tacoma Chamber of Commerce began working toward getting the money to build a bridge in 1923. Many well known bridge engineers were talked to about the bridge. These included Joseph B. Strauss and David B. Steinman. Later in time, Strauss was the main engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge and he designed the Mackinac Bridge. Steinman went to the area many times. He created a plan for the bridge in 1929. By 1931, the Chamber chose not to follow his plan because they thought Steinman was not doing enough to help get money to pay for the bridge. Another problem with paying for the bridge was buying out the ferry contract from a company that was running service on the Narrows at the time.\n\nThe Washington State legislature created the Washington State Toll Bridge Authority and gave $5,000 to study the request by Tacoma and Pierce County for a bridge.\n\nFrom the start, getting money to pay for the bridge was a problem. Money earned from tolls on the bridge would not be enough to pay for the bridge's construction. There was support for the bridge from the U.S. Navy and Army. The Navy had a shipyard in Bremerton. The Army had McChord Field and Fort Lewis near Tacoma. The bridge would be useful to both the Army and Navy.\n\nClark Eldridge, an engineer working for the state, created a suspension bridge design. This design was similar to the design of many other suspension bridges. It was a design that had be shown to work very well at other places. The Washington Toll Bridge Authority asked for $11 million from the Federal Public Works Administration (PWA). Early construction plans by the Washington Department of Highways had a set of 25-foot-deep (7.6m) girders to sit beneath the roadway. These would make the roadway more stiff so it would not move easily.\n\nLeon Moisseiff had other ideas about building the bridge. Moisseiff was a well known New York bridge engineer. He was the designer and consultant engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge. Moisseiff talked to the PWA and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) about building the bridge for less money. He suggested that they use shallower supports—girders that were only deep. His ideas meant the bridge would be slimmer but they reduced the construction costs. Moisseiff's design was chosen. The other design was said to cost too much. On June 23, 1938, the PWA approved nearly $6 million for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. Tolls from the bridge would earn another $1.6 million pay for the estimated total $8 million cost.\n\nUsing Moisseiff's design, bridge construction began on September 27, 1938. Construction took only nineteen months. It cost $6.4 million. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, with a main span of , was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at that time. The two larger bridges were the George Washington Bridge between New Jersey and New York City, and the Golden Gate Bridge, just north of San Francisco.\n\nBecause the bridge was not expected to have large amounts of traffic, the bridge was designed with only two lanes. It was just wide. This was quite narrow given how long it was. With only the -deep girders to give it extra depth, the bridge's roadway was very shallow.\n\nThe shallow and narrow girders are what caused the bridge to collapse. With such small girders, the deck of the bridge was not rigid enough. It was easily moved by the winds. The bridge was well known for its movement. A small wind could make the center span move several feet during four- to five-second intervals. This was seen by the builders and workmen during construction. It caused some of the workers to name the bridge \"Galloping Gertie.\" Even the public felt these motions on the day that the bridge opened on July 1, 1940.\n\nAnother reason the bridge swayed and then fell was its solid sides. This did not allow wind to pass through the bridge's deck. This design allowed the bridge to catch the wind and sway, which ultimately took it down.\n\nBecause the bridge moved so much while it was being built, many ideas were used to make it move less. They included\n\n\nThe Washington Toll Bridge Authority hired Professor Frederick Burt Farquharson to make tests of the bridge in a wind-tunnel. He was an engineering professor at the University of Washington. Professor Farquharson and his students built a 1:200-scale model of the bridge and a 1:20-scale model of a section of the deck. The first studies ended on November 2, 1940. This was five days before the bridge collapse on November 7. He found two ways to fix the problem:\nThe first option was not not liked because of if the changes were done, they could not be undone. The second option was the chosen one. It was not done because the bridge collapsed five days later.\n\nThe collapse happened on November 7, 1940, at 11:00 a.m. (Pacific time). It was caused by physical phenomenon known as aeroelastic flutter.\n\nLeonard Coatsworth, a \"Tacoma News Tribune\" editor was the last person to drive on the bridge. He was driving with his dog, Tubby, over the bridge when the bridge started to vibrate very badly. Coatsworth had to leave his car:\n\nNo one died in the collapse of the bridge. Tubby, a black male cocker spaniel, was the only death of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. The dog was lost along with Coatsworth's car. Professor Farquharson and a news photographer tried to save Tubby, but the dog was too scared to leave the car. He bit one of the people trying to save him. Tubby died when the bridge fell. Neither his body nor the car were ever recovered. Coatsworth had been driving Tubby back to his daughter. She was the owner of the dog. Coatsworth was payed US $450 for his car and $364.40 for what was in the car. This included Tubby.\n\nTheodore von Kármán was one of the people who tried to learn what caused the collapse. He was the director of the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and a well known aerodynamicist. He said that the State of Washington could not get money from one of the insurance policies for the bridge. This was because its insurance agent had fraudulently taken the insurance pyments. The agent, Hallett R. French worked for the Merchant's Fire Assurance Company. He was charged with grand larceny for keeping the payments for $800,000 worth of insurance. The bridge was insured by many other policies. These covered 80% of the $5.2 million bridge's value. Most of these were payed without problems.\n\nOn November 28, 1940, the U.S. Navy's Hydrographic Office said that the parts of the bridge were at geographical coordinates , at a depth of 180 feet (55 meters).\n\nThe collapse of the bridge was recorded on movie by Barney Elliott. He was the owner of a local camera store. The movie shows Leonard Coatsworth leaving the bridge after exiting his car. In 1998, \"The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse\" was chosen for preservation in the United States National movie Registry by the Library of Congress. It was chosen because it was culturally, historically, or aesthetically important. This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as an example of what can go wrong. Elliot's movies of the construction and collapse of the bridge were shot on 16 mm Kodachrome movie. Most copies are in black and white. This is because newsreels of the day copied the movie onto 35 mm black-and-white stock.\n\nA commission formed by the Federal Works Agency studied the collapse of the bridge. It included Othmar Ammann and Theodore von Kármán. They looked at three possible reasons for the collapse:\n\nEfforts to save the bridge started after its collapse. They continued into May 1943. It was decided that the bridge could not be repaired. The entire bridge would have to be taken down. A new bridge would have to be built. At the time, the United States was dealing with World War II. This meant the steel that would be needed to built the bridge was needed for the war. Steel from the old bridge cables and the suspension span was sold melted down. It cost the state more to destroy the bridge than it earned by selling the materials. The state lost over $350,000.\n\nThe cable anchorages, tower pedestals and most of the substructure were not damaged badly in the collapse. They were used again during construction of the new bridge that opened in 1950. The towers were badly damaged. They were taken down. The steel in them was sold to be melted down.\n\nThe parts of the bridge that fell into the water below are now a large artificial reef. They are listed on the National Register of Historic Places with reference number 92001068.\n\nOthmar Ammann is a leading bridge designer. He is also a member of the Federal Works Agency Commission that looked at the causes of the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. He wrote:\n\nThe Bronx Whitestone Bridge has a design that is much like the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. It was reinforced after the collapse. Fourteen-foot-high (4.3 m) steel trusses were added on both sides of the deck in 1943. These add weight to the bridge and make it more stiff. This was done to reduce oscillation. In 2003, the trusses were removed. Aerodynamic fiberglass fairings were added along both sides of the road deck.\n\nBecause of materials and labor shortages caused by World War II, it took 10 years before a new bridge was opened. This bridge was opened to traffic on October 14, 1950. It is long — longer than Galloping Gertie. The new bridge also has more lanes than the original bridge.\n\nHalf a century later, the new bridge had more traffic than it could handle. A second, parallel suspension bridge was built to carry eastbound traffic. The suspension bridge that was completed in 1950 was changed to only carry westbound traffic. The new parallel bridge opened to traffic in July 2007.\n\n\n", "id": "333674", "title": "Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)"}

It was written and directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez and produced by the Haxan Films production company. \n\nThis movie was put together from amateur footage and relates the story of three student filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams) who disappeared while hiking in the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The viewers are told the three were never seen or heard from again, although their video and sound equipment (along with most of the footage they shot) was discovered a year later. This \"recovered footage\" is presented as the viewer is watching the movie.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" was first shown at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. It was released by Artisan on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity, including a ground-breaking campaign by the studio to use the Internet and suggest that the film was a record of real events. The distribution strategy for \"The Blair Witch Project\" was created and implemented by Artisan studio executive Steven Rothenberg. The movie was positively received by critics and went on to gross over US$248 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time. The DVD was released in December 1999 and presented only in fullscreen.\n\nIn October 1994, movie students Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard set out to make a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, which the town was used to be called Blair. They interview people living in the local area about the legend of the Blair Witch. The local people tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who kidnapped seven children in the 1940s and brought them to his house in the woods, where he tortured and killed them. Parr brought the children into his home's basement in pairs, forcing the first child to face the corner and listen to their companion's screams as he murdered the second child. Parr would then murder the first child. Eventually turning himself in to the police, Parr later pleaded insanity, saying that the spirit of Elly Kedward, a witch hanged in the 18th century, had been terrorizing him for some time and promised to leave him alone if he murdered the kids. The three students also interviews Mary Brown, a local eccentric who tells them that she had encountered the Blair Witch as a child. \n\nThe second day, the students begin to explore the woods in north Burkittsville to look for evidence of the Blair Witch. Along the way, a fisherman warns them that the woods are haunted, and recalls a time that he had seen strange mist rising from the water. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century, and then camp for the night. The next day they move deeper into the woods, despite being uncertain of their exact location on the map. They eventually locate what appears to be an old cemetery with seven small cairns. They set up camp nearby and then return to the cemetery after dark. They later hear crackling sounds in the darkness that seem to be coming from all directions and assume the noises are from animals or locals following them. \n\nThat same following day they attempt to return to their car, but cannot find their way; they try until it is night time, when they are forced to set camp. That night, they hear crackling noises again, but they cannot see anything. The next morning they find three cairns have been built around their tent during the night. As they continue trying to find their way out of the woods, Heather realizes that her map is missing, and Mike later reveals that he kicked it into a creek out of frustration the previous day. Josh and Heather get angry at Mike. They then realize they are now hopelessly lost, and decide to simply \"head south\". Soon, they discover a multitude of humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. That night, they hear more strange noises, including the sounds of children and bizarre \"morphing\" sounds. When an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in a panic and hide in the woods until it is morning. Upon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime, causing them to question why only his belongings were affected. As the day wears on, they pass a log over a stream that was identical to the one they had passed earlier, despite having traveled directly south all day, and again set camp, completely demoralized at having wasted the entire day seemingly going in circles, with Josh outside on guard duty.\n\nJosh disappears the next morning. After a while of finding him, Mike and Heather eventually break camp and slowly move on. That night, they hear Josh screaming in the darkness, but are not able to find him. The next morning, Heather finds a bundle of sticks and fabric outside their tent. Later inspection reveals it contains blood-soaked scraps of Josh's shirt, as well as teeth and hair, but she does not mention this to Mike. \n\nThat night, Heather records herself apologizing to the co-producers of her project as well as her family, and starts to cry, finally admitting her fate. Later, they again hear Josh crying for help, but this time they follow them and discover an abandoned house in the woods. Hanging on the front of the house is the same human stick figure that they saw in the woods. Mike runs upstairs, following the voice, while Heather tries to follow. Mike then claims he hears Josh in the basement. He follows the sound and, after what seems to be a struggle, goes silent and drops to the floor. Heather runs down to the basement screaming for Mike, but she does not hear Mike. She then enters the basement looking for both men, and her camera catches a glimpse of Mike facing the wall. Heather then screams as she and her camera drop to the floor. There is only silence as the footage ends.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" was developed by the filmmakers. The script was written in 1988. It began with a 68-page outline, with the dialogue to be improvised. According to the directors of the movie, they advertised in \"Back Stage\" magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities. There was a very informal improvisational audition process to narrow the total amount of 2,000 actors. In talks with investors of the movie, they presented an eight-minute documentary along with newspapers and news footage. This documentary, originally called \"The Blair Witch Project: The Story of Black Hills Disappearances\" was produced by Haxan Films. In the movie, the Blair Witch is, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1785. The directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the Salem Witch Trials and \"The Crucible\", to play on the themes of injustice done on those who were called witches. They were influenced by \"The Shining\", \"Alien\" and \"The Omen.\" \"Jaws\" was an influence as well, presumably because the witch was hidden from the viewer for the entirety of the film, forcing suspense from the unknown.\n\nThe movie was shot for only eight days in October 1998. Most of the movie was filmed in the tiny Seneca Creek State Park in Montgomery County, Maryland, although a few scenes were filmed in the real town of Burkittsville. Some of the townspeople interviewed in the film were not actors, and some were planted actors, unknown to the main cast. Donahue had never operated a camera before, and spent two days in a \"crash course\". Donahue said she modeled her character after a director she once worked with, citing the character's self assuredness when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis. The three actors filmed the whole movie with only two cameras. They recorded using Heather's video camera and a 16mm camera that can record video in black and white. The apparent use of handheld camera, and the coarse grained picture supports clearly the film's documentary feel. The strange recording method is also based on the actors who did not know the movie's story in detail. The three actors were dragged into the woods, and almost tortured with the cold weather, food shortages and spooky sounds.\n\nDuring filming, the actors were given clues as to their next location through messages given in milk crates found with Global Positioning Satellite systems. They were given individual instructions that they would use to help improvise the action of the day. Teeth were obtained from a Maryland dentist for use as human remains in the film. Influenced by producer Gregg Hale's memories of his military training, in which \"enemy soldiers\" would hunt a trainee through wild terrain for three days, the directors moved the characters far during the day, harassing them by night and depriving them of food. \n\nAlmost 19 hours of usable recorded footage had to be edited down to 90 minutes. Editing took more than eight months. Originally it was hoped that the movie would make it on to cable television, and the filmmakers did not anticipate wide release. The initial investment by the three University of Central Florida filmmakers was about US$35,000. Artisan acquired the film for US$1.1 million but spent US$25 million to market it. The actors signed a \"small\" agreement to receive some of the profits from the film's release.\n\nA list of production budget figures have circulated over the years, appearing as low as $20,000. Sánchez revealed in an interview that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" grossed $248,639,099 worldwide, compared to its final budget, which ranged between $20,000 and $750,000. The movie received critically positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes says that out of 133 reviews for the movie, 85% of these reviews were positive. \n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun Times\" gave the movie four out of four stars. He called it \"an extraordinarily effective horror film\". It was listed on Filmcritic.com as the 50th best movie ending of all time. Critics praised Donahue's apology to the camera near the end of the movie, saying it would cause \"nightmares for years to come\"; Roger Ebert showed how much different this sequence to Robert Scott's final journal entries as he froze to death in the Antarctic. Donahue said that there was a considerable backlash against her because she was starring in the movie. Her claims led to her having threatening encounters and difficulty obtaining employment.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" is thought to be the first widely released film marketed primarily on the internet. The film's official website featured fake police reports and 'newsreel-style' interviews. Due to this, audiences and critics initially thought it was an actual documentary about the 'missing' teenagers. These augmented the film's convincing found footage style to spark heated debates across the internet over whether the film was a real-life documentary or a work of fiction.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" was given a Global Film Critics Award for Best Screenplay and won the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award. In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named \"The Blair Witch Project\" one of \"the 100 best films from 1983 to 2008\", ranking it at #99. In 2006, Chicago Film Critics Association listed it as one of the \"Top 100 Scariest Movies\", ranking it #12. \n\nDespite its positive reviews, the movie was nominated for the 1999 Razzie Award for Worst Picture. Heather Donahue won a Razzie Award for Worst Actress. The movie also became controversial for it's shaky footage, especially the final sequence in which the camera operator is running down a set of stairs with the camera. Some viewers had gotten motion sickness and even vomited as a result.\n\nA sequel, \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\", was released in the autumn of 2000, but was poorly received by most critics. A third installment was announced that same year but did not materialize. On September 2, 2009, it was announced that co-directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick were pitching the third film.\n\n\"The Blair Witch Project\" was released on DVD on October 26, 1999, with VHS and laser disc versions released around the same time. Unlike the widescreen theatrical release, this DVD is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The DVD has a number of special features, including \"The Curse of the Blair Witch\" and \"The Blair Witch Legacy\" featurettes, newly discovered footage, director and producer commentary, production notes, cast & crew bios and trailers. A Blu-ray release from Lionsgate was released on October 5, 2010, also in 1.33:1 format.\n\n", "id": "333676", "title": "The Blair Witch Project"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333827", "text": "Cantilever bridge\n\nA cantilever bridge is a bridge built using a . A cantilever is only supported on one end. For small footbridges, the cantilevers may be simple beams. For large cantilever bridges, designed for road or rail traffic the cantilevers are trusses built from structural steel, or box girders built from prestressed concrete. The steel truss cantilever bridge was a major engineering breakthrough when it was first used, because it can span distances of over . They can be more easily built at difficult crossings as they do not need to be supported during the construction.\n\nEngineers in the nineteenth century knew that a bridge which was built across multiple supports would distribute the loads among them. This meant there would be lower stresses in the girder or truss and meant that longer spans could be built. Several nineteenth century engineers designed continuous bridges with hinge points mid-span. The use of a hinge in the multi-span system meant that engineers could better work out the loads and stresses on the bridge It also meant the bridge could handle the foundations settling at different rates. \n\nHeinrich Gerber was one of the engineers to obtain a patent for a hinged girder (1866) and is recognized as the first to build one. The Hassfurt Bridge over the Main river in Germany has a central span of 124 feet (38 meters). Completed in 1867, it was the first modern cantilever bridge. Other early cantilever bridges included the High Bridge of Kentucky by C. Shaler Smith (1877), the Niagara Cantilever Bridge by Charles Conrad Schneider (1883) and the Poughkeepsie Bridge by John Francis O'Rourke and Pomeroy P. Dickinson (1889). The Kentucky River Bridge spanned a gorge that was 275 feet (84 meters) deep. It was built with a cantilver which meant that it did not need to be supported during the building. The most famous early cantilever bridge is the Forth Rail Bridge. This bridge held the record for longest span in the world for 17 years.\n\nBenjamin Baker showed how the cantilever system worked in the photo on the left. The suspended span, where Kaichi Watanabe sits, is seen in the center. The need to resist compression of the lower chord is seen in the use of wooden poles while the tension of the upper chord is shown by the outstretched arms. The action of the outer foundations as anchors for the cantilever can be seen in the placement of the counterweights. \n\nA simple cantilever span is formed by two cantilever arms extending from opposite sides of the obstacle to be crossed, meeting at the center. With a suspended span, the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central truss bridge which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special traveling supports.\n\nwith as balanced cantilever, the span is balanced by cantilevers going in the opposite direction. If these are anchored into solid foundations, they are called anchor arms. In a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by tension of the upper members and compression of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension through the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using segmental construction.\n\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the Navajo Bridge) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side.

Pliny the Elder writes about orcs in his \"Naturalis historia\". They are long-toothed sea monsters. Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533)wrote an epic \"Orlando Furioso\": There, the virgin Angelica is captured by a sea monster called orc. The hero, Rogero, is able to free her as he rode a Hippogriff. The Latin name of the Killer Whale, \"Orcinus orca\" is likely to come from that story. There is another creature called \"orc\" in \"Orlando Furioso\": a blind man-eating giant who abducts King Norandin of Damascus and his lover Lucina. This orc cannot be vanquished; only fooled by trickery.\n\nThere is another Orc that lives in the Alps. It is a demon living on mountain tops. It sometimes is described as protector of the forest. At other times it is said to be an evil spirit who brings doom to cattle and wild beasts.\n\nFrom the early Middle Ages, the orc was seen as an evil creature, much like other creatures of Celtic origin.\n", "id": "333902", "title": "Orc"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333930", "text": "David Coverdale\n\nDavid 'Jack' Coverdale (born 22 September 1951) is an English rock singer. He is most famous for his work with hard rock band Whitesnake. The band was very successful commercially. During his early career Coverdale was the vocalist of Deep Purple for some time. He left the band to become a solo artist, and worked with Whitesnake. He also made an album with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. This was also successful.\n\nCoverdale was born on 22 September 1951, in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Redcar and Cleveland, England. His love for music developed early. Around the age of 14, he began performing professionally as he wanted to be a singer. He developed his style of singing then. \"I don't think my voice had broken,\" he explained to \"Sounds\" in 1974. \"And that's when I first learnt how to sing with my stomach, which sounds silly, but it's totally different from a normal voice.\" Coverdale had been the vocalist local bands like The Government (1968–1972); Fabulosa Brothers (1972–73).\n\nIn 1973, Coverdale saw an article in a copy of \"Melody Maker\", which said that Deep Purple was auditioning for singers to replace Ian Gillan. Coverdale was the frontman of a local group called The Government. They had played with Deep Purple in 1969. So both he and the band knew one another. Coverdale first sent a tape to the band. Then, he auditioned to become a singer. He was admitted into the band, with bassist Glenn Hughes being another vocalist.\n\nIn February 1974, Deep Purple released their first album with Coverdale and Hughes called \"Burn\" which was certified Gold in the US on 20 March 1974 and in the UK on 1 July. In April 1974, Coverdale and Deep Purple performed to over 200,000 music fans at the California Jam. . This was his first trip to America.\n\nIn December 1974 \"Burn\" was followed-up by \"Stormbringer\". This also ranked at Gold album status in the US and the UK. The album had funk and sould influences. So guitarist Ritchie Blackmore left the band in June 1975.\n\nCoverdale did not want Deep Purple to disband. He helped in persuading the band to continue with American guitarist Tommy Bolin (of Billy Cobham and The James Gang). So Jon Lord said, \"David Coverdale came up to me and said, 'Please keep the band together.' David played me the album that Tommy did with Billy Cobham. We liked his playing on it and invited Tommy to audition.'\" The band released one studio album with Bolin, \"Come Taste the Band\" in 1975. The album was less successful than previous records. At the end of the tour in March 1976, Coverdale walked off in tears. He handed in his resignation. But he was told Deep Purple was disbanding. So he had no band left to quit. The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Ian Paice (the last remaining original members). Lord and Paice had not told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976. Said Coverdale in an interview: \"I was frightened to leave the band. Purple was my life, Purple gave me my break, but all the same I wanted out.\"\n\nAfter the end of Deep Purple, Coverdale started a solo career. He released his first album in February 1977. It was called \"White Snake\". All songs were written by Coverdale and guitarist Micky Moody. Coverdale later said about this album: \"It's very difficult to think back and talk sensibly about the first album. \"White Snake\" had been a very inward looking, reflective and low-key affair in many ways, written and recorded as it was in the aftermath of the collapse of Deep Purple.\" Even though the album was not successful, its title inspired the name of Coverdale's future band.\n\nIn 1978 Coverdale released his second solo album \"Northwinds\". It was received much better than \"White Snake\". But before the album's release, he had already formed a new band.\n\nAfter recording \"Northwinds\", Coverdale soon formed the band Whitesnake. Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody played guitar in the band. It began as a touring band for Coverdale's first solo album. But, it soon developed into a full-time band. In early 1978, the band released the \"Snakebite EP\". It was repackaged later. It was released as a full album called \"Snakebite\", released in June 1978, with the B-side taken from Coverdale's \"Northwinds\" album. For the next album, \"Trouble\", Coverdale was joined by his former Deep Purple colleague, keyboardist Jon Lord. For Whitesnake's 1980 album, \"Ready an' Willing\", drummer Ian Paice also joined the group. \"Ready an' Willing\" also featured the band's biggest hit up to then. This was the song \"Fool for Your Loving\". It reached #13 on the British charts and #53 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. \"Ready an' Willing\" was followed up by the even more successful \"Come an' Get It\" in 1981. During 1982 Coverdale took some time off to look after his sick daughter. He decided to put Whitesnake on hold. When David Coverdale returned, he reformed the band. They recorded the album \"Saints & Sinners\" after this.\n\nIn 1982, according to British heavy metal magazine \"Kerrang!\", Coverdale was considered for the vocalist position with Black Sabbath following the departure of Ronnie James Dio. Coverdale declined.\n\nWhitesnake became very popular in the UK, Europe, and Asia, but not in North America. In 1984, the album \"Slide It In\" finally entered the US charts (reaching #40). But it did not reach high enough to be considered a hit. When \"Slide It In\" was going to be released in the US, Coverdale made a calculated attempt at changing Whitesnake's sound and look. He recruited John Sykes from the remnants of Thin Lizzy for this. Sykes brought a more contemporary, aggressive guitar sound with him. He also had good stage manners to match. In 1985, Sykes and Coverdale started working on new songs for the next album. But Coverdale soon contracted a serious sinus infection. So he could not record that year. Doctors said he might not be able to sing again. Coverdale eventually recovered, and recordings were continued. But before their upcoming album was fully recorded and released, Coverdale had dismissed Sykes from the band.\n\nIn many period interviews, Coverdale stated that the next album was a make-or-break album for Whitesnake. If not successful, he would disband Whitesnake altogether. During 1987 and 1988, Whitesnake finally became successful in North America. They released the multi-platinum self-titled \"Whitesnake\" album. It was co-written (for most of the songs) by Sykes. But guitar was played by virtuoso Adrian Vandenberg, as a session musician.\n\nThe 1987 album has sold 8 times platinum since its release. It had hit singles like \"Here I Go Again\" and \"Is This Love\". It finally made Whitesnake a concert headliner in North America. Through the late 80s and early 90s, in the \"hair-band\" era, Coverdale kept Whitesnake going with great success. But lineups changed many times.\n\nIn 1989 Coverdale recruited Vandenberg to recorded a new album, \"Slip of the Tongue\". Vandenberg co-wrote the entire album with Coverdale. But he had a wrist injury. So he could not do solo guitar. Fellow virtuoso Steve Vai was recruited. He re-recorded most of Vandenberg's existing parts and finished the album. Upon release, it was very successful in Europe and the U.S.\n\nThe following tour, for which Vandenberg returned to play along with Vai, made Whitesnake famous as a giant in the world of hard rock. The album peaked at number 10 in the U.S., and has achieved platinum status. The tour continued until the end of 1990.\n\nCoverdale did not want to be in Whitesnake any more. He had grown uncomfortable with what he thinks Whitesnake had become. He admits that he got \"caught up in it\". In a candid period interview, Coverdale sums it up in one sentence: \"It got louder and louder, and so did I, to the point now where I have to get dressed up like a \"girly man\" and tease ones questionable bangs or hair and it's all becoming a bit... boring.\"\n\nIn 1990 Coverdale sang and co-wrote (with Hans Zimmer and Billy Idol) the song \"The Last Note of Freedom\" for the Tony Scott movie \"Days of Thunder\".\n\nOn 26 September 1990, after the last show on the \"Slip of the Tongue\" tour in Tokyo, Coverdale disbanded Whitesnake indefinitely. He was tired of the business in general and troubled by his separation and later divorce from Tawny Kitaen. Coverdale wanted to find other values in life. He took \"private time to reflect\" and think where his career was going.\n\nThe hiatus did not last long. In the early spring of 1991, Coverdale collaborated with guitarist Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin fame. Both of them have said that the collaboration revitalized them on many levels. This collaboration led to the \"Coverdale-Page\" album. It was released in March 1993. The album was a hit all over the world. It reached number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the US. It was certified Platinum in the US on 7 April 1995. But the US tour for the album had to be cancelled due to slow ticket sales. After only a limited Japanese tour, Coverdale and Page parted ways. In part, the problem had been the comparison to Robert Plant who had been the Led Zeppelin vocalist, with Jimmy Page. Some of their audience criticized Coverdale. They thought he was too similar to Plant. Others felt the collaboration only served to inspire Page to once again join Plant, a year later.\n\nIn 1994 Coverdale assembled a new line-up of Whitesnake (with the exception of Coverdale's musical partner, guitarist Adrian Vandenberg and bassist Rudy Sarzo, both of whom had been in Whitesnake since 1987). Whitesnake was to tour for the release of their \"Greatest Hits\" album. The band again broke-up after the tour. After this Coverdale once again went away from the music business, for three years. In 1997 Coverdale returned and released \"Restless Heart\" (with Vandenberg on guitar). The album was originally meant to be Coverdale's solo album. But the record company forced it to be released under the name of \"David Coverdale & Whitesnake\". The tour was called Whitesnake's farewell tour, during which Coverdale and Vandenberg played two unplugged shows (one in Japan and the other for VH1). The first of the two shows was released the next year under the title \"Starkers in Tokyo\". After the Restless Heart-tour ended, Coverdale once again ended Whitesnake and took another short break from music.\n\nIn 2000 Coverdale released his first solo album in 22 years, titled \"Into The Light\". The album was not a hit. But it did return Coverdale to the music business.\n\nIn December 2002, Coverdale re-reformed Whitesnake for an American and European tour, with Tommy Aldridge on drums, Marco Mendoza (bass), Doug Aldrich (guitar), Reb Beach (guitar) and keyboardist Timothy Drury. In 2004-2005, Whitesnake went on a tour of the United States, South America and Europe. A live DVD, shot during the 2005 tour at the legendary Hammersmith Apollo was released in February 2006. In June 2006, Coverdale signed a new record deal with Steamhammer Records. The first release under the record label was the double live album \"\" (released 27 November 2006). The album also contained 4 brand new studio tracks. They were written by Coverdale and Aldrich.\n\nIn 2008 the band (with new bassist and drummer) released its first new studio album in over 10 years titled \"Good to Be Bad\". The band toured for the album extensively. Also in 2008, Whitesnake went on a European Tour with fellow Yorkshire rock band Def Leppard.\n\nIn 2009, Whitesnake toured with Judas Priest on the \"British Steel\" Anniversary Tour. On 11 August 2009, Whitesnake was playing a show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, when Coverdale suffered a vocal injury. After seeing a specialist, it was announced on 12 August 2009 that Coverdale is suffering from severe vocal fold edema. He has a left vocal fold vascular lesion. The rest of their tour with Judas Priest was cancelled.\n\nIn early February 2010, David Coverdale has announced his voice seems to have fully recovered from the injury. He says he's been recording new demos. He wants to create a new Whitesnake album. On tape his voice is sounding full and strong. The latest Whitesnake studio album \"Forevermore\" was released on 25 March 2011, with Aldrich and Beach on board.\n\nCoverdale was first married in 1974 to Julia, and their daughter Jessica was born in 1978. Coverdale's second marriage was to actress Tawny Kitaen, from 17 February 1989. They divorced in April 1991. Kitaen was known for her provocative appearances in Whitesnake's music videos for \"Here I Go Again\", \"Is This Love\" and \"Still of the Night.\" Since 1997, he has been married to Cindy, an author with works such as \"The Food That Rocks.\" They have a son, Jasper (born 1996).\n\nOn 1 March 2007, Coverdale became a U.S. citizen, in a ceremony in Reno. He now holds dual US/UK citizenship. He has lived near Lake Tahoe, Nevada for more than 20 years.\n\n1977 \"White Snake\" <br>\n1978 \"Northwinds\" <br>\n1990 \"The Last Note Of Freedom\" - song featured on the \"Days of Thunder\" soundtrack<br>\n1993 \"Coverdale and Page\" (with Jimmy Page)<br>\n2000 \"Into the Light\"\n\n1974 Roger Glover - \"The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast\" (\"Behind the Smile\")<br>\n1974 Jon Lord - \"Windows\" - 2nd Movement, Gemini<br>\n1976 Eddie Hardin - \"Wizard's Convention\" (\"Money To Burn\")<br>\n1978 Barbi Benton - \"Ain't That Just The Way\" (co-writer of \"Up In The Air\")<br>\n1989 Steve Vai - \"Passion and Warfare\" (\"For the Love of God\")<br>\n2000 Bernie Marsden - \"And About Time Too\" (\"Who's Fooling Who\", live recording from '81, only on reissue of the album)<br>\n2003 Tony Franklin - \"Wonderland\" (\"Sunshine Lady\")\n\n", "id": "333930", "title": "David Coverdale"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333964", "text": "Tay Rail Bridge\n\nThe Tay Bridge (or Tay Rail Bridge) is a railway bridge about two and a quarter miles (three and a half kilometres) long that spans the Firth of Tay in Scotland, between the city of Dundee and Wormit, Fife ().\n\nAs with the Forth Rail Bridge, the Tay Bridge has been called the Tay Rail Bridge since the construction of the Tay Road Bridge over the firth. The original rail bridge replaced an early train ferry.\n\nThe present Tay Bridge is the second Rail bridge over the Tay. The first one collapsed in 1879 in a storm, with great loss of life.\n\nThe original Tay Bridge was designed by noted railway engineer Thomas Bouch, who received a knighthood when the bridge was completed. It was a lattice-grid design, combining cast and wrought iron. The design was well known: it was used with success in the Crumlin Viaduct in South Wales in 1858, after the use of cast iron in the Crystal Palace.\n\nA previous cast iron design, the Dee bridge which collapsed in 1847, failed due to poor use of cast-iron girders. Later, Gustave Eiffel used a similar design to create several large viaducts in the Massif Central (1867).\n\nProposals for constructing a bridge across the River Tay date back to at least 1854. The North British Railway (Tay Bridge) Act received the Royal Assent on 15 July 1870 and the foundation stone was laid on 22 July 1871.\n\nThe original design was for lattice girders supported by brick piers resting on bedrock shown by trial borings to lie at no great depth under the river. At either end of the bridge the single rail track ran on top of the bridge girder, most of which therefore lay below the pier tops. However, in the centre section of the bridge (the “high girders”) the railway ran inside the bridge girder, which could then run above the pier tops to give the required clearance to allow passage of sailing ships upriver (e.g. to Perth).\n\nHowever as the bridge extended out into the river, it became clear in December 1873, that the bedrock really lay much deeper; too deep to act as a foundation for the bridge piers. Bouch had to redesign the bridge.\n\nHe reduced the number of piers and increased the span of the girders. The pier foundations were no longer taken down to bedrock; instead they were constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed,\n\nThe company which had the contract for building the bridge went bankrupt while Bouch was redesigning the bridge. The replacement company did poor work. Almost every part of the bridge was substandard, including the iron and the ties and fixings. Lack of precision in the bolts and braces led to ad hoc on-site fixes, described by one witness at the later inquiry as \"about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life\".\n\nThe bridge was opened for passenger traffic on 1 June 1878. The next year, on June 20 1879, Queen Victoria crossed the bridge to return south from Balmoral. Bouch was presented to her before she did so, and on June 26th 1879 he was knighted by the Queen at Windsor Castle.\n\nOn the night of 28 December 1879 at 7.15pm, the bridge collapsed after its central spans gave way during high winter gales. A train with six carriages carrying seventy-five passengers and crew, crossing at the time of the collapse, plunged into the icy waters of the Tay. All seventy-five were lost. The disaster stunned the whole country and sent shock waves through the Victorian engineering community.\n\nAt the time a gale estimated at force ten or eleven (Tropical Storm force winds: 55–72 mph/80–117 km/hr) had been blowing down the Tay estuary at right angles to the bridge. The engine itself was salvaged from the river and restored to the railways for service.\n\nThe collapse of the bridge, opened only nineteen months earlier and passed as safe by the Board of Trade, is still the most famous bridge disaster in the British Isles. The stumps of the original bridge piers are still visible above the surface of the Tay even at high tide.\n\nThe inquiry held that \"the fall of the bridge was occasioned by the insufficiency of the cross-bracings and fastenings to sustain the force of the gale on the night of December 28th 1879 and that the bridge had been previously strained by other gales\".\n\nHowever, this is not a finding that the bridge \"as designed\" would have failed. The engineer appointed to carry out detailed investigations testified: \n\nThe section in the middle of the bridge, where the rail ran inside high girders, was potentially top-heavy and very vulnerable to high winds. Neither Bouch nor the contractor appeared to have regularly visited the on-site foundry where iron from the previous half-built bridge was recycled. The cylindrical cast iron columns supporting the 13 longest spans of the bridge, each 245 ft (75 m) long, were of poor quality. Many had been cast horizontally, with the result that the walls were not of even thickness, and there was some evidence that imperfect castings were disguised from the (very inadequate) quality control inspections.\n\nIn particular, some of the lugs used as attachment points for the wrought iron bracing bars had been \"burnt on\" rather than cast with the columns. Even the normal lugs were very weak. They were tested for the Inquiry, and proved to break at only about rather than the expected load of . These lugs failed and destabilised the entire centre of the bridge during the storm.\n\nPut into simple words, the bridge failed because of defects in its manufacture. This meant it did not reach the standards of wind resistance intended by the designer.\n\n\nA new double-track bridge was designed by William Henry Barlow. It was built by William Arrol & Co. upstream of, and parallel to, the original bridge. The foundation stone laid on 6 July 1883. Construction involved of iron and steel, of concrete, ten million bricks (weighing ) and three million rivets. Fourteen men lost their lives during its construction, most by drowning.\n\nThe second bridge opened on 13 July 1887 and is still in use. In 2003, a £20.85 million strengthening and refurbishment project (£ as of 2017), on the bridge was completed. More than of bird droppings were scraped off the ironwork lattice of the bridge using hand tools, and bagged into sacks. Hundreds of thousands of rivets were removed and replaced. All work was done in very exposed conditions high over fast-running tides in the river.\n", "id": "333964", "title": "Tay Rail Bridge"}

She next appeared in Paris at the Théâtre de la Renaissance in 1840. A year later, she toured with Perrot to Paris, London, Vienna, Munich, and Milan. By dancing Perrot's choreography, she gained both public and critical acclaim. \n\nHer greatest role was Giselle. The world première of this two-act ballet was on June 28, 1841 at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique, Paris. The ballet caused a sensation. It inspired reviewers to proclaim \"Giselle\" to be the greatest ballet of its time. The ballet immediately established Grisi as a star in her very first full-length ballet in Paris. Her salary grew from 5,000 francs to 12,000 in 1842 and 20,000 by 1844, with additional performance fees on top. It also marked the beginning of a change in her relationship with Jules Perrot. Grisi's last performance in the west was in Paul Taglioni's \"Les Métamorphoses\" (aka \"Satanella\", 1849).\n\nIn 1850, she joined Perrot in St. Petersburg, Russia. He had been appointed balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. She danced \"Giselle\" at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre. The first Giselle in Russia had been danced by Fanny Elssler. The initial reaction to Grisi's interpretation of the role was not enthusiastic. Over time, the Russians came to appreciate her talents. She was \"Prima Ballerina\" of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg from 1850 to 1853. She worked with Perrot and also Joseph Mazilier. \n\nIn 1854, she left Russia for Warsaw with her daughter. She intended to continue dancing. She became pregnant by Prince Léon Radziwill.

Balletomanes of the early nineteenth century were bored with stories about ancient gods and goddesses, plots based on myths, and ancient costumes. They wanted ballets about real people and real places. \"Pointe\" work became artistic expression rather than stunt work, and the long, white, ballet skirt of tulle was introduced. Both produced the illusion of ethereal weightlessness. Gas lighting made capable special dimming effects and wires made it possible for ballerinas to \"fly\". \n\nThe romantic era in ballet began with \"The Ballet of the Nuns\" in 1831 and was followed by \"La Sylphide\" in 1832. The genre began a slow decline. \"Coppélia\" of 1870 is said to mark the end of the romantic ballet, although the three ballets composed by Tchaikovsky are romantic ballets. Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" of 1876 is considered a romantic ballet. Even his \"The Nutcracker\" of 1892 is a romantic ballet. Michel Fokine's \"Les Sylphides\" of 1906 is considered a tribute to the romantic ballet in its atmosphere and tone. \n\nRomantic ballets have four things in common: they are about real people rather than mythological gods and goddesses; they employ local or national color in costumes, settings, and dances such as mazurkas and waltzes; a supernatural, fantastic, exotic, or spiritual element is usually prominent; and ballet technique is a focus, especially \"pointe\" work for the ballerina. \n\n", "id": "333988", "title": "Romantic ballet"}

It says that Afrikaners who speak their language should unite to fight off foreign influences that come from English-speaking settlers of South Africa, black people or Jews. \n\nThe historian T. Dunbar Moodie describes Afrikaner nationalism as a kind of civil religion that combined the history of the Afrikaners, their language and the Afrikaner Calvinism as key symbols. A major proponent of the ideology was the secret \"Broederbond\" organization and the National Party that ruled the country from 1948 to 1994.

Approximations are used for the following reasons:\n\nOne of the earliest known uses of numerical analysis is a Babylonian clay tablet, which approximates the square root of 2. In a unit square, the diagonal has this length. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle is extremely important, for instance, in carpentry and construction.\n\nNumerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the Babylonian approximation of formula_1, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.\n\nNumerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary differential equations appear in star movement; optimization occurs in portfolio management; numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis; stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.\n\nComputers greatly helped this task. Before there were computers, numerical methods often depended on hand interpolation in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving differential equations.\n", "id": "334165", "title": "Numerical analysis"}

There are different ways to invent the data, such as simply drawing a straight line between two data points, which is not very accurate, or using polynomials to create a more accurate representation. In many cases, the results of this interpolation are usable, either as a replacement for missing data points, or as a tool to help understand more complicated data.\n\nInterpolation tries to find the values between two known points of data. It is not to be confused with extrapolation, which is a similar process that tries to find data points at the edge or outside the currently defined points.\n\nThe primary use of interpolation is to help users, be they scientists, photographers, engineers or mathematicians, determine what data might exist outside of their collected data. Outside the domain of mathematics, interpolation is frequently used to scale images and to convert the sampling rate of digital signals.\n\nIn the domain of science, a scientist may need to use a computer to calculate a complicated function. However, if that function takes a very long time to compute, it may make her experiments difficult or impossible to run properly. So, she might use interpolation to create a slightly less complicated version of her function, which takes less computational time and energy to run. This interpolated function should achieve the same results as the more complex function, but will make some errors, or lose some detail as compared to the original function. However, the reduced time and cost of running the interpolated function may make this trade-off worthwhile.\n\nWhen an image is made larger, the existing pixels cannot simply be stretched, as you might stretch a rubber band. Instead, new pixels must be created. In order to \"guess\" what these pixels should look like, the software that enlarges the image uses interpolation. The software first spreads out the existing pixels into the new image size, leaving many gaps and spaces. Then, it examines the existing data (the original pixels) and then creates a function that describes the missing data (the new pixels) to create a new data set (the enlarged image). Sometimes, the program does a poor job, and the resulting image is blurry or wrong in places. These are called interpolation errors - the software did not correctly guess what the data should be. But, overall, the image will look similar. This is an example of the risks and benefits of interpolation - the user can see new data, but that data may not be perfect.\n\nMore about interpolation in graphics and photography: http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/image-interpolation.htm\n", "id": "334215", "title": "Interpolation"}

Gay icons can be male or female. They can be gay, straight, bisexual, or asexual. If they are gay, they can be openly gay or not. Sometimes living gay icons support LGBT causes, sometimes they do not. Some gay icons from history are tragic figures like Saint Sebastian, Oscar Wilde, or Judy Garland.

It was choreographed by Nijinsky to a short symphonic work by Claude Debussy called \"Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune\". Both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem \"L'après-midi d'un faune\" by Stéphane Mallarmé. It was Nijinsky's first choreographed work. The ballet was first performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 29 May 1912. The costumes and sets were designed by Léon Bakst. Nijinsky danced the role of the faun. \n\nGrace Robert writes in \"The Borzoi Book of Ballet\" that Bakst was responsible for the choreography. Nijinsky simply carried out his directions. However, Nijinsky's sister alleged that Bakst and Diaghilev were not involved with the choreography and were admitted to rehearsals only in the last stages. The truth will never be known; those involved are dead. The choreography however caused a scandal, especially the ending. Here, the Faun appears to climax upon a Nymph's scarf. Gaston Calmette, the editor of \"Le Figaro\", attacked the choreography on moral grounds. Sculptor Auguste Rodin defended it. The furor assured the public's interest in the ballet, then and now. \n\nThe first American performance occurred in New York City on January 17, 1916. The Catholic Theatre Movement decided the ending should be modified. The ending was duly altered. Diaghilev told the head of the Metropolitan Opera House, \"America is saved.\" Thereafter, the ballet saw a variety of manifestations until 1936 when a close facsimile of the original was presented at the Metropolitan by Colonel W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. Grace Robert believes the original ballet was produced as an aesthetic antidote to Isadore Duncan's copycats and their Greek dances. \n\nLincoln Kirstein describes the story: \"A faun lolls on a hillock ... Seven nymphs in chain step shuffle past him ... Curious, the Faun descends to watch. Curious, then alarmed, they flee, to return shyly. The Faun tries to play with them, but they are frightened by this half-boy, half-beast. The least shy ... returns; they link arms. Contact frightens her; she escapes, dropping her scarf ... she is eager to stay, but the creature seems too theatening. Leaping onto his rock, he carries her scarf ... Arching his body, he thrusts his length into it.\"\n\n\n", "id": "334221", "title": "Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)"}

The river is the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia. The bridge has border posts on both ends, at the towns of Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and Livingstone, Zambia.\n\nThe bridge was the idea of Cecil Rhodes. It was part of his grand plan to build a railway from Cape Town to Cairo. He never visited the falls and died before the building of the bridge began. Rhodes told the engineers to \"build the bridge across the Zambezi where the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls\". It was designed by George Anthony Hobson, of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, not as is often stated, Sir Ralph Freeman, the same engineer who designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Freeman, who also worked for Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, did the calculation of stresses for the bridge.\n\nThe bridge was built in England by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company. It was then shipped to the Mozambique port of Beira and transported on the newly built railway to the Victoria Falls. It took just 14 months to put together and was completed in 1905. \n\nThe bridge was officially opened by Professor George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, and President of the British Association (now the Royal Society) on 12 September 1905. The American Society of Civil Engineers lists the bridge as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\nMade from steel, the bridge is long, with a main arch spanning . It is above the lower water level of the river in the gorge below. It carries a road, railway and footway. The bridge is the only rail link between Zambia and Zimbabwe, and one of only three road links between the two countries. The other road links are at Chirundu Bridge and Kariba Dam.\n\nThe Victoria Falls Bridge did not bring the first train or the first railway to Zambia. In order build the railway north as fast as possible, Cecil Rhodes wanted the Livingstone to Kalomo line built before the bridge was finished. A locomotive was carried in pieces across the gorge by the temporary electronic cableway used to carry the bridge materials. The cableway was called the 'Blondin' by the bridge engineers. The locomotive was put back together and started work months before the bridge was complete. \n\nFor more than 50 years the bridge was used by passenger trains as part of the main route between the then Northern Rhodesia, southern Africa and Europe. Freight trains carried mainly copper ore (later, copper ingots) and timber out of Zambia, and coal into the country.\n\nThe age of the bridge and maintenance problems have led to traffic restrictions at times. Trains cross at less than walking pace and trucks were limited to loads of 30 tons. Bigger trucks have to take the longer road using the Kazungula Ferry or Chirundu Bridge. The limit was raised after repairs in 2006. The bridge needs to be extensively rebuilt or replaced. \n\nDuring the Rhodesian UDI crisis and Bush War the bridge was often closed (and regular passenger services have not been successful). In 1975, the bridge was the site of unsuccessful peace talks when the parties met in a train carriage above the gorge for nine and a half hours. In 1980 freight and road services restarted and have continued without interruption except for maintenance.\n\nToday one of the Victoria Falls Bridge's main attraction are historical guided tours about the construction of the bridge and which include a walking tour under the main deck. On the Zambian side there is a small museum about the bridge which is free to enter and contains cafe selling refreshments.\nAlso located on the bridge is the Shearwater bungee jump including a bungee swing and zip-line. Concerns about safety of the attraction were raised in late 2011 after the bungee's cord snapped and a young Australian woman fell into the fast flowing river with many crocodiles.\n\nThe bridge was originally called the Great Zambesi or Zambezi bridge, later becoming known as the Victoria Falls Bridge.\n\nThe Location of the bridge and surrounding area by Openstreetmap\n", "id": "334233", "title": "Victoria Falls Bridge"}

It was made in small sections that could be easily moved and put together on site. It was developed by the British during World War II for military use. \n\nA Bailey bridge did not need special tools or heavy equipment to put into place. The wood and steel bridge parts were small and light enough to be carried in trucks and lifted into place by hand. The bridges were strong enough to carry tanks. Bailey bridges continue to be used in building projects and to provide temporary crossings for people and vehicles. \n\nIt was designed by a British engineer, Donald Bailey. The British army tested different bridge designs in 1941–1942, including a suspension bridge and a stepped arch bridge. The flat truss bridge was the most successful. An early test model of the Bailey flat truss bridge is still in place over Mother Siller's Channel in Dorset. The Bailey bridge was first used by the army in Tobruk in 1942. The US Army built many of the bridges for use after the D-Day landings in France.\n\nThe basic Bailey bridge is made up of three main parts, the \"floor\", the \"stringers\" and the side \"panels\". The floor of the bridge is made up of a number of that run across the bridge. Across the bottom of these, forming a square, are . The bridge's strength is provided by the panels on the sides.

Later in the war, the wood was covered by steel plates, to protect it from the damage caused by tank tracks.\n\nEach unit built in this way is a single section of bridge, with a roadbed. After one section is complete it is pushed forward over rollers on the bridgehead, and another section built behind it.

He was born in the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kakaako. Ho grew up in Kāneohe on island of Oahu. He was a graduate of the Kamehameha Schools in 1949. He attended Springfield College on a football scholarship in 1950. Ho left Springfield and returned home to earn a bachelor's degree in sociology at University of Hawai'i in 1953. In 1954, Ho entered the United States Air Force. He did his basic training at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. Ho spent time flying fighter jets in both Texas and Hawaii. When he was sent to Hamilton AFB, California, he went to the local town of Concord and bought an electronic keyboard from a music store. He was known to say, \"That's when it all started.\"\n\nDon married the girl he was in love with in high school, Melvamay Kolokea Wong, on November 21, 1951. She was the mother to the first six of his children. Ho was married for 48 years until she died on June 8, 1999. While in the military, Ho lived in many states with his family until he was called home to help his mother Honey Ho, with the family bar business called Honey's.\n\nHo left the United States Air Force in 1959 due to his mother's illness. He began singing at his mother's club in Kaneohe. Honey's became a main location for the local entertainment. Many of their customers were from the Kaneohe Marine Base.. Ho always honored the military. He remembered his own years of military service. In 1963, he moved the club in Kāneohe to Waikīkī. After much success, Kimo Wilder McVay wanted Don to play at a night club called \"Duke's\". It was owned by Duke Kahanamoku.

He also kept singing ever night.\n\nHo was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2005. He had a pacemaker implanted. He talked with a biotechnology company that dealt with treating heart conditions with adult stem cells. This company was working with Dr. Shoa, cardiac surgeon and one of the first people to work with adult stem cells for heart disease. On December 6, 2005, Ho had his own stem cells put into his heart by Amit Patel and his other doctors in Thailand. The treatment went without problems.

The episode was watched by 11.70 million people in the United States. It was the top scripted show among adults aged 18–49 for the week it was broadcast. The episode guest stars Gwyneth Paltrow as Holly Holliday. She is a substitute teacher who does Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) job as glee club director while he is sick. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) becomes principal of William McKingley High School, and glee club members Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) start to feel stress in their growing friendship.\n\nThe episode includes cover versions of six songs. These songs got mixed reviews from music and television journalists. The cover version of Cee Lo Green's \"Forget You\" and mash-up of \"Singin' in the Rain\" with Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" was given good reviews. Both covers' charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Paltrow's guest appearance was given positive reviews. The sub-plots of the episode did not get good reviews. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Tim Stack all thought that \"The Substitute\" is the best episode of the season. \"Time\"s James Poniewozik said that the episode was an \"okay\" episode. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said it was better than the previous two episodes. The National Alliance on Mental Illness gave positive reviews for the episode's definition of bipolar disorder.

She was given the job after causing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to be infected with the flu. Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) also gets the flu. He takes time off from work to get better. He is cared for by his ex-wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig). This leads to them sleeping together.\n\nGlee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) tries to take over for Will. This results in problems. At the request of Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), club lessons are taught by substitute teacher Holly Holliday (Gwyneth Paltrow). She has different ways of doing things. These include talking about Lindsay Lohan's rehabilitation in Spanish, singing \"Conjunction Junction\" to her English class, and pretending to be a bipolar Mary Todd Lincoln for the History class. When Holly first goes to glee club rehearsal, she does a cover of Cee Lo Green's \"Forget You\". The group likes her performance. Rachel is annoyed. She is worried that Holly may not be able to get them ready for the Sectionals competition. Holly later wins over Rachel by \"duetting\" with her on \"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag\" from the musical \"Chicago\".\n\nKurt rejects his best friend Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) in favor of his new friend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). Mercedes does not like it when Kurt tries to set her up on a date with a football player because they are both black. She also feels left out when she comes with Kurt and Blaine to dinner. This is because the conversation is mostly about gay issues and icons. When Sue starts a healthy eating program and says people can not eat \"Potater Tots\", Mercedes starts a student protest. She also puts Tots in the tailpipe of Sue's car. This causes $17,000 worth of damage.\n\nSue's program becomes popular with the students' parents. Her job as principal is made permanent, and she fires Will. Will is later visited by Holly who is looking for help. Holly does not think she is doing a good job as a teacher. She thinks this because she caused Mercedes to act the way she did. She tells him that, at first, she took her work seriously. She changed when a student (Lindsay Sims-Lewis) hit her in the face. Because of being hit, she chose to be more laid-back. Terri arrives while they are talking. She gets mad because Holly is there. Will asks Terri to leave. He tells her her that their \"reunion\" was a mistake and he ends their relationship.\n\nKurt confronts Mercedes. He tells her that she may be substituting food for love and their friendship for a romantic relationship. Mercedes decides to talk to the student who Kurt tried to set her up with. As she leaves, school bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) approaches Kurt. He tells Kurt that he will kill him if Kurt tells people that he is gay. At the request of the glee club members, Sue makes Will the director again. He suggests a group performance of \"Singin' in the Rain\". Will asks Holly to help them make it modern. They end up with a mash-up with Rihanna's \"Umbrella\" song.\n\n\"The Substitute\" is Paltrow's first ever scripted-show guest performance. The role of Holly was created for her by show creator Ryan Murphy. Murphy suggested that she show her vocal and dancing talent before the December 2010 release of the movie \"Country Strong\". In this movie, Paltrow plays a country singer. In September 2010, BBC News said that she would be in two more episodes of \"Glee\". E! Online's Kristen dos Santos said that Holly would become a love interest for Will in the episode. Murphy later said that Holly's appearance would create a \"love quadrangle\" between herself, Will, guidance counselor (a counselor and an educator who helps students with problems they are dealing with in school by giving positive advice.) Emma Phillsbury (Jayma Mays) and her boyfriend Carl Howell (John Stamos). Fancast later said that Paltrow's guest appearance had been shorten to a single episode. They also said that neither Mays and Stamos were in \"The Substitute\". After the episode was done filming, Murphy stated that both he and Paltrow hoped that she would appear on \"Glee\" again in the future. This would depend on a storyline that best fit with her character Holly. In December 2010, Paltrow said that she would return to the series for another episode. A month later, Murphy said she would be on the series again as a sex education teacher. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series\" for her work in \"The Substitute\".\n\n\"The Substitute\" includes a short \"fantasy\" moment. In it, Will sees the club members as kindergarten-aged children. Child actors were used to act out as the characters' younger selves. These included Jake Vaughn and Lauren Boles as young Finn and Rachel. The episode also includes the return of Gilsig. Gilsig had not been in several episodes of \"Glee\". Gilsig believed that Will's sickness let viewers see the couple in a positive relationship for the first time. She also thought that the addition of Holly \"highlighted\" a special bonding in their relationship. She said that while Terri is not \"the most pleasant person\", she is at least faithful to Will, while he has \"a wandering eye\" (has interest in another women) and treats Terri badly in \"The Substitute\". The main characters in this episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Principal Figgins, school bully Dave Karofsky, cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), wrestler Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) and Kurt's friend Blaine Anderson.\n\n\"The Substitute\" includes cover versions of six songs. Paltrow performs on four of these. She recorded them all in one day. The songs she recorded were \"Conjunction Junction\" from Schoolhouse Rock!, and a clean version of Cee Lo Green's \"Fuck You!\" entitled \"Forget You\". The producers of the series had wanted Paltrow to sing a Coldplay song. They chose to not do this. They wanted to use the song for a competition episode of \"Glee\". Morrison and Shum, Jr. sang a duet version of \"Make 'Em Laugh\" from the musical \"Singin' in the Rain\". Paltrow and Michele did a duet on \"Nowadays / Hot Honey Rag\" from the musical \"Chicago\". Morrison and Paltrow performed a mash-up of \"Singin' in the Rain\" with \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z. The cast had to spend twelve hours filming for the mash-up in a tank of water.\n\nAll of the songs performed except \"Conjunction Junction\" were released as digital download singles. \"Forget You\" is featured on the soundtrack album \"Glee: The Music, Volume 4\" (2011). \"Forget You\" and \"Singing in the Rain / Umbrella\" charted both on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and internationally. \"Forget You\" peaked at number eleven in the US and number twelve in Canada. \"Singing in the Rain / Umbrella\" peaked at number ten in Ireland. Green's \"Fuck You!\" entered the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first time after the Glee cover. His sales increased 94% in a week.\n\nWhen \"The Substitute\" was first broadcast on FOX, it was watched by 11.70 million US viewers. It had a 5.0/14 Neilsen rating/share in the 18-49 demographic group. This helped the episode to become the top-rated program of the night for adults aged 18–49. In the weekly rankings, the episode was the top scripted program for adults 18-49. Overall, it placed twentieth for the second season. Views and ratings were both better than the previous episode, \"Never Been Kissed\". It was watched by 10.99 million viewers and had a 4.6/13 rating/share. In Canada, viewership was also better than the last episode. It was watched by 2.29 million viewers and ranked ninth for the week. The last episode had 1.97 million viewers and ranked twelfth. In Australia, the episode was watched by 1.06 million viewers. This made \"Glee\" the seventh most-watched program of the night and nineteenth of the week. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.55 million viewers-2.11 million on E4, and 439,000 on E4+1. It was the most-watched show on cable for that week.\n\nThe music performances got mixed feedback from music and television journalist. Anthony Benigno of the \"Daily News\" gave \"Conjunction Junction\" an \"A\". He had noticed the \"ordinarily\" (in a normal way) of the song. Benigno did not give a review for the song because of its short length. He only said \"what a glorious ten seconds it is\". Benigno and Poniewozik criticized \"Forget You\" for not having any profanity that was in the original recording. Poniewozik liked Paltrow's \"deeper voice\". He gave her cover a \"A\". Benigno liked the original version better. \"Rolling Stone\"s Erica Futterman believed the \"clean version\" of the song did not affect its success. She said that it was \"charming and sassy\". Megan Vick of \"Billboard\" called it \"the most exciting number (song)\" of the episode. Stack gave the song an \"A+\". He also said it was \"one of the most memorable and energetic \"Glee\" performance(s) ever, thank in no small part to Paltrow\". Green told MTV that we was \"flattered\" by the cover, mostly because he did not know Paltrow would perform it after he was allowed to be in the audience watching the episode filming. He called her performance \"great\". He also said that he did not know that she could sing.\n\nBenigno and Stack gave a good review for the choreography of \"Make 'Em Laugh\". They gave it a \"B\" and \"B+\". These were lower grades than they gave \"Forget You\". Vick said that \"Glee\" covers songs from musicals to often introduce classic songs to viewers in a more modern way. He felt that \"Make 'Em Laugh\" did not do this. The \"Chicago\" cover did not get a positive review from many critics. Futterman, \"The Wall Street Journal\"s Raymund Flandez and \"The Atlantic\"s Patrick Burns all believed the choreography was \"lacking\". Kevin Fallon said that \"Glee\" should not be \"overusing recreations\". He said that they had done this in other episodes. These included \"The Power of Madonna\", \"Britney/Brittany\" and \"The Rocky Horror Glee Show\". Todd VanDerWerff of the \"A.V. Club\" said he did not like the performances. He said they were \"outright plagiarism\", not an homage (in respect)\" to the original artist.\n\nFor the song \"Singin' in the Rain/ Umbrella\", Benigno and Futterman compared the songs as a better mash-up than the previous episode's mash-up. Benigno gave the cover a \"B\". He said that by using \"Singin' in the Rain\" as the chorus, the song lacked \"catharsis\". This was also seen by Flandez. He gave positive reviews on the costumes, props and staging, but had hoped that the cover had more \"bite\" and \"attitude\". Futterman said it was a \"buoyant (cheerful) and catchy homage to the old and the new [that] perfectly captures \"Glee\"s musical spirit\". Vick felt the song could not compare to the previous episode's mash-ups. She believed the staging was \"implausible\" (not believable). Stack wrote that he loved the mash-up. He gave it an \"A-\". Amy Reiter of the \"Los Angeles Times\" liked the choreography.\n\n", "id": "334885", "title": "The Substitute"}

It has over 30 indoor and outdoor attractions. The Cincinnati Zoo also breeds rare animals. For example, it was the first zoo to breed the California sea lion and one of the first to breed the American bison both in 1878. It is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where one, two, and three Sumatran Rhinoceroses have been born.\n\nThe Cincinnati Zoo started in 1875. It covered 66 acres and was owned by some of the richest men in Cincinnati. There are currently around 500 species at the zoo with a total of around 1900 animals. There are also over 6,000 plant species shown at the zoo. The zoo is home to Indian blue peafowls that are free to walk anywhere around the zoo.\n\nIn the late 2000s, the Cincinnati Zoo was named the Greenest Zoo in America for their \"go green\" practices.

It is a main character of the cleidoic egg, which allows amniotes to breed on land.\n\nAmniotes developed the cleidoic egg early in the Carboniferous period, and this meant they could live and reproduce on dry land. These early land animals evolved into the reptiles, birds and mammals of today. In contrast, the amphibia are land animals who must lay their eggs in water, because the eggs are not protected by a shell. \n\nThe structure and composition of the eggshell protects the egg against damage, microbial contamination, and desiccation (drying out). Small molecules can pass through it, so the shell allows gas exchange for the growing embryo. It also provides calcium for the embryo's skeleton. \n\nWhile many reptiles lay eggs with flexible, calcified, eggshells, there are some that lay hard eggs. Eggs laid by snakes generally have leathery shells which often adhere to one another. Depending on the species, turtles and tortoises lay hard or soft eggs. Several species lay eggs which are nearly the same as bird eggs.\n\nThe normal bird egg is a fertilized egg sitting on the yolk surface and surrounded by albumen, or egg white. The albumen in turn is surrounded by two shell membranes (inner and outer membranes) and then the eggshell. The chicken eggshell is 95-97% calcium carbonate crystals, which are held together by a protein matrix. \n\nWhile the bulk of eggshell is made of calcium carbonate, it is now thought that the protein matrix has an important role to play in eggshell strength. These proteins affect crystallization, which in turn affects the eggshell structure. \n\nThe average laying hen, takes about 20 hours to make the shell. Pigmentation is added to the shell by papillae lining the oviduct, coloring it any of a variety of colors and patterns depending on the species.\n\n", "id": "334995", "title": "Eggshell"}

The adult flies usually feed on nectar and pollen, and some are important pollinators.\n\nMany Bombyliidae look like bees and so a common name for the family is the bee flies. The reason is probably aposematic: the adults are safer from predators because they share the warning colours of bees. The adult females usually lay eggs near the nests of possible hosts, often in the burrows of solitary bees, wasps or beetles. \n\nThe larval stages are predators or parasitoids of the eggs and larvae of other insects.

Phototropism is common in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a plant growth hormone called auxin, which causes phototropism to occur. It causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light.\n\nPhototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is a \"positive phototropism\", while growth away from light is called \"negative phototropism\". Most plant shoots have positive phototropism. Roots usually have negative phototropism, though gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them.\n\nAuxin collects mainly on the darker side of the stem and stimulates cell elongation. Thus, the cells on the side not directly exposed to light will grow faster than the opposing side, and the stem will curve towards the light source. \n\nPhototropism in plants such as \"Arabidopsis thaliana\" is directed by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light, and cryptochromes that sense blue light. \n", "id": "335057", "title": "Phototropism"}

It was created for television by Frank Darabont. The series is based on the comic book series \"The Walking Dead\" by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.\n\nThe series stars Andrew Lincoln as sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes. Rick wakes up after being in a coma to find the world is filled with \"walkers\". These walkers are similar to the zombies of George A. Romero's horror movies. He leaves to find his family and other people who are still alive.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" was first broadcast on October 31, 2010. on the cable television channel AMC in the United States. The second season of the series was first shown on October 16, 2011. After the second episode of season 2, AMC said that there would be a third season. The show is now in its sixth season.\n\nThe series has been liked by critics. It has been nominated for many awards. These include a Writers Guild of America Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award nomination for \"Best Television Series Drama\". It has won one Emmy Award. The series has also had very good Nielsen ratings. The rating for the series have set many records for a cable series. For example, 9 million people watched its season two finale (last episode of the season). This made it the most-watched basic cable drama telecast in history.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" is based on the comic book series of the same name. It tells the story of a small group of people living in a zombie apocalypse. Most of the story takes place in the near Atlanta, Georgia. The group looks for safe place which is not near the very large groups of deadly zombies. The zombies are called \"walkers\" in the series. Walkers will eat any living thing they can catch. They also infect anything they bite. The first episode deals mainly with the problems the group have as they try to keep their humanity and still survive.\n\nThe group is led by Rick Grimes. He was a sheriff's deputy before the zombies. The group must always deal with the horror and danger of the walkers. They must also deal with changes in their group as new people join them and others are killed.\n\nSeason one is about Rick Grimes as he tries to find his family and take them to safety. The series starts with Rick waking up from a coma. He awakes to a world overrun with the walking dead (\"walkers\"). Rick leaves the hospital. He goes to his home and learns that his wife and son are not there. Rick hears a rumour from a fellow survivor. He goes to the police station and gets weapons. He goes to Atlanta. He was told that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a \"safe-zone\" in the city. He thinks this is where his family would have gone. During his travel, Rick sees the damage to both society and infrastructure caused by the disaster. When he gets to Atlanta, he sees that the city is overrun by the undead. It is no longer a safe zone.\n\nA few miles outside the city, Rick's wife Lori and son Carl have been hiding from the walkers with Shane Walsh. Shane was a deputy who worked with Rick. He was also his best friend. Shane and Lori are in a camp with a small group of survivors. Rick meets Glenn in the city. Glenn helps him leave Atlanta and takes him to the camp where he finds Lori and Carl. Rick takes command of the group with Shane. Part of the group goes back into Atlanta to get weapons. While there, they have a conflict with other survivors. When the group returns to their camp, they find that many walkers are now there. One of their group is injured and needs medical treatment. The group chooses to go back to Atlanta and try to get help from the CDC.\n\nOnly one person is left in the CDC. This person is Dr. Edwin Jenner. Everyone else has either left or killed themselves. Dr. Jenner tells the group that his research into the infection has not led to a cure. The CDC building is not the safe place the group thought it would be. The next day, the safety protocols are started when there is not enough fuel for the generators. An explosion will destroy the CDC. The explosion is to stop the escape of any deadly diseases in the CDC. Dr. Jenner tells the group that the French may have found a cure. He thinks this is possible since they survived the longest in their labs. Dr. Jenner choses to stay in the CDC and die in the explosion. A member of the group, Andrea, tries to stay as well. Her sister Amy had just died and Andrea did not want to live anymore. Dale stays with her. He tells her that if she does not leave, he will not leave also. To stop him from dying, Andrea choses to leave with the group. Before the group leaves, Dr. Jenner whispers something into Rick's ear. The group leave just as the CDC explodes.\n\nThe second season starts with Rick and his group leaving the CDC. They think that they should go to Fort Benning. While going there, they find that I-85 is blocked by many empty vehicles. The group searches some of the vehicles and takes things that could be useful. While they are searching, a very large group of walkers moves along the road towards them. They have to hide under the vehicles so the walkers do not see them. Sophia is seen by a walker and runs into the woods to get away from it. After the walkers leave, the group starts to look for Sophia. During the search, Carl is shot by a man hunting a deer. Otis, the man who shot Carl, takes Rick and Shane to a large farm. The farm is owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. Hershel removes the bullet from Carl. The group go to the farm while Carl heals. Secrets and issues about who should lead the group causes problems. During this time, many relationships are dealt with and the group continues to look for Sophia. Glenn starts a romantic relationship with one of Hershel's daughters, Maggie. He learns that Hershel's barn is full of walkers. Some of these are Hershel´s family members. Hershel thinks they are just sick and could be cured someday. When Shane lets the walkers out of the barn and the group shoots them all. After the last of the walkers is killed, one last walker leaves the barn. It is Sophia. She is then shot by Rick.\n\nHershel tells Rick and his group that they have to leave his farm. Rick and Glenn go looking for Hershel. They find him in a local tavern. He is drinking large amounts of alcohol. After trying to get Hershel to go back to the farm, two other men enter the bar. They are with another group of survivors. This meeting does not go well and both men are killed in a gunfight. Other members of the group the dead men were with come looking for them. They find Rick, Hershel, and Glenn at the bar and begin shooting at them. The noise of the guns attracts a large group of walkers. While trying to get away from the walkers, the other group leaves one of their group, Randal, behind. Rick does not want to leave Randal to be killed by walkers. He cover his eyes and take him to the farm. Once they get him to the farm, they think that he could lead the rest of his group to the farm. Rick wants to drive Randall far away and set him free. While He and Shane are doing this, they are attacked by walkers when Rick and Shane get into a fight. Before the walkers attacked, Randall tells Rick and Shane that he knew Maggie. He knows where the farm is at. Rick thinks the location of the farm should be a secret to keep them safe. Since Randal knows where it is, they take him back to the farm until they know what to do with him. Rick and Shane talk about the fact that they will probably have to kill Randal. Back at the farm, Hershel's daughter Beth tries to kill herself. Seeing so many people in her family die, she does not want to live in this world anymore. The group talks about what to do with Randall. Only Dale thinks they should not kill him. While they are talking about Randal, Carl takes a gun from Daryl's motorcycle and goes into the woods. He sees a walker with its legs trapped in mud. Rather than shooting it, he starts throwing rocks at it. After a while, the walker gets free of the mud but Carl runs away. Later that night, the Rick and Shane go to kill Randal. As they are doing this, Carl enters the barn and tells Rick to shoot him. This causes Rick to stop and try to find a different way to deal with the problem. Soon after this, Dale is badly injured by a walker and will die soon. It is the same walker that Carl ran from earlier. Dale is then shot in the head by Daryl. This ends his suffering and stops him from coming back as a walker. Shane goes to the building where they are keeping Randal. He sets him free and takes him into the woods. Shane tells Randal he want to leave Rick's group and join Randal's group. Instead of this, Shane leads Randal from the farm and kills him by breaking his neck. The group sees that Randal is gone and starts to look for him. Shane goes back to the camp and tells them that Randal had gotten free, attacked him and taken his gun. Daryl, Glenn, Rick and Shane go looking for him. They separate into two groups. Daryl and Glenn are one group, Rick and Shane are the other. Daryl and Glenn find Randall. He has become a walker. They look at his body and see that he was never bitten. They understand that the dead can come back without being bitten. Shane uses the search for Randall to try to kill Rick. His plan does not work and Rick kills Shane. Just minutes later, Shane turns into a walker and stands up. Carl shoots him.\n\nA very large number of walkers in the woods hear the noise caused by Carl's gun. They all start to walk in that direction. Rick and Carl run to the barn. Rick tells Carl to set the barn on fire after the walkers come inside. Rick and Carl leave the barn from an upper level while the walkers burn. With walkers all over the farm, a large battle takes place. Jimmy and Patricia are killed and Andrea is left behind. The rest drive away from the farm. Andrea runs into the woods. She is chased by many walkers. She kills many of them and is later rescued by a hooded woman. This woman, Michonne, is carrying a sword to kill walkers. She also has two walkers with her. These two walkers have had both of their arms and their lower jaws cut off. Michonne leads the armless walkers around with chains around their necks. The survivors all meet back on the highway where they lost Sophia. They drive off but must soon make camp when Rick's vehicle has no more fuel. Rick tells them that \"this isn't a democracy any more\" after he tells them what Dr. Jenner told him. Jenner told him that all of the survivors are infected. A large prison is shown in the be background as the episode ends.\n\nThe group have been on the road for months and Lori is far into her pregnancy. Rick finds a prison which was seen in the final scene in season 2. They decide to go to the prison and stay there. They kill the walkers outside and then go inside to kill some more. Hershel gets bitten in the leg and Rick has to cut it off. The group meet prisoners who had been in the prison's cafeteria for months. The prisoners had no idea what had been going on in the world since the outbreak started and Rick tells them about it. Some of the prisoners try to kill members of the group and so Rick kills Tomas and leaves Andrew to die while Oscar and Axel are put in another block away from the group. Andrew is still alive and rings an alarm which brings walkers to the prison. A huge battle happens. T-Dog is killed by walkers trying to protect Carol. Lori is about to give birth to her baby as this is happening. Maggie cuts her open to take the baby out but Lori dies. Carl is then forced to shoot his mother in the head. Rick finds Andrew and is nearly killed when Oscar shoots Andrew, killing him and saving Rick. After the attack, Maggie and Carl bring the baby to Rick. Rick finds out Lori died and starts crying.\n\nAfter Lori has died, Rick starts to see visions of her. At the same time, Andrea and Michonne are found by Merle, who is Daryl's brother. Merle takes them to a town called Woodbury. The leader of Woodbury is a man who everyone calls The Governor. Michonne doesn't trust Woodbury and goes to the prison where Rick is. At the prison, Michonne meets Rick and his group. Glenn and Maggie are captured by Woodbury, so Michonne takes Rick's group to Woodbury to save them. In the battle, people on both sides die, but the prison group finds a way to escape. The Governor says to Woodbury that Rick and his group are terrorists.\n\nDaryl reunites with his brother Merle after the battle and chooses to leave Rick's group with Merle. He changes his mind later and goes back to the prison group. Rick goes to his hometown to get weapons, and thinks about his morals when he sees Morgan again. Andrea convinces The Governor to speak to Rick and make an agreement for peace; secretly, The Governor plans an attack, and Merle risks his life to stop the attack. Andrea runs away from Woodbury but is caught by The Governor. He locks her in a room with a walker and attacks the prison. They are stopped by Rick's group, and The Governor kills his own people for not fighting. The Governor escapes, and Rick's group returns to Woodbury to bring in the survivors but are too late to save Andrea.\n\nSeveral months later, the prison community has gotten bigger. Many people in the prison get sick with the flu at once. The flu kills many people who come back as walkers. Rick sends Carol away for murdering two sick residents. Walkers attack the prison fence and break it but are stopped afterwards. The Governor meets the Chambler family, and they join another group of survivors led by Martinez, who was in Woodbury before. The Governor kills Martinez and takes lead the group to attack the prison. Rick offers to share the prison, but The Governor calls Rick a liar and kills Hershel. The Governor fights Rick and is killed by Michonne, but the prison is taken over by walkers and Rick's group is divided.\n\nSeparated into small groups, the survivors see signs along railway lines that say that there is a safe place at Terminus. Glenn and Tara Chambler join a group of people including Eugene Porter – who says he knows how to stop the walkers if he can get to to Washington, D.C. They meet up with Maggie and are the first to get to Terminus. Carol helps two sisters she taught to use weapons in secret. After one of them kills the other, Carol kills the living sister. Beth Greene is taken away from Daryl by unknown people. Daryl meets and joins a gang that later say they want to kill Rick. Daryl helps Rick, and Carl and Michonne to defeat them. Then they reach Terminus. They are welcomed by the residents of Terminus first, but are forced to give up their weapons and locked inside a railway boxcar.\n\nRick's group find out that the residents of Terminus eat other people. Carol uses walkers to attack Terminus so the others can escape. Reunited, they soon encounter Gareth and a small group of Terminus survivors who try to eat Rick's group but are defeated. Abraham Ford and Rosita Espinosa continue their mission to get Eugene to Washington, D.C., joined by Glenn, Maggie and Tara. After facing a number of problems, Eugene says that he made up the story about a cure in order to get protection. Daryl and Carol follow a marked car to Atlanta, where Beth has been kept in a nearby hospital ruled by untrustworthy police officers. Carol is taken, and Daryl gets the rest of his group to help. They capture police officers to make a trade but a brief standoff ends with Beth killed.\n\nThe reunited group continue toward Washington, D.C. and meet Aaron who offers them shelter at the Alexandria Safe Zone, a community led by Deanna Monroe. Feeling the sheltered residents can't survive against walkers or other survivors, Rick and Carol discuss taking over the community while others begin to take leadership roles. A series of problems scare residents, and during a meeting deciding Rick's fate he kills a resident who accidentally killed Deanna's husband. Rick's friend Morgan arrives to see the execution.\n\nThe series features several actors whom \"Walking Dead\" developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden (Andrea), Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Sam Witwer (the dead soldier in the tank where Rick hides in \"Days Gone Bye\"), and Juan Gabriel Pareja (Morales).

Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film \"The Majestic\" (as Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's character's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has also appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to \"The Mist\" and \"The Majestic\", he appeared in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"The Green Mile\" (1999).

It is often shortened to \"NLP\". The discipline assumes there is a link between neurological processes, language and behavior. According to NLP, it is possible to achieve certain goals in life by changing one's behaviour. \nCertain neuroscientists psychologists and linguists, believe that NLP is unsupported by current scientific evidence and that it uses incorrect and misleading terms and concepts.\n\nNLP was invented by Richard Bandler and John Grinder. According to these people, NLP can help solve problems such as phobias, depression, habit disorder, psychosomatic illnesses, and learning disorders.\n\nReviews of empirical research on NLP show that NLP contains many factual errors. It did not produce reliable results for the claims for effectiveness made by NLP’ developers and proponents. According to Devilly, NLP is no longer as common as it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Criticisms go beyond the lack of empirical evidence for effectiveness; critics say that NLP has pseudoscientific characteristics, title, concepts and terminology. One example where NLP is used as pseudoscience is to make the teaching of scientific literacy at the professional and university level easier. NLP also appears on peer reviewed expert-consensus based lists of discredited interventions. In research designed to identify the “quack factor” in modern mental health practice, Norcross \"et al.\" (2006) list NLP as possibly or probably discredited, and in papers reviewing discredited interventions for substance and alcohol abuse, Norcross \"et al.\" (2010) list NLP in the top ten most discredited, and Glasner-Edwards and Rawson (2010) list NLP as “certainly discredited”.\n", "id": "335464", "title": "Neurolinguistic programming"}

People do not agree about his parents: Sometimes he is said to be the son of Poseidon and the gorgon Euryale, at other times, he is said to have three fathers, Poseidon, Zeus and either Hermes or Ares. All three mixed their perm in a bag of animal hide. Zeus gave him his craving for erotic adventures, from Poseidon, he got the ability to walk on water.\n\nHe is married to Side, but Hera cast his wife into the Tartaros, because Side was too proud of her own beauty.\n\nIn Greek literature he first appears as a great hunter in Homer's epic the \"Odyssey\", where Odysseus sees his shade in the underworld. The bare bones of his story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no literary version of his adventures. Other heroes' stories are told, for example Jason in Apollonius of Rhodes' \"Argonautica\" or Euripides' \"Medea\". The entry in Ovid's \"Fasti\" for May 11 is a poem on the birth of Orion, but that is one version of a single story. The surviving fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about Greek prehistory and myth.\n\nOrion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which we have the most evidence (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Straits of Sicily.\n", "id": "335507", "title": "Orion (mythology)"}

It starred Carlotta Grisi and Lucien Petipa. \"Paquita\" remained in the repertory of the Opéra until 1851. \n\nThe story takes place in Spain during the occupation of Napoleon's army. The heroine is the young Gypsy girl, Paquita. She is really of noble birth. She was abducted by Gypsies when she was an infant. She saves the life of a young French officer, Lucien d'Hervilly. He is the target of a Spanish governor who desires to have him killed by Iñigo, a Gypsy chief. Paquita discovers that she is of noble birth. She is in fact the cousin of Lucien. She and Lucien marry.\n\nIn 1847, \"Paquita\" was staged for the first time in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa and Pierre-Frédéric Malevergne. It was Petipa's first ballet staged in Russia. In 1881, Petipa produced a revival of the ballet. He added new pieces specially composed by Ludwig Minkus. This included the \"Pas de trois\" (aka the Minkus Pas de trois or Paquita Pas de trois) for the first act, and the Paquita \"Grand pas classique\" and the \"Mazurka des enfants\" (Children's mazurka) for the last act.

Everyone will travel the same distance. They usually compete around an oval course. The Dutch were arguably the earliest pioneers of skating. They began \nusing canals to maintain communication by skating from village to \nvillage as far back as the 13th century. Skating eventually spread \nacross the channel to England, and soon the first clubs and artificial \nrinks began to form. Passionate skaters included several kings of England, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon III and German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. \n\nSpeed skating appeared for the first time in 1924 at the first Olympic Winter Games in Chamonix. Initially, only men were allowed to \nparticipate. It was only at the Lake Placid Games in 1932 that women \nwere authorised to compete in speed skating, which was then only a \ndemonstration sport. It was not until the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley that women’s speed skating was officially included in the Olympic programme. \n\nThe events almost always follow the European system, which consists \nof skaters competing two-by-two. At the 1932 Olympic Games, the Americans organised American-style events, i.e. with a mass start. This decision brought about a boycott by many European competitors, which allowed the Americans to win the four gold medals. This system would give birth to short-track speed skating, which was added to the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992. The first known skating competition is thought to have been held in the Netherlands in 1676. However, the first official speed skating events were not held until 1863 in Oslo, Norway. In 1889, the Netherlands hosted the first World Championships, bringing together Dutch, Russian, American and English teams. \n", "id": "335687", "title": "Speed skating"}

We felt we needed to take a stand.” Numerous parodies of the video were released online. Thicke responded to criticism by calling it 'ridiculous'. He said the lyrics are about \"blurring the lines between men and women and how much we're the same\" and \"blurred lines between a good girl and a bad girl.\"\n\nOn July 30 the album \"Blurred Lines\" was released in the US.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336122", "text": "Assembly line\n\nAn assembly line is a manufacturing process which is a very important part of industry.\n\nIn an assembly line, parts are added to a product in a sequence. Each worker and machine does one part, and the parts are put together to make the finished object. This makes a product much faster than with handcrafting-type methods, where one person made the whole object. \n\nThe division of labour was discussed by Adam Smith in his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776). He used the manufacture of pins as an example.\n\nThe assembly line developed by Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1915 made assembly lines famous as an example of mass production. The result was a cheaper car, the Ford Model T, and higher wages for Ford workers. Henry Ford was the first to master the moving assembly line, and was able to reduce labor hours needed to make a car, and increased numbers of cars and parts. Ford was the first company to build large factories around the assembly line concept. \n\nMass production by assembly lines was the catalyst which started the modern consumer culture by making possible low unit cost for manufactured goods. It is often said that Ford's production system was ingenious because it turned Ford's own workers into new customers. The lower prices turned a huge potential market into a reality. The greater demand allowed further economies of scale to be exploited. This bootstrapping quality of growth made Ford famous and set an example for other industries.\n\nThe idea was not invented by Ford. Its use in America may have started with the production of cars by Ransom E. Olds in 1901.\n\nThe earliest example of an assembly system is the Terracotta Army of the 3rd century BC. The terracotta army figures were made in workshops. The head, arms, legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled. Studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used. Once put together, features such as facial expressions were added. \n\nIt is thought their legs were made the same way that terracotta drainage pipes were made at the time. This would make it an assembly line production, with specific parts manufactured and assembled after being fired, as opposed to crafting one solid piece and subsequently firing it. In those times, each workshop had to write its name on items produced. Once they were completed, the terracotta figures were placed in the pits in precise military formation according to rank and duty.\n", "id": "336122", "title": "Assembly line"}

It has segmented ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a midline. The genus \"Charnia\" was named after Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England, where the first fossilised specimen was found.\n\n\"Charnia\" is a highly significant fossil for several reasons. It is the first fossil ever described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until then the Precambrian was thought to have no fossils. Similar fossils found in the 1930s (Namibia) and the 1940s (Australia) but were thought to be of Cambrian age. \n\nSecondly, \"Charnia\" has become an enduring image of Precambrian animals. Originally interpreted as an alga (Ford), it was recast as a sea pen, a sister group to the modern soft corals, from 1966 onwards (Glaessner). The sea pen interpretation has recently been discredited. The current \"state of the art\" is something of a \"statement of ignorance\".\n\nLittle is known of the ecology of \"Charnia\". It was benthic, anchored to the sea floor. It probably lived in deep waters, below the waves (perhaps a great deal below the wave base). This means it did not photosynthesise. Further, it has no obvious feeding apparatus (mouth, gut, etc.) and so its lifestyle is somewhat of an enigma. Some think it survived by filter feeding or directly absorbing nutrients. \n\nThe growth and development of the Ediacara biota is also important. It was used to discredit the sea pen hypothesis. In contrast to the sea pens (that grow by new buds at the base), \"Charnia\" grew by new buds at the apex.\n\n\"Charnia\" is, in time and geography, the most widespread Ediacaran fossil. The greatest abundance of specimens, which are also the oldest reliably dated Ediacaran fossils, are found at Mistaken Point on Newfoundland.\n\nThree species, \"C. masoni\", \"C. wardi\", and \"C. antecedens\", have different length/width ratios and attachments of adjacent branches. \n\n\"Charnia masoni\" was found by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who later became a professor of metamorphic petrology, in 1957. Tina Negus, a 15 year old schoolgirl at the time, had seen this fossil a year previously, but her geography schoolteacher flatly denied the possibility of Precambrian fossils. \n\n\"Charnia wardi\", later discovered in 1978 in southeast Newfoundland, was first described in 2003. This is the longest surviving Ediacaran age fossil, lasting over 2 million years. The holotype is a fragmentary specimen with a \"C. masoni\" like structure. It was defined as a new species on the basis of long and narrow shape. \n\n\"Charnia antecedens\" has more irregular and higher angles of branching than \"C. masoni\".\n\nA number of Ediacaran form taxa are thought to represent \"Charnia\" (or \"Charniodiscus\") at varying levels of decay.\n", "id": "336141", "title": "Charnia"}

It runs from High Holborn, at its north end in the London Borough of Camden, and meets Aldwych in the south in the City of Westminster at Bush House. It was built in the 1900s. Together Kingsway and Aldwych form one of the major north-south routes through central London linking the ancient east-west routes of High Holborn and Strand.\n\nThe road was built as part of a redevelopment of the area in the 1900s. Its route cleared away the maze of small streets in Holborn such as Little Queen Street and the surrounding dwellings. However Holy Trinity Church, which was built in Little Queen Street was spared. Whereas the Sardinian Embassy Chapel, an important Roman Catholic church attached to the Embassy of the Kingdom of Sardinia, was demolished to make way for the new street.\n\nPlans were published by London County Council in 1898 and the road was formally opened in 1905. It is one of the broadest streets in central London at wide.\n\nIt was unique in containing below it a tunnel for a tramway, which started just north of Southampton Row, passed beneath Aldwych and continued to the Thames Embankment: this Kingsway tramway subway joined the North and South London tram systems. In 1958 the disused tunnel was reopened at the southern end to make a new connection, the Strand Underpass, for light traffic between Waterloo Bridge and Kingsway on order to reduce congestion. Also beneath Kingsway was a branch of the Piccadilly tube line from Holborn to Aldwych. It is now closed with no service but the platform at Holborn used for the branch is used for TV and film sets that require underground scenes. During WW2 the branch was used to store art treasures from the British Museum, including the Elgin Marbles.\n", "id": "336176", "title": "Kingsway (London)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336306", "text": "Box office\n\nA box office is a place where tickets are sold to the public. These tickets let people into a theater to see an event. In the movie industry, the term is most often used to mean the amount of money a movie makes by the selling of tickets. The term can also mean things which affect the amount a movie earns.\n\n\"Box office\" business can be measured in terms of how many people see a movie. It can also be measured by how much money is earned by selling tickets. The estimate of these amounts and analysis of them is very important to the movie industry. It is often something that is important to fans as well. \n\nSome people think that the movie industry is concerned too much with this. They say profit is more important to movie studios than making movies as a form of art. Understanding how different types of movies earn money affects the how other movies are made and paid for. If a certain type of movie often has a large box office, studios are more likely to make that type of movie. Some types of movies earn more when they are released at certain times of the year. Studios use this information to plan when to release certain movies. For example:\n\nThere are many websites that show box-office number. Two of these are ShowBIZ Data and Box Office Mojo. \n\nUsually, the movie's distributor gets more than half of the money earned. The rest is kept by the movie theater. The percentage is different from movie to movie. The distributor often gets a higher percentage in early weeks. As time passes, the percentage become lower and the theater keeps a larger part of the ticket sales. With some movies, the distributor may take all of the ticket sales for the first week. The theater earns its money by selling food and drinks. After several weeks nearly all of the ticket sales is kept by the theater. Because of this, only the first few weeks are very important to the movie studios. \n\nThe following is movie industry specific terminology. It is defined by Box Office Mojo.\nFor movies released in North America, box office figures are usually divided into two categories. The first is domestic. This is the amount a movie earns in the United States and Canada. The second is foreign which includes all other countries. The Weekly box office is the amount a movie makes from Friday through Thursday. The \"movie week\" starts on Friday because most movies are released on that day. A large part of this is the weekend box office. It is defined as the amount earned on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The first weekend after a movie is released is the opening weekend. The amount made by a movie on its opening weekend is what is often reported. \n\nTheaters is the number of theaters in which the movie is being shown. Because a theater may show a movie on more than one screens, the total number of screens is also used. If a movie is released in over 600 theaters, it is said to be wide release. If the number is less than 600, it is a limited release. A limited release may be as small as one theater or 1-2 theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, California. A movie may start with a limited release and later get a wide release. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" is an example of this.\n", "id": "336306", "title": "Box office"}

It is on a sharp bend in the river, and links Battersea south of the river with Chelsea to the north. \n\nThe first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge. Although a stone bridge was planned, a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicles in 1772. The bridge was poorly designed. Iy was dangerous to its users and to passing shipping. Boats often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed, and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.\n\nAlthough dangerous and unpopular, the bridge was the last surviving wooden bridge across the Thames in London. It was the subject of paintings by Turner, Cotman and Whistler.\n\nIn 1879 the bridge was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 demolished and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, and one of London's least busy Thames bridges. The position on a bend in the river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.\n\nIn June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames. The Battersea Bridge area marked the official start of the parade of ships and boats moving towards Tower Bridge.\n\n\n \n", "id": "336402", "title": "Battersea Bridge"}

In the Orthodox Church, sainthood refers to closeness to God. \n\nIn the Lutheran Church, all Christians, whether in heaven or on earth, are regarded as saints. However, the church still recognizes and honors certain saints, including some saints honored by the Catholic Church.\n\nWhile Methodists as a whole do not practice the patronage or veneration of saints, they do honor and admire them. Methodists believe that all Christians are saints, but mostly use the term to refer to biblical people, Christian leaders, and martyrs of the faith. Many Methodist churches are named after saints, such as the Twelve Apostles, John Wesley, etc.\n\nThe beliefs within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with regard to saints are close to the beliefs of the Protestant faith. In the New Testament the saints are all those who have been baptized. \"Latter-day\" refers to the doctrine that members are living in the \"latter days\", before the Second Coming of Christ. Therefore members are often referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\" or \"LDS\", and among themselves as \"Saints\".\n\nThe Syriac Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Armenian Apostolic Church do accept the existence of saints, but officially recognize them in their own ways. For example, the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria canonizes saints, through the approval of that church's Holy Synod. A requirement of the Coptic Orthodox faith is that at least 50 years must pass from a saint's death to his canonization, and the Coptic Orthodox Pope must follow that rule.\n\nThere are some groups who do not accept the idea of the Communion of Saints. Some believe all of the departed are in soul sleep until the final resurrection on Judgment Day. Others believe that the departed go to either Paradise or Tartarus, to await the day in which the living and the dead are judged. Certain groups do not believe that the departed have any connection with the living.\n\nIn many Protestant churches, the word \"saint\" is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a Christian. This is similar to Paul's numerous references in the New Testament of the Bible. In this way, anyone who is within the Body of Christ (any Christian) is a 'saint' because of their relationship with Christ Jesus. Many Protestants consider prayers to the saints to be idolatry because they believe prayers should be given only to God himself. \n\nOne Roman Catholic website says that \"There are over 10,000 named saints and beatified people from history, the Roman Martyrology and Orthodox sources, but no definitive head count\".\n\nRev. Alban Butler published \"Lives of the Saints\" in 1756, containing 1,486 saints. The latest edition of this work contains the lives of 2,565 saints. Monsignor Robert Sarno, an official of Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, said it is impossible to say the exact number of saints.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that it does not make anyone into a saint. Instead, it recognizes a saint. In the Church, the title of Saint refers to a person who has been canonized (officially recognized) by the Catholic Church, and is therefore believed to be in Heaven.\n\nBecause the Church believes all people in Heaven are saints, there are many people believed to be in Heaven who have not been officially declared as saints. Sometimes the word \"saint\" is used to refer to Christians still living here on earth.\n\nThe veneration of saints, in Latin, \"cultus\", or the \"cult of the saints\", describes devotion to a particular saint or saints. Sometimes this is called \"worship\", but only in the old-sense meaning \"to honor or give respect\". According to the Catholic Church, Divine Worship is properly reserved only for God and never to the saints. Saints can be asked for help, just as one can ask someone on earth to pray for them.\n\nA saint may be a patron saint of a cause or profession, or invoked against specific illnesses or disasters, sometimes by popular custom and sometimes by official statements of the Magisterium. Saints are not thought to have power of their own, but only that granted by God. \n\nA person who is seen as very holy can be declared a saint by a formal process, called canonization. Formal canonization is a lengthy process often taking many years, even centuries. The first step in this process is an investigation of the candidate's life, undertaken by an expert. After this, the report on the candidate is given to the bishop of the area and more studying is done. It is then sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.\n\nIf the application is approved, the person may be granted the title of \"Venerable\". Further investigations may lead to the candidate's beatification and given title of \"Blessed\". At least two important miracles are required to be formally declared a saint. These miracles must have happened after the candidate died. Finally, when all of this is done the Pope canonizes the saint.\n\nOnce a person has been declared a saint, the body of the saint is considered holy. The remains of saints are called holy relics and are usually used in churches. Saints' personal belongings may also be used as relics. Some of the saints have a symbol that represents their life.\n\nThe word \"saint\" is not only used by Christianity. In many religions, there are people who have been recognized as having reached the highest goals of religious teaching. In English, the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions.\n\nCuban Santería, Haitian Vodou, Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé, and other similar syncretist religions adopted the Catholic saints, or at least the images of the saints, and applied their own spirits/deities to them. They are worshiped in churches (where they appear as saints) and in religious festivals, where they appear as the deities. The name \"santería\" was originally a negative term for those whose worship of saints deviated from Catholic norms.\n\nBuddhists hold the Arhats and Arahants in special esteem, as well as Bodhisattvas and Buddhas.\n\nIn Discordianism, anyone, living or dead, or even anything can be named a saint. Anyone may canonize anything or anyone else as everyone, whether they are aware of it or not, is a pope in the POEE. This is because \"moral perfection isn't necessary for Discordian Sainthood. You just have to suffer a lot.\"\n\nThere are people who have been described as being Hindu saints, most of whom have also been more specifically identified by the terms Sant, Mahatma, Paramahamsa, or Swami, or with the titles \"Sri\" or \"Srila\".\n\nThe Arabic word \"wali\" (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is usually translated into English as \"Saint\". However, the \"wali\" should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. An important early scholar of Sunni Islamic beliefs, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi, mentioned in his book \"Al-Aqidah At-Tahawiya\":\n\n\"We do not prefer any of the saintly men among the Ummah over any of the Prophets but rather we say that any one of the Prophets is better than all the awliya' put together. We believe in what we know of Karamat, the marvels of the awliya' and in authentic stories about them from trustworthy sources.\n\nUnlike Prophets and Messengers, the \"awliya\" can be either male and female. One of the best known female saints is Rabi`a al-Adawiyya.\n\nIt is widely regarded in Islam that the saints of saints is Ali Ibn Abi Talib the cousin of Muhammad all Sufi orders originate through his teachings. In addition all saints regard him as their champion 'The Saints of Saints'\n\nIn Sufism, the major \"wali\" are considered to have been masters in the art of spiritual purification. Some groups within Islam hold the Hadrat (literally, Presence, a title of Sufi saints) in esteem.\n\nThe word \"Tzadik\" \"righteous\", and its associated meanings, developed in Rabbinic thought from its Talmudic contrast with \"Hasid\" (\"Pious\" honorific), to its exploration in Ethical literature, and its spiritualisation in Kabbalah. In Hasidic Judaism, the institution of the Tzadik assumed central importance.\n\nThe concept of sant or bhagat is found in North Indian religious thought including Sikhism. Figures such as Kabir, Ravidas, Nanak, and others are widely regarded as belonging to the Sant tradition. Some of their mystical compositions are incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. The term \"Sant\" is still sometimes loosely applied to living individuals in the Sikh and related communities.\n\n\n\n", "id": "336412", "title": "Saint"}

One of the most well-known bits of popular wisdom in the English-speaking world is that apples and oranges cannot be compared. The ability to tell apples from oranges is learned. \n\nThe phrase is almost always used along with a warning that things in different categories cannot be compared, or that the comparison is improper.\n\nThis idiom began as a comparison of \"apples and oysters\" in a book of proverbs published in 1670. This idiom has become a marker in English-speaking culture. Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.\n\nThe idiom is not uniquely English.\n\nIn French-speaking Quebec, the idiom is \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), In Europe, the French idiom is \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears).\n\nIn Latin America, the Spanish idiom is \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples). \n\nIn British English, the phrase \"chalk and cheese\" means the same thing as \"apples and oranges\".\n\nIn order to compare anything, there needs to be a theory to be proven and framework for testing the theory. Three basic questions come first: \n\nThe idiom has inspired scientific research projects. For example, the \"British Medical Journal\" published a study of red delicious apples compared with navel oranges.

'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Born in Winterville, Mississippi, Lance moved to Chicago as a kid and became friends with Otis Leavill Cobb. Both of them took boxing and also worked at a drug store.\n\nAlthough he was arrested a couple of times in his life and his earliest records were not successful, Lance was most known for his music hits in the United States called \"Monkey Time\" and \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\". He was considered the most successful Okeh artist. After these hits, he became an iconic figure in Britain, where he lived throughout in the 1970s, among followers of Northern soul. \n\nLance continued to tour and perform at clubs and music festivals, such as in the United Kingdom and England, until he died in 1994 from a certain heart attack at the age of 55. Lance is buried in Homewood, Illinois.\n\nMajor Lance was born in Winterville, Mississippi. There has been something confusing over Lance's birth year; some sources say he was born 1941 or 1942 (as Lance claimed), while his gravestone states he was born in 1939. 'Major' was his given name; it was not a nickname or stage name. Major Lance was one of 12 children. One of his hobbies was playing Baseball. \n\nLance moved with his family on the northwest side of Chicago in the Cabrini-Green projects, where there was a lot of crime in the area, as a child. After moving to Chicago, he developed a boyhood friendship with another singer named Otis Leavill Cobb. They both attended Wells High School. This was the same school Curtis Mayfield and Jerry Butler, who were also both singers too, went to. Mayfield called him a \"sparkly fellow, and a great basketball player, which is probably how we met. His hero was Jackie Wilson, and he was always coming round and looking through my bag for songs that I'd written but didn't want to do with the Impressions. He was pretty good at picking them, too.\" Lance and Otis both toke boxing and were also singing as members of the Five Gospel Harmonaires. Both of them also worked together at a drug store.\n\nLance and Otis Leavill formed a group named the Floats in the mid-1950s. However, they broke up before recording any songs. But Lance became a featured dancer on a local TV show named \"Time for Teens\", and presenter Jim Lounsbury gacve him a one-off record deal with Mercury Records. Mercury released his single \"I Got a Girl\", written and produced by Curtis Mayfield, in 1959, which was not successful. Because of this, Lance worked at various jobs over the next few years.\n\nLance signed with OKeh Records in 1962 as Curtis Mayfield recommended. Major was constantly showing up at the Okeh offices, offering to run errands for Carl Davis, telling him about the record he'd once made and how he and Curtis Mayfield were friends from their childhood. Major Lance's first single was called \"Delilah\", which was made by Curtis Mayfield. Although it was not successful, it made his partnership with a writing and arranging team for Curtis Mayfield, Carl Davis, and Johnny Pate, often with members of Mayfield's music group called The Impressions on backing vocals. Together they made a distinctive, Latin-tinged sound which epitomised Chicago soul unlike other music. \n\nMajor Lance's second Okeh single was called \"The Monkey Time\". This song was also written by Mayfield. Unlike his first Okeh single, Monkey Time was a success, becoming #2 on the \"Billboard\" R&B chart. It was also the #8 pop hit in 1963. \"The Monkey Time\" became Okeh's first hit single for 10 years.\nHis hits quickly became more successful, including \"Hey Little Girl\", \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\" (his biggest hit, reaching #5 in the US pop chart and #40 in the UK, where it was his only chart success. It was also one of the top 100 on the Billboard chart in 1964), \"The Matador\" (the only one not written by Mayfield), \"Rhythm\", \"Sometimes I Wonder\", \"Come See\", and \"Ain't It A Shame\".\n\nLance and Davis continued to work together, during the time Pate and Mayfield left Okeh Records. \"Too Hot To Hold\" was a minor hit, but they had poor success before Davis left the company in turn. During this period, Lance toured in the United Kingdom. This is where he was supported by Bluesology, a band including pianist Reggie Dwight (Reggie was later known as Elton John.). Over the next two years he began working with several music producers. Soon after Lance left OKeh Records in 1968 and moved to Dakar Records, where he had the Top 40 R&B hit \"Follow the Leader.\" He then moved to Mayfield's label named Curtom Records, which resulted in his last two Top 40 R&B hits, \"Stay Away From Me (I Love You too Much)\" and \"Must Be Love Coming Down.\" One of Lance's song recorded at Curtom called \"Stay Away From Me\" was listed #4 in Jet Magazine's \"Soul Brothers Top 20\". He left Curtom in 1971, and recorded Volt and Columbia Records labels for a short amount of time.\n\nLance moved to England in 1972. He was to become \"legendary as a UK club act, known to deliver 110% at every performance.\" During his time in England, he recorded an album, \"Major Lance's Greatest Hits Recorded Live At The Torch\", recorded at The Torch, a club in Stoke on Trent, which has been described as \"perhaps the best Northern Soul album ever made\". Lance returned to Atlanta in 1974. He recorded an updated disco version of \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\" for Playboy Records. He set up a new label, Osiris, with Al Jackson, a former drummer for Booker T and the MG, but again with little success, and his songs became less popular. But later found that his recordings had become popular on the beach music circuit in the Carolinas, where he continued to perform at live performances. He recorded a comeback album, \"The Major's Back\", and several tracks for the Kat Family label.\n\nMajor Lance was married to Christine Boular Lance, and had nine children. He was 6'6 foot tall.\n\nLance was arrested two times in his life. In 1965, Lance was arrested in violation of the Paternity Act. A Chicago Women, Para Lee Thomas, told she had a son named \"Ronnie Maurice Lance\" (born ). She declared Lance who promised to pay her doctor and hospital bills around 375$, but defaulted in the payment. Judge Benjamin J. Kanter issued for the arrest, setting Lance's bond at $1,000. After recording briefly for the Motown Records subsidiary label Soul in 1978, he was convicted of cocaine possession and was sentenced to four years in Jail.\n\nIn 1987, Lance was diagnosed with a heart attack, and he became nearly blind from glaucoma. As a result, he made no more recordings since. In June 1994, he gave his final performance at the 11th Chicago Blues Festival. In September of that year, he died in his sleep at the age of 55 of heart disease in Decatur, Georgia. He was survived by his family. He is buried at Washington Memory Gardens Cemetery in Homewood, Illinois.\n\n", "id": "336578", "title": "Major Lance"}

The character is played by actress Lea Michele. The character first appeared in \"Glee\" from its pilot episode. It was first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Rachel was created by \"Glee\" creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. She is the glee club captain of the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio, where the show is set. Her storylines have seen her suffer feeling alone because of her ambition to win. She has also developed romantic feelings for Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), a member of the rival (enemy) glee club Vocal Adrenaline. She also had many dates with quarterback and glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith). The two eventually become engaged.\n\nMichele has stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She had inspiration to play the role as Rachel. These include the movie \"Election\" and other television roles such as the \"Gossip Girl\" character Blair Waldorf. Michele has said that she feels \"vulnerable\" while playing Rachel. She stated, \"Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out.\" Michele added, \"What's so great about \"Glee\" is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be.\"\n\nRachel is a \"strong, driven girl\" but somewhat nervous about herself. \"Glee\" follows Rachel's journey to become more of a team player. She does this to fulfill her own dreams. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\" in 2010. She was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\" in 2010 and 2011. Rachel has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Maureen Ryan of \"The Chicago Tribune\" thanked Michele for making the character \"more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype\". However, \"The Wall Street Journal\"s Raymund Flandez has described Rachel as \"insufferable\" (annoying). Several songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They have also been included on the series' soundtrack albums.\n\nRachel is the daughter of an interracial same-sex couple. She is Jewish and was named after Rachel Green from \"Friends\". She joins the glee club. She hopes that fame will increase her popularity and to find a boyfriend. She is bullied by members of the school cheerleading and football teams. She is, however, excited that quarterback Finn Hudson joins the club. She then develops a crush on him. The two kisses in the episode \"Showmance\". However, Finn tells her to forget that it happened and continues dating his girlfriend, cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). Rachel quits the glee club. She does this because she is not given a solo she wanted. She is then given the lead role in the school musical, \"Cabaret\". However, she later quits the musical and rejoins the glee club. She returns because she rather have friends then be alone. She has a short relationship with another glee club member, Puck (Mark Salling). He is also Jewish, and is a football player who used to bully her. Rachel later breaks up with him because she still has feelings for Finn. She later learns that Quinn's pregnancy was not caused by him but by Puck. She then tells Finn the truth who then attacks Puck. Finn then breaks up with Quinn and drops out of glee club. He returns on the day of the group's first major competition, the Sectionals. He does this to undo damage by cheerleading couch Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). The group makes up a completely new set list. Rachel starts the show with a solo of \"Don't Rain on My Parade\". They win by an agreement decision.\n\nFor a short time Rachel believes that she is dating Finn. However, he tells her that he needs to take time out for himself. He changes his mind soon after. By that time, Rachel has already begun dating Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff). He is the lead singer of the enemy glee club Vocal Adrenaline. The rest of the glee club tries to convince Rachel to break up with Jesse. However, he transfers (moved) to William McKinley. He then joins New Directions. Rachel tells Jesse that her dream is to find her birth mother. He offers to help her do so. However, he already knows who it is: Vocal Adrenaline coach Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel). Shelby asked Jesse to befriend Rachel. She hopes that it might reconnect with her daughter. Shelby cannot directly contact Rachel until she is eighteen. When Rachel discovers that Shelby is her mother they begin to talk. They both confess to not feel an anything. They eventually decide to not develop a relationship. Jesse betrays Rachel and returns to Vocal Adrenaline. In the episode \"Journey to Regionals\", Finn tells Rachel that he loves her. Although they lose the competition to Vocal Adrenaline, they become a couple.\n\nSue Sylvester tells glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) about a rule. The rule is that there has to be a minimum of twelve students when competing. Will tells the glee club that they have to find new members. At first Rachel encourages Sunshine Corazon (Charice) to try out. However, when she realizes that she is a good singer, she gives her wrong directions to the auditions. She gives Sunshine directions to an inactive (no longer in service) crack house. Sunshine then transfers (moves to) Carmel High School and joins Vocal Adrenaline. Puck and Finn's friendship becomes stronger again. They work together and sing horribly at the duets competition. They do this so new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) wins instead. They want him to feel welcomed and appreciated by the club. Rachel later finds out that Finn slept with cheerleader Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) the previous year. At the time, Rachel was dating Jesse. Finn lied to Rachel, though Rachel herself had lied. She said she slept with Jesse which she had not. Feeling hurt, she makes out with Puck to hurt Finn back. This causes Finn to break up with her. Rachel later tries get back with Finn. However, he begins to dating Quinn again. Feeling hurt, Rachel writes an original song for Regionals, \"Get It Right\". They win Regionals and Rachel is named MVP.\n\nJust before junior prom, Jesse returns. Rachel invites him to the prom with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Finn and Jesse begins arguing at prom. They then begin to fight and are asked to leave prom. This hurts Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn breaks up with Quinn after he realizes he really loves Rachel. At Nationals in New York City, Finn begs Rachel to be his girlfriend again. She says no. She does this because she wants to stay focus on becoming a Broadway star. At the end of their duet—\"Pretending\", Rachel and Finn kiss. The audience become silent. The glee club comes in twelfth and did not make the top 10. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation. They then kiss and restart their relationship.\n\nRachel and Kurt plan to go to a performing arts school in New York City after graduation. School counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) suggests they think about going to The York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA). The two go to an Ohio \"mixer\". They attend in hopes to get potential applicants. Rachel proposes McKinley do \"West Side Story\" as the school musical. She believes she can get the lead role Maria. She also needs the experience for her NYADA application. However, Mercedes also auditions for Maria. The directors were not able to choose between the two. After their callbacks, the casting directors decides to \"double-cast\" the role. Mercedes begins believing that she did better in the callbacks. She refuses to accept the double-casting. She then quit the show and gives Rachel the part. She and Finn decide to have sex in the episode \"The First Time\". In the episode \"Mash Off\", Rachel decides to run for class president. She takes herself off when she realizes Kurt will not go to NYADA if he does not win. In the episode \"I Kissed a Girl\", she starts an election ballot box. She does this because to keep Kurt from losing. He loses anyway and she tells Kurt what she had done. Rachel is then suspended from school for a week. She is also not allowed to compete in Sectionals with New Directions. While at Sectionals, glee club wins without her. At the end of the episode \"Yes/No\", Finn asks her to marry him. After taking time to think about it, she accepts.<ref name=\"Yes/No\"></ref> Their parents find out in \"Heart\". They try everything they could to break them up. However, their plans only made it worse. Finn and Rachel announced their plan to get married in May. When the date seems to be too far away, they decide to get marry sooner. They decide to get marry after Regionals in \"On My Way\". New Directions wins at Regionals. Hours later, the ceremony begins at City Hall. Their parents arrive to New York. They try to end the wedding. Rachel is waiting for Quinn to arrive. She had to go home to get her bridesmaid dress. While Quinn is driving back to New York City, her car is hit by a truck.\n\nRachel is portrayed by Lea Michele. Younger Rachel has been played by Lauren Boles. When Ryan Murphy was casting for \"Glee\", he wanted actors who could take on theatrical roles. Murphy did not want to do network casting calls. He instead, spent three months on Broadway. He found Michele, who was starring in \"Spring Awakening\". The role of Rachel was written just for Michele. In an interview with \"The Washington Post\", Michele commented on her casting, saying: \"I was kind of just thrown into this—this is one of the first television jobs I've ever had. Of course being able to sing helps bring a sense of comfort. The character I'm playing is really outgoing—she performs in her everyday life as though she's performing in front of a huge audience.\"\n\nIn December 2010, Murphy announced that the cast of \"Glee\" would be replaced. He stated that the replacements would happen at the end of the third season. Which would be around the time when they graduate. Murphy said: \"Every year we're going to add a new group [of people]. There's nothing more sad than a high schooler with a bald spot.\" He also revealed that some of the original cast will leave as early as 2012: \"I think you have to be true to the fact that here is a group of people who come and go in these teachers' lives.\" Murphy said in July 2011 that Michele would be one of the actors leaving. Michele commented on this, saying: \"We always knew we'd graduate in real time. It's all part of the plan and it's all good! It's going to make Season 3 amazing! This is just the beginning!\" However, Falchuk later stated that Michele, along with Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith will graduate at the end of the third season. He also said: \"because they're (they are) graduating doesn't mean they're (they are) leaving the show.\" Falchuk also said: \"it was never our plan or our intention to let them go…. They are not done with the show after this season.\"\n\nSandra Gonzalez of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented on the news about the cast leaving. She said: \"Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on \"Friday Night Lights\", which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, but it was a well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood (group) didn't (did not) try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. \"Glee\" could learn a lot from what \"Friday Night Lights\" accomplished (have done successfully): a seamless, realistic (real) transition (change). The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been \"Glee\"s strong points, which is not to say they couldn't (could not) be. But the question is: Is \"Glee\" looking to be the less-attractive comedy cousin of \"Friday Night Lights\"… or \"Saved By the Bell: The New Class\"?\"\n\nMichele took the role as Rachel because of her characterization. Michele explained: \"Not only is she a singer, but she has so much heart—I think it's what we need on TV. A show that is filled with heart and love that is funny. It sends an amazing message to kids about the arts and being who you are.\" Michele described the first thirteen episodes of \"Glee\". She described it as: \"Rachel's journey of finding herself within the glee club\". She also said that \"she's learning how to be a team player and work within this group. She's a very strong, driven girl, who's (who is) sometimes a little misunderstood.\"\n\n\"Glee\"s costume designer Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costumes. Eyrich told \"Entertainment Weekly\": \"Originally (at first), the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from \"Election\"—very buttoned-down (someone who is serious in the job they are doing), preppy (someone who looks like a high school student), obnoxious (not very well liked by people), squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen (television) and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls find a way to make it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong.\"\n\nMichele have stated that she was just like Rachel when she was younger. She also gets inspiration from the movie \"Election\", and \"Gossip Girl\" character Blair Waldorf. She has explained: \"[Blair] is shady (a mean person), but you still love her. She's still vulnerable (easy to get hurt). That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't (are not) considered beautiful, and when I was in high school it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't (does not) matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't (will not) matter anyway.\"\n\nSome songs performed by Michele as Rachel have been released as digital download singles. They were also on the soundtrack albums, \"Glee: The Music, Volume 1\" and \"Glee: The Music, Volume 2\". Rachel has received positive reviews from critics. Michele was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\" in 2010. She also was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\" in 2010. Robert A. George of the \"New York Post\" stated \"the only female [in Glee] who doesn't (does not) come across as manipulative (easy to tell someone what to do) or vapidly (nothing good about her) helpless\" (not able to help her own self). \"Chicago Tribune\"s Maureen Ryan wrote, \"Lea Michele not only has an amazing voice but manages to make her character, spoiled (get's whatever she wants in life) diva Rachel Berry, more than a humorless (not funny) stereotype.\" Denise Martin of \"The Los Angeles Times\" commented in her review of the episode \"The Rhodes Not Taken\": \"if there's any justice in the world, Lea Michele will win a Golden Globe and an Emmy for playing Rachel\".\n\nIn the episode \"Hairography\", Kurt Hummel gives Rachel a bad make over. Mike Hale of the \"New York Times\" remembered a popular theme that critics give negative reviews because of the way \"Glee\" treats its female characters. Hale said that he understands why, but also says that the show equally treats male characters the same. However, he wrote that \"it was a bit much when Finn looked at Rachel in her catsuit and frizzy hair and said she looked like a 'sad clown hooker.' Come on. She looked fantastic (really good).\" Zap2it's Korbi Ghosh commented: \"when we saw Rachel fall for them (Finn and Puck), she was actually relatable. Likable even. The type-A (best), uber-talented, self-involved (gets into things by herself) know-it-all (a person who believes they know everything) who's usually alienating her classmates let her guard down to expose (to show) a vulnerable side. And, as a bonus, we got some super solid musical performances from those awkward courtships.\"\n\nMichele has won a number of awards for her portrayal of Rachel. Michele won the Satellite Awards for \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical or Comedy Television Series\" in 2009. She also won, as part of the cast, for \"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\" at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2010, Michele won the NewNowNext Awards for \"Brink of Fame: Actor\". In 2009, she was nominated for a Teen Choice Awards in the category \"Choice TV Breakout Star\". That same year, Michele was nominated for a Golden Globe for \"Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy\". She also was nominated for an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series\". She received another Teen Choice Award nomination in 2010 for \"Choice TV Actress: Comedy\". Michele was included in \"Time\" magazine's 2010 list of the \"100 Most Influential People In the World\". Her cover of The All-American Rejects' \"Gives You Hell\" reached the top 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Michele is featured as lead singer in 14 of the top 20 selling Glee Cast songs as of 2010. She won the 2012 People's Choice Award for \"Favorite TV Comedy Actress\".\n\nMichele was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2011. The first for \"Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals\" (\"Don't Stop Believin\"). The second for \"Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media\" (\"Glee: The Music, Volume 1\"). Michele said of the first Grammy nomination: \"I like that it's for 'Don't Stop Believin\", which is for the whole cast, so that we all get to go. That's just awesome.\" She was nominated again for \"Best Actress- Television Series Musical or Comedy\" at the 2011 Golden Globe Awards. The cast of Glee was also nominated for the \"Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\" award at the 2011 and 2012 Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\n", "id": "336714", "title": "Rachel Berry"}

He was a minor god of fertility and symbolized the unity of male and female. His name is the origin of the word hermaphrodite.\n\nAccording to a myth of Ovid, he was raised by nymphs in a cave on Mount Ida. At the age of fifteen, he traveled to the cities of Lydia and Caria in Asia Minor. It was there that he came upon a pool of fresh water. He undressed and bathed in the pool. Meanwhile, the nymph of the pool Salmacis, fell in love with him. She jumped into the pool and embraced him, not letting go, he struggled to get away from her. Salmacis prayed to the gods that they should never separate and the gods hearing her prayer, merged their bodies together, transforming Hermaphroditus into an androgynous being. Hermaphroditus, in anger of his transformation, cursed the pool so that anyone who bathed in it would suffer the same fate.\n\nThe worship of Hermaphroditus originated from Cyprus, under the name of Aphroditus. The cult was introduced into mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. At rituals and sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed; men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The god was also identified with the moon, because the moon was thought to be both male and female.\n\nHermaphroditus was a popular subject in ancient Greek and Roman art. He is often shown alone and sometimes interacting with satyrs and cupids. There is a famous statue called \"The Sleeping Hermaphroditus\" at the Louvre Museum in Paris. \n", "id": "336758", "title": "Hermaphroditus"}

A Macintosh port was published in July 2002 by MacSoft in North America, and by Feral Interactive in the rest of the world. There were plans for a Dreamcast version of \"Max Payne\", but they were cancelled because of the console had stopped being made. The game was again released in April 2009 as a downloadable game for the Xbox Originals program for the Xbox 360.\n\nThe game features a neo-noir type style and uses comic strips (with voice-overs) in place of animated cutscenes to narrate the game. This is because it is inspired by hard-boiled detective novels by authors like Mickey Spillane. The game contains many references to Norse mythology, particularly the myth of Ragnarök. Several of the names used in the game are those of Norse gods. The gameplay is very much influenced by the Hong Kong action cinema genre, particularly the work of director John Woo, and it was the first game to feature the bullet time effect made famous in \"The Matrix\".\n\n\"Max Payne\" got very good reviews from critics and was praised for its exciting gun play and use of noir storytelling devices.

They began in the later Cambrian. \"Nautilus\" is the only surviving genus. \n\nNautiloids flourished during the early Palaeozoic era, when they were the main predatory animals. They developed an extraordinary range of shell shapes and forms. Some 2,500 species of fossil nautiloids are known, though only a few species survive today.\n\nNautiloids are among the group of animals known as cephalopods. The cephalopods are an advanced class of molluscs. The cephalopods also include ammonoids, Belemnites and modern coleoids such as octopus and squid. \n\nTraditionally, the most common classification of the cephalopods has been a three-fold division into the nautiloids, ammonoids, and coleoids. This article is about nautiloids in that broad sense, sometimes called Nautiloidea \"sensu lato\".\n\nCladistically speaking, nautiloids are a paraphyletic group united by shared primitive (basal) features not found in derived cephalopods. In other words, they are a evolutionary grade that is thought to have given rise to both ammonoids and coleoids. They are defined by the exclusion of both those descendent groups. Both ammonoids and coleoids probably descended from bactritids, which in turn arose from straight-shelled orthocerid nautiloids. \n\nThe ammonoids (a group which includes the ammonites and the goniatites) are extinct cousins of the nautiloids which evolved early in the Devonian, some 400 million years ago.\n", "id": "336769", "title": "Nautiloid"}

The divinity was introduced into Greece and celebrated in Athens in a cross-dressing ritual.\n\nIt is thought that Hesiod's myth, explaining the birth of Aphrodite, born when Cronus cut off the genitals of Uranus and threw it into the sea, originated from the cult of Aphroditus. A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC found at Perachora in Greece, representing Aphroditus emerging from severed male genitals, suggests this, as there are two different myths of the creation of Aphrodite.\n\nAccording to Macrobius, Aphroditus was represented in Cyprus with a beard and phallus, wearing female clothing and holding a scepter. At sacrifices to the god, worshipers cross-dressed, men wearing women's clothing and women dressed in men's clothing. The cult spread from Cyprus into southern Asia Minor, eventually reaching mainland Greece around the late 5th century BC. In Athens, the iconography of the god took on the \"anasyromenos\" pose, a female figure lifting her dress to reveal an erect phallus, a gesture that had apotropaic qualities, much like the god Priapus. By the Hellenistic period, the cult and votives had spread throughout Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy.\n\nGradually over time the cult lost popularity, Aphroditus was also being called Hermaphroditus, which originally meant Aphroditus in the form of a herm or \"a herm of Aphroditus\". These were marble or bronze sculptures with a head or torso above a plain rectangular pillar, a symbol of fertility.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336823", "text": "Telomerase\n\nTelomerase is an RNA protein which is an enzyme. It adds DNA sequence repeats (\"TTAGGG\" in all vertebrates) to the end of DNA strands in the telomere regions. \n\nThe telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. They are a region of repeated nucleotides containing noncoding DNA. Telomeres are destroyed during cell division, and are remade by the enzyme telomerase.\n\nThe function of telomeres is to avoid the loss of important DNA from chromosome ends. Every time the chromosome is copied 100–200 meaningless nucleotides are lost, which causes no damage to the organism's DNA. So, the telomeres are shortened after each replication cycle, and then are restored to their proper length by telomerase. Telomerases carry their own RNA molecule, which is used as a template to elongate the telomeres.\n\nThe existence of a compensatory mechanism (a 'fix') for telomere shortening was first predicted by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973. He also suggested the telomere hypothesis of ageing and the telomere's connections to cancer. \n\nTelomerase was discovered by Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984 in the ciliate \"Tetrahymena\". Together with Jack Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery.\n", "id": "336823", "title": "Telomerase"}

Nurse, Hartwell and Hunt together discovered two proteins, cyclin and CDK (cyclin dependent kinase), which control the change from one stage to another. These proteins are called \"checkpoints\", because they check whether the cell has divided properly. If the cell does not divide correctly, other proteins will try to repair it. If that does not work, they will destroy the cell. If a cell divides incorrectly and survives, it may cause cancer and other serious diseases.\n\nWorking in baker's yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"), Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle – the progression through G1.\n", "id": "336943", "title": "Lee Hartwell"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336979", "text": "Formula One car\n\nA Formula One car is a racing car used in Formula One races. They have one seat, which is open to the air. They have aerodynamic wings on their front and rear, and the engine is positioned behind the driver. The regulations governing the cars are unique to the Formula One championship. The regulations say that cars must be built by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be done by others.\n\nF1 Cars have technology to make them faster, more drag resistant and safer. Some of this technology is described below.\n\nERS stand for Energy Recovery Systems. There are two basic types of ERS systems - mechanical and electrical and both recover energy without using fuel and damaging the environment. The rule to use KERS was introduced by the FIA in 2009. It works by storing energy in a flywheel or battery (like the one on the right) that would be lost when braking, and allow that energy to be re-used when accelerating. ERS was introduced in 2014 to activate wherever a driver chose permanently throughout a race weekend\n\nThis is used a lot in corners because it controls the wheel spin when under and over steering. They mean simply to which end of the car runs out of grip first as the tyres only have limited amount of grip. In an under steer, the front axle and wheels runs out of grip first and in Over steer the rear end runs out first. When this happens it is like a handbrake skid. Traction Control is the device that tries to keep the car stable by adjusting the wheel movement in these turns.\n\nDRS stand for Drag Reduction System. It is an addition to the rear wing of the car introduced in 2011 Formula 1 season aimed at reducing aerodynamic drag in order to promote overtaking. It is used when a driver is close to somebody in front of him. He will be able to open the rear wing so the car becomes more streamline and aerodynamic so he can overtake his opponent. The device is then disabled as soon as he overtakes his opponent.\n\nFormula One teams do much research into materials. Below are list of materials used in the F1 world, what they are, what they do, where they're placed and why F1 teams choose them over everything else.\n\nCarbon fibre is a very strong and light material that contains carbon fibres. It may sometimes contain other fibres such as Kevlar, aluminium and glass. Although it has a very big price tag, its strength to weight ratio and the good rigidity of it make it a very valuable piece of material. However as is it gets cheaper it is being used in much smaller products like sports equipment, bodies for instruments and also household objects.\n\nCarbon fibre is most commonly used in the bodywork of an F1 car and also the air box, the wings, the engine cover, steering wheel and in the suspension. It is sometimes reinforced with titanium or steel.\n\nIt is used over every other kind of material because it’s lightweight, very strong, very stiff and can easily be moulded into any shape. \n\nKevlar is another fibre like carbon. Some of its properties are very similar. Kevlar is a very strong and lightweight material. If you have an equal amount of steel and Kevlar, Kevlar would be 5 times stronger than the steel. When it is woven, it is suitable to take underwater. Kevlar is also used by the army as it a very sturdy material and it is used to make a range of items like helmets.\n\nKevlar is used in pretty much the same areas as carbon fibre is used. For example it is used in the bodywork, the wings, the suspension and more.\n\nKevlar is an extremely firm material. As F1 cars go at high speed it adds extra protection to drivers and stops massive damage being done to the cars.\n\nAluminium is an element. It is very light and hard. It is often used for ships so that ship doesn’t get corroded and it is very stable due to its oxide coating. Aluminium is used in the bodywork and almost every single part of a F1 car. Aluminium is used because it is extremely light and very strong.\n\nMagnesium is another chemical element and is very light and strong. Its main use is to combine with aluminium to make alloys which are extremely light and strong, such as magnalium. It is used mainly in the wheels and some small parts in the engines.\n\nGold foil is a type of foil which is gold coloured and stops heat from escaping. It is used between the engine and fuel tank. It is used in that certain position so it can stop heat transfer from the engine to the fuel tank.\n", "id": "336979", "title": "Formula One car"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336994", "text": "Structural isomer\n\nStructural isomerism (IUPAC call this constitutional isomerism) is a kind of isomerism. Two chemical in this isomerism have the same molecular formula, but the molecules have bonded together in different orders. The opposite of structual isomerism is stereoisomerism. There are many words that represents structual isomers.\n\nThere are three kinds of constitutional isomers. They are skeletal isomers, positional isomers, and functional isomers. Positional isomers are also called regioisomers. Tautomers are also a kind of functional isomers.\n\nIn skeletal isomerism, or chain isomerism, components of the skeleton (usually carbon) are re-ordered to make different structures. Pentane has three isomers. They are \"n\"-pentane (often called simply \"pentane\"), isopentane (methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane).\n\nIn position isomerism, a functional group or other substituent changes its position on a parent structure. In the table below, the hydroxyl group can stay in three different positions on an n-pentane chain to make three different compounds.\n\nMany aromatic isomers exist because substituents can be positioned on different parts of the benzene ring. Only one isomer of phenol or hydroxybenzene exists but cresol or methylphenol has three isomers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the ring. Xylenol has one hydroxyl group and two methyl groups and a total of 6 isomers exist.\n\nFunctional isomers are one of the structural isomers. Two compounds in functional isomerism have the same molecular formula (the number of each atom is the same, like cyclohexane: and 1-hexene:). But, the atoms are connected in other ways so that the groupings are different. We call these groups of atoms functional groups, functionalities, or moieties. Another way to say this is that two compounds that have the same molecular formula, but have different functional groups, are functional isomers.\n\nFor example, the chemical formula of cyclohexane and 1-hexene are CH. We call them functional group isomers because cyclohexane is a cycloalkane and hex-1-ene is an alkene.\n\nFor two molecules to be functional isomers, they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways. Some of the best examples come from organic chemistry. CHO is a molecular formula. Depending on how the atoms are arranged, it can represent two different compounds dimethyl ether CH-O-CH or ethanol CHCH-O-H. Dimethyl ether and ethanol are functional isomers. The first is an ether. The carbon chain-oxygen-carbon chain functionality is called an ether. The second is an alcohol. The carbon chain-oxygen-hydrogen functionality is called an alcohol.\n\nIf the functionalities stay the same, but their locations change, the structural isomers are not functional isomers. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, but they are not functional isomers. Both of them are alcohols. The functional group (carbon chain-O-H) is present in both of these compounds, but they are not the same.\n\nWhile some chemists use the terms structural isomer and functional isomer interchangeably, not all structural isomers are functional isomers.\n\nFunctional isomers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy. Infrared radiation corresponds to the energies associated primarily with molecular vibration. The alcohol functionality has a very distinct vibration called OH-stretch that is due to hydrogen bonding. All alcohols in liquid and solid form absorb infrared radiation at certain wavelengths.\n\nCompounds with the same functional groups will all absorb certain wavelengths of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups. In fact, the infrared spectrum is divided into two regions. The first part is called the functional group region. Dimethyl ether and ethanol would have dissimilar infrared spectra in the functional group region.\n\nThe second part of the infrared spectrum is called the fingerprint region; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies. The fingerprint region is more specific to an individual compound. Even though 1-propanol and 2-propanol have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region, they differ in the fingerprint region.\n\nIn simple terms, functional isomers are structural isomers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether.\n\nAs an example of isomer counting, 7 structural isomers exist with molecular formula CHO, each with different bond connectivities and air-stable at ambient temperature. An additional two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomers, but these are not stable.\n", "id": "336994", "title": "Structural isomer"}

He helped establish the discipline\nof mathematical statistics.\n\"Carl Pearson\" became \"Karl Pearson\" by accident when he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg in 1879. They changed the spelling. He used both versions of his name until 1884 when he finally adopted Karl. Eventually he became known as \"KP\".\n\nIn 1911 he founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London. He was a proponent of eugenics, and a protégé and biographer of Sir Francis Galton.\n\nA conference was held in London on 23 March 2007, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth.\n\nPearson met Charles Darwin's cousin Francis Galton, who was interested in heredity and eugenics. Pearson became Galton's protégé, at times close to hero worship.\n\nAfter Galton's death in 1911, Pearson started on a massive three-volume biography of Galton. The biography was done \"to satisfy myself and without regard to... the needs of publishers or to the tastes of the reading public\". It celebrated Galton's life, work, and talent. He predicted (wrongly) that Galton, rather than Charles Darwin, would be remembered as the most prodigious grandson of Erasmus Darwin.\n\nWhen Galton died, he left much of his estate to University College London for a Chair in Eugenics. Pearson was the first holder of this chair, in accordance with Galton's wishes. He formed the Department of Applied Statistics, which included the Biometric and Galton laboratories. He stayed with the department until his retirement in 1933, and continued to work until his death in 1936.\n\nPearson's ideas helped build the statistical methods in common use today.\n\n\n", "id": "337101", "title": "Karl Pearson"}

It was about 10 meters long and 3 meters tall, and is the largest known dinosaur with direct evidence of feathers. It is forty times heavier than the previous record holder, \"Beipiaosaurus\". The feathers were long, up to , and filamentous. \n\nThe fossil was found in what is now northeastern China. Three fossils of \"Y. huali\", were all found in the rock beds of Liaoning Province. Because of its size, it is certain that \"Yutyrannus\" could not fly. The feathers supported other functions, such as temperature regulation and visual signalling. \n\n\"Yutyrannus\" is known from three nearly complete fossil specimens (an adult, a subadult and a juvenile). They were got from a fossil dealer who claimed all three were found in a single quarry at Batuyingzi in Liaoning Province.
