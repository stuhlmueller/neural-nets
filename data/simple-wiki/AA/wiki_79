For a decade the CIA had been sending in South Vietnamese teams on sabotage missions to the North. American ships such as the \"Maddox\" went on espionage missions in the North's coastal waters. U.S. President Johnson claimed that the North Vietnamese had made two attacks on the \"Maddox\" and the \"Turner Joy\" in the Gulf of Tonkin. On the 4th of August he asked for congressional support to return the attacks.\n\nThe government had written up a resolution in June 1964. Believing that the lives of American sailors were in danger from the North Vietnamese, Congress willingly passed the resolution. The resolution gave the president the power to start war in Vietnam. As Johnson said, it was \"like grandma's night shirt - it covered everything\". The resolution would end when the president believed that the situation in Southeast Asia was safe or when Congress decided to terminate it. Senator Mansfield was unconvinced that the U.S. was acting correctly.\n\nWith the resolution, Johnson appeared to have the nation behind him. Now the war could really be taken to the North. This escalation for the U.S. in the Vietnam War made Johnson look tough. His public approval rating rose from 42 to 72 percent, helping him to win the presidential election. The resolution and the presidential election suggested a nation united behind its president in his Vietnam policy.\n\n", "id": "344136", "title": "Gulf of Tonkin resolution"}

The line goes southeast to northwest beneath the northern Pacific Ocean; and many of the underwater mountains are guyots.\n\nThe seamount chain, with over 80 identified undersea volcanoes, stretches over from the Aleutian Trench in the far northwest Pacific to the Loʻihi seamount, the youngest volcano in the chain, which lies about southeast of the Island of Hawaiʻi. \n\nThe oldest age for the Emperor Seamounts is 81 million years, and comes from Detroit Seamount. However, Meiji Guyot, located to the north of Detroit Seamount, is likely somewhat older.\n\nIn 1963, geologist John Tuzo Wilson explained that the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain was created by a hotspot of volcanic activity that stood as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over it. This left a trail of volcanic islands and seamounts. A \"bend\" or \"V\" in the chain marks a shift in the movement of the Pacific plate some 47 million years ago, from a northward to a more northwesterly direction. The bend shows how a tectonic plate can shift direction suddenly. A look at the USGS map on the origin of the Hawaiian Islands clearly shows this \"spearpoint\".\n\nRecent research shows that the hotspot itself may have moved with time. Some evidence comes from analysis of the orientation of the ancient magnetic field preserved by magnetite in ancient lava flows sampled at four seamounts.\n\n", "id": "344224", "title": "Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain"}

The key idea is that the growing embryo gets its nutrition from a placenta in the mother's womb. It is the standard method for all mammals except monotremes. \n\nThose reptiles which do not lay eggs mostly keep soft-shelled eggs inside their bodies. The embryo exists on the material in the egg. They are ovoviviparus, because of the source of nutrition. However, there are some amphibians and a few reptiles which are genuinely viviparous because they get their nutrition direct from the mother.\n\nViviparous plants produce seeds that germinate before they detach from the parent. In many mangroves, for instance, the seedling germinates and grows under its own energy while still attached to its parent. Then it drops into the water to transport away. \n\nIn some trees, like jackfruit, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe. This condition is not vivipary because the moist and humid conditions just mimics a wet soil. However, the seeds can germinate under soil too.\n", "id": "344461", "title": "Viviparity"}

The word is thought to derive from the base \"skell-\", \"to ring/resound\" and the diminutive suffix \"-ling\". The slang term for a shilling as a currency unit was a \"bob\".\n\nThe abbreviation for shilling is s, from the Latin \"solidus\", the name of a Roman coin. Often it was informally represented by a slash, standing for a long s: \"e.g.,\" \"1/6\" would be 1 shilling and sixpence, often pronounced \"one and six\" (and equivalent to 18d; the shilling itself was valued at 12d). A price with no pence would be written with a slash and a dash, \"e.g.,\" \"11/-\". Quite often a triangle or (serif) apostrophe would be used to give a neater appearance, \"e.g.,\" \"1'6\" and \"11'-\". In Africa it is often abbreviated sh.\n\nDuring the Great Recoinage of 1816, the mint was instructed to coin one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains) of standard (0.925 fine) silver into 66 shillings, or its equivalent in other denominations.

Today the same group is registered as a marginal right-wing party in Croatia.\nCroatian Liberation Movement was established by Ante Pavelić in Buenos Aires in 1956. The goal of this group was to control original Ustaše organization. Pavelić then enjoyed protection of Argentina's dictator Juan Peron. . A prominent role in HOP, with the aim of keeping Ustaše ideals and infrastructure intact, had Pavelić's daughter Višnja. At those times HOP, in their writings and proclamations, tried to clear of any blame the Ustaše regime stressing the resistance of the movement to existence of Yugoslavia. Their writings compared Ustaše to earlier French and American revolutionaries. Ustaše main goals were described as defense of Croatia against Serbian aggression and against international Communism. When Peron lost power, Israeli attempted to force Argentina to extradite Pavelić. In 1957, after a failed attempt to assassinate Pavelić, he and his family moved via Chile to Spain, where Pavelić got protection of General Franco. Pavelić died on 28 December 1959, at the German hospital in Madrid.\n\nAfter Pavelić's death, his son-in-law Srečko Pšeničnik took over HOP and in 1960, moved its operations from Buenos Aires to Toronto, Canada. HOP newspaper, called Independent State of Croatia, continued to publish agitations for the downfall of Communist Yugoslavia.\n\nSeveral members of this organization were involved in the terrorist attacks in Yugoslavia, arrested there and were, on June 25 1964, sentenced for manslaughter and other terrorist acts. \n\nThe head of US HOP chapter was Stjepan Hefer, minister of agriculture and food in the Pavelić's regime. After his death, another Ustaše high ranked official, Anton Bonifačić took over the HOP leadership. Bonifačić was a head of cultural affair of the Foriegn Ministry in the Ustaše regime. Bonifačić posed in public as a writer and an anti-communist, giving speeches and passing resolutions on the continuing struggle for the Independent State of Croatia.. Bonifačić's presidency lasted from October 1975 through July 1981.\n\nThe chapter of HOP was established in 1963 in Australia. Ustaše Srećko Rover, who emigrated to Australia in 1948, was appointed head of this chapter. In 1972 Rover was elected vice-chairman of another terrorist organization, HNO (Croatian National Resistance).\n\nIn Australia, this terrorist group was reorganized by Pavelić's successor, Stjepan Hefer in 1967. Hefer was the head of this terrorist group until his death in 1973 .\n\nBy 1966, and within the next several years, the HOP carried out a series of assassinations and attacks on Yugoslav diplomat missions and the airline office. Their terrorist activities on the Australian soil and recorded military exercises with the Australian Army's Citizens Military Forces (CMF) prompted Australian senator from Tasmania, O'Byrne, to start action against HOP before the Australian Parliament controlled then by Australian Liberal Party. Many of HOP members were members of the Australian Liberal Party that time. This party membership along with the Cold War atmosphere provided a smoke screen behind this group carried their terrorist activities in early 1970-ies. When the Australian Democratic Labour Party came to the power in 1972, Australian Attorney-General approved the wire-tapping of suspected terrorist leaders such as Srećko Rover and Fabian Lovoković - the head of the HOP in Australia. For terrorist training purposes HOP used an Australian army Wodonga camp in the Victoria state.\n\nThe Croatian Liberation Movement, along with the Croatian National Resistance, were dreaming about resurrection of the Independent State of Croatia well into 1980s.

The district court dismissed the claims (2003) against the Croatian Liberation Movement for lack of personal jurisdiction. This dismissal was upheld by Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (2005).\n\nDuring the Yugoslavia disintegration, in the early 1990s, this organization moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where it was officially registered as a political party in Croatia in 1991.\n\nThis a far right and openly pro-Ustaše party is a marginal political party in Croatia.

Reynaldo Hahn wrote the music. Michel Fokine designed the dances, and Léon Bakst designed the sets and costumes. The ballet was first performed in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 May 1912. It was a failure. Critics thought Nijinsky the dancer for whom the ballet was designed did more posing than dancing. Producer Sergei Diaghilev blamed Hahn's music for the failure. \"Le Dieu Bleu\" was staged three times in Paris in 1912 and three times in London in 1913. The ballet has not been revived.\n\nBallet impresario and producer Sergei Diaghilev staged two exotic ballets for the Ballets Russes: \"Cléopâtre\" in 1909 and \"Schéhérazade\" in 1910. Both were great successes with the Parisian public. He hoped that \"Le Dieu Bleu\" (another exotic ballet) would be equally successful. \n\n\"Dieu\" was one of six new ballets for the 1911 Ballets Russes season. The others were \"Narcisse\", \"La Peri\", \"Le Spectre de la Rose\", \"Sadko\", and \"Petrushka\". Michel Fokine would design the dances for all of them. Léon Bakst would design the sets and costumes for the first four. When Fokine and Bakst started work on Ida Rubinstein's ballet \"Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien\", Diaghilev felt betrayed. He pushed \"Dieu\" forward to 1912. He lost interest in \"Dieu\", but spent huge amounts of money on the production. He hoped \"Dieu\" would make Nijinsky a great international star.\n\nFokine started work on \"Dieu\" in St Petersburg in the winter of 1911-1912. He based some of his ideas for the ballet on the dances of the Royal Siamese Court ballet. This company had danced in St Petersburg in 1900. Fokine also made a study of the arts of India. In the end though\n, his dances for \"Dieu\" were dull. \n\nHahn's music could have been the reason. It was not very good. Prince Lieven, a critic and historian of the Ballets Russes, said the music had no interest or importance. He said that it was \"sweet and insipid\". Bakst based his ideas for the sets and costumes on the printed materials for the Cambodian Ballet's 1906 performances in France.\n\nThe ballet was first presented by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 May 1912. Another ballet, \"Thamar\", was also on the program. Both ballets were failures. Diaghilev was shocked by the failure of \"Thamar\". He thought it would be another success like \"Schéhérazade\". He was not surprised that \"Dieu\" was a failure. He privately blamed Hahn's music for its failure. The music was dull. He was forced to use it because Hahn had rich friends in Paris. They would have cut their support of the Ballets Russes if the music had been turned down.\n\nThe ballet was designed for Nijinsky. He had yet to dance an important part for the Ballets Russes. He was cast as The Blue God. Diaghilev hoped The Blue God would make the dancer an internationally famous star. Other dancers in the ballet were Max Frohman as The Young Man, Tamara Karsavina as The Young Girl, Lydia Nelidova as The Goddess, and Michel Federov as The High Priest. Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska was cast as The Drunken Temple Dancer.\n\nThe curtain rises on a warm evening in India a long time ago. In front of a temple of rock, a pool is seen with a lotus on the surface of the water. Snakes and other animals rest near the pool. The temple walls are covered with masses of flowering plants. People are waiting for a ceremony to take place. The Young Man is about to become a priest of the temple. The Young Girl runs in. She kneels at the feet of The Young Man.

With the French occupation of Turin during the Napoleonic War the theatre was renamed the \"Teatro Nazionale\" and finally, after Napoleon became emperor, renamed again as the \"Teatro Imperiale\". When Napoleon's lost power in 1814 it got its original name back: the \"Regio\".\n\nOther theatres were built and gave seasons of opera in Turin. Among them was the restored \"Teatro Carignano\" in 1824. It was taken over by the municipality in 1932 and, after the destruction by fire of the \"Teatro Regio\" in 1936, the Carignano was the main opera house in the city until the \"Regio\" reopened in 1973.\n\nThe Regio was rebuilt in 1905 but the theatre closed during the First World War and re-opened in 1919. Until February 1936, seasons of opera were presented until fire then destroyed everything except the front of the building. It remained closed for thirty-seven years. Arturo Toscanini was the conductor of the Turin Opera from 1895 to 1898, during which time several production of works of Wagner were given their first Italian performances.\n\nThe opera house was rebuilt an opened in 10 April 1973 with a production of Verdi's \"I Vespri Siciliani\" directed by Maria Callas and Giuseppe Di Stefano. \n\nThe new house, which uses the original frontage, seats 1,750 and is elliptical in shape with a large orchestra level and 37 boxes.

It is for the country's declaration of independence from Pakistan. On the night of 25th March 1971, Pakistani Army brutally committed genocide on unarmed civilian Bengalis in the name of \"Operation Searchlight\". On the 26th of March, Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan was declared by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the nine month long bloody liberation war was commenced. The day is a memorial to the deaths of millions of civilians and valiant freedom fighters who died in the Bangladesh Liberation War.On Independence Day there are parades, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and ceremonies. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. Generally a thirty one gun salute is done in the morning. The main streets are decorated with national flags. We observe the day with due respect. All the people of Bangladesh eagerly wait for this day.The day has great importance to the people of Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a country of solemnity and unity. On the occasion of Independence Day the whole country wears festive colors. All the govt. offices are decorated with colourful lightings.\n\nBackground: Bangladesh is a newborn independent country. We had to undergo a world of pains and sufferings under the barbaric domination of the different autorotation of Great Britain as colonial state for long 190 years. Then we had to suffer under the domination of the barbarize rulers of West Pakistan for about 25 years. A mountain high disparity was created by them in the different spheres of national life. They made us crippled economically, politically and culturally. Their atrocities surpassed all the humanitarian limits. But our undaunted leaders and freedom-loving people did not let the matter go unchallenged. They rose up with great determination and started vigorous movement against them. A lot of blood was shed in different movements. At last, the war of liberation was waged on the midnight of March 25 1971. The war continued for long nine months. More than 30 lacks of people sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of freedom. This blood-shed of our heroic people did not go in vain. A proverb also goes, ‘there is a silver lining even in the darkest of clouds’. Justice triumphed in the long run. The Pakistani occupation forces surrendered unconditionally to the allied forces on December 16, 1971. This victory confirmed the birth of Bangladesh on the world map. However, March 26 victory confirmed the birth of Bangladesh on the world map. However, March 26 is our independence day because on this day in 1971, the Independence Day was declared. We celebrate this day every year with great honor and solemnity.\n\nDay’s programme: the day’s programme begins with the dawn of the day. The national flag is hoisted on all government and private buildings in towns. Dhaka, our capital city, takes a festive look on this occasion. Various units of our armed forces exhibit parades before the spectators. Sweets are distributed among the children. Special prayers are offered for the martyrs in all mosques, temples and churches of the country. Shaheed families are paid honor and respect. Special foods are supplied in hospitals and prisons. Essay writing competitions stressing on the significance of the day are held.\n\nVarious social and cultural organizations hold functions to commemorate the day. Sports and games are held throughout the country. The roads of the town remain crowded with the people of all walks of life. Government and semi-government offices, educational institutions and shops on both sides of the roads are decorated beautifully. In the evening, important government and public buildings are illuminated with mulch-colored bulbs. Radio and television center air special programmes. National dailies bring out special supplements highlighting the importance of the day. Flowers and floral wreaths are placed at the Jatiyo Smriti Soudho and . And songs are sung in chorus in honor of the martyrs\n\nSignificance of the day: it is needless to speak of the significance of the Independence Day in our life. Freedom is the birth right of man. No one has any right to snatch away this right. Despite the fact, we had to suffer deadly for lack of freedom for a pretty long time and live quite a sub-human life. We had land but we had no native land. We had language but we had no voice. Speak the truth, we were treated just life the inanimate objects of the earth. So we had no other alternative than to stand upright for the cause of our existence. We shattered the shackles of slavery and won independence in 1971. So the achievement of independence is a milestone in the life of the bangles. It is not merely a date of yearly calendar. It is a day of great thrill. It, is a day of great sensation. It is a day of great victory – a victory of justice over injustice, a victory of truth over falsehood, a victory of light over darkness, a victory of freedom over slavery and a victory of humanity over inhumanity. It is a day of taking on oath of dedicating life for the cause of motherland.

He was the first great poet of modern Bengali literature. He was educated at the Hindu College, Calcutta. In 1843, he became a Christian. He was born in Sagordari, a village in Keshobpur Upozila, Jessore District, East Bengal (now in Bangladesh). He was a pioneer of Bengali drama. His famous work \"Meghnad Bodh Kavya\", is a tragic epic. It has nine cantos and is exceptional in Bengali literature both in terms of style and content. He also wrote poems about the sorrows and pains of love as spoken by women. \n\nFrom an early age, Dutt wanted to be an Englishman in form and manner. In later life, he regretted his attraction to England and the Occident. He wrote lovingly of his homeland in his poems and sonnets from this period.\n\nHis early writings were in English, but they were unsuccessful. He turned, reluctantly at first, to Bengali. His main works, written mostly between 1858 and 1862, include prose drama, long narrative poems, and lyrics. His first play, \"Sarmistha\" (1858), was well received. His poetical works are \"Tilottamasambhab\" (1860), a narrative poem on the story of Sunda and Upasunda; \"Meghnadbadh\" (1861), his most important piece, an epic on the Rāmāyaṇa theme; \"Brajangana\" (1861), a cycle of lyrics on the \"Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa\" theme; and \"Birangana\" (1862), a set of 21 epistolary poems on the model of Ovid’s Heroides. \n\nDutt is widely said to be one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature. He is the father of the Bengali sonnet. He was the first to make what came to be called \"amitrakshar chhanda\" (blank verse).

The name comes from the Persian word \"beryā(n)\" which means \"fried\" or \"roasted\".\n\nThe cooking method of Biryani came from Iran. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent by Iranian travelers and merchants. In India, the recipe of biryani developed to its current form. Local variants of this dish are popular not only in South Asia but also in Southeast Asia, Arabia, and within various South Asian communities in Western countries.\n\nThe spices and condiments used in biryani may include, but are not limited to, ghee, nutmeg, mace, cumin, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. For a non-vegetarian biryani, the main ingredient with the spices is the meat—beef, chicken, goat, lamb, fish or shrimp. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or Raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of eggplant (brinjal), boiled egg and salad.\n\nBiryani and pullao are different. In biryani the rice (plain or fried) is cooked separately from the thick sauce (curry of meat or vegetables). The curry and the rice are then brought together and layered. This makes a dish with contrasting flavors of flavored rice and strongly flavored sauce and meat or vegetables.\n", "id": "345640", "title": "Biryani"}

Scientific models are used as a basis for scientific work. They can be used to explain, predict, and test, or to develop computer programs or mathematical equations.\n\nAn example of a complex model is the software used for weather forecasts. The program is based on equations for the variables which affect weather. Meteorological data is fed in, and the program produces predictions (graphs and data) of future weather patterns.\n\nA scientific model represents complex objects, events, and physical processes in a logical way.\n\n\nFor instance, models of our universe are part of astrophysics - the biggest things in nature - and physics - the smallest. This is not usually what we mean by nature, however. We mean the models studied in biology, ecology, economics, environmental health and healing. Most models of nature are of things that humans really affect directly, and which affect humans back:\n\nFor instance, to dump toxic waste in a river will harm others down the river. But without models of nature we do not know who, and cannot say how much is harmed or harmful.\n\nModels of nature affect human decision-making. They are very important to human health, wellness and economics. They also matter in ethics, since most people wish to reduce harm done by their decisions. They matter in law because harms can be proven to have been done in a court.\n\nA forest is very hard to bring back to life, once it is degraded. Smaller models of bits of nature help to understand how much must be left, so future generations can use nature too.\n\nIn many ways humans and nature can be said to be in conflict. Natural capital like soil and large healthy trees, which nature needs to make more of itself, is also useful to humans as natural resources. To know how much can be drawn out of nature, before it dies, is important. This is another reason for a model:\n\nThere are three main ways in which models of nature affect human life:\n\n\n\n\nTo preserve nature, ecology movement activists now cooperate in a global power network. It includes not just parties in politics but also NGOs like Greenpeace, Earth First or World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\nOne model of nature they have agreed on is a map that shows ecoregions, which are the natural borders of ecology maps. According to this map, there are 867 regions divided into 8 ecozones - plus others which are in the ocean.\n\nMost anthropologists agree that aboriginal languages have a small model of local nature in them. For instance, there will be more words to describe snow in an Arctic language, and more words to describe shades of green in a rainforest. This is part of the reason to use ecology borders in politics, since people who do not live inside the border do not see or make the same distinctions about nature.\n\nA very small number of people think that humans do not need nature at all, and can replace everything that it does. To prove them wrong, some economists made another model of nature:\n\nEconomists study nature's services to see how hard it would be to replace what nature does for humans. They showed in 1995 that the services nature performed for humans were more valuable than all services humans perform for each other all over the world. The value of Earth as a living thing was much more than we could ever afford to replace with our own technology. There has been no real disagreement about any of this.\n\nPricing all the value of Earth to humans gives a huge number - which proves the pricing is right, since, we must put a high price on anything we have no way to replace.\n", "id": "345676", "title": "Scientific model"}

In a normal pregnancy, the embryo implants (sticks) itself into the wall of the uterus. The uterus is the only place in the body where an embryo can grow into a fetus.\n\nMost ectopic pregnancies happen in a Fallopian tube (one of the two tubes that connect the ovaries and the uterus). For this reason, ectopic pregnancies are often called tubal pregnancies. Rarely, ectopic pregnancies can happen in an ovary or in the cervix. \n\nEctopic pregnancies cannot become normal pregnancies, and will not result in a baby. They can also cause serious health problems for the mother.\n\nRisk factors (things that make a woman more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy) include:\n\nAt first, there may be no symptoms. A woman may not even know she is pregnant at this point. Sometimes she might have pain in her pelvis, or bleeding from her vagina.\n\nBut once the embryo has grown for about 6 to 8 weeks, it gets large enough to make the Fallopian tube rupture (break open). This is a medical emergency, and can kill a woman.\n\nOnce the Fallopian tube has ruptured, it will start to bleed into the abdomen. Symptoms will include:\n\nA physician can do an exam of the pelvis to test for sensitivity and pain, to figure out if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy. There are also blood tests for the pregnancy hormone hCG. In a normal pregnancy, the hGC levels double every day. Low levels are evidence of a problem, like an ectopic pregnancy. An ultrasound can also be used to see if the embryo is implanted in the uterus or not.\n\nThere are two main ways to treat an ectopic pregnancy if it is diagnosed before the Fallopian tube ruptures. The first is with the medicine methotrexate. If it is given early enough, it can cause an abortion and end the pregnancy. The second is with a surgery called a laparoscopy (a surgery done with a laser). The surgeon makes a small cut in the belly and removes the embryo. A laparoscopy is done after the first few weeks of the pregnancy.\n\nOnce the Fallopian tube ruptures, emergency surgery is needed to fix the broken Fallopian tube and remove the blood from inside the abdomen. The patient may also needed to be treated for blood loss and sho\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy cannot become a baby. But it can have effects on future pregnancies and fertility. Because in an ectopic pregnancy the embryo usually grows in a Fallopian tube, the Fallopian tube can become damaged. This makes it more likely for another embryo to get stuck there. The likeness of another ectopic pregnancy depends on the amount of damage to the Fallopian tube, and the health of the tubes. However, even after a ectopic pregnancy, it is entirely possible to have a normal pregnancy.\n", "id": "345712", "title": "Ectopic pregnancy"}

On December 28, 2011 Johnson, withdrew his Republican campaign for president and joined the Libertarian Party as its candidate. On January 6, 2016, Johnson announced that he is running for President again for the Libertarian party. He won the nomination on May 29, 2016.\n\nJohnson was born in Minot, North Dakota. His father was Earl Johnson and his mother was Lorraine Bostow. He is of Danish, Norwegian and Ukrainian descent. He was raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He studied at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. \n\nJohnson entered politics for the first time by running for Governor of New Mexico in 1994 on a fiscally conservative, low-tax and anti-crime plan. He won the election beating the current governor Bruce King. \n\nDuring his time as governor, Johnson became known for his low-tax libertarian views, follwing to policies of tax and bureaucracy reduction supported by a cost–benefit analysis rationale. He cut the 10% annual growth in the budget: in part, due to his use of the gubernatorial veto 200 times during his first six months in office. Johnson set state and national records for his use of veto and line-item veto powers:o estimated to have been more than the other 49 contemporary governors combined, which gained him the nicknames \"Veto Johnson\" and \"Governor Veto\".\n\nJohnson successfully sought re-election in 1998. In his second term, he concentrated on the issue of school voucher reforms, as well as campaigning for marijuana decriminalization and legalization, and opposition to the War on Drugs. Term limited, Johnson could not run for re-election at the end of his second term. He left office in 2003.\n\nIn April 2011, Johnson announced that he was running for President of the United States. He ran as a Republican. After poor polling numbers in Republican polls and not qualified to attend the debates, Johnson switched his political views and ran as a Libertarian. He beat Libertarian candidate R. Lee Wrights for the nomination at the convention.\n\nIn the 2012 United States presidential election, Johnson received 0.99% of the popular vote, a total of 1,275,971 votes. This was the best result in the Libertarian Party's history by raw vote number, though under the 1.1 percentage of the vote won by Ed Clark in 1980.\n\nIn an April 2014 Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session, Johnson stated that he hopes to run for president again in 2016. On whether he would run as a Libertarian or a Republican, he stated that \"I would love running as a Libertarian because I would have the least amount of explaining to do.\"\n\nIn November 2014, Johnson said he wanted to run for the 2016 Libertarian nomination. Johnson resigned from his post as CEO of Cannabis Sativa, Inc. in January 2016 to pursue political opportunities, hinting to a 2016 presidential run.\n\nOn January 6, 2016, Johnson announced that we will run for president for the Libertarian Party nomination.\n\nA poll done by Monmouth University to show who people wanted to win the election showed that Johnson was at 11%.\n\nJohnson won the party's nomination on May 29, 2016 at the Libertarian Convention in Orlando, Florida.\n\nJohnson was married to Dee Simms from 1997 until her death from heart disease in 2005.

It is the only venomour snake in the British Isles.\n\nThey are not highly dangerous; the snake is not aggressive and usually only bites when alarmed or disturbed. Bites can be very painful, but they are rarely fatal. The snake is not threatened, though it is protected in some countries.\n\nAdults grow to an average 60 centimeters (24 in) in length. The largest, at around 90–104 (35–41 in), are found in Scandinavia. In France and Great Britain, the maximum size is 80–87 centimeters (31–34 in), weighing from 50 grams (1.8 oz) to about 180 grams (6.3 oz). The head is fairly large, the sides of which are almost flat, and the edge of the snout is usually raised into a low ridge.\n\nUnusual for snakes, the adder's sexes are possible to tell apart by the colour. Females are usually brownish with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings.\n\nThe species has two morphs. The common pattern is the one with dark stripe with crossbars along the back, on a lighter body. The melanistic morph is very dark all over. The dark morph is more common in females. Where information is available, polymorphism seems to be maintained by natural selection. No information has been collected on its effect in adders.\n\nThe adder has a wide range. It can be found across Eurasian; from northwestern Europe (Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, France) across southern Europe (Italy, Albania, Croatia, Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria, and northern Greece) and eastern Europe to north of the Arctic Circle, and Russia to the Pacific Ocean, Sakhalin Island, North Korea, northern Mongolia and northern China. \nIn several European countries it is known as being the only native venomous snake.\n\nThe adder's diet is mainly small mammals such as mice, voles, shrews and even weasels and moles. Sometimes, they eat slow worms and lizards. They feed on amphibia, such as frogs, newts, and salamanders. There have been reports of adders eating birds, especially nestlings and eggs. Once they reach about 30 cm (1 ft) in length, their diet begins to resemble that of the adults.\n", "id": "346072", "title": "Adder"}

It is a serious and life threatening health problem that can be fatal if not properly treated in time. \n\nIn a healthy body, insulin helps glucose (sugar) get from the blood into the body's cells. There, the cells can use the sugar to make energy. However, when there is not enough insulin in the body, or if a person's body does not react to insulin normally (this is called insulin resistance), too much sugar stays in the blood. This can cause serious health problems.\n\nExtremely high blood sugar means diabetes mellitus, a condition that often causes very high blood sugar. Hyperglycemia that comes and goes may mean diabetes of any kind, or may be developing under low insulin levels or resistance to insulin.\n\nThree of the early signs of hyperglycemia are \"the 3 polys\": polydipsia (feeling very thirsty), polyphagia (feeling very hungry), and polyuria (urinating a lot). These things happen because:\nOther early signs of high blood sugar include blurred vision, headache, and feeling tired.\n\nIf hyperglycemia gets worse or is not treated, it can cause toxic acids called ketones to build up in the blood and urine.

The park is the largest in Tasmania and is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.\n\nThe eastern side of the park is west of Hobart and the park stretches to the west and south coasts. This park covers most of the wilderness areas in Tasmania's south west. The park is well known for its untouched wilderness and remoteness. Weather in the park is can change quickly, and can be severe. The area has not been changed by humans. Evidence shows that Tasmanian Aborigines have visited the area for at least 25,000 years. European settlers have made a few trips into the park, but there has been very few long lasting settlements and little change to the natural environment. Within the area there is only one road, to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon. The southern and western parts the park can only be reached by foot, boat, or light aircraft.\n\nThe tiny town of Melaleuca in the extreme south-west has a runway for airplanes to land, and basic facilities for the National Parks Service.\n\nMost of the park was created in 1955 and was first called Lake Pedder National Park. Over the following 35 years the park was made bigger and was renamed, reaching its present size in 1990. The original small Lake Pedder was flooded with the building of a dam on the Gordon River for hydroelectricity. The man made lake is also called Lake Pedder\n\nThe Melaleuca area is the summer breeding grounds of the highly endangered orange-bellied parrot .\n\nThere are two ways to reach the park by land: the Gordon River Road to the hydroelectricity township of Strathgordon and the Huon Highway to Cockle Creek. The southern and western areas of the park can only be reached by foot, boat, or light aircraft.\nThere are two main walking tracks cross the park. The Port Davey Track and the South Coast Track. The walks are generally for more experienced walkers, and take about ten to fourteen days to complete. A flight to or from Melaleuca may be arranged to split the walk, or for tourist access for day trips. Several more difficult walks also exist, including the Eastern and Western Arthur Ranges, Precipitous Bluff, the South West Cape, and Federation Peak. These are not suitable for inexperienced walkers, or for people traveling alone. Sea access to the park is from Port Davey and Bathurst Harbour.\n\nOther National Parks and reserves in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area are:\n\n", "id": "346373", "title": "Southwest National Park"}

On 21 December 1988, the aeroplane flying this route was destroyed by a bomb. The explosion killed everybody on the plane. It exploded over Lockerbie, in southern Scotland, and eleven more people on the ground were killed by the falling plane. The event is also known as the Lockerbie bombing.\n\nThe aircraft was a Boeing 747–121 named \"“Clipper Maid of the Seas”\". The explosion killed all 243 passengers and 16 crew members. Eleven more people in Lockerbie were killed as large parts of the plane fell in the town and crashed into houses. The total number of people killed in the disaster was 270. After many years of investigation, the attack was blamed on airline officials working for Libya's government. Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, a Libyan man, was convicted of murder over the attack, and later freed as he had deadly cancer. Megrahi died almost three years later. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was also said to have ordered the attack.\n\nThe airplane that crashed was a Boeing 747–121, registered and named \"Clipper Maid of the Seas\" and it was was 18 years old.\nFlight 103 had originated at Frankfurt Airport, operated by Boeing 727. At London Heathrow Airport, the flight was the changed to a Boeing 747. The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, and took off to John F. Kennedy International Airport, and then to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport.\nAt 19:02:44 Flight 103 disappeared from air traffic control, then at 19:02:50 then plane returned as five echos instead of one. A British Airways pilot, reported that he could see a huge fire on the ground. The explosion punched a 50-cm (20-inch) hole on the left side of the fuselage. As it descended, the fuselage broke up into smaller pieces, with the section attached to the wings landing first. 200,000 lb (91,000 kg) of jet fuel it contained, ignited, the resulting fireball destroyed several houses and tore a large crater through the center of Lockerbie killing 11 people on the ground.\nAll 259 passengers and crew and eleven people on the ground died in the crash. Of the 259 people on the plane 190 people were Americans, 43 were British, and many more were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country. Flight 103 was manned by Captain Jim MacQuarrie (55), First Officer Ray Wagner (52), and Flight Engineer Jerry Don Avritt (46).

It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, a famous German mathematician who wrote about this method, but did not invent it.\n\nTo perform Gaussian elimination, the coefficients of the terms in the system of linear equations are used to create a type of matrix called an augmented matrix. Then, elementary row operations are used to simplify the matrix. The three types of row operations used are:\n\nThe goal of Gaussian elimination is to get the matrix in \"row-echelon form\". If a matrix is in row-echelon form, that means that reading from left to right, each row will start with at least one more zero term than the row above it. Some definitions of Gaussian elimination say that the matrix result has to be in \"reduced row-echelon form\". That means that the matrix is in row-echelon form and the only non-zero term in each row is 1. Gaussian elimination that creates a reduced row-echelon matrix result is sometimes called Gauss-Jordan elimination.\n\nSuppose the goal is to find the answers to this system of linear equations.\nFirst, the system needs to be turned into an augmented matrix. In an augmented matrix, each linear equation becomes a row. On one side of the augmented matrix, the coefficients of each term in the linear equation become numbers in the matrix. On the other side of the augmented matrix are the constant terms each linear equation is equal to. For this system, the augmented matrix is:\n\nThen, row operations can be done on the augmented matrix to simplify it. The table below shows the row reduction process on the system of equations and on the augmented matrix.\n\nThe matrix is now in row-echelon form. This is also called \"triangular form\".\nThe matrix is now in reduced row-echelon form. Reading this matrix tells us that the solutions for this system of equations occur when x = 2, y = 3, and z = -1.\n", "id": "346458", "title": "Gaussian elimination"}

She attended St. Paul's Girls' School and then continued school at Newham College in Cambridge. At Newham College she got a Ph.D in physical chemistry. She worked on coal, studies of RNA, and viruses. She was one of the first people to do X-ray crystallography on DNA. She also spent several years working in Paris studying crystals. [3] She discovered the size, shape, and arrangement of molecules. She dedicated her life to discovering more about molecules. \n\nIn 1951, she moved to London. She joined a group of scientific researchers at King's College. Her assignment was to take pictures of DNA. She looked at the structure and function of DNA in the pictures. This job was very difficult because technology was simple at that time. During this job, Franklin worked with a man name Raymond Gosling. He was also trying to photograph the DNA. Franklin also had to work with Maurice Wilkins. The scientists had many arguments, but Franklin kept working. Instead of working with Wilkins, Franklin liked to work with Gosling. She created X-ray pictures that showed that DNA is shaped like a double helix.\n\nIn 1951, Franklin presented her idea about the shape of DNA at a conference. A biologist named James D. Watson went to her conference. Watson and Francis Crick were biologists. They were also studying the shape of DNA. They were building 3D examples of the helix shape.  \n\nWatson and Crick used Franklin's work in their work to discover the structure of DNA. Their final model was presented in 1953.

She was born into a wealthy Brooklyn family. On a family vacation she toured the Warner Brothers studio and was spotted by director Anatole Litvak. After a screen test she was offered a contract. But her father disapproved of her becoming a Hollywood actress. He finally approved of her acting on the Broadway stage if she would first make her society debut. She played several bit parts before again being noticed by Hollywood. She had a brief contract with Columbia Pictures but returned to Broadway. Her first break was in the play \"The Male Animal\" as a college cheerleader. This time 20th Century Fox wanted to sign her to a contract. They allowed her creative control over her parts and she could return to act on Broadway every year.\n\nShe played a newspaperwoman in love with an outlaw (played by Henry Fonda) in the Western \"The Return of Frank James\". She was then cast in a variety of roles before getting top billing on her own. Her first lead role came in the movie \"Heaven can Wait\" also starring Don Ameche. She then starred in the Film noir \"Laura\". This was followed by a second film noir, \"Leave her to Heaven\". Starring with Tyrone Power, she played the female lead in \"The Razor's Edge\". Probably her best known film was \"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir\" with Rex Harrison. When it was released in 1947 it did fairly well. But it did not become a classic until later. She went on to star in several films. But she had a number of personal problems later in her career. This included a love affair gone wrong. As her second husband, she married W. Howard Lee, a rich Houston oilman. She remained happily married to him for 20 years until his death in 1981.\n\nAfter her marriage to Howard she did only two more films before retiring. Tierney's autobiography was published in 1979. As an actor she had been a heavy smoker, probably to lower her voice. On 6 November 1991 Tierney died of emphysema in Houston, Texas.

Their original lineup was Scott Reagers (vocals), Dave Chandler (guitarist), Mark Adams (drums) and Armando Acosta (drums). Saint Vitus was known as Tyrant until 1980, when they changed their name to their current name Saint Vitus, which was inspired by the song \"St. Vitus' Dance\" by Black Sabbath, a band they have cited as one of their major influences.\n\nAround 1983, Greg Ginn of Black Flag signed Saint Vitus to his label SST Records and the band managed to record their first album, which is self-titled. It came out in 1984, and later that year, the embarked on their first-ever tour with Black Flag, another band that Saint Vitus is influenced by and would latercover their song \"Thirsty and Miserable\" for their 1987 EP with the same title. Their second album \"Hallow's Victim\" and the \"The Walking Dead\" EP were both released in 1985.\n\nSaint Vitus experienced their first lineup change when Scott \"Wino\" Weinrich replaced Reagers on vocals in 1986.

They live in Australia and New Guinea. \n\nThe green tree frog was imported onto ships to the United States and New Zealand. The species belongs to the genus \"Litoria\". The species magnificent tree frog (\"Litoria splendida\") and the giant tree frog (\"Litoria infrafrenata\") are similar to the green tree frog. The green tree frog is the largest frog in Australia. It can reach to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length. \n\nThe average lifespan is about sixteen years, if kept captive. Green tree frogs are easy to take care of. They are okay with living near human buildings. They are often found on windows or inside houses. The green tree frog screams when it is in danger. It does this to scare off animals that have threatened them. The green tree frog squeaks when it is touched. The green tree frog is known as the most recognizable frog in Australia. This is because of how the frog looks like and because of its behavior in its habitat. It is also a popular exotic pet throughout the world. The frog's skin has antibacterial and antiviral protections. Their skin may be useful for medication in treating patients in the future.\n\nThe green tree frog is one of many tree frog species of the genus \"Litoria\". They are native in Australasia. The common name of the species is \"White's tree frog\". The species were named after John White. He first discovered the species in 1790. The green tree frog was the first frog to be classified in Australia. The specimen of the green tree frog was collected by Sir Joseph Banks. It was destroyed during the German bombing of the Hunterian Museum during World War II. The museum was located at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\n\nThe green tree frog was first called the \"blue frog\" (\"Rana caerulea\"). The original specimens White sent to England were damaged by the preservative and looked blue. The color of the frog is caused by blue and green pigments covered in a yellow layer. The preservative destroyed the yellow layer. It left the frog looking blue. The word \"caeruela\", which means blue in Latin, is part of the green tree frog's scientific name. The frog is also more known as the \"green tree frog\". However, that name is often given to the larger green tree frog (\"Hyla cinerea\") in its region.\n\nThe green tree frog can reach 10 centimeters (4 inches) in length. The frog's color depends on the temperature and the color of its environment. The green tree frog can be brown or green. The frog's mouth is white. The frog may have small, white-shaped spots on its back. At the end of its toes, it has large discs. This gives the frog the ability to climb. The eyes are golden. The fingers of the frog have webbed feet for swimming. The tympanum membrane can be seen on the frog. \n\nThe green tree frog looks similar to the magnificent tree frog (\"Litoria spendida\"). This frog is native to north-western Australia. The magnificent tree frog has large patrotoid and rostral glands on the head. The giant tree frog (\"Litoria infrafrenata\") is also sometimes confused with the green tree frog. The giant tree frog has white stripes. These stripes are on the edge of the frog's lower jaw. The green tree frog does not have these stripes.\n\nThe appearance of the green tree frog tadpole changes during its development. The tadpole can reach from 8.1 millimeters (after it has hatched) to 44 millimeters. The tadpole is brown, but it later changes to green during its development. The underside of the tadpole is dark. It changes to white when the tadpole is an adult frog. The eggs are brown, in a clear jelly. They are 1.1–1.4 millimeters in diameter. \n\nThe green tree frog has lungs. They absorb oxygen through their skin. For this to happen, their skin has to be moist. However, their skin can get infected by pathogens. Pathogens will live on the frog's skin. This makes them sick. The frog will then grow peptides. These will destroy the pathogens. The skin of the Green Tree Frog has caerins. Caerins is a group of peptides with antibacterial and antivirial protection. It also has caerulins. The caerulins have physiological effects. The CCK-8 is a digestive hormone and hunger suppressant. Several peptides from the skin of the green tree frog have been found to destroy HIV without harming healthy T-cells.\n\nThe green tree frog is native to northern and eastern parts of Australia. They are also native to southern New Guinea. In New Guinea, the green tree frog lives in the drier area of the country. The frog can be found from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby. It also can be found on Daru Island. There has been records of the frog found in northern New Guinea. However, it is thought that they were introduced there by humans. The International Conservation Union (IUCN) believes the frog is in \"scattered locations\" in both New Guinea and Indonesia.\n\nThe species has been introduced to the United States and New Zealand. The frog can be found in the US state of Florida. It is believed that they were introduced through pet trade. There are only small populations in Florida. It is unknown if they have caused any ecological damage. In New Zealand, there were large populations of the green tree frog. However, there have been no sightings since the 1950s.\n\nGreen Tree Frogs are easy to take care of. They are active at night. During the day, they will rest near a place where it is cool, dark, and moist. In the winter, green tree frogs do not make calling sounds. They are also not seen that much.\n\nDepending on their location, green tree frogs will live in several habitats. They are found in the canopy of trees. They are also found near slow-moving waters. They can also live in swamps or in the grasslands in cooler climates. green tree frogs are known to live inside houses. They can be found in sinks and toilets. They can also be found on windows. They will also live in tanks, downpipes, and gutters. They like living in those places because they provide high humidity. The habitats can also be cooler than their environment. The frogs will be near downpipes and tanks during mating season. They do this because the tools will make their call louder.\n\nThe species' call is a low, slow \"Brawk-Brawk-Brawk\". They repeat it many times. For most of the year, they will call while being on top of something that is very high. These include trees and gutters. During mating season, the frogs will call near a place where there is water. They will stay there for a little while or forever. Like many frogs, green tree frogs call to attract a mate. They will also use their call to warn other frogs that they are near. The green tree frog will make a stress call whenever they are in danger.\n\nThe green tree frogs will eat insects and spiders. However, they can also eat smaller frogs and even small mammals. The frog's teeth are not made for cutting up their prey. This means that the prey has to fit inside their mouths in order for the frog to eat it. Many frogs will stick out their tongues at prey. The green tree frog's tongues, as with many frogs, are very sticky. The prey will be stuck and will be eaten. The green tree frog will use their tongues on small prey. For larger prey, they will jump on top of it and force it into their mouths using their hands.\n\nThe frog has a few predators. They include snakes, a few species of lizards and birds. Dogs and cats have also been known to catch and eat Green Tree Frogs. The green tree frog can live up to sixteen years, if kept captive. But some have been known to live for over twenty years. The average life expectancy in the wild is lower than being captive. This is because of predation.\n\nThe green tree frog is one of the most popular pet frogs in the world. This is because of its submissive behavior and long life expectancy. It is also a popular pet frog because it looks like a cartoon frog. It is also one of the easiest frogs to take care of. Their diet are not expensive. They also have a strong resistance to diseases. Overfeeding the frog is a common problem with pet owners. The green tree frog tends to become obese when it is overfed. In the wild, the frog's energy is needed for the frog to catch its prey. However, in captivity, they are given live food. They are also housed in comfortable habitats. This makes the frog lazy because it does not have to do any activities. When the frog is inactive, it will gain weight. An overweight green tree frog will have fat layers on top of the head and body. This gives it a \"dumpy\" look. This is why some pet owners call the green tree frog the \"dumpy tree frog\".\n\nAccording to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the green tree frog is protected in Australia. The IUCN lists the frog as \"least concern\". It is listed as \"least concern\" because the green tree frog can be found in many places. The Green Tree Frog's population is not declining.\n\nSome of the green tree frog's natural habitats have been destroyed. Some Green Tree Frogs have been found to be infected with chytrid fungus. This causes chytridiomycosis. The population of the green tree frog in Australia is declining. However, because of the long life expectancy of this species, it will take longer for the frog to be an endangered species.\n\n", "id": "346631", "title": "Australian green tree frog"}

With over 80,000 drivers, the NHRA is considered one of the largest motorsports organizations in the world.\n\nThe association was started by Wally Parks in 1951 in the State of California to provide a governing body to organize and further the sport of drag racing. The first national NHRA event was held in 1955, in Great Bend, Kansas. (The races were run on a training air field built during World War II.) The \"Nationals\", which now number 22 events every year, are the major events in drag racing that bring together the best cars and drivers from across North America. The Mac Tools U.S. Nationals are now held at Indianapolis Raceway Park in Clermont, Indiana. \n\nThe NHRA forces racers to use various things in the cars run in its racing events to keep drivers safe. First is the five point safety harness (belt) that all cars must have. This holds the driver secure in the seat and has with a quick-release lock, which can be opened in less than a second if the driver needs to leave the car due to fire or explosion.\n\nSecond are the fire suits that all drivers must wear. These suits are full body cover-alls and made with seven layers of Nomex fire-resistant fabric. \n\nThird is the use of the Head and Neck Support (HANS) device. This device limits the moving of the head and neck in the event of a collision and has been required within the NHRA since 2004.\n\nFourth is the high-strength metal shield that must be placed behind the head of all Top Fuel drivers. This is to prevent any material from entering the cockpit and striking the driver. This is needed because the engine is behind the driver in Top Fuel cars.\n\nFifth is the on board fire control system that all cars must have. These systems are directed onto the engine itself and start when the engine catches fire, reducing the chance for the car to completely catch fire. This has been in place on all cars beginning in 1983, when an engine explosion and fire came very close to killing then-Funny Car driver Mike Dunn.\n\nSixth is the roof escape opening that is in place on all Funny Cars since the division was made in the early 1970s. This opening allows Funny Car drivers a safe means of escape during an engine fire rather than falling out of the car between the frame and body.\n\nSeventh are the long bars at the end of all cars, also known as \"\"wheelie bars\"\". These prevent the car from turning over during the rapid start of the race. \n\nThe drive tires of the cars, which are called \"slicks\" because there is no tread on them, are made from a much harder compound so that the tires are resistant to failure. The tires are not allowed to be inflated under for any race at any time.\n\nCars in the Funny Car class must have fire-proof engine blankets around the engine block to contain material in case of an engine explosion.\n\nBefore the late 1980s, people could station themselves up to the guardrails so they could be closer to the action. After several rather accidents on track, where people have been hurt or killed, people are no longer allowed within of the guardrail.\n\n", "id": "346653", "title": "National Hot Rod Association"}

She was orphaned at an early age. She had, by the standard of Russian ballet, little formal training. Tutored by Mikhail Fokine, she made her debut in 1908. This was a single private performance of Oscar Wilde's \"Salomé\", in which she stripped nude in the course of the \"Dance of the Seven Veils\". \n\nSergei Diaghilev took her with the Ballets Russes and she danced the title role of \"Cléopâtre\" in the Paris season of 1909, and Zobéide in \"Scheherazade\" in 1910. Both ballets were choreographed by Fokine, and designed by Leon Bakst. Her partner in \"Scherazade\" was Nijinsky. \"Scherezade\" was admired at the time for its racy sensuality, costumes and design. Its music is by Rimsky-Korsakov. For a long time the ballet was rarely performed. It is in the repertoire of the Mariinsky Ballet at present, and was performed by them in London 2011. Rubinstein left the Ballets Russes in 1911. \n\nBisexual, in 1911 Rubinstein began a three-year affair with the painter Romaine Brooks, who created a striking portrait. She used the dancer as a nude model for Venus.\n\nAfter leaving the Ballets Russes, Rubinstein formed her own dance company. She had inherited money, and she used it to commission several lavish productions. In 1911 she performed in \"Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien\". The creative team was Fokine (choreography); Bakst (design); and score by Debussy. This was a triumph for its stylized modernism, and a scandal. The Archbishop of Paris prohibited Catholics from attending because St. Sebastian was being played by a woman and a Jew.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Rubinstein appeared in a number of plays, and in Staat's \"Istar\" at the Paris Opera in 1924. Between 1928 and 1929, she directed her own company in Paris with Nijinska as choreographer. She commissioned and performed in Maurice Ravel's \"Boléro\" in 1928. Other works developed in 1928 were Massine's \"David\", with music by Sauguet; and \"Le Baiser de la fée\", with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Nijinska. The repertoire also included The Firebird (\"L'Oiseau de Feu\") with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Fokine; this had been one of the most sensational creations for the Ballets Russes. Her company was revived in 1931 and 1934, with new works. She closed the company in 1935, and gave her last performance in the play \"Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher\" in Paris, 1939.\n\nRubinstein often staged free ballet events and continued to dance until the start of the Second World War.\n\nRubinstein was not a front-rank ballerina; she began her training too late for that. She did have tremendous 'stage presence' and was able to act. She was also a significant patron, and commissioned works that suited her, works that mixed dance with drama and stagecraft. In 1934 the French government awarded her the Légion d'honneur, and then in 1939 the Grand Cross of the order, their highest honour. In 1935 she was awarded honorary French citizenship, and in 1936 she converted to Roman Catholicism.\n\nIn 1940 she left France and made her way to England via Algeria and Morocco. There she helped wounded Free French soldiers until 1944. She returned to France after the war. She lived finally at \"Les Olivades\" at Vence, where she died in 1960. She is buried nearby.\n", "id": "346895", "title": "Ida Rubinstein"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=346926", "text": "Sudden infant death syndrome\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden and unexpected death of a human baby which is unexplained even after an autopsy and investigation. SIDS is sometimes referred to as cot death or crib death. \n\nThe name is only applied to cases where the baby is less than one year old. By definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year. Most happen when the infant is 2 to 4 months of age. This is a critical period because the infant's ability to arouse from sleep is not yet mature. SIDS is defined as a syndrome.\n\nBabies are at the highest risk for SIDS during their sleep. Male infants die more often than female infants; about 60% of the cases are male infants. Infants also die more often during winter months. \n\nThe reason for SIDS are unknown, but there are different theories:\n\nInfanticide and child abuse cases may be misdiagnosed as SIDS due to lack of evidence. and caretakers of infants with SIDS are sometimes falsely accused. Accidental suffocations are also sometimes misdiagnosed as SIDS and \"vice versa\". Grief support for families affected by SIDS is particularly important. The death of the infant is typically sudden, without witnesses, and requires an investigation.\n\nA broader term, “sudden and unexpected infant death” (SUID) is used to describe \"all such deaths, regardless of cause\". Cases of SUID that remain unexplained after a complete autopsy and review of the circumstances of death and clinical history are classified as SIDS. Thus, SIDS is one of the causes of SUID and accounts for 80% of such deaths.\n\nNobody knows what causes SIDS. However, there are some known risk factors for SIDS.\n\nNot every infant who has one of these risk factors dies from SIDS. Risk factors just make it more likely for a baby to have SIDS.\n\nSIDS happens more in infants of mothers who smoke while they are pregnant. The higher the levels of nicotine in the infant's blood, the higher the risk of SIDS. Nicotine causes important changes in the way a fetus develops during pregnancy, which have been linked to SIDS as well as miscarriages.\n\nInfants who are put to sleep on their stomachs or sides are more likely to die of SIDS. This risk is highest in infants who are two to three months old. The \"Back to Sleep\" movement has encouraged parents to put their infants to sleep on their backs to prevent SIDS. \n\nOther things that increase the risk for SIDS while an infant is sleeping include: \n\nSome researchers think these things can make it difficult for infants to control their body temperature, making them unable to control their breathing.\n\nInfants are more likely to die of SIDS if they share a bed with parents or older children. This risk is highest:\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that if parents share a room with an infant without sharing a bed, they can cut their infant's risk of SIDS in half.\n\nInfants who are breastfed are less likely to die of SIDS. The more an infant has been breastfed, the less likely they are to die of SIDS.\n\nSIDS is less likely to happen in infants of older mothers. Infants of teenage mothers are at the highest risk. \n\nAn infant is also at a higher risk of SIDS if:\n\nSIDS only happens at certain ages. The risk of SIDS is highest in infants from two to four months old. After the infant reaches one year old, the risk decreases and eventually reaches zero.\n\nGenetics affect the risk of SIDS. Baby boys have about a 50% higher risk of SIDS than baby girls. Scientists think this might be because of an allele that exists on the X chromosome. They think this allele helps protect against episodes where the brain does not get enough oxygen (transient cerebral anoxia). Baby boys would be more likely to be missing this allele.\n\nScientists think that about 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are caused by inherited defects in the ion channels that help the heart squeeze out blood.\n\nThe risk of SIDS seems to be affected by things like how much education an infant's mother got, race, ethnicity, and poverty.\n\nVaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS. Most studies have shown that getting vaccinations cuts an infant's risk of a SIDS death in half.\n\nSIDS may be more common in babies with \"Staphylococcus aureus\" or \"Escherichia coli\" (\"E. coli\") infections, but scientists are not sure.\n\nPutting infants to sleep on their backs can help prevent SIDS. The number of SIDS deaths has fallen in countries where this is commonly done. Also, if parents share a room with their infant but do not share a bed, they can cut their baby's risk of SIDS in half.\n\nParents can help prevent SIDS by not using pillows, very soft mattresses, stuffed animals, or fluffy blankets in their infant's crib. Dressing the infant warmly and keeping the crib \"naked\" lowers the risk of SIDS.\n\nIf an infant has a blanket in the crib, they should be covered only up to their chest, with their arms left outside the blanket. This makes it harder for the infant to move the blanket over their head, which could cause breathing problems.\n\nIn colder places where infants need help staying warm, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using a \"sleep sack.\" This is like a sleeping bag for a baby, but with holes for the baby's arms and head. The bag is closed around the baby with a zipper. This helps keep the baby warm without covering their head. Sleep sacks are especially helpful for babies with low birth weight, who have more trouble keeping themselves warm.\n\nMany studies have shown that vaccines normally given to infants help prevent SIDS. For example, one very large research study showed that giving infants vaccines for diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis helps prevent SIDS.\n\nGetting normal infant vaccines cuts infants' risk of SIDS in half, according to many studies.\n", "id": "346926", "title": "Sudden infant death syndrome"}

TLC (an acronym for \"T-Boz, Left Eye and Chilli\") consisted of Tionne \"T-Boz\" Watkins, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes (1971-2002) and Rozonda \"Chilli\" Thomas. Lisa Pebbles, was the band manager. \n\nTLC's debut album \"Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip\" (1992) sold 4,000,000 copies in the United States. It released four singles \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\", \"What About Your Friends\", \"Hat 2 Da Back\", and \"Baby, Baby, Baby\". In 1994, band member Lopes had set her boyfriend, Andre Rison's, house on fire. After she was released from rehab, she was put on probation. That same year, \"CrazySexyCool\" was released. It became their breakthrough release. It sold 11,000,000 copies in the United States and was certified 8x Platinum in Canada, Platinum in United Kingdom and 1x Diamond in the United States. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked the album #377 of the \"500 greatest albums of all time\" list. The singles \"Red Light Special\", \"Waterfalls\", \"Creep\" and \"Diggin' on You\" all entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\n\nTLC filed for bankruptcy in 1995, despite their success of \"CrazySexyCool\". The band had owe too much money to their manager Pebbles. The albums sales were not enough to pay her back. TLC filed for a lawyer and was able to terminate the record deal signed with Pebbles. Because of the label and producer trouble, and health problems (Watkins' struggled with sickle cell anemia), postponed any developments for their next album. \"Fanmail\" was released in 1999. The album became a hit record. The singles \"No Scrubs\", \"Unpretty\", and \"Silly Ho\" helped the album to reach #1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 pop chart. The album's fourth single \"Dear Lie\" was not successful. The album was given positive feedback from music critics. The band began arguing with each other because of Lopes, who continued to be on tabloid magazines. Watkins married Mack 10, a rapper. However, her health problems were helping her to not be near recording studios. Lopes had begun a solo career. In 2002, Lopes was killed during a car accident in Honduras. The remainder of the group announced that they continue recording their fourth album. Lopes had recorded a few verses before she was killed.\n\nThe album, \"3D\" was released later that year. The single \"Girl Talk\" was a tribute to Lopes. The other single \"Hands Up\" was not successful. The album's third single \"Damaged\" was more successful and was on the Hot 100 until 2003. In 2004, the reality television show \"R U The Girl?\" aired on FOX. The show was about searching for great African American singers. The show had over 4,000,000 average viewers. O'so Krispie from Atlanta was chosen as the winner. TLC later said that they never wanted to replace Lopes and disbanded the group.\n\nIn July 2013 TLC signed a new record contract.

Some choices for the Hall of Fame have not been popular like famous people who did not wrestle. Sometimes WWE will show Hall of Fame announcements and ceremonies on TV. \n\nThe early Hall of Famers are the ones who helped build WWE and are considered pioneers. These include Arnold Skaaland, Buddy Rogers, Chief Jay Strongbow, Freddie Blassie, Gorilla Monsoon, Antonino Rocca, Ernie Ladd, The Fabulous Moolah, George \"The Animal\" Steele, The Grand Wizard, Ivan Putski and Pedro Morales. James Dudley was inducted for being a dear friend of the McMahon family and for being loyal to the company for a long time. Vince McMahon, Sr. was inducted because he first started WWE and might be the most important member. It is his family that still owns and runs the company to this day. Bobo Brazil was the first great black wrestling star. Killer Kowalski was a great villain wrestler. \n\nLater inductees included the top stars of the 1980s which was the greatest time in wrestling history. Those wrestlers are Jimmy Snuka, Pat Patterson, Lou Albano, \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton, Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik, classic manager Jimmy Hart, Nikolai Volkoff, Paul Orndorff and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. An wrestler who usually lost his matches, Johnny Rodz was also inducted.

Potentiometers are resistors where the resistance can be changed using a knob or a slider. Potentiometers are used to control many things, including how bright or dim the lights in your house are and the volume controls on your television.\n\nThe idea of a device that could be used to control the amount of electricity going to a component was thought by many people, but the carbon potentiometer we commonly use today was invented by Thomas Edison in 1872 at the age of 25. He called this device a \"coiled resistance wire rheostat\". His patent for this device was issued in 1872. Carbon resistors, as said above, are the most commonly used resistors today. They are used in radios to control the volume, in televisions to control picture brightness, contrast, and color response. Some are used in voltage dividers.\n\nThere are many different types of potentiometers. These different types include carbon potentiometers, plastic potentiometers, and wire potentiometers. Carbon potentiometers are the most common potentiometers that we use today because they are inexpensive to make and are easy to put together. Wire potentiometers are the most powerful type out of the three listed above. The wire inside the potentiometer is wound so that it has more power. Plastic potentiometers have the same amount of power that carbon potentiometers do, but are of a higher quality. They are made of a special kind of plastic that conducts electricity just as effectively as carbon potentiometers. It as a better life than carbon potentiometers do.

This wire is called a filament. The filament is the part of the light bulb that produces light.\n\nFilaments in incandescent light bulbs are made of tungsten. When electric current goes through the filament, the filament glows. It may also be known as the electron emitting element in a vacuum tube. To make the bulb produce more light, the filament is usually made of coils of fine wire, also known as the coiled coil.\n\nThe first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon. As the filaments got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. Carbon filaments were heated up by current passing through them. Changing the carbon to graphite changed the lamp to a positive temperature number (rather than a negative) like a metallic conductor. Changing the filament helped stabilize the amount of power it used. In 1902 a tantalum filament was developed which made lamps even more efficient. Tantalum filaments could operate at higher temperatures. In 1906 the tungsten filament was invented. The tungsten filament is a solid cylinder equal to the power of the coiled coil. \n", "id": "347055", "title": "Electrical filament"}

It covered the land of present-day Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania and parts of Estonia, Moldova, Poland, Russia and Ukraine. At its biggest in the 15th century, it was the largest state in Europe. There was great diversity in languages, religion, and cultural heritage.\n\nBringing together of the Lithuanian lands began in the late 12th century. Mindaugas, the first ruler of the Grand Duchy, was crowned as Catholic King of Lithuania in 1253. The pagan state was targeted in the religious crusade by the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order. When Gediminas began to rule, he allowed people to have different religions. This grew under his son Algirdas. In 1386 Jogaila changed the religion to Catholicism. He also made a dynastic union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.\nVytautas the Great grew the land of the Grand Duchy. He also led the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. After Vytautas's death, Lithuania's relationship with the Kingdom of Poland was not good. The Union of Lublin of 1569 created a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In this federation, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had a separate government, laws, army, and treasury.

It was from 5500–4500 BC.\nIt is abbreviated as LBK and is also known as the Linear Band Ware, Linear Ware, Linear Ceramics or Incised Ware culture.\nThe most evidence for the culture is in Central Europe. It is important evidence for early farming in Europe. The pottery after which it was named has simple cups, bowls, vases and jugs, without handles. They were made as kitchen dishes, or for carrying food and drink. The pots had line patterns on them.\n\nThe LBK people lived over a period of 1000 years, long before the Bronze Age and farmed crops like wheat, lentils and peas. They also kept cows and dogs, and sometimes hunted in the forests around them for other animals, like deer.\n\nTheir diet probably didn't contain enough energy for them, as they often did not grow as tall as the people who came before them, or as people do now. This might have also been because of disease, which can spread more easily in a village than it can when people are moving about a lot and not seeing many other people, as people did before the Neolithic. People in the LBK culture probably died quite young, in their twenties or thirties, and many of their children would die before they grew up. \nIf a person was very sick and in a lot of pain, the LBK people might have had access to opium which did not make them better but took away the pain. They probably knew how to make some illnesses better by using wild herbs as medicine.\n\nThe LBK people probably worshiped a mother goddess, who represented the fertility of the land they farmed.\n\nBecause this was before the Bronze or Iron Ages, there were no metal tools, and everything the LBK people had was made from either stone, wood and plants (such as flax which could be made into clothing, and things that could be got from animals (like leather or fur). They even had sickles, which are used for cutting down grass and are half-moon shaped blades with a handle coming off one end; however theirs were made of wood with sharp stone points glued into them for the cutting.\n\nThe LBK people lives in rectangular longhouses, and digging up an area often shows several clusters of about 6 of these long houses. The people in nearby clusters of houses probably knew each other and shared or traded their goods. Their houses were made of wood, mud and straw and they might have let their animals stay in there too.\n\nSome LBK settlements have palisades, or long walls around them, to defend themselves from other people who might attack them. There are also some skeletons of LBK people that look like they died from battle injuries, and some look like they may have even been eaten by cannibals. This shows that there was a lot of war between nearby groups.\n\nImportant sites include Nitra in Slovakia; Bylany in the Czech Republic; Langweiler and Zwenkau in Germany; Brunn am Gebirge in Austria; Elsloo, Sittard, Köln-Lindenthal, Aldenhoven, Flomborn and Rixheim on the Rhine; Lautereck and Hienheim on the upper Danube; Rössen and Sonderhausen on the middle Elbe.\n\nThe Excavations at Oslonki in Poland had a large fortified settlement.

The birds breed in loose colonies of 3−30 nests and they feed in flocks of several dozens.\n\nJohn James Audubon was the first person to formally describe the yellow-billed magpie.

Black-billed and yellow-billed magpie diverged as a result of the glaciation of the Rocky Mountains. The yellow-billed yagpie became isolated in the warm climate of California and adapted to it. The species' population was hit hard by the outbreak of the West Nile Virus after 1999. It is currently not considered as endangered, but the virus and the degradation of its habitat pose a serious threat to some populations.\n", "id": "347492", "title": "Yellow-billed magpie"}

His work ranged from realistic portraits to comic strip-like series of pictures called \"modern moral subjects\". His work is so well known that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".\n\nIn 1731, he completed a series of moral works which made him recognised as a great and original genius. This was \"A Harlot's Progress\". It was first done as paintings, which are now lost. Then the series was published as engravings. In the six scenes, the fate of a country girl who became a prostitute in town is traced out. At the start, the girl meets a bawd, a woman who persuades her to take up prostitution. At her shameful end, the girl dies of venereal disease and there follows a merciless funeral ceremony. The engraving show vivid scenes of drunken and loose behaviour. The series was an immediate success.\n\n\"A Rake's Progress\" showed in eight pictures the reckless life of Tom Rakewell, the son of a rich merchant. Tom wastes all his money on luxurious living, whoring, and gambling, and dies in Bedlam. The original paintings of \"A Rake's Progress\" is displayed in the gallery room at Sir John Soane's Museum, London.\n\nIn 1743–1745 Hogarth painted the six pictures of \"Marriage à-la-mode\" (National Gallery, London), a pointed skewering of upper class 18th century society. This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best planned story serials. Marital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th century Britain. Marriages of convenience, and their unhappiness, came in for particular criticism.\n\nThe series shows the story of the fashionable marriage of the son of bankrupt Earl Squanderfield to the daughter of a rich but miserly city merchant. It starts with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover, and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at Tyburn.\n\nIn the twelve prints of \"Industry and Idleness\" (1747) Hogarth showed the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, the other idle. The industrious apprentice becomes Sheriff and Lord Mayor of London. The idle turns one to crime. In the end, he is executed at Tyburn. The idle apprentice is sent to the gallows by the industrious apprentice himself.\n\nThis shows the work ethic of Protestant England, where those who work hard get rewarded, and those who do not end badly, \n\n\"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" (1751) was his warning on alcoholism. They were two engravings designed to be seen side by side. Hogarth engraved \"Beer Street\" to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage of English beer. On the other side was \"Gin Lane\". This showed the effects of drinking gin which, as a harder liquor, caused more problems for society. People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in \"Beer Street\", while in \"Gin Lane\" they are scrawny, lazy and careless. \n\nThe woman at the front of \"Gin Lane\" who lets her baby fall to its death, echoes the tale of Judith Dufour who strangled her baby so she could sell its clothes for gin money. The prints were published in support of what would become the Gin Act of 1751.\n\nHogarth's friend, the magistrate Henry Fielding, may have got Hogarth to help with propaganda for the Gin Act: \"Beer Street\" and \"Gin Lane\" were issued shortly after Fielding's work \"An Enquiry into the Causes of the Late Increase of Robbers, and Related Writings\".\n\nOther prints were his outcry against inhumanity in \"The Four Stages of Cruelty\" (published 21 February 1751). Hogarth depicts the cruel treatment of animals, and suggests what will happen to people who carry on in this manner. In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled \"Reward of Cruelty\", the murderer is shown being dissected by surgeons after his execution. The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 Act of Parliament. This allowed the public dissection of criminals who had been executed for murder.\n\nHogarth wished to stop \"that barbarous (mean) treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders [makes] the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind\".\n\n\"The Humours of an Election\" is a series of four oil paintings and later engravings by Hogarth. They show what went on in the 1754 election of a Member of Parliament. The oil paintings were created in 1755. \n\nAt this time each constituency elected two MPs, and there was a property qualification for voters, so only a minority of the male population was enfranchised. There was no secret ballot, so bribery and threats were used to raise votes.\n\nThe originals are held by Sir John Soane's Museum, London.\n\nHogarth was also a popular portrait painter. In 1746 he painted actor David Garrick as Richard III. He was paid £200, “which was more,” he wrote, “than any English artist ever received for a single portrait”. In the same year a sketch of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, afterwards beheaded on Tower Hill, had an exceptional success. \n\nHogarth's portrait of his friend, the philanthropic Captain Coram (1740; Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, now Foundling Museum), and his unfinished oil sketch of \"The Shrimp Girl\" (National Gallery, London) are highly regarded. There are also portraits of his wife and his two sisters and of many others.\n", "id": "347505", "title": "William Hogarth"}

He was a Belarusian poet and writer. Kupala is said to be one of the greatest Belarusian-language writers of the 20th century.\n\nKupala was born on July 7, 1882 in Viazynka. His family was of Szlachta origins. Both of his parents were tenant farmers. Kupala received a traditional Belarusian education. He finished his studies in 1898. After the death of his father in 1902, Kupala worked several short-term jobs. These included being a tutor, a shop assistant, and a record keeper.\n\nKupala's first serious try at writing was \"Ziarno\". It was a Polish-language sentimental poem which he completed around 1903–1904. His first Belarusian-language work (\"Мая доля\") was dated July 15, 1904. Kupala's first published poem, \"Мужык\" (\"Peasant\"), was published about a year later. It was in the newspaper on May 11, 1905. Several more poems by Kupala were in the Belarusian-language newspaper \"Nasha Niva\" from 1906 to 1907.\n\nKupala moved from Belarus to Vilnius in 1908. He continued with his career as a poet. The first published collection of his poems, \"Жалейка\" (\"The Little Flute\") made the czarist government mad. The order for Kupala's arrest was ended in 1909.\n\nKupala left for St. Petersburg in 1909. In 1910 he published several works. He left St. Petersburg and returned to Vilnius in 1913. Among those influencing Kupala in the 1910s was Maxim Gorky.\n\nKupala's writing changed to an optimistic tone after the Great October Revolution of 1917. \n\nKupala was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1941 for the poetry collection \"Ад сэрца\" (\"From the Heart\").\n\nIn 1941 he moved to Moscow and then to Tatarstan. But even from there he wrote poems supporting Belarus fighting against Nazi Germany. He died mysteriously in 1942 in Moscow. He fell down the stairwell in Hotel Moskva. The death was said to be accidental. Some people think it was suicide or murder.\n", "id": "347640", "title": "Yanka Kupala"}

It is on the border between Poland and Belarus. It is north of Brest (Belarus) and southeast of Białystok (Poland). It is one of the last and largest remaining parts of the large primeval forest that once went across the European Plain.\n\nThis UNESCO World Heritage Site and Biosphere Reserve are in parts of the Brest Voblast and Hrodna Voblast in Belarus. On the Polish side they are near the town of Białowieża in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. Białowieża means the White Tower in Polish.\n\nThe border between the two countries runs through the forest. There is a border crossing for hikers and cyclists. The forest is home to 800 wisent, the continent's heaviest land animals. \n\nOn the Belarusian side the Biosphere Reserve is . The National Park and World Heritage Site are . The Belavezhskaya Pushcha headquarters at Kamieniuki, Belarus has a laboratory and a zoo. The zoo has wisent, konik (a semi-wild horse), wild boar, moose, and other animals. There is also a small museum, restaurant, snack bar and hotel. Because of the lack of facilities and having few tourists in the country, few foreign tourists visit the Belarusian Pushcha each year.\n\nOn the Polish side, part of the Białowieża Forest is protected as the Białowieża National Park (Białowieski Park Narodowy). It has a general area of about . There is also the Białowieża Glade (Polana Białowieska). This has several buildings first owned by the tsars of Russia. The tsars were the last private owners of the forest (from 1888 to 1917) when the whole forest was in the Russian Empire. A hotel, restaurant and parking areas are there. Guided tours into the strictly controlled areas of the park can be arranged on foot or by horse-drawn carriage. About 200,000 tourists visit the Polish part of the forest each year. Activities are: bird watching with local ornithologist, watching bisons in their natural environment, and sledge and carriage rides with a bonfire. The popular village of Białowieża is in the forest.\n\nThe forest has a number of large, ancient pedunculate oaks (\"Quercus robur\"), some of which are individually named. Trunk circumferences are measured at breast height, above the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolish environmentalists say that logging is threatening the flora and fauna in the forest, including species of rare birds. Poland's state forestry board is saying that it is being done for protection and for ecological reasons.\n", "id": "347743", "title": "Białowieża Forest"}

It was built in honor of the Roman Senator Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, known as Celsus.\n\nCelsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth. Celsus was Consul in 92 AD, Governor of the Roman province of Asia in 115 AD, and a rich and popular local citizen. He was a native of nearby Sardis and amongst the first Greek men to become a consul in the Roman Empire. He is honoured both as a Greek and a Roman on the library itself. \n\nThe library was built by his son, Gaius Julius Aquila (Consul 110 AD), and completed in 135 AD.\n\nThe library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. Celsus is buried in a sarcophagus beneath the library, in the main entrance. which is both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument to him. It was unusual to be buried within a library or even within city limits, so this was a special honour for Celsus.\n\nThe library was built in Ephesus, a Greek city in Asia Minor.\nThe building is important as one of few remaining examples of an ancient Roman-influenced library. It also shows that public libraries were built not only in Rome itself but throughout the Roman Empire. \n\nThe interior of the library and all its books were destroyed by fire in the devastating earthquake that struck the city in 262. Only the facade survived. About 400 AD, the library was used for other purposes. The facade was completely destroyed by a later earthquake, likely in the late Byzantine period.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the facade was restored. It now serves as a prime example of Roman public architecture. The building had a single hall which faced east toward the morning sun, as Vitruvius advised, to benefit early risers. Beside the entrances are four pairs of Ionic columns on pedestals. A set of Corinthian columns stands directly above the first set, adding to the height of the building. It is thought there once may have been a third set of columns. \n\nThis type of facade with inset frames and niches for statues is like that found in ancient Greek theatres, and so is described as \"scenographic\".\n", "id": "348075", "title": "Library of Celsus"}

It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch. It may also contain oils and protein.\n\nThe endosperm of cereal plants is an important source of nutrition for humans. Wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread. With whole wheat bread the bran (cover of seed) is also in the flour. Barley endosperm is the main source for beer production. Other examples of edible endosperms are coconut 'meat' and coconut 'water', and corn, including popcorn. Some plants, like the orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds.\n\nPrimitive (basal) flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and big endosperms. The evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with seeds with little or no endosperm. In more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is not developed or consumed before the seed matures. In these plants, the cotyledons contain the food reserve.\n\nEndosperm is formed when the two sperm nuclei inside a pollen grain reach the inside of an ovule or embryo sac. One sperm nucleus fertilizes the egg, forming a zygote, while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the two polar nuclei at the center of the embryo sac. This makes the first endosperm cell, which develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm is an organism distinct from the embryo (though placed next to it in the seed). \n\nAbout 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are polyploid. These are typically triploid (containing three sets of chromosomes) but can vary widely from diploid (2n) to 15n.\n", "id": "348148", "title": "Endosperm"}

She has written both fiction and essays about race and gender. She is best known for the novel \"The Color Purple\" (1982). She won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for the novel.\n\nWalker is an African American who was born in Eatonton, Georgia. She is the youngest of eight children. Her parents were Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Lou Tallulah Grant. Her father, who was, in her words, \"wonderful at math but a terrible farmer,\" earned only $300 a year from sharecropping and dairy farming. Her mother added to the family income by working as a maid. She worked 11 hours a day for USD $17 per week to help pay for Alice to attend college.\n\nIn 1952, Walker was accidentally hit in the right eye by a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate help. By the time they reached a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. She felt like an outcast and turned for comfort to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class.\n\nAfter high school, Walker went to Spelman College in Atlanta. She later moved to Sarah Lawrence College near New York City, graduating in 1965. Walker became interested in the U.S. civil rights movement. This was partly due to the influence of activist Howard Zinn, who was one of her professors at Spelman College. Walker returned to the South where she became involved with voter registration drives, campaigns for welfare rights and children's programs in Mississippi.\n\nAlice Walker met Martin Luther King Jr. when she was a student at Spelman College. Walker credits King for her decision to return to the American South as an activist for the Civil Rights Movement. She marched with hundreds of thousands in August in the 1963 March on Washington. As a young adult, she volunteered to register black voters in Georgia and Mississippi.\n\nOn March 8, 2003, International Women's Day, on the eve of the Iraq War, Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Terry Tempest Williams were arrested with 24 others for crossing a police line. This was during an anti-war protest rally outside the White House.\n\nIn March 2009, Alice Walker traveled to Gaza in response to the Gaza War. She was with a group of 60 other female activists from the anti-war group Code Pink. Their purpose was to deliver aid, to meet with NGOs and residents, and to ask Israel and Egypt to open their borders into Gaza.\n\nIn 1965, Walker met Melvyn Roseman Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967 in New York City. Later that year the couple moved to Jackson, Mississippi. They became \"the first legally married inter-racial couple in Mississippi\". They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the Ku Klux Klan. The couple had a daughter Rebecca in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced on friendly terms in 1976.\n\nWalker and her daughter grew apart. Rebecca felt herself to be more of \"a political symbol... than a cherished daughter\". She published a memoir called \"Black White and Jewish\", about the complexities of her parents' relationship and her childhood. Rebecca recalls her teenage years when her mother would go to her far-off writing studio while “I was left with money to buy my own meals and lived on a diet of fast food.” Since the birth of Rebecca’s son Tenzin, her mother has not spoken to her. Rebecca has learned that she was cut out of her mother’s will in favor of a distant cousin.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Walker was involved in a romance with singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman.\n\nIn 2011 shooting began on \"Beauty in Truth\", a documentary film about Walker's life directed by Pratibha Parmar.\n\nWalker is a feminist.

Some of the characters he created are Sam Spade (\"The Maltese Falcon\"), Nick and Nora Charles (\"The Thin Man\"), and the Continental Op (\"Red Harvest\" and \"The Dain Curse\").\n\nIn addition to the large influence his novels and stories had on film, Hammett \"is now widely regarded as one of the finest mystery writers of all time\". \"Time\" magazine included Hammett's 1929 novel \"Red Harvest\" on a list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.\n\nHammett was born on a farm in St. Mary's County, in Maryland. His parents were Richard Thomas Hammett and Anne Bond Dashiell. Hammett was baptized a Catholic. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. \"Sam,\" as he was known before he began writing, left school when he was 13 years old. He had several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for the Pinkertons from 1915 to February 1922. He took time off to serve in World War I. He did not like the agency's role in union strike-breaking.\n\nHammett enlisted in the United States Army in 1918. He became ill with the Spanish flu and later got tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient in Cushman Hospital, Tacoma, Washington. While there he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he later married.\n\nHammett and Dolan were married, and they had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 15 October 1921) and Josephine (born in 1926). Because of Hammett's tuberculosis, Josephine and the children could not live with him full time. Josephine rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon ended. He continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.\n\nHammett used his experiences as a Pinkerton operative. Hammett said: \"All my characters were based on people I've known personally, or known about.\"\n\nHammett wrote most of his detective fiction during the time he was living in San Francisco (the 1920s). Specific streets and locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1930 Dashiell was romantically involved with Nell Martin, an author of short stories and several novels. He dedicated \"The Glass Key\" to her, and in turn, she dedicated her novel \"Lovers Should Marry\" to Hammett.\n\nIn 1931, Hammett started a 30-year affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. This relationship was shown in the film \"Julia\". Hammett was played by Jason Robards and Hellman by Jane Fonda.\n\nHe wrote his final novel in 1934. He spent the rest of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong anti-fascist through the 1930s. In 1937 he joined the American Communist Party. \n\nIn early 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. He was a disabled veteran of World War I, and a victim of tuberculosis, but he was allowed to join. He served in the Aleutian Islands. He edited an Army newspaper. He also got emphysema. .\n\nAfter the war, Hammett returned to political activism. He was elected President of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946.\n\nDuring the 1950s he was investigated by Congress. This was part of Senator Joseph McCarthy's attempt to identify Communists. He refused to share information and was blacklisted.\n\n A lifetime's heavy drinking of alcohol and cigarettes made Hammett's tuberculosis worse. As the years of the 1950s went on, Hammett became \"a hermit\". Hammett no longer could live alone, so the last four years of his life he spent with Hellman. On January 10, 1961, Hammett died in New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital, of lung cancer. He had been diagnosed just two months before. As a veteran of two World Wars, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nAll the novels except \"The Thin Man\" were originally in three, four, or five parts in various magazines.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "348215", "title": "Dashiell Hammett"}

It is based on the comic strip \"Dennis the Menace\" by Hank Ketcham. The four-season series aired from 1959 to 1963 on CBS. The show stars Jay North as Dennis Mitchell, Herbert Anderson as his father Henry, Gloria Henry as his mother Alice, Billy Booth as his friend Tommy Anderson, and Jeannie Russell as his friend Margaret Wade. Dennis wore the same costume in every episode: a striped tee-shirt, a pair of bib overalls with a slingshot in the back pocket, a pair of sneakers, and an enormous blond cowlick. Viewers complained about the slingshot and it was eventually removed. The bizarre costume put Dennis outside the realistic \"mise en scene\" of the show, making it difficult to \"relate\" to him in spite of North's brilliant performance. Margaret had the same problem with her ringlets, eyeglasses, and ever-present patent leather shoes. These clothes were not the sort of things kids were wearing during the shows years on the air.\n\nMargaret wanted to marry Dennis. This was a running gag in both the comic strip and the television show. She pushed a baby carriage through the neighborhood. \"Playing house\" was something she pressured Dennis to do. When Dennis needed a penny or two, she gave it to him but only after he promised to play house with her. If he turned her down, she would hit him with one of the rag dolls in the baby carriage and prance on her way. \n\nOther players in the show are Joseph Kearns as Dennis's neighbor George Wilson, Sylvia Field as George's wife Martha, and Gale Gordon as Mr. Wilson's brother John. George Wilson was a retired fussy sort of man who gardened, collected coins, did household fixit jobs, and watched birds. Many episodes were about Dennis making a mess of Mr. Wilson's hobbies. Dennis's comic strip dog Ruff was cut from the TV story, but Mr. Wilson was given a little dog named Fremont. Maud Prickett, Irene Tedrow, Dub Taylor, Mary Wickes, and other familiar 1950s TV faces showed up often as minor characters. Ron Howard appeared in several episodes as Dennnis' friend Stewart while also playing Opie Taylor on \"The Andy Griffith Show\".\n\n\"Dennis the Menace\" is about a happy little (but trouble-prone) middle class boy named Dennis Mitchell. He would like to be helpful but his attempts always end in disasters. He bothers a lot of people, but mostly his neighbor George Wilson. Actor Joseph Kearns played George Wilson but died while the show was in production. Gale Gordon joined the show as John Wilson, George's brother. Viewers were told that George and his TV wife Martha were taking a long journey and that George's brother John would be living in and taking care of their house. The show ended in 1963 when North became too old (11 years) to play the part of Dennis.\n", "id": "348287", "title": "Dennis the Menace (TV series)"}

The spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early close to the ice edge. The fresh water from the melting ice makes up a water layer on top of the sea water. The phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton. The animals that eat zooplankton include young cod, capelin, polar cod, whales, and Little Auk. The capelin is a main food for animals such as the North-East Arctic cod, harp seals, and seabirds such as Common Guillemot and Brunnich's Guillemot.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348401", "text": "Norwegian Sea\n\nThe Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea in the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of Norway. It is between the North Sea and the Greenland Sea. It joins the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Barents Sea to the northeast. In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. To the North, the Jan Mayen Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea.\n\nUnlike many other seas, most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a continental shelf. It is at a great depth of about two kilometres on average. Rich deposits of oil and natural gas are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially. The coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic for spawning. The warm North Atlantic Current gives stable and high water temperatures, so that unlike the Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice-free throughout the year.\n\nThe Norwegian Sea is a transition zone between boreal and Arctic conditions. It has flora and fauna of both regions. The southern limit of many Arctic species runs through the North Cape, Iceland, and the center of the Norwegian Sea. The northern limit of boreal species is near the borders of the Greenland Sea with the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. These areas overlap. Some species like the scallop \"Chlamys islandica\" and capelin tend to live in this area between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.\n\nMost of the aquatic life in the Norwegian Sea is in the upper layers. Estimates for the entire North Atlantic are that only 2% of biomass is at depths below 1,000 metres and only 1.2% occurs near the sea floor.\n\nThe blooming of the phytoplankton is dominated by chlorophyll and peaks around 20 May. The major phytoplankton forms are diatoms, in particular the genus \"Thalassiosira\" and \"Chaetoceros\". After the spring bloom the haptophytes of the genus \"Phaecocystis pouchetti\" become dominant.\n\nZooplankton is mostly copepods \"Calanus finmarchicus\" and \"Calanus hyperboreus\". \"C. hyperboreus\" is strongest in the Arctic waters. They are the main diet of most marine predators. The most important krill species are \"Meganyctiphanes norvegica\", \"Thyssanoessa inermis\", and \"Thyssanoessa longicaudata\". In contrast to the Greenland Sea, there are a lot of calcareous plankton (Coccolithophore and Globigerinida). \n\nShrimp of the species \"Pandalus borealis\" play an important role in the diet of fish, particularly cod and blue whiting. A special feature of the Norwegian Sea is large coral reefs of \"Lophelia pertusa\", which provide shelter to various fish species. \n\nThe Norwegian coastal waters are the most important spawning ground of the herring populations of the North Atlantic, and the hatching occurs in March. The eggs float to the surface and are washed off the coast by the northward current. Whereas a small herring population remains in the fjords and along the northern Norwegian coast, the majority spends the summer in the Barents Sea, where it feeds on the rich plankton. Upon reaching puberty, herring returns to the Norwegian Sea. The herring stock varies greatly between years. It increased in the 1920s owing to the milder climate and then collapsed in the following decades until 1970; the decrease was, however, at least partly caused by overfishing. The biomass of young hatched herring declined from 11 million tonnes in 1956 to almost zero in 1970; that affected the ecosystem not only of the Norwegian Sea but also of the Barents Sea.\nEnforcement of environmental and fishing regulations has resulted in partial recovery of the herring populations since 1987. This recovery was accompanied by a decline of capelin and cod stocks. While the capelin benefited from the reduced fishing, the temperature rise in the 1980s and competition for food with the herring resulted in a near disappearance of young capelin from the Norwegian Sea. Meanwhile, the elderly capelin population was quickly fished out. This also reduced the population of cod – a major predator of capelin – as the herring was still too small in numbers to replace the capelin in the cod's diet.\n\nBlue whiting (\"Micromesistius poutassou\") has benefited from the decline of the herring and capelin stocks as it assumed the role of major predator of plankton. The blue whiting spawns near the British Isles. The sea currents carry their eggs to the Norwegian Sea, and the adults also swim there in order to benefit from the food supply. The young spend the summer and the winter until February in Norwegian coastal waters and then return to the warmer waters west of Scotland. The Norwegian Arctic cod mostly occurs in the Barents Sea and at the Svalbard Archipelago. In the rest of the Norwegian Sea, it is found only during the reproduction season, at the Lofoten Islands, whereas \"Pollachius virens\" and haddock spawn in the coastal waters. Mackerel is an important commercial fish. The coral reefs are populated by different species of the genus \"Sebastes\".\n\nLarge numbers of minke, humpback, sei, and orca whales are present in the Norwegian Sea. White-beaked dolphins are in the coastal waters. Orcas and some other whales visit the sea in the summer months for feeding. They follow the herring schools within the sea. With a total population of about 110,000, minke whales are by far the most common whales in the sea. They are hunted by Norway and Iceland, with a quota of about 1,000 per year in Norway. In contrast to the past, mostly they are hunted for their meat, rather than fat and oil.\n\nThe bowhead whale used to be in the area. It almost disappeared from the Norwegian Sea after intense whaling in the 19th century, and was temporarily extinct in the entire North Atlantic. Similarly, the blue whale used to form large groups between Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, but is hardly present nowadays. Seeing northern bottlenose whales in the Norwegian Sea is rare. Other large animals of the sea are hooded and harp seals and squid.\n\nImportant waterfowl species of the Norwegian Sea are puffin, kittiwake and guillemot. \n", "id": "348401", "title": "Norwegian Sea"}

It covers over two million square kilometers, bordered on the east and northeast by Alaska, on the west by Russia's Siberia and Kamchatka Peninsula, on the south by the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands and on the far north by the Bering Strait. The Strait connects the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean's Chukchi Sea. Bristol Bay is the part of the Bering Sea which separates the Alaska Peninsula from mainland Alaska. The Bering Sea is named for Vitus Bering, a Danish navigator in Russian service, who in 1728 was the first European to systematically explore it.\n\nThe Bering Sea ecosystem includes resources belonging to the United States and Russia, as well as international waters in the middle of the sea.\n\nMost scientists believe that during the most recent ice age, sea level was low enough to let humans and other animals move on foot from Asia to North America across what is now the Bering Strait. This is commonly called the \"Bering land bridge\" and is believed by some—though not all— to be the first point of entry of humans into the Americas.\n\nIslands of the Bering Sea include:\n\nRegions of the Bering Sea include:\n\nThe Bering Sea has 16 submarine canyons including the largest submarine canyon in the world, Zhemchug Canyon.\n\nThe Bering Sea is home to some of the world's most interesting wildlife. This sea supports many endangered whale species including Bowhead Whale, Blue Whale, Fin Whale, Sei Whale, Humpback Whale, Sperm Whale and the rarest in the world, the North Pacific Right Whale. Other marine mammals include walrus, Steller Sea Lion, Northern Fur Seal, Beluga, Orca and polar bear.\n\nThe Bering Sea is very important to the seabirds of the world. Over 30 species of seabirds and about 20 million individuals breed in the Bering Sea region. Seabird species include Tufted Puffins, the endangered Short-tailed Albatross, Spectacled Eider, and Red-legged Kittiwakes.\n\nTwo Bering Sea species, the Steller's Sea Cow and Spectacled Cormorant, are extinct because of overexploitation by man. In addition, a small subspecies of Canada goose, the Bering Canada goose is extinct due to overhunting and introduction of rats to their breeding islands.\n\nThe Bering Sea supports many species of fish. At least 419 species of fish have been reported from the Bering Sea. Some species of fish support large and valuable commercial fisheries. Commercial fish species include 6 species of Pacific Salmon, Alaska Pollock, Red King Crab, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, Yellowfin Sole, Pacific ocean perch and sablefish.\n", "id": "348427", "title": "Bering Sea"}

The relative proportions is what picks up indications of a problem.\n\nSometimes the doctor will take a very small piece of the body out, to look at it. This is called a \"biopsy\". Bone marrow is where new blood is made in the body.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348736", "text": "Global dimming\n\nGlobal dimming is the slow decrease in the irradiance at the Earth's surface. Irradiance is the power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area. One of the possible causes of global dimming is pollution. It affects the water cycle by decreasing evaporation and by decreasing the rain in some areas. Global dimming also causes the earth to cool down. This cooling effect may cover the effect of greenhouse gases caused by global warming.\n\nAir pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become the core for cloud droplets. Water droplets in clouds fuse around the pollutants. More pollutants create clouds with more number of smaller droplets. The smaller droplets make clouds to reflect more light. This causes more sunlight to be reflected back into space and less light reaches the Earth's surface.\n\nClouds stop the heat from both going in and out from the earth. This process is complex and it changes according to the time, location and the height above the sea level. During the day, more sunlight stops from going in. This cools down the Earth. During the night, the heat in earth stops from going out. This slows down the heat from going out the earth.\n\nVolcanic ash can also stops the sunlight from going in and out from the earth. Decreases in the earth's temperatures are observed after large volcanic eruptions. Some examples are the eruptions of Mount Agung in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico, 1983), Ruiz (Colombia, 1985), and Mount Pinatubo (Philippines, 1991). Even for large eruptions, the ash clouds do not stay for a long time.\n\nGlobal dimming is harming the water cycle of the earth. It reduces the rain, which is very important for the fresh water. In 2001, researchers did a study at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The research suggested that the pollutants have a bad effect on the water cycle. Another global dimming event happened in 2006 in northern hemisphere during hurricane season. The NASA study found that the big dust storms happened in Sahara Desert during June and July cause the dust to go over the Atlantic Ocean. The dust forms a cover over the ocean and causes it to cool down. This reduces the hurricanes' development.\n", "id": "348736", "title": "Global dimming"}

Some types of interior design are residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, and spatial branding.\n\nThe designer tries to help customers look after their needs at home, their personality, and style and goals which make the home more comfortable. The designer should dose what the home needs, such as security and convenience. \n\nCommercial interior designers design public spaces such as office buildings, community centers, museums, hotels, stores, warehouses, and libraries. In commercial design the designer have to create an environment that includes function and aesthetics. A commercial interior designer's work includes selecting paint colors, choosing artwork, accounting for acoustics and lighting, picking appropriate furniture, and placing all these together in the manner most appropriate to the venue. Recently commercial interior designers have worked with indoor plants and agro-inventions such as the Grofie Greenwall, which allows firms to bring a tropical forest, vegetable or herb garden right into the office, in order to reconnect office workers with nature. \n\nHospitality designers design the places which have any relationship between guest and host such as hotels. This includes the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers, resorts, membership clubs, conventions, attractions, special events, and other services for travelers and tourists.\n\nHealthcare design is related to hospitals and how to make a good space to make the patient and staff very comfortable. Healthcare designers compare the evidence-based design with evidence-based medicine; that knowledge can help ensures that future healthcare facilities are built to improve clinical outcomes. In addition deeper understanding of the relationship between the built environment and quality of care will help ensure that healthcare facilities are designed to meet the diverse needs of patients, families, and staff.\n\nUniversal design is the design for all people around the world and to creating environments and products those are usable by all people to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThere are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions, to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos and visitor centers.

They are most common in Australia and New Guinea, but are also found in New Zealand, the Pacific islands as far east as Samoa and Tonga, and the islands to the north and west of New Guinea. Bali, on the other side of the Wallace Line, has a single species.\n\nHoneyeaters and the Australian chats (Epthianura) make up the family Meliphagidae. In total there are 182 species in 42 genera. About half of them live in Australia, and many of the others are from New Guinea. Although honeyeaters look and behave much like other nectar-feeding birds around the world (such as the sunbirds and flowerpeckers), they are not related. \n\nThere is an important partnership between honeyeaters and Australian flowering plants. A great many Australian plants are fertilised by honeyeaters, particularly the Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, and Epacridaceae. It is known that the honeyeaters are important in New Zealand as well, and scientists believe they are just as important in other areas.\n\nUnlike the hummingbirds of America, honeyeaters do not usually hover (beat their wings fast to stay in the same air space). However, smaller members of the family do hover hummingbird-style to collect nectar from time to time. Usually honeyeaters move quickly from perch to perch in the outer leaves, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside. Many honeyeaters have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, covered with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then squeezes liquid out when the bill is closed. \n\nAs well as nectar, all or nearly all honeyeaters take insects and other small creatures, usually by catching them in the air, sometimes by picking them off plants. A few of the larger species, such as the white-eared honeyeater, and the strong-billed honeyeater of Tasmania, search under bark for insects. Many species also eat fruit, and a small number eat large amounts of fruit, particularly in tropical rainforests and in semi-arid scrubland. The painted honeyeater is a mistletoe specialist. Most, however, live on a diet of nectar and insects. In general, the honeyeaters with long, fine bills eat more nectar, the shorter-billed species less so, but even specialised nectar eaters like the spinebills take extra insects to add protein to their diet when they are breeding.\n\nThe movements of honeyeaters are poorly understood. Many follow the flowering of favourite food plants. Arid zone species appear to travel further and less predictably than those of the more fertile areas. It seems probable that no single explanation will emerge: the general rule for honeyeater movements is that there is no general rule.\n\n\n", "id": "348976", "title": "Honeyeater"}

They live on the skin, in the saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. They include bacteria, archaea, fungi and single-celled eukaryotes ('protozoa'). Everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body. The human body has about 100 trillion cells, and carries about ten times as many microorganisms \"in the intestines alone\".\n\nThe microbiome is \"the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space\". The term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg. He thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important. Many scientific articles distinguish \"microbiome\" and \"microbiota\" to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves, respectively. However, by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous. \n\nSome of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are just symbionts: they live with us. Those which are expected to be present are members of the \"normal flora\". Under normal circumstances they do not cause disease, but may even help our health. Studies in 2009 asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota. This is certainly the case with gut flora.\nAlthough \"flora\" refers to plants rather than bacteria, the term 'gut flora' is widely used and familiar to biologists. 'Biota' refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem. The term 'microbiota' is best for bacteria and other microorganisms, but no doubt 'flora' will often be used. \n\nThe microbes being discussed are generally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally); they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts.\n\nResearchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single-celled organisms called archaea. They include methanogens which produce methane and may cause flatulence.\n\n", "id": "349006", "title": "Human microbiome"}

The text of the Gospels is mostly taken from the Vulgate bible, and it has several passages from earlier versions of the Bible, such as the Vetus Latina. It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy. and Ireland's finest national treasure.\n\nThe illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells are outstanding. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of the art of the British Isles. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, and Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements have Christian symbolism.\n\nThe manuscript today is 340 folios (separate sheets, written on one side). Since 1953, it has been bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum. There are ten full-page illustrations, and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures. The writing of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The colours used were gathered from many substances, some of which were imports from distant lands.\n\nThe manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells which was its home for centuries. Today, it is on permanent display at the library of Trinity College, Dublin. The library usually displays two of the four volumes at a time, one showing a major illustration and the other showing a typical text page.\n\nIn 1951, the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first facsimile of the Book of Kells. Most of the pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, and the edition also had 48 colour reproductions, including all of the full-page decorations. \n\nUnder licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, the art publishers Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition had all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a section of text page ornamentation, with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour.\n\nBy 1986, Swiss publisher Faksimile-Verlag had a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it. They got permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, on the site of the original monastery.\n\nIn 1994, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells, with 110 colour images of the manuscript.\n\nA digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006.\n", "id": "349160", "title": "Book of Kells"}

His music Mixing elements of dancehall, reggae, hip hop and R&B.\n\nDeScribe was born in Sydney, Australia, to a Hasidic Jewish family. His mother, Devorah Hasofer, is a known singer/songwriter who has released four albums and mostly performs in the Hasidic communities in Australia and Israel. He is a drummer from the age of five and in his preteen years he participated in the recordings of his mother's albums and performed with her as a special guest. \n\nAt the age of 14, Hasofer's parents sent him to Jerusalem to study in a yeshiva. He spent a year in the yeshiva. After that he stayed in Israel, \"left the Jewish way of life and did a lot of stupid things.\" Many of the things he did were illegal. His family's move to Beitar Illit in 1998 did not help stop his wildness.\n\nIn 2000, at age 17, DeScribe joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as a combat sharpshooter (a kind of semi professional sniper). He served for three years at the height of the Second Intifada. He saw intense action on almost a daily basis. After being discharged, he stayed in Israel. He organized a concert tour featuring affiliates of the Wu-Tang Clan Remedy and Killah Priest, gaining an inside view of the hip hop scene. \n\nAround 2004, he began to feel a strong desire to leave his bad lifestyle and return to a religious one. “I started to change the way I thought and behaved and in Judaism I found something that was real that brought happiness to a dark place in my life,” he has said. In 2006, he moved to Brooklyn to attend Tifferet Menachem. There he was given permission to set up a music studio inside the yeshiva.\n\nIn 2008, after an early music video was picked up by the Israeli media, he was invited to play the Highline Ballroom in New York with Perry Farrell. Shortly after that, he had met Rohan Marley (Bob Marley’s son) by chance on the streets of New York City. Marley later asked DeScribe to create the theme song for his company, Marley Coffee. Marley Coffee supports environmental and social justice causes in Jamaica and around the world. DeScribe came up with \"Livin’ for the Grind,\" inspired by Bob Marley’s 1962 single \"One Cup of Coffee.\"\n\nDeScribe’s 2010 single “Harmony” was celebrated as a great message for unity and racial harmony by Brooklyn borough president Marty Markowitz, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Crown Heights riot.\n\nIn early 2011, DeScribe worked with Matisyahu on the dancehall track \"Pure Soul\". The proceeds from the song benefit The Friendship Circle, a nonprofit organization that helps children with disabilities.\n\n\"My music is about unity,\" DeScribe has said, \"and we all have one God whether we are Jewish, Christian or Muslim.

The system also occurs sporadically in some spider mites, coleopterans (bark beetles) and rotifers. \n\nIn this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are haploid. \n\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. Most importantly, the relatedness between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. This means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems. It is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved. Whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate.\n\nThe thing to remember is that in normal sexual reproduction, the father has two sets of chromosomes, and crossing over takes place between the chromatids of each pair during the meiosis which produces the sperm. Therefore, \"the sperms are not identical\", because in each chromosome of a pair there will be different alleles at many of the loci. But when the father is haploid \"all the sperm will be identical\" (except for a small number where gene mutations have taken place in the germline). So, \"as long as all the female queen mates only with one male\", all the female offspring will inherit the male's chromosome 100% intact. In fact in Hymenoptera, the males almost all produce enough sperm to last the female for a whole lifetime.\n\nAnother feature of the haplodiploidy system is that lethal and deleterious alleles will be removed from the population rapidly because they will automatically be expressed in the males.\n", "id": "349212", "title": "Haplodiploidy"}

The beds were laid down 125 million years ago (mya) in the Sihetun area, near Beipiao City, in western Liaoning Province. \n\nThe most significant, and highly unusual, characteristic of this dinosaur is its apparent adaptation to an herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle. Its name refers to its rodent-like front teeth, which show wear patterns commonly found in plant-eating dinosaurs.\n\nThe initial description of \"Incisivosaurus\" showed that the skull, about 10 cm in length (4 inches), had the most complete dentition known for any oviraptorosaur. Their cladistic analysis indicated that \"Incisivosaurus\" lies at the base of the oviraptorosaurs, making it more basal than \"Caudipteryx\" and \"Oviraptor\". The distinguishing skeletal features of \"Incisivosaurus\", include a long snout that made up about half the total length of the skull, a slender lower jaw with a long fenestra (opening), and its distinctive, large, flattened front teeth. In addition to these unique features, \"Incisivosaurus\" shared many traits with more typical oviraptorosaurs, so it is classified in that group. \n\nSeveral features, including its numerous teeth (most advanced oviraptorids were toothless), show that it was a primitive member of the group. Several features of the skull are similar to the therizinosaurs, another theropod group that was probably herbivorous.\n\nIn 2009 the holotype skull was scanned and analyzed in three dimensions. The results indicated that \"Incisivosaurus\" had fewer bird-like air spaces in the skull bones than later oviraptorosaurs did. It also found that \"Incisivosaurus\" had reduced olfactory lobes and expanded optic lobes, like ornithomimids. These features of oviraptorosaurs were similar to those of birds. \n\n\"Incisivosaurus\" is assumed to have been feathered like most other maniraptoran theropods. Its total body length has been estimated at just under 1 meter (3 ft.). It is possible that \"Incisivosaurus\" is the same species as \"Protarchaeopteryx\", though more fossil specimens are needed before the two can be directly compared.\n", "id": "349248", "title": "Incisivosaurus"}

The hamlet was designed in 1783 by Richard Mique and Hubert Robert as a play space for Queen Marie Antoinette. It was here that she played the simple country girl in a straw hat and plain dress with her friends. About twelve structures form the hamlet. Some were working farm structures and some were structures for the Queen's amusement and use such as the mill. The hamlet fell into neglect after the French Revolution. Restoration was undertaken in the 1990s, and the hamlet is now open to the public.\n\nPicturesque hamlets such as Le Hameau de la Reine were not unknown in 18th century France. The Prince de Condé had one at Chantilly and there was a village at Méréveille. The creation of these villages was influenced by the natural philosophy extolled by Rousseau and the country life genre paintings of painters Greuze, Le Nain, and Chardin. Le Hameau was designed for Queen Marie Antoinette by her favorite architect Richard Mique and the painter Hubert Robert. The painters Tolède and Dardignac painted thousands of little cracks and false half-timbering in the structures to suggest picturesque humbleness, poverty, and age. All the structures in the hamlet were more or less modelled upon similar structures in Normandy and Flanders. Construction on the hamlet started in 1783 and was completed in four or five years.\n\nThe purpose of the hamlet was to give the Queen a place to play at the simple life, far from the busy French court. The hamlet is set among meadows at the edge of a lake created by waters channeled from Marly. The structures are divided into two groups. One group was used by the Queen for her pleasure and amusement. The other group was used for farm work. The farm produced milk and eggs for the Queen. Cheeses were made in the dairy. The Queen tasted this produce in a marble room. \n\nThe structures are:\n\nThe Queen loved the simple life. It was a break from the stiffness of the court. She played at being a peasant girl in the hamlet. She wore plain muslin dresses and a straw hat. She ate the produce from the farm. Only her dearest friends were allowed into the hamlet. There was a ball room (a room for holding dances) and a billiards room. She wanted her children to experience real animals and kept two cows at the hamlet, Blondie and Brownie. Both were washed and brushed before a visit from the Queen. Ducks, geese, and sheep were kept at the hamlet as well as a billygoat from Switzerland.\n\nThe French people believed the Queen was selfishly amusing herself at a time when France was nearing a national crisis. After the French Revolution, the hamlet was deserted and fell into neglect. Restoration was conducted in the 1990s. The Queen's Hamlet is now open to the public.\n\n", "id": "349298", "title": "Hameau de la Reine (Versailles)"}

The ballet was first presented on 18 December 1892 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. The music was written by Tchaikovsky and the dance was designed by Lev Ivanov. The Sugar Plum Fairy was first danced by Antonietta Dell'Era and the Prince by Pavel Gerdt. The \"pas\" is sometimes danced outside the ballet and is sometimes danced in ballet competitions.\n\nThe \"pas de deux\" is structured in four sections (or movements): first, an \"Andante maestoso\"; second, a Tarantella for the male dancer; third a dance for the ballerina called the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"; and fourth and finally a quick, energetic movement for both dancers.\n\nMarius Petipa, Ballet Master at the Mariinsky Theatre, wanted music \"colossal in effect\" for the opening \"Andante maestoso\" movement. The music is made up of descending (falling) scales for cellos. A second, contrasting section is written for oboe and bass clarinet. The music ends with a great climax for trombones. The musical theme of the \"Andante maestoso\" is similar to Tchaikovsky's death themes in the Fifth and Sixth symphonies.\n\nThe \"Andante maestoso\" movement used a device on the stage called a \"reika\". This was a small platform or wagon set in a track. It was operated under the stage. In \"The Nutcracker\", the Sugar Plum Fairy stepped upon a scarf that Prince Coqueluche had placed on the \"reika\". The Prince pulled the scarf and, as the \"reika\" was moved from one side of the stage to the other, it seemed that the Sugar Plum Fairy was lighter than air. \n\n", "id": "349314", "title": "The Nutcracker pas de deux"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349469", "text": "Ancient Greek wrestling\n\nGreek wrestling was a grappling combat sport practiced by the Ancient Greeks. A wrestler's objective (aim, goal) was to throw his opponent to the ground from a standing position. A point (or fall) was scored when a wrestler's back or shoulders touched the ground. Three points were needed to win a match. Holds were restricted to the upper body. Unlike modern wrestling, there were no weight divisions or time limits. As a result, the sport was dominated by large strong men and boys who could defeat smaller but more skillful opponents. These structures were built at public expense. Large cities sometimes had several palaestrae. Wrestlers trained and competed in the nude. The sport was the first added to the Ancient Olympic Games that was not a footrace. Two ancient Greek wrestlers that are remembered today are Leontiskos of Messene and Milo of Croton. Leontiskos is infamous for winning the Olympics after breaking his opponent's fingers, and Milo is famous for winning five Olympic championships. Wrestling was a popular subject for Greek sculpture, painting, and literature. \n\nGreek wrestling was known to the ancients as \"orthe pale\" (\"upright (or erect) wrestling\"). Legend says that Theseus of Athens invented wrestling. The wrestler's objective (aim) was to throw his opponent to the ground from a standing position. Holds were restricted to the upper body and pinning an opponent to the ground was unknown. Wrestling on the ground was permitted only in the sports known to the Greeks as \"kato pale\" (\"ground wrestling\") and \"pankration\". \n\nA point was scored for a fall. A fall occurred when a wrestler's back or shoulders touched the ground. Three points were required to win a match. Wrestling was less rough than the pankration and required less space. As a result, it was the most popular sport among Greek athletes. It was an event in the pentathlon (and could be the deciding event) but it was a separate event as well, with the same techniques. Wrestling was mentioned numerous times in Greek literature, especially poetry. \n\nThe remains of a papyrus wrestling manual from the 2nd century AD reveal that the Greeks were familiar with headlocks, joint locks, shouldler holds, and other techniques used by modern wrestlers. Because there were no time limits to matches, some would end in draws. A wrestler could submit under a chokehold and \"tap out\". Wrestlers were sometimes killed in contest, but their opponents were never held responsible for homicide.\n\n \n\nWrestling was taught and practiced in a building called the \"palaestra\". There were many of these wrestling schools across Greece. The first palaestras were built about the 6th century BC. They were privately owned, but by the 5th century BC palaestras were being built at the public expense. Palaestras were built until the end of the Age of the Roman Empire. The ancient Greek scholar Plutarch writes that only wrestling and the pankration were taught and practiced in the palaestra. Boxing and other sports were taught and practiced in gymnasiums. \n\nThe palaestra consisted of a square or rectangular yard open to the sky. This yard was used for training and practice. The yard was surrounded by colonnades. During rainy weather, wrestling and the pankration were practiced under the colonnades. Rooms adjoining the colonnades were used for lectures, bathing, dressing and undressing, game playing, socializing, and the storage of equipment and olive oil. Gay sex was rampant in the palaestra, despite official efforts to curb it. \n\nGreek athletes were the few athletes in the ancient world who practiced and competed in the nude. Homer's wrestlers in \"Iliad\" wore loincloths, but shortly after the Age of Homer, Greek athletes started to strip. It is not known why. Pausanias says athletes wanted to imitate Orsippos of Megara, a runner who won a footrace at Olympia in 720 BC after losing his loincloth. Dionysios of Halikarnassos and Thucydides credited a Spartan with the custom. \n\nOther legends say that a runner tripped on his loincloth and officials banned it as unsafe. Some say that athletes stripped to prove that they were males, or because they could run better in the nude. Other reasons have been given: athletes stripped for erotic reasons, or for cult reasons, or for good luck, or as a democratic equalizer. Some say they stripped because they were proud of their muscular bodies and their tans.\n\nThe Greeks called the penis \"dog\". Athletes sometimes used a cord called a \"dog leash\" to tie off the foreskin of the penis. It is unknown if this custom had sexual or aesthetic meanings. It appears to have been a matter of personal preference. Tying the foreskin is sometimes a subject in vase painting.\n\nThe Greek wrestler carried three items to the palaestra: an oil flask, a scraper, and a sponge. The oil flask (\"aryballos\") was a ceramic container with a wide lip and narrow mouth that held a wrestler's daily allotment of olive oil. These containers took a variety of shapes. Some were fashioned to resemble birds, animals, or human body parts such as the head, foot, or penis. Most were simply globes without a resting base. \n\nThe scraper (\"strigil\" or \"stlengis\") was a tool with a concave blade. It was made of bronze, silver, glass, or iron. It was used to scrape the accumulated olive oil and sweat (\"gloios\") from an athlete's body. The gloios was sold for its alleged medicinal value. It was used to treat inflammations of the joints, the vulva and anus, for genital warts and syphilitic lesions, muscle sprains, and pains. Once the sweat and oil was removed, the wrestler bathed using a sponge (\"spongos\").\n\nHeavy athleteswrestlers, pankratiasts, and boxersshared the same buildings, practiced the same exercises, used the same equipment (punching bags), and followed the same high-protein diets of meat. Wrestlers at Olympia once were given light boxing practice as a preparation for competition. \n\nWrestlers first rubbed their bodies with olive oil to keep sand out of their pores. The wrestler then dusted himself with a fine powder. He sometimes practiced with a partner to learn tactics, but, for the most part, wrestlers simply wrestled. Rhythm was important, so wrestlers practiced and competed to flute music. Unlike boxing and the pankration, wrestling practice was conducted at full bore. Wrestlers kept their hair cut short to avoid giving opponents something to grasp or wore a skullcap to keep their hair in place.\n\nWrestlers were paired by drawing lots (\"kleroi\"). These lots were about the size of a bean and marked with a letter. There were two lots for each letter. The lots were mixed in a pitcher. Each wrestler drew one lot and was paired with the wrestler who drew the same letter. If there was an odd number of wrestlers, the last letter would be marked on only one lot. The wrestler who drew it would not compete in the first round.\n\nA match began in a position known as the \"standing together\" (\"systasis\"). The wrestlers would lean into each other until their foreheads touched. From this position, each would try to throw his opponent to the ground. A wrestler might lunge forward gripping his opponent's shoulders or wrapping his arms around his opponent's torso in a \"bear hug\". The two might avoid close contact during the initial struggle, with each fighting for a grip on his opponent's legs or arms. Eventually, one would find the grip he needed to throw his opponent. A wrestler might try to grip the hands, wrists, or arms of his opponent and throw him with a sudden twist (\"akrocheirismos\"), or come to close quarters and gain a hold on the body.\n\nA match was divided into sections marked by \"falls\". The wrestlers re-engaged without an interval (break) after a fall. Sports scholars and historians are uncertain about what exactly constituted a fall. They agree however that it involved touching at least the shoulders or the back to the earth. Three falls were a victory and the match was ended.\n\nIn \"Combat Sports in the Ancient World\", Michael Poliakoff points out that Greek wrestling was a brutal sport and tolerated some rough tactics. It was less brutal than the other two combat sportsthe pankration and boxingbut, while striking was forbidden and fingerbreaking was eventually made illegal, some limb-threatening moves, neckholds, and strangleholds were permitted. Wrestling was considered a sport of craft because of its large number of leverages and holds. It was a sport that tested the \"martial virtues: cunning, boldness, courage, self-reliance, and perseverance\" Poliakoff writes, and the Greeks \"expected that an accomplished and educated man would practice and enjoy wrestling as an adult.\" \n\nThe wrestler's objective (aim) was to score a fall on his opponent. Touching the back or shoulders to the ground was a fall. There was no defined wrestling space such as a ring or circle and there was no time limit. Holds were limited to the upper body and foot tripping was permitted. \n\nThere were no weight divisions in Greek wrestling; the sport was dominated by the large and strong. These men and boys could defeat a smaller but more skilled opponent simply by their size. Three falls were required for a win in formal competition. Five bouts were possible in a match. The ancients never awarded points for successful tactics, as in modern wrestling, and \"pinning\" or holding an opponent to the earth was unknown. Strangling or choking an opponent in order to force him to concede (admit) defeat was permitted. \n\nKeeping an opponent in a hold from which he could not escape was also a fall, as was stretching a man full length on the ground. A wrestler could drop to one knee, but this was risky. Once two wrestlers fell to the earth together, it was sometimes difficult to determine exactly what was happening, and disputes arose. Throwing an opponent out of the \"skamma\" (wrestling pit) was not a fall, but counted as a victory nonetheless.\n\nThree classic moves in Greek wrestling were the \"flying mare\", the \"body hold\", and fancy foot trips. In the flying mare, the wrestler would grip his opponent's arm, throw him over his shoulder, and send him to the ground flat on his back. In the body hold, a wrestler would grip his opponent about the waist, lift him in the air, flip him, and drop him head first to the ground. Elaborate foot trips would send a wrestler crashing to the ground, but old school wrestlers who relied on sheer strength scorned fancy foot trips. Punching, kicking, and gouging soft body areas were not allowed. A point was scored if a wrestler tapped out because of a submission hold. It was possible for a match to last for five rounds.\nWrestling was an event in the ancient Olympic Games. It was added to the Olympic program in 708 BC. It was the first competition added to the Olympics that was not a footrace. Boys' wrestling was added to the Olympic program in 632 BC. Wrestlers prayed to Herakles for strength and Hermes for speed. The wrestling competition was held in the stadium at Olympia, not the palaestra.\n\nWrestling, boxing, and the \"pankration\" (the contact sports), were held on the fourth day of the Olympic festival. There were no weight divisions in Greek wrestling. The sixteen Olympic wrestlers were heavyweights with muscles \"the size of boulders\" according to one witness. Fans gave wrestlers nicknames that fit their physiques such as \"the bear\" or \"the lion\". \n\nThe ancient coach Philostratus thought an even temperament and fine physique were important for a wrestler. He liked a wrestler with a straight back, a solid thigh turned outwards, and wrote that \"narrow buttocks are weak, fat ones slow, but well-formed buttocks are an asset for everything.\"\n\nLeontiskos was an Olympic wrestling champion in 456 and 452 BC. Although rules against breaking an opponent's fingers were made in the 6th century BC, Leontiskos won by using just this very tactic. Milo of Croton was another Olympic herothe only wrestler to win five Olympic championships. He was defeated in his sixth attempt when he was forty. The Olympic wrestler Polydamas was killed when he tried to hold up the roof of a cave during an earthquake.\n\nWrestlers were praised for their physical beauty.

This yard was surrounded on all four sides with colonnades of Doric columns. In bad weather, the athletes practiced under these colonnades.\n\nOff these colonnades were rooms where the athletes dressed and undressed, rubbed themselves with olive oil, dusted themselves with powder or sand, met friends, and had gay sex. There was a tub (1.5 meters deep) in the corner of the yard that was used for cold baths. There were rooms for the storage of oil and equipment.\n\nIn 195556, the German Archaeological Institute partly restored the palaestra.

It was a successful pre-World Wide Web online service. The PTT (Poste, Téléphone et Télécommunication) started Minitel started in France in 1982. From the beginning, users could buy things online that are now done on the Internet. People could make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, have a mail box, and chat.\n\nIn February 2009, France Telecom said the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections. One-million were to the directory. France Telecom is planning to end the service on 30 June 2012.\n\nMillions of terminals were free to telephone subscribers. That meant many people and businesses had access immediately. People who got Minitel did not get a regular paper telephone directory.\n\nMinitel gave access to these services:\n\nMany new companies started to try to make money using the network. This was like the dot-com bubble. Many of the companies failed. Some people criticized pornographic services on Minitel because children could access them. The government did not make rules about pornography on Minitel. The government also made a tax on pornographic online services.\n\nPayment methods\n\nFrance Télécom charged Minitel users at rates of up to €1 a minute. The rates depend on the service called. Most services were much cheaper than the maximum. France Télécom then paid part of the fee to the companies that operate Minitel servers.\n\nThe most popular service of the Minitel was the \"Annuaire Electronique\" at the phone number \"11\". On 18 October 1996, access to the Phonedirectory changed to \"3611\". Companies could add up to 3 lines of information to the listing. There were also advertisements on the phone directory pages.\n\nMinitel terminals have a text based screen, keyboard and modem. The screen can show simple graphics. Minitel terminals use the AZERTY keyboard, not the QWERTY keyboard. Users could buy printers to attach to the terminals.\n\nThe Minitel modem usually dialed a special number to connect to a PAVI (\"Point d'Accès VIdéotexte\", \"videotext access point\"). The PAVI sent information to the correct servers on the Transpac X.25 network. In France the most common dial number was \"36 15\". \"36 17\" was for more expensive services. Minitel services names often started with this number.

Olympia was the site of the ancient Olympic Games. The temple is a ruin. It was dedicated to Zeus, the principal god of the Ancient Greeks. This temple was the most important and most impressive structure at Olympia. \n\nThe temple was built between 470 BC and 456 BC. Local limestone was the chief material used. The roof tiles, the gargoyles, and the sculptures were made of marble. The temple measured 64.12 meters by 27.66 meters. It was 20.25 meters high. The temple had six columns at the ends and thirteen columns along both sides. The height of each column was 10.45 meters.\n\nA ramp at the eastern end led to the \"prodomos\". The table holding the Olympic wreaths stood to the right. The crowning of the victors took place on the last day at this spot. \n\nThe sculptures of the east pediment depicted the story of Pelops and Hippodameia. This story is about the first chariot races. The sculptures of the west pediment depicted the story of the Centaurs and the Lapiths. This story is about the contest between barbarity and civilization. There were six metopes over the front porch and six over the back porch. They depicted the Labors of Heracles.\n\nThe temple once contained Phidias' \"Statue of Zeus\", one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The fate of the statue is unknown. It may have been taken to Constantinople where it was probably destroyed in the fire of 475 AD. Or, it may have been destroyed in the fire at Olympia in 426 AD. Phidias' workshop was discovered at Olympia in 1954.\n\nStatue bases cover the area around the temple. These bases held statues of gods, heroes, and Olympic victors. They were dedicated by individuals and cities. The sacred olive from which the Olympic wreaths were cut stood on the west side of the temple. Emperor Theodosius II ordered the temple burned to the ground in 426 AD. Earthquakes destroyed it in 522 AD and in 551. \n\n", "id": "349958", "title": "Temple of Zeus at Olympia"}

It's developed by Camelot and published by Nintendo. First shown \"Dark Dawn\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s official games was in E3 2010. Game was released in October 28, 2010 in Japan and in November 29, 2010 in North America; It is 8 years since the previous game, Game Boy Advance game \"\", was released.\n\nThe game picks up 30 years after the first two games of the series. The main characters are the children of the character in the previous game. In the game, player will control Matthew and his friends to fix the \"soarwing\".\n\nLike its predecessors, \"Dark Dawn\" similay as the traditional role-playing video game. In game, players control characters travel in fantasy-themed world, chat with other characters, battle with monsters, learning powerful magic spells, finding equipment, and take part in a building, do given tasks. Unlike the previous games, some locations don't allowed return once player left. One change of game is the encyclopedia system. For players who don't familiar with the plot of the first two games, the encyclopedia explains location, role and other words.\n\nMuch of the time are not spend in battle, instead, it takes place either in the game's overworld or solve puzzle for dungeons, caves, and other locales. Like \"The Lost Age\", \"Dark Dawn\" have a ship that can help player across a large sea, visiting continents and islands. To solve puzzles or complete the tasks, player usually need to use magic spells that named Psynergy, besides, player also has to find items that can teach character new Psynergy.\n\nUnlike many role-playing video games that magiac can only use as attack or defending in battle, Psynergy spells are also have important usage for solve puzzles and searching. While some Psynergy can only be used in battle, some are only used in the game's overworld and in non-battle place. Instead, some Psynergy can also be used for both situations; for example, the “Cold Snap” ability can be used to attack enemies in battle, or changed water to ice as part of a puzzle. While using Psynergy in non-battle place, a light ring appears around the character and players can decide the direction of the ability by using the touch screen or buttons. Psynergy comes in four elements: Venus (rocks and plants), Mars (fire and heat), Jupiter (wind and electricity), and Mercury (water and ice). The player gains more and more Psynergy spells as the game progresses, either through levelling up or acquiring and equipping, or using special items, and with each \"utility\" Psynergy spell the party gains access to more locations and secrets hidden within the game world.\n\n\"Dark Dawn\" have two kinds of battle: random monster encounters and battles which BOSS that can advance the story. Battles take place on the lower screen of DS, enemy party and player's party are shown face to face. During battle, the camera rotates around the characters and backgrounds in 3D, unlike the pseudo 3D effect used in the previous games. The upper screen is used to view characters' stats and Djinni information.\n\nIn battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies by attacks with weapons, using Psynergy spells, or other ways. At the same time, player needs to keep his or her own party alive by using items and supportive Psynergy that heal and support. If all the player's characters are defeated by losing all their hit points, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited, and the player loses some money. A battle victory, players will get experience points, coins, and sometimes can get special items.\n\nOne of the most special feature in \"Dark Dawn\" is the Djinn system, where the player collects and cortrols elemental product called Djinn (singular: \"Djinni\"), and \"Dark Dawn\" use some Djinn that appeared in previous games. They can be found in different place of the game. Each element have 18 Djinn, so 4 elements Djinn have 72 totally, and any character can have each one. Different Djinn can changed different character's classes differently, that besides hit points, Psynergy points, general stats, and Psynergy that character could use.\n\nOnce Djinn got, player can decide which character get it. Each Djinn have three modes: Set, Standby, or Recovery. When a Djinni is Set, that Djinni will change character's class, stats and Psynergy. Psynergy that who can used is depending on both the character's and the Djinni's element. In combat, player use character's set Djinni during that character's turn. Each Djinni has its own special effect when called upon during combat. These effects include attacking, buffing or debuffing, healing and many other effects. After using a Djinni, it goes into Standby mode. While on Standby, Djinn can't affect character class, but can be used for Summoning, where the player summons a powerful elemental spirit. This is the game's most powerful way of attacking, and also the riskiest. As it requires Djinn to be on standby, it woulden't strong a character like set Djinni. Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it spends some turns recovering before it restores itself to Set mode on a character. There are 30 Summon Sequences in \"Dark Dawn\"; 16 from the first game can be used alongside, 13 multi-elemental sequences introduced in \"The Lost Age\", and 1 new sequence in \"Dark Dawn\". Each of these must be earned individually; they are usually find in dungeons that not must to visit.\n\nIn \"Dark Dawn\", 83 Djinn are introduced. 72 Djinn are obtainable by the player, and 11 are only apper in the plot that can't really got. Djinn allow for a large array of possible class setups for all eight playable characters. This allows for a large kind of combat ways.\n\nIn the past of Weyard, Alchemy was used for developing culture. However, use Alchemy as a wrong way would destroy the world, so Alchemy was sealed in Mount Aleph. In the beginning of first game, Alchemy was released, so a group of heroes travel to reseal Alchemy. In the second game, it is find that without Alchemy, the ancient culture began to lost, and the world will disapper without the powers of Alchemy. In the predecessors, Isaac and Felix let Alchemy return to the world. The story of \"Dark Dawn\" begins thirty years after the end of \"The Lost Age\". Due to Isaac and the others bringing the power of the Golden Sun to Weyard, continents have moved, new countries have set up, and new species have appeared. However, Psynergy Vortexes, which take the elemental Psynergy from both the earth and the Adepts (who can control Alchemy), are appearing all over Weyard.\n\nIn \"Golden Sun: Dark Dawn\", player can control eight characters totally. Venus Adept captain Matthew is the son of Isaac and Jenna, he is silent but strong-willed. Mars Adept Tyrell is son of Garet, though he likes to play tricks, he is the best friend of Matthew. Wind Adept Karis is the daughter of Ivan, usually visits and plays with Matthew and Tyrell who live in Lookout Cabin. Mercury Adept Rief is the son of Mia, he is travelling with tutor Kraden. Mercury Adept Amiti is the prince of Ayuthay and his lot is a mystery. Beastman Sveta is the sister of the ruler of Morgal, she can incarnat a beastman to protect friends in a battle. Mars Adept Eoleo is the son of Briggs, he also appeared in \"The Lost Age\" and now he is a pirate. Venus Adept Himi is the daughter of Susa, who is a seer with powerful Psynergy. Blados and Chalis are from Tuaparang, a mysterious country where they have science and military power, and a masked man named Arcanus actions with them together.\n\nThe story of \"Dark Dawn\" begins thirty years after the conclusion of \"The Lost Age\". Due to Isaac and the others bringing the power of the Golden Sun to Weyard, continents have changed, new countries was set up, and new species have appeared. However, Psynergy Vortexes, which absorb the elemental Psynergy from both the land and the power-wielding Adepts, are appearing all over Weyard. The children of the previous games' heroes – Matthew, Karis, and Tyrell – set out to solve the mystery of the vortexes, and cross a world that is succumbing to a new evil.\n\nTyrell destroyed soarwing that made by Ivan, so Isaac sends him out with Matthew and Karis to find a feather of the Mountain Roc to make a new one. Along the way, they met the bad person Blados, Chalis, and Arcanus. After Rief left Kraden and his sister Nowell, he joins Matthew's party to meet Kraden. After making two Alchemy Machines (a Forge and a Well) running they come to the country of Morgal, where beastmen live. They get the Roc feather quickly, however, they were tricked into activating the Luna Tower, the Grave Eclipse cover much parts of earth and takes death and pains. The children then fight to end the eclipse by activating Apollo's Lens, an alchemy machine powered by the Alchemy Forge and Alchemy Well. For this, they and defeating Blados, Chalis and a dark monster who changed by Sveta's brother. After activating the Apollo's lens and stopping the Grave Eclipse, they and new friends return to their own homes. However, when they return to the home, a unusually large Psynergy Vortex greeting them.\n\nAfter previous \"Golden Sun: The Lost Age\" was released in 2003, there are many players talk about a third entry in the \"Golden Sun\" series. In 2003, developer Camelot said \"the current status of a third game ... is still up in the air\". In a 2004 interview about the studio's founding brothers Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi, they said the first two games is for \"prologues to the real event yet to come\". At this time, someone said third title might pubilshed on the Nintendo GameCube.\n\nDue to less update information about new game, there were some hoaxes. One of hoax is a Nintendo DS game called \"Golden Sun: The Solar Soothsayer\", which said that would shown at a small pre-E3 2007 shown. Official said this information is no really, and the hoax's author explain that he wants to make more talks for new game.\n\nThere are also many talks about the third \"Golden Sun\" title. In October 2007, Takahashi brothers said they still wanted to and \"have to\" make a third game, and Nintendo also asked them to make another. They said they just wished to give the title time to developing, so they didn't make a game now. In April 2008, \"Nintendo Power\" magazine interviewed Shugo Takahashi on one of his latest games. When they asked about a third \"Golden Sun\", Takahashi replied \"A new \"Golden Sun\"? Well, I personally think that I want to play a new RPG, too...\"\n\n\"Golden Sun DS\" was finally announced during Nintendo's press conference at E3 2009, with a release date set for the 2010 holiday season. Media shows that elemental Djinn (likely it previous, earth, fire, wind, and water, also refer to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Mercury) and certain summons will return from the previous games in the series. At E3 2010, the title's name was public as \"Golden Sun: Dark Dawn\" and a playable demo was made available to who join E3.\n\n\"Golden Sun: Dark Dawn\" had mixed reviews from critics. It is ranked 79% on Metacritic and 80% on GameRankings. The game was not as well received as its predecessors: \"Golden Sun\" received a 91% and a 90% on Metacritic and GameRankings, and \"The Lost Age\" received an 86% and an 87%.\n\nReviews usually praise the game's graphics and Djinni system. While \"GameSpot\" said \"the visuals have brought the 2D world of the GBA games into full 3D on the DS to good effect\", 1UP.com praises the game's battle graphics are \"vivid [and] never grow tedious or overblown\". GamesRadar said the game's unusual Djinni system let \"veteran RPG players won't be bored with the gameplay\". \"Game Revolution\" praises the game's puzzle setting like its predecessor that \"are rarely very difficult, but the sense of satisfaction you get after grabbing your elusive reward is still like crack for the exploratory player\". Besides, the game's encyclopedia system can let a new player get familiar with the previous games, gaming blog \"Kotaku\" said it's \"extremely newbie friendly\".\n\nCriticism of the game is that battle is easy and cut-scenes dialogue is too long. \"Game Revolution\" said battle can \"[use] the Djinn and subsequently summoning monsters ... pound on your enemies with attacks instead\". 1UP.com said the game's long dialogue is just like its predecessors that \"heroes and villains have an uncanny knack for saying incredibly simple things with about three or four times the words they actually need to convey those ideas\". This entry adds a emotion system that can silence other characters' replies, however, reviews think it's unnecessary and can't really effect plot.\n\nAccording to Media Create, 46,516 copies were sold in Japan in first four days.\n", "id": "350038", "title": "Golden Sun: Dark Dawn"}

It is when a lot of capital and labour is used to increase the yield that can be got. The use of pesticides for crops and medication for animal stocks is common. \n\nThis is a contrast to ŧraditional agriculture, which does not get as much output per area. When agriculture is intensified, this means that the amount of work needed goes up, until the worker is replaced by a machine. At that point, there will only need to be a few workers to operate the machines. Intensive farming has often been done as a response to rising population levels. It is criticised because the standards of animal welfare are low. Intensive animal farming leads to increased pollution and to health issues.\n\nModern intensive crop based agriculture involves the use of mechanical ploughing, chemical fertilizers, plant growth regulators, and pesticides. The use of machines has allowed farmers to substantially increase production. Intensive farming has also increased erosion.

The pankration was a form of wrestling with one difference: the athletes were allowed to use their fists. They did not wear boxing thongs however. Kicking and hitting were allowed but biting and gouging an eye or soft spot with a thumb or finger were forbidden. Umpires flogged athletes who violated these rules. In spite of this punishment, violations often occurred.\n\nA Greek wrestler aimed to throw his opponent; a pankratiast however aimed to force his opponent to concede defeat. This might be done by getting an opponent in a hold that, if he did not yield (give up), a bone would be broken or a joint dislocated. Size and weight did not matter as much in the pankration as they did in boxing and wrestling because pankratiasts spent most of their time rolling around on the ground. \n\nThe Greeks loved the pankration. They considered it the greatest test of an athlete's skill and strength. The pankration was also a favorite sport in Roman imperial times. The most famous ancient pankratiast was Arrichon of Philageia in the 6th century BC. He won the pankration in two Olympics, but died of a stranglehold in the Olympics of 564 BC.

The area is in Rossendale. It is made up of the steep valleys of the River Irwell and its tributaries. These flow from the Pennines. They then go south into Greater Manchester. They cut through the open moorland. The area has a lot of these, even though a long time ago they were called \"forests\".\n\nThere are two Marilyns in the hills. These are Hail Storm Hill and Freeholds Top.\n\nThe geology of the area is layers of gritstone, coal and sand and gravel left behind by glaciers. These rocks were cut by rivers, the Irwell and its tributaries, to make steep valleys. These are 600 feet high. Woodland on the steep slopes includes remnants of ancient woodland but other areas are more recently planted.\n\nThe Rossendale Valley is recognised by the steep valley of the River Irwell and its tributaries. Textile mills and chimneys and gritstone houses are what most buildings are. Roads are mostly found in the narrow valley.\n\nThe valley was part of the medieval Forest of Rossendale. People living there in the Middle Ages would have been in \"booths\" or farmsteads and movement into the forest would have turned them into small hamlets.\n\n", "id": "350275", "title": "Rossendale Valley"}

They have a similar morphological or physiological complexity, and they are often adapted to the same way of life. \n\nThe term was coined by Julian Huxley, to contrast with clade, which is a strictly phylogenetic unit. The use of 'grade' as a term in biology was strongly supported by Ernst Mayr, who also pointed out that the term had been used for some time before cladism.\n\nAn evolutionary grade is a group of species united by similarities. These similarities led to their being given a name. But now to be a clade, the whole group from the first known member to the present day must be included. \n\nThe most commonly cited example is that of reptiles. In the early 19th century, tetrapods were put in the four familiar classes of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. In this system, reptiles are defined by traits such as laying cleidoic eggs, having skin covered in scales or scutes, and having a 'cold-blooded' metabolism. \n\nHowever, we now know that amphibia gave rise to early egg-laying amniotes. These gave rise to sauropsids (the ancestors of reptiles and birds) and synapsids (the ancestors of mammals. 'Reptile' is just a common term for those sauropsids which survived to the present day, minus the birds. As an everyday word, everyone understands it. But as a modern \"scientific\" term, it is no longer good, and is less used.\n\nParaphyletic and polyphyletic taxa often represent evolutionary grades. In some cases paraphyletic taxa are united simply by not being part of any other groups, and give rise to so-called wastebasket taxa.\n\n", "id": "350289", "title": "Evolutionary grade"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=350305", "text": "Unity makes strength\n\n\"Unity makes strength\" (, ; ; ) is the national motto of Belgium. It was also taken on by Bulgaria and Haiti.\n\nThe motto was first used in 1550. It came from the Latin phrase \"concordia res parvae crescunt\" (small states flourish by concord). The new Dutch Republic took over the phrase as its motto. It was on several of its coins and coats of arms. \n\nThe French were in the Netherlands from 1795 to 1813, first as the Batavian Republic then the Kingdom of Holland. Early on the national motto was changed to \"Gelykheid, Vryheid, Broederschap\" (Equality, Liberty, Fraternity). From 1802 to 1810 'Unity makes strength' was used again. In 1816, it switched to the House of Orange motto 'Je maintiendrai'.\n\nThe motto was chosen by the Republic of Haiti after the revolution and subsequent independence of the slaves of the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1803. The newly created state of Haiti became officially independent on January 1st,1804 following the capitulation of the French troops at the Battle of Vertieres of November 18,1803. The coat of arms of the republic of Haiti carries the french version of the motto \"L'Union fait la force\". The Republic of Haiti is often reffered to as the world's First Black Republic.\n\nThe motto was used by Belgium after its Revolution of 1830. It was first only in its French form \"L'union fait la force\".\n\nThe motto of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City started by Dutch settlers, is still \"Eendraght maeckt maght\". The motto \"Eendragt maakt magt\" also appears on the badge of the police force of Holland, Michigan.\n\nAfter Ferdinand of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took over the throne of the Principality of Bulgaria, the country started to use Belgium's motto of \"L'union fait la force\" (in Bulgarian: Съединението прави силата). It was the country's motto until 1948. \n\nOn 17 January 1852 the United Kingdom, ruler of the Cape Colony, made the South African Republic free. \"Eendragt maakt magt\" was the motto on the new state's shield. In 1888 the republic decided Dutch was its official language.\n\nAn early design of the coat of arms used between 1948 and 1963 used a variation of the motto, \"Unity is Strength\". It was in both English and Jawi. After three more states were added into the federation in 1963, the English motto of the arms was replaced by a rough Malay translation, \"Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu\" (literally \"Unity Improves Quality\"). The Jawi motto remained unchanged.\n", "id": "350305", "title": "Unity makes strength"}
