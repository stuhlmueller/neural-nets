The BIPM is an inter-governmental organization that is responsible for harmonizing systems of measurement across the world. The treaty was first made in 1875 between 17 countries. \n\nThe member countries agreed to share the costs of running a laboratory on neutral territory. The international prototype metre and the international prototype kilogram would be kept at the laboratory. Member state's national prototype metres and kilograms would be compared with the international prototypes at regular intervals. Member states would have regular meetings to discuss developments in measurement technology.\n\nIn 1921 the treaty was extended to cover electrical and all other physical measurements. This enabled the BIPM to published the standards for the International System of Units (SI). Under SI, units of measurements that are used in science and engineering were defined in a logical manner. The rules for SI also standardized the way in which physical quantities are written.\n\nIn 2014 the BIPM had 55 member countries.\n\nThe metric system was developed in France in the 1790s. The length of the metre was made to be one ten millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator. Between 1791 and 1798 the French men Delambre (a mathematician and astronomer) and Méchain (an astronomer) measured the distance between Dunkirk and Barcelona. The measurements were used to make a metal bar exactly 443.296 \"lignes\" long (the \"ligne\" is an old French unit of length equal to one twelfth of a French inch). The bar would be used as a standard for the metre. The bar was later called the \"metre des archives\". By the 1860s it was found that the \"metre des archives\" was 0.03% shorter than it was supposed to have been.\n\nThe Great Exhibition in London in 1851 and the Paris International Exhibition in 1867 had shown the need for different nations to use the same units of measurement. In the 1860s there were many discussions by astronomers and surveyors from outside France whether they should use the \"metre des archives\" or whether they should use a \"new metre\" that took account of the 0.03% error. Prussia took the lead in organizing conferences in Berlin to discuss the matter. France did not take part in the conferences. Before any actions could be taken the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Prussia defeated France. At the same time the German Empire was formed.\n\nIn 1875 France invited representatives to Paris to discuss the matter. This helped France to score a diplomatic victory over Prussia and the German Empire.\n\nThe treaty was signed by seventeen of the countries at the conference in Paris on 20 May 1875. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands went to the conference but did not sign the treaty at that time. After further consideration, the United Kingdom did sign the treaty in 1884.\n\nThe meeting agreed:\n\nThe organization set up by the treaty was the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. Its French name is \"Bureau international des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is BIPM. The BIPM has its headquarters at the Pavillon de Breteuil, Sèvres, France (close to Paris). About 70 people work at the BIPM. The budget for 2013 was over €10 million ($12 million).\n\nThe three organisations were set up under the treaty. They are:\n\nThe Bureau has responsibility for safeguarding the international prototype kilogram.\n\nThe official language for the organisations is French. Until 1988 all reports of meetings were only published in French. Since then both English and French have been used. Abbreviations are based on the French words, not English words. Official communications between the BIPM and France are conducted via the French Foreign Ministry. Official communications with other countries are conducted via that country's embassy in Paris.\n\nThe General Conference on Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It gives the BIPM its mandate and budget on behalf of the member states. Its French name is \"Conférence générale des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is \"CGPM\".\nThe CGPM meets every four to six years. The first meeting was in 1889 and the 24th meeting was in 2011. Each member state has one vote. France is represented by its foreign minister and by the president of the French Academy. The French Foreign minister is the chairman of the opening and closing sessions of any CGPM session. The president of the French Academy is the chairman of other meetings of the CGPM. \n\nThe CGPM:\n\nThe International Committee for Weights and Measures was set up under the Metre Convention as an organ of the BIPM. It advises the CGPM and supervise the BIPM. Its French name is \"Comité international des poids et mesures\". Its abbreviation is CIPM.\n\nThe CGPM has 18 members. These members are well-known measurement experts who are elected by the CGPM. They must all come from different countries. One of the CIPM members must be French. They meet once or twice a year in Paris. The CIPM is assisted by a number of Consultative Committees. In February 2014 there were ten such committees. Nine of the committees are dedicated to special types of measurement such as Electricity and Magnetism, Length, Photometry and Radiometry, Thermometry and Time and Frequency. The CIPM appoints people to these committees.\n\nThe tenth committee is called the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU). Its chairman is appointed by the CIPM. Other members of the committee are appointed by other organizations. These organizations include International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CCU's task is to ensure that all the definitions of SI are consistent. It also drafts the SI standard which is called the \"SI Brochure\".\n\nThe BIPM's offices and laboratories art at the Pavillon de Breteuil, Sèvres, France (close to Paris). \n\nThe BIPM looks after the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) for the CGPM. It provides laboratory services for the CGPM and CIPM. Member states use the BIPM laboratories when they check their own copy of the kilogram against the IPK. The BIPM offices are also the headquarters for the CGPM and CIPM.\n\nIn 1875 the convention only dealt with standardization of the kilogram and the metre. The convention was revised in 1921 to accommodate all physical measurements. In 1933 the CGPM approved efforts that were being made to merge electrical and photometry units into the metric system.\n\nDuring the late nineteenth and early twentieth century many new units of measure were defined using the metric system. Units of measure used in electrostatic applications, electromagnetic applications and electrical distribution systems were incompatible with each other. The use of standard gravity in force and pressure definitions resulted in more units of measure being defined than were necessary. \n\nAfter the Second World War the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the French Government asked the BIPM to look into the matter. In 1948, the 9th CGPM asked the CIPM to conduct a study into units of measurement used by member states. The CIPM reported back and in 1954 the 10th CGPM decided to set up a new system of units. There would be six base units. These were the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, degree Kelvin (later renamed kelvin), and candela. The new system was published in 1960. The 11th CGPM named it the \"International System of Units\". The short name was \"SI\". This came from the French name, . The BIPM described SI as \"the modern metric system\".\n\nSince 1960 the BIPM has made several refinements to SI. Some of the refinements include developing new ways of making high precision measurement. Other refinements include small changes to details of definitions.\n\nThe atomic clock has made very precise time-keeping possible. The earth is slowing down. A the \"time of the dinosaurs\" the earth rotated once every 23 hours. It is now possible to measure variations in the Earth's rotation caused by volcanoes and tsunamis. This is done by the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS). The IERS proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed. Under the Metre Convention, the BIPM has the task of coordinating over 200 atomic clocks around the world. These clocks are located in 50 different national laboratories.\n\nMany measuring devices need to be recalibrated at regular intervals. These devices might be petrol pumps. They might be weighing scales. They might be complex medical equipment like MRI scanners. A certificate is issued when the device is recalibrated. The device that is used to do the calibration must itself be calibrated. These devices are often recalibrated in a national metrology laboratory. Legal problems can arise if a calibration done in one country is not recognised in another country.\n\nSome countries are full members of the CGPM and have a vote at CGPM meetings. These countries have their own copy of the prototype kilogram. They also take part in the CIPM MRA program. \n\nOther countries are associate members. They take part on the CIPM MRA program. They may speak at CGPM meetings but not to vote at these meetings. They do not have their own copies of the prototype kilogram.\n\n (1877) <br>\n\nAt its 21st meeting (October 1999), the CGPM created the category of \"associate\" for those states not yet members of the BIPM and for economic unions.\n\nThe following international organisations have signed the CIPM MRA:\n\n (1970–2012)<br>\n\n", "id": "437217", "title": "Metre Convention"}

This has made the Brazil manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, very angry. The Brazilian Football Confederation have even asked the country's government to remove Costa's citizenship.\n\nIn March 2014, Costa changed to the Spanish national team, this was when he was granted his Spanish citizernship. He made his first appearance against Italy and represented Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n\nCosta spent 2 years at Barcelona Esportivo Capela, from 2004 to 2006. After this, he then began his senior career in Portugal.\n\nDiego Costa joined Braga in 2006. But due to a loan at Penafiel, he didn't get a game.\n\nIn the same year as joining Braga, he was sent on a loan spell to Penafiel. He achieved 13 league games with 5 goals.\n\nIn 2007, Costa joined Atletico Madrid for a fee of €1.5 million. Unfortunately, he didn't get a games due to loan spells.\n\nDiego Costa remained at Braga in 2007 but on a loan spell. This time, he made 7 league appearances, but he failed to score a goal. In the UEFA Cup, he scored his first goal in a domestic cup against Parma F.C.\n\nHe was then loaned to Celta for the 2007-08 Segunda Division season. In that season, he made an impressive 30 appearances and scored 5 goals.\n\nStaying in the Segunda Division, he then joined on loan Albacete Balompie for the 2008-09 season. At this loan spell, he made 35 league appearances and 9 goals.\n\nCosta was bought by Valladoid from Atletico Madrid in 2009 Transfer Window. In this 2009-10 season, he made 34 league appearances with 8 goals. But it wasn't enough to keep Valladoid in the La Liga. Near to the end of the season, they were relegated.\n\nCosta returned to Atletico in June 2010 for an undisclosed fee. Since then, Costa has made a superb 94 league appearances and 43 league goals during his 4 year spell with the club. In his time, he suffered with a few injuries during his time. This include his hamstring injury he suffered near to the end of the 2013-14 La Liga season. \n\nOn the 1 July 2014, it was announced that Chelsea had agreed a fee with Atletico to sign Costa for a fee of £32 million. He made his first league appearance against Burnley in a game which he scored in for Chelsea to win 3-1. Costa is currently top goal scorer in the Barclays Premier League and has flown during his start at Chelsea\n\nDuring his international career, he started with the Brazilian National Team in 2013. He only made 2 appearances with no goals. But controversy was created when Costa was granted a Spanish Citizernship in 2014. Then, Costa adopted Spain as his national side. He made his debut against Italy on the 5 March 2014, Spain won 1-0. Costa was called-up to play for Spain in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started for both of the first two games of Spain's torlument against Holland and Chile, but was rested against Australia. Spain lost 5-1 against Holland And 2-0 against Chile. They did win 3-0 against Australia in their final group game, but it wasn't enough to keep them to progess into the knock out phases.

These are handguns although other types of weapons use revolving cylinders. They are also called revolving guns, though \"revolver\" is used far more often. The first revolvers date back to late 1500s in Europe. It was not until the 1700s or 1800s, however, they became affordable. Revolvers are sometimes used by law enforcement agencies. On some occasions, these guns can be reset by one hand, then loaded with the other.\n\nIn a single-action revolver, the hammer is manually cocked. This is usually done with the thumb. This action advances the cylinder to the next cartridge. It also locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called \"single-action\" because the trigger only performs a single action—that of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is very light, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The gun will not fire unless the hammer is cocked back. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.\n\nIn double-action (DA), the stroke of the trigger pull generates three actions: \nThus, DA means that a cocking action separate from the trigger pull is not needed. Every trigger pull will result in a complete cycle. This allows the gun to be carried uncocked. It also allows the gun to be drawn from the holster and fired using only the trigger. However, a DA revolver has a longer and harder trigger pull. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as the gun is safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.\n\nMost double-action revolvers may be fired in two ways.\n", "id": "437295", "title": "Revolver"}

She was one of the world's most successful players in the 1970s and early 1980s. She ranked No. 1 in the world in 1976.\n\nGoolagong won 14 Grand Slam titles. She won the women's title in singles tennis four times at the Australian Open, twice at the Wimbledon Championships, and once at the French Open. The other Grand Slam titles she won were in doubles tennis: six in women's doubles and one in mixed doubles.\n\nEvonne Fay Goolagong was born in Griffith, New South Wales. She and her family are Aboriginal Australians. They belong to the Wiradjuri nation. Evonne was the third of eight children. She grew up in the small farming town of Barellan. Her father, Kenneth Goolagong, was a sheep shearer. Her family was poor. At this time, many Aboriginal people around Australia faced discrimination; they were treated differently by White Australians. However, Goolagong has said that she did not experience discrimination whilst living at Barellan.\n\nShe started playing tennis when she was a young girl. A began when Bill Kurtzman, a player at Barellan, saw Goolagong looking through the fence of the local tennis courts. He asked her if she would like to try playing. She joined the local tennis club when she was seven years old. She quickly showed a talent for the game. She was fast and had quick reflexes. She played in competitions with neighbouring towns. In 1961, Vic Edwards, the owner of a tennis school in Sydney, travelled to Barellan to watch Goolagong play. She was eleven years old at the time.\n\nEdwards coached Goolagong and encouraged her to play tennis as a career. She left Barellan and moved to Sydney permanently in 1965, when she was aged 14. She lived with Edwards' family in their home. She went to Willoughby Girls High School, finishing in 1968. She entered the New South Wales Championship in 1967. She played in the Australian women's singles championship in January 1968. By this time she was ranked as the best junior player in New South Wales. Goolagong would later win the Australian championship four times; in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977. She came second place in 1971, 1972 and 1973.\n\nGoolagong won seven Grand Slam singles titles in her career. She played in eighteen Grand Slam singles finals; all except one of these were during the 1970s. Between 1971 and 1977, she reached the final of almost every Grand Slam singles event she entered.\n\nShe competed at Wimbledon for the first time in 1970. She won her first Grand Slam singles title in 1971, beating Helen Gourlay to win the French Open. A month later, she beat Margaret Court to win the Wimbledon Championship. The next year, she lost in the Wimbledon final to Billie Jean King. She lost to King again in the semi-final in 1973, and a third time in the final in 1975. She lost to Chris Evert in the final in 1976. She won the Wimbledon title for the second time in 1980, playing against Evert again in the final. Goolagong had given birth to her daughter in 1977. She became the first and only mother to win since Dorothea Douglass-Chambers 66 years before.\n\nGoolagong reached four U.S. Open finals; in 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. She lost them all: to Court, King, then twice to Evert. She is the only woman in the U.S. Open to have lost four finals one after the other. Goolagong made seven finals at the Australian Open, each one after the other. She won four times in a row. After having won her first French Open in 1971, Goolagong stopped competing in the tournament after 1973. She returned in 1983, and this was the last Gland Slam singles tournament she competed in. She lost to Evert.\n\nGoolagong won six women's doubles titles. She won five at the Australian Open (in 1971, 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977), and one at Wimbledon (1974). She also won the mixed doubles title at the French Open in 1972.\n\nGoolagong was ranked number one in the world for two weeks in 1976. However, it was not reported at the time because incomplete data were used to calculate the rankings. This was discovered in December 2007, 31 years later. She was the 16th woman to hold the top position.\n\nGoolagong was awarded Australian of the Year in 1971. She was made an Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1972, and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1982. She was entered into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. She was made a part of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe National Museum of Australia holds a collection of items to remember Goolagong's career. This includes her 1971 and 1980 Wimbledon singles trophies, the trophy from her 1974 doubles win, and two racquets used in these tournaments.\n\nGoolagong married British tennis player Roger Cawley on 19 June 1975. After their wedding, the couple settled in Naples, Florida. They lived in the U.S. for eight years. They now live in Noosa Heads, in Queensland. They have two children: Kelly and Morgan.\n\nGoolagong played a total of 869 singles matches. Of these, she won 704 (81.01%). In Grand Slam singles tournaments, she won 82.09% of her matches (133 wins, 29 losses).\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "437448", "title": "Evonne Goolagong"}

It was said that some ships carried $200,000 worth of alcohol in a single trip.\n\n\"Bootlegging\" usually means smuggling over land.

Formerly in Kent, it is now shared between the London Boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich. \nBlackheath has one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London.\n\nThe name is recorded in 1166 as \"Blachehedfeld\" and means the \"dark coloured heathland\". It is formed from the Old English 'blæc' and 'hǣth' and refers to the open space that was the meeting place of the ancient hundred of Blackheath. The name was later applied to the Victorian suburb that developed in the 19th century and was extended to the areas known as Blackheath Park and Blackheath Vale.\n\nThe Roman road that later became known as Watling Street crosses the northern edge of Blackheath (almost in line with the A2).\n\nBlackheath was a rallying point for Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt of 1381, and for Jack Cade's Kentish rebellion in 1450. Wat Tyler is remembered by Wat Tyler Road on the heath. After pitching camp on Blackheath, Cornish rebels were defeated in the Battle of Deptford Bridge (sometimes called the Battle of Blackheath), just to the west, on 17 June 1497.\n\nWith Watling Street carrying stagecoaches across the heath, en route to north Kent and the Channel ports, it was also a notorious haunt of highwaymen during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe sizeable estate of Blackheath Park was created on lands of Wricklemarsh Manor, and built over in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It has fine examples of substantial Georgian and Victorian houses – most notably Michael Searles' crescent of semi-detached terrace houses linked by colonnades, The Paragon (c 1793-1807). \n\nThe Pagoda is a notable example of a beautiful property situated in Blackheath, built in 1760 by Sir William Chambers in the style of a traditional Chinese pagoda. It was later leased to the Prince Regent, who would become King George IV, and used as a summer home by his wife Caroline, Princess of Wales.\n\nIn 1608, according to tradition, Blackheath was the place where golf was introduced to England – the Royal Blackheath Golf Club. The club was one of the first golf associations established (1766) outside Scotland. Since 1923 it has been in nearby Eltham. Blackheath also gave its name to the first hockey club, established during the mid 19th century.\n\nThe Blackheath Rugby Club was founded in 1858, the oldest rugby club in England. The Blackheath club organised the world's first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871), and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later.

For example, to allow their sheep to graze, to collect firewood, or to cut turf for fuel. \n\nOriginally in mediaeval England the common was part of the manor. Although it was part of the estate owned by the lord of the manor, tenants had certain rights. \n\nBy extension, the term \"commons\" has come to be applied to other resources which a community has rights or access to.

On August 12, 1985, the Boeing 747-146SR developed mechanical problems 12 minutes after taking off. The plane then crashed into Mount Takamagahara in Gunma Prefecture 32 minutes later, after the pilots tried to control the plane, but failed. 520 people died, and only 4 survived. The crash was caused by incorrect repair after a tailstrike incident, which caused metal fatigue and eventually an in-flight structural failure, in which the whole tail of the plane separated from the plane.\n\nThe crash was the worst plane crash involving only one plane. It was also the second worst plane crash, with the only one worse than it being the Tenerife Airport Disaster.\n\nThe plane that crashed was a Boeing 747-146SR (SR stands for short range), with tail number JA8119. The plane was used to fly short, domestic routes within Japan. The plane first flew on January 28, 1974. It had 4 Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A engines. Before it crashed, it had flown for 25030 hours, and took off and landed 18835 times.\n\nOn June 2, 1978, JA8119 was involved in a tailstrike accident at Osaka International Airport. When landing, the plane's tail struck the runway. The aft pressure bulkhead was damaged in the accident, as well as the rear of the plane. Later, during June 17 and July 11, repairman from Boeing repaired the plane, by replacing the lower part of the rear and a part of the bulkhead. The plane later returned to service.\n\nWhile investigating the accident, the investigators realised that the repair done 7 years before the accident by Boeing was incorrect. While two rows of rivets were required for a splice plate in the bulkhead to be installed, the repairman only used one row. This increased the chance of metal fatigue by 70% and also caused the subsequent accident.\n\nOn that day, the plane was flown by three crew. The 49-year-old captain, Masami Takahama, was a very experienced pilot. He has flown for 12423 hours, with 4842 hours on 747s. The 39-year-old co-pilot, Yutaka Sasaki, was training to be a captain. On that flight, he was seated on the left-seat (which is usually for captains). He has flown 3963 hours, with 2665 hours on 747s. The last crew, 46-years-old flight engineer, Hiroshi Fukuda, has flown 9831 hours, with 3846 hours on 747s. There were also 12 cabin crew.\nThe countries which the passengers and crew came from are listed below.\nOn the afternoon of the accident day, JA8119 has already completed two round trip flights, JL503/504 to and from Sapporo, and JL363/366 to and from Fukuoka. At 5.17pm, the plane has just completed flight JL366, and was parked at Spot 18 at Tokyo International Airport, getting ready for its flight to Osaka, JL123. \n\nAt 6.04pm, the plane started taxiing towards the runway. Takeoff was at 6.12pm, and the plane climbed to its cruising height of 24000ft (about 7300 metres). Till then, everything was fine.\n\nAt 6.24pm, there was suddenly a loud noise heard, which was actually caused by the pressure bulkhead's failure. This caused an explosive decompression. Air rushed out of the plane and blew off the tail of the plane. As all four hydraulic lines, which control the plane, are located in the tail, the plane became uncontrollable. 46 seconds later the pilots squawked 7700 (meaning that they are in an emergency) and requested to return to Tokyo International Airport. However, although the air traffic controller approved the plane to turn towards Tokyo, the plane strangely started heading towards the north-west direction. At 6.28pm, the Tokyo Air Traffic Controller asked the pilots to turn left, but received the message from the pilots, \"now uncontrollable.\" By then, the plane was moving in a way called the phugoid motion, climbing until losing speed and stalling, then the nose goes down and gaining speed until the plane is able to climb again. The phugoid motion repeated itself until the end of the flight.\n\nAt 6.31pm, the air traffic controller asked the plane if it can land at Nagoya Airport, which was 72 miles (about 133 km) from the plane. However, the pilots wanted to return to Tokyo. Between 6.35pm and 6.56pm, the pilots struggled to control the plane without the tail. This failed, as the plane flew uncontrollably towards the mountains.\n\nAt 6.56pm, the plane's right wing hit a ridge. The plane then flew on, crashed into a second ridge, and exploded. 520 died, while 4 survives.\n\nThe time taken for the plane to crash after the bulkhead failure is 32 minutes. The accident was the worst in aviation history involving explosive decompression.\n", "id": "438060", "title": "Japan Airlines Flight 123"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438066", "text": "Oncogene\n\nAn oncogene is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer. Or, equally good, an oncogene is a gene which brings about uncontrolled cell division.\n\nOncogenes in tumor cells are often mutated or expressed at high levels.\n\nMost normal cells undergo a programmed form of death (apoptosis). Activated oncogenes can cause those cells designated for apoptosis to survive and proliferate instead. Most oncogenes require an additional step, such as mutations in another gene, or environmental factors, such as viral infection, to cause cancer. Since the 1970s, dozens of oncogenes have been identified in human cancer. Many cancer drugs target the proteins coded by oncogenes.\n\nIn 1976 J. Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus of the University of California, San Francisco showed that oncogenes were activated proto-oncogenes, found in many organisms including humans. For this discovery Bishop and Varmus were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1989.\n\nThe work of Bishop and Varmus corrected a long-standing error. The Nobel citation includes this explanation:\n\nIn fact, the reverse transcription of the virus RNA into DNA had the effect that the oncogenes become integrated into the chromosomal DNA in the cells. It was then found that oncogene-like material could be detected in different species throughout the animal kingdom, in fact even in simple organisms with only a few cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the gene had a fixed position in the chromosomes of a certain species, and that the gene, when it constituted part of the cellular genetic material, was divided into fragments.\n\nA proto-oncogene is a normal gene that can become an oncogene due to mutations or increased expression. The resultant protein can be called an oncoprotein. Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon \"activation\", a proto-oncogene (or its product) becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. \n\nThe MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's Lymphoma. This starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence close to the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the 'Philadelphia Chromosome'. This is a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22. Bcr-Abl codes for a receptor tyrosine kinase, which is active, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation. \n", "id": "438066", "title": "Oncogene"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438467", "text": "Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall\n\nThe Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall is the largest known super-structure in the universe.\n\nIt is a huge group of galaxies forming a giant sheet-like pattern. It is about 10 billion light-years long, 7.2 billion light-years wide, and almost 1 billion light-years thick. It is about 10 billion light-years away in the constellations of Hercules and Corona Borealis, hence its name.\n\nIt was discovered in November 2013 by mapping gamma-ray bursts. They are very luminous explosions of distant, massive stars, the most powerful explosions in the universe. A typical burst releases more energy in less than a tenth of a second than the Sun will in its whole life of 10 billion years. \n\nGamma-ray bursts are very rare: only one happens in a typical galaxy every few million years. The stars which cause these explosions are very massive, so the material required for them to be formed must be in great amounts. So, these explosions can be used to track down if there is a galaxy in that direction, or there is a large group of matter in there.\n\nBetween the years of 1997 to 2012, astronomers mapped these bursts in the sky, with the help of the robotic satellites Swift and Fermi which looks for gamma-ray bursts and measures their redshifts. In the map they produced, they noticed something interesting; 14 gamma-ray bursts have very similar redshifts and are very close to each other. This means that there is a very large group of galaxies and matter in the region. They say, from measuring these bursts, comes up with a very large structure measuring 10 billion light-years in diameter.\n\nFor comparison, the Milky Way, the galaxy we live in, measures only 100,000 light-years, and the distance from the Milky Way to the Andromeda Galaxy measures only 2.5 million light-years. The Huge-LQG (the Huge Large Quasar Group), the previous largest structure in the universe, is 4 billion light-years long.\n\nThe discovery of the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall contradicts a theory proposed by Albert Einstein known as the cosmological principle. The cosmological principle says that the entire universe is approximately equal; any two regions in the universe will look very similar, even if those two regions are very far apart, assuming those regions have sizes larger than 250 to 300 million light-years. Maximum sizes of structures must be around 1.2 billion light-years based on the meaning above, and no structure must be larger than that, assuming that matter is spreaded equally from the Big Bang. However, the structure, is eight times larger than the limit, contradicting the cosmological principle.\n\nThe structure also contradicts theories about the evolution of the universe. The structure is 10 billion light-years away, which means that we see the structure 10 billion years ago, when the universe is only 13.8 billion years old, and its light was just approaching us. The 13.8 billion year span of time is \"too short for a giant structure 10 billion light-years long to form\". Even Istvan Horvath, the discoverer of the structure, says he has no idea how the structure has formed in that amount of time. For now, the existence of the structure is still a mystery for cosmologists.\n", "id": "438467", "title": "Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall"}

Different art schools laid down rules on what a good painting or artwork shouls look like. Academic art was influenced by these rules, and was about applying them when creating a work of art. Academic art is a form of Realism in art. One of the main ideas that influenced academic art was that of Aristotle: A work of art should give a selective, but true copy of a part of reality. This idea was transformed into the concept of mimesis, or imitation. Together with thisidea, there were a number of subjects that were acceptable for painting or sculpture. Very often, the subjects came from mythology\n\nThe École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris had a lot of influence on the movement. At the time Neoclassicism and Romanticism were the main movements at the school. \n\nWith later art styles, especially that of impressionism, academic art losts its importance.\n\nWell known artists who painted in the academic art style include William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel, Eugene de Blaas, Edward Poynter, Wilhelm Bendz and Alexander Ivanov.\n", "id": "438479", "title": "Academic art"}

One way of doing this is to allow the government to pay the business for providing free services to the public. The business provides the services for free and then charges the government for compensation, in which the government agrees. Supporters of public-private partnerships argue that it reduces inefficiency and provides the free market with greater flexibility.\n", "id": "438756", "title": "Public-private partnership"}

Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. One conclusion was that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and so in some cases were warm-blooded. This was popularized by Ostrom's student Robert Bakker. The impression of dinosaurs as being slow, cold-blooded, small-brained reptiles needed to be rethought, at least for some of the carnivores.\n\nThese are the main points:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discovery of new feathered dinosaurs in China has kept the field in the forefront of research and populat attention.

This is when Afonso, 8th Count of Barcelos, was made Duke of Braganza. Alfonso (Alfonso I) was an illegitimate son of King João I of Portugal, of the House of Aviz. He was made a duke by his nephew, King Afonso V of Portugal. The feudal dukes quickly collected a fortune in properties, titles, and power. By the mid 1600s, the House was the most powerful in all of Portugal. It was also of the greatest houses of Iberia.\n\nThe House of Braganza became the reigning house of Brazil, first, when the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves was created in 1815. The United Kingdom lasted until 1822, when the Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal. The new Brazilian nation was led by Prince Pedro of Braganza, heir to the Portuguese throne, who ruled as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, as well as King Pedro IV of Portugal. Until 1835, the Portuguese Braganzas were still in the line of succession to the Brazilian throne. The House was deposed (removed) from the Brazilian throne, in 1889, when Brazil was proclaimed a republic.\n\nThe House continued to be the house to the Brazilian throne until 1921. This is when Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, daughter of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, died. Her claim passed to her son, Prince Pedro Henrique of Orléans and Braganza. Thus the House of Orléans-Braganza became the claimant house to the former monarchy of Brazil. Pedro Henrique died in 1981. The current claimant is his eldest son, Prince Luiz.\n\nIn Portugal, King Carlos I of Portugal was assassinated in 1908. Also killed in the attack was his eldest son. His younger son, Manuel II, became king. When the Portuguese Republic was established, in 1910, King Manuel II and the rest of the Braganzas went into exile.\n\n", "id": "438987", "title": "House of Braganza"}

It guarantees the protection of children from child trafficking. It also guarantees them safe adoption and a quick adoption process. \n\nIn May 1993 the proposal was presented at the seventeenth session of The Hague Convention. It became effective in 1995. The United States ratified the Hague Adoption Convention in December of 2007. Forty-six countries had ratified the treaty as of May of 2002. Thirteen more had yet to ratify it. Many countries which have not ratified the Convention do not permit foreign adoptions of their children nor adoptions of foreign children. For example Muslim countries do not permit foreign adoptions.\n\nAdopting children from one country into a family from another is a relatively new idea. It developed after World War II. By the 1970s it became a fairly common event. But it was soon recognized this was creating a number of legal and human problems. There were few domestic and international laws that adequately protected children's rights. The Hague Adoption Convention of 1993 addressed these concerns. The Convention gave the responsibility of providing the protection against child trafficking, safe adoption and a quick adoption process to the countries and to adoption agencies.\nThe convention also raised several ethical concerns. In a normal domestic adoption the child loses connections and identification with their biological family. In an international adoption a child may also lose identification with their nationality and ethnicity. Adoptions that span countries should be considered only after all efforts to place adopted children within their own country. UNICEF, by comparison, does not encourage international adoptions. They encourage nations to adopt within their own country.\n\nThere has been a sharp decline in international adoptions in the last few years. Romania, for one, has ended all foreign adoptions. Belarus and the Ukraine closed foreign adoptions for 2007. The 5000 adoptions from China in 2005 dropped to 4000 in 2006. Wars and natural disasters were the reasons for massive adoptions from the affected countries in the past. But the international community is no longer in favor of this as a solution. Adoptions from Africa are increasing, however. The number of Orphans from Liberia and Ethiopia have increased from 2006–2008. But the costs to adopt a child from another country have risen. This is due in part to the steps taken by the convention to prevent abuse of the system. \n\n", "id": "439023", "title": "Hague Adoption Convention"}

It prohibits wage based solely on gender. It was signed into law on June 10, 1963 by John F. Kennedy, who at that time was President of the United States. The principle was equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\n\nIn 1868 a major objective of the Knights of Labor was equal pay for men and women. During World War I and World War II the National War Labor Board had the power to set labor standards for American businesses. During the Korean War the Wage Stabilization Board set these standards. In all three cases they set equal pay policies for both sexes during . During the war, Rosie the Riveter was paid the same wage as males doing the same job. In 1919 two states, Michigan and Montana, passed equal pay laws. But it wasn't until after World War II that any other states followed their examples. The United States Women's Bureau, a part of the United States Department of Labor, was established in 1920. Since their start they have pushed for equal pay. In 1952 the National Committee for Equal Pay was established as a coalition of several woman's, labor, business, and civic group|groups. They began a campaign for new laws requiring equal pay. In 1945 the 79th Congress introduced an equal pay bill that did not pass. It was 18 years later when the 88th Congress passed such legislation. It was called the Equal Pay Act of 1963.\n\nAs an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 made it against Federal law to discriminate against workers on the basis of gender. This is when \"tasks require equal skill, effort, and responsibility under similar working conditions.\" President John F. Kennedy signed this into law on June, 10 1963. At the ceremony held in the Oval Office of the White House president Kennedy gave special recognition to several groups and individuals who worked towards this law. Among those honored were Congresswomen Edna Kelly and Edith Green, Assistant Secretary of Labor Esther Peterson, National Council of Negro Women President Dr. Dorothy Height and Business and Professional Women's Foundation President Dr. Minnie Miles.\n\nThe act passed largely due to Congress recognizing the changing in the United States. Male-supported households were becoming obsolete as more women entered the workforce. Higher divorce rates meant more female-supported households. But in the 1960s women earned only 60 cents for every dollar paid to male workers. The Equal Pay Act was intended as part of the solution to unequal pay. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, added more to the Equal Pay Act by making it unlawful to discriminate based on race \"or\" sex. Title VII also added White-collar worker to the Act.\n\nBy the 1970s women were earning 75 cents per male-earned dollar. According to US Department of Labor statistics, in 2007 the rate was still at about 75 cents. The gap between college educated women and college educated men has actually widened slightly. In Fortune 500 companies (top US corporations) women still hold only about 17% of top positions. As of 2010 the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that women who worked earned about 81 cents for every (full-time) male-earned dollar.\n", "id": "439025", "title": "Equal Pay Act of 1963"}

The Court ruled that a suspect in police custody must be informed of the right to consult with an attorney before and during questioning. They must be informed of the right against self-incrimination. They must also make certain the suspect understands these rights.\n\nThe Miranda warning (often abbreviated to \"Miranda,\" or \"Mirandizing\" a suspect) is the name of the formal warning that is required to be given by police in the United States to criminal suspects. It must be given before they are interrogated, in accordance with the \"Miranda\" ruling. Its purpose is to ensure the accused are aware of these rights under the U.S. Constitution. Also so they know they know they can invoke them at any time during the interview.\n\nOn 13 March 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested by police officers in Phoenix, Arizona. Miranda asked why he was being arrested but was given no answer. At the time of his arrest he was not charged with any crime. Ten days earlier an 18-year old girl claimed she had been sexually assaulted. When she talked to the police, her story changed several times. A few days later she was leaving work and saw a suspicious car she thought might be the same as the one used in her assault. A partial license plate led police to arrest and question Miranda. In a lineup, the girl could not identify her attacker but thought he looked similar to Miranda. During the interview with Miranda, police told the suspect he failed the lineup. After hours of interrogation Miranda finally signed a confession. Police also got Miranda to confess to two other cases of abduction and robbery which \"cleared\" two more cases.\n\nThe case of Ernesto Miranda and three other similar cases were heard before the Supreme Court. All four defendants did not have attorneys present when they were questioned. The decision was announced on 13 June 1966 by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Because of the important changes it made, he read the entire sixty pages. Four justices disagreed with the ruling. Their argument was that all the defendants confessed. Their opinion was that allowing lawyers in interrogations would prevent most suspects from confessing.\n\nAs a result Ernesto Miranda's first conviction was overturned but he faced a second trial on sexual assault and kidnapping charges in 1967. His confession could not be used against him but the prosecutor got Miranda's girlfriend to testify he told her he did it. She said it happened three days after his police confession. He was found guilty and got the same sentence again.\n\nThere are some 17,000 police departments in the United States. They use any of hundreds of different versions of the Miranda warning. These range from a few words to over 400. One reason is that many fall into vulnerable groups who do not always understand written or oral Miranda warnings. These include those who are deaf, do not speak or read English well, juveniles, mentally ill, and or the mentally challenged. The courts have been less than protective of the rights of these groups who may not have understood their Miranda rights.\n\nLike the Miranda warnings, other countries have written rights they give to suspects before police begin their questioning. They have procedures to insure a confession is valid in their court systems. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for example, provides that if someone is arrested they have certain rights. These are to be promptly told why they were arrested, told they have a right to retain legal council and the right of proof of habeas corpus (or be released from custody). \n", "id": "439036", "title": "Miranda v.

It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies.\n\nThe disease has three forms:\n\nLeishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of \"Leishmania\". Risk factors include poverty, malnutrition, deforestation and urbanization. All three types can be diagnosed by identifying the parasites under a microscope. The visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test.\n\nLeishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide. Another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies. Early treatment of people with the disease also helps prevent further spread. The treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired, the species of \"Leishmania\" and the type of infection. Medications used for the visceral form include: liposomal amphotericin B, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin, and miltefosine. For the cutaneous form, paromomycin, fluconazole or pentamidine can help.\n\nAs of 2014, about 12 million people are infected in some 98 countries. There are about 2 million new cases each year. Each year, between 20 thousand and 50 thousand people die from the disease. About 200 million people in Asia, Africa, South and Central America and southern Europe live in areas where the disease is common. The World Health Organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease.\n\nThe parasites that cause the disease also infect other mammals: The disease has been described in dogs, cats, rodents, cattle and horses. In addition to the mammal, the parasite needs an insect that spreads the parasite through its sting. \nLeishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies. These can transmit the infection \"Leishmania\". The sandflies inject the infective stage, metacyclic promastigotes, during blood meals (1). Metacyclic promastigotes that reach the puncture wound are phagocytized by macrophages (2) and transform into amastigotes (3). Amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues, depending in part on which \"Leishmania\" species is involved (4). The differences in the type of tissue affected are responsible for the different visible types of leishmaniasis. Sandflies become infected during blood meals on infected hosts when they ingest macrophages infected with amastigotes (5,6). In the sandfly's midgut, the parasites differentiate into promastigotes (7), which multiply, differentiate into metacyclic promastigotes, and migrate to the proboscis (8).\n\nThe genomes of three \"Leishmania\" species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite. \"Leishmania\" has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment. The new knowledge from these studies may help identify new targets for drugs and aid the development of vaccines.\n", "id": "439048", "title": "Leishmaniasis"}

Geocentrists accept that the earth is round. Before the 16th century most people believed in the theory of geocentrism. From Earth, it looks like the Sun and stars are moving across the sky. Geocentrism is connected with the Ancient Greek philosopher, Ptolemy. From the time of Ptolemy round the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD through to the time of Copernicus round the 15th and 16th Centuries AD educated people who knew the earth is round almost always believed the Geocentric theory of Ptolemy.\n\nFrom the 15th to the 17th century, astronomers, especially Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler, found evidence that the Earth is not fixed but moves round the Sun. That is called heliocentrism.\n\nGeocentrism has been proven to be incorrect. However, there are still geocentrists today. In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that about 25% of Americans believe in geocentrism.\n\n", "id": "439112", "title": "Geocentrism"}

Parasitic diseases spread by the flies include leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus \"Lutzomyia\". \"Lutzomyia\" often live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World sand flies in the genus \"Phlebotomus\" spread leishmaniasis.\n\nPhlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find. As far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first. Proteins and other nutrients in the blood enable the female to produce eggs. \n\nThe flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine; this distend capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood flow.\n\nOne blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter.\n\nSand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical. This helps them in escape notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439228", "text": "Road bicycle racing\n\nRoad bicycle racing is a sport where people race on bicycle along paved roads. Usually riders start the race at the same time. The winner is the first to the finish line at the end of the route.\n\nRoad bicycle racing is popular in Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. More recently, countries such as Kazakhstan, Australia, Venezuela, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland and the United States have also become very good at racing.\n\nRoad bicycle racing began as a sport in 1868. The first world championship was in 1893. Cycling has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896.\n\nAt the beginning the sport was popular in France, Spain, Belgium, and Italy. Some of the first races were Liège–Bastogne–Liège (started in 1892), Paris-Roubaix (1896), the Tour de France (1903), the Milan – San Remo and Giro di Lombardia (1905), the Giro d'Italia (1909) and the Tour of Flanders (1913). Nowadays there are many other races, but these historic races remain the most famous and many cyclists want to win them.\nSingle day races are held on one day. The race can be any distance from a few kilometres to over 200km. The race route may go from one place to another, or be a number of laps of a circuit. Some routes take the riders from a starting place and then finish with several laps of a circuit. This helps create excitement for the crowd at the finish.\n\nAn individual time trial is an event in which cyclists race alone against the clock. A team time trial is where teams of cyclists race against the clock. In both types of time trial, each cyclist or team starts the race at different times so that each start is fair and equal. The winner is the cyclist or team who finishes the race in the fastest time. Race distances vary from a few km to 60 and rarely more than 100 km.\n\nStage races are made up of races held for several days in a row. These races are called stages. The competitor with the lowest total time to finish all the stages is the overall winner. He or she is called the general classification (GC) winner. Stage races often have other awards, such as prizes for each stage winners, the points classification winner, and the \"King of the Mountains\" winner. Some stage races include time trials or team time trials. The stage winner is the first person to cross the finish line that day or the time trial rider (or team) with the lowest time on the course.\n\nThese races are very long single stage events. They usually last several days. The winner is the first one to cross the finish line. The riders take breaks on their own schedules. One of the best-known ultramarathons is the Race Across America (RAAM). It is a coast-to-coast non-stop, single-stage race. Riders cover approximately 3,000 miles in about a week.\n\nThe winner of the race is the first rider to cross the finish line. However many riders are grouped together in teams. Teams usually have commercial sponsors and are named after the main sponsor. For example some famous teams have been called T-Mobile, Rabobank, ONCE, and Lampre. There can be up to twelve team members in professional races. Team riders decide which team member has the best chance of winning the race. The choice will depend on how hilly the route is, the chance that everyone will finish together in a sprint, and other things. The rest of the team will work to help him or her win the race.\n\nIn professional races, radios are used so that the team can talk to each other and the team director. The team director often travels in a team car behind the race to monitor the whole race. The influence of radios on race tactics is controversial, and some people think radios have led to less exciting racing. In September 2009, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the governing body of pro cycling, voted to ban team radios in men's top level road racing.\n\nDifferent cyclists have different strengths and weaknesses. Therefore a rider may prefer different events over particular courses, and perform different roles within a team.\n\nThe main types of rider in road bicycle racing are:\n\nA number of tactics are used to win a race. Tactics can be different in single stage races and stage races.\n\nTactics are based on drafting. This is where a rider can reduce the effort needed to pedal by following the rider in front very closely. Riding with others in the main field, called the peloton, can save as much as 40% of the energy needed to ride alone. Riders can help each other to ride at high speed, or one rider can sit on a competitor's wheel, forcing him to do more work and get tired earlier. Some teams have a leader, and the rest of the team let him or her draft them to save their energy for the important bit of the race. Drafting is not allowed in individual time trials.\n\nA small group of riders sometimes \"breaks away\" in front of the main group. When they work together a small group can sometimes go faster than the peloton, if the peloton does not organise to chase them. The riders in the breakaway try to win the race, and in the breakaway there are fewer rivals for the win.\n\nIf a break does not succeed and the peloton catches up with them, a sprinter will usually win the race by sprinting faster than everyone else in the final few hundred metres. The team works together to make sure their sprinter is in a good position to win.\n\nClimbs are very good places for a single rider to try and leave the others behind. If the finish of the race is at the top of the climb, or not far past the top, a single rider can stay in front of the peloton and win the race.\n\nIn a stage race each day's stage is like a race within the bigger race. Each stage has a winner, either the first rider across the line, or in a time trial the rider or team with the quickest time. After each stage the general classification ranking is also worked out. The rider with the lowest total time for all the stages is the leader. The leader wears a special jersey for the next day's stage. \n\nIn multi-stage races, the GC leader will watch break-aways carefully if there is a rider close to him in the general classification. However often the GC leader will not react to a break-away. This happens if the escaping riders are a long way behind in the GC, and do not have a chance of taking the GC lead. Riders who are far behind often escapes because they want to win the stage or collect points for sprinting or climbing mountains. Riders may also go in a break-away to get television time for their team sponsors because the break-away often gets shown on the television coverage.\n\nThe most famous cycling race is the Tour de France, a stage race lasting three weeks. It takes place mostly in France, usually ending in Paris. Similar races are held in Italy (the Giro d'Italia) and Spain (the Vuelta a España). These three races make up the \"grand tours\".\n\nProfessional racing is controlled by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). In 2005 it started the UCI World Tour. The World Tour includes the Grand Tours and other large stage races such as Tour Down Under, Tour de Suisse, Paris–Nice and the Critérium de Dauphiné Libéré.\n\nSome one day races are also part of the World Tour: Milan – San Remo (Italy), Tour of Flanders (Belgium), Paris-Roubaix (France), Liège–Bastogne–Liège (Belgium) and Amstel Gold Race (Netherlands) in the spring, and Clásica de San Sebastián (Spain), HEW Cyclassics (Germany), Züri-Metzgete (Switzerland), Paris–Tours (France) and Giro di Lombardia (Italy) in the autumn season.\n\nCycling has been at the Olympics since 1896. There are usually road race and individual time trial events for both men and women.\n\nThe other important one-day race is the World Championships. The World Championships is held on a different course each year and ridden by national rather than sponsored teams. The winner wears a white jersey with coloured bands (often called \"rainbow bands\") around the chest.\n\nIn Europe and in the United States, cycle racing on the road is a summer sport. The season can start in early spring and end in autumn. \n\n", "id": "439228", "title": "Road bicycle racing"}

One of its first leaders was Terence V. Powderly. The Knights started as a secret society with many elaborate rituals. By 1878 they became more of an open group. They greatly expanded their membership in the 1880s.\n\nThe Knights of Labor began during the era of labor unions. The Garment Cutters Association of Philadelphia failed and was dissolved on 9 December 1869. Several members voted to form a new organization. They were convinced their new union needed more secrecy. As they drew up plans for the new organization each member was required to take an oath of secrecy. The title for the presiding officer was \"Master Worker\" and other titles were similarly named. On December 28th they adopted the name of Knights of Labor. The membership fees were $1. In 1878 they held their first general meeting. The early Knights took up campaigning for an 8-hour workday. Child labor exploitation was another of their causes. About 20% of the Knights were women and black workers. The members were mainly working class people. Certain professions were banned from membership. This included lawyers, bankers, and stockbrokers. As a measure of how these occupations were viewed, saloon keepers and gamblers were also excluded. \n\nWorkers in the 1880s began going on strike to gain better . Only about half belonged to unions. There were an average of about 500 strikes a year between 1881 and 1885. In 1886 this increased to over 1400 strikes. On 4 May 1886 in Chicago a peaceful rally was held to support workers striking for an eight-hour day. Someone threw a bomb into the crowd at Haymarket square. At least eight police officers and several civilians were killed. Labor unions were blamed even though the person throwing the bomb was never caught. The press and the American people held labor unions responsible. As one of the largest labor organizations the knights of Labor were blamed more than the other unions. The Haymarket affair caused the decline of the Knights of Labor even though they were not directly involved.

It was created in early 1918 by President Woodrow Wilson. It was made up of twelve members from business and labor. The were former President William Howard Taft and attorney Frank Walsh. Its purpose was to make sure labor strikes did not hurt the war effort. The board ended after the war in May 1919. The National War Labor Board was reestablished on January 12, 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. This board ended its duties in 1945.\n\nThe United States entered World War I in April 1917. Soon the government became concerned that labor strikes might stop the production of military equipment and supplies. In response President Woodrow Wilson created the National War Labor Board. The board recognized the worker's right to organize unions and bargain collectively. Former President Taft and labor attorney Frank Walsh were the co-chairmen. The board had little real power but depended on their ability to negotiate compromises between the two sides. They succeeded in preventing a number of strikes. After Germany was defeated the board was disbanded. In 1919 several strikes broke out in the coal and steel industries. The board supported an eight-hour day for workers and equal pay for equal work regardless of sex.\n\nThe National War Labor Board was started up again by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on January 12, 1942. The chairman was William Hammatt Davis. The board's job was to prevent labor disputes. Also to insure that higher wage settlements did not cause inflation. The board was generally favorable to unions. The board encouraged the use of fringe benefits instead of inflation-causing higher wages. In 1942 the board began a \"maintenance of membership\" policy which attracted new members into labor unions. Unions understood they had to minimize any activism among their members in order to gain favorable rulings from the NWLB. Dispite the efforts of labor unions there were wartime strikes. Most of these were unauthorized (by the unions) or wildcat strikes (non-union). The CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations), later part of the AFL-CIO, largely cooperated with the board. When the number of strikes peaked in 1944 CIO members maintained their no-strike pledge. By the time the war ended, membership in the CIO was nearly 5 million. The NWLB provided on an honorary basis, that is, without fees. But they encouraged paid arbitrators and by war's end most who arbitrated disputes were paid a fee of from $25–$100 per day. In 1945 the board was disbanded. A wave of strikes broke out just the same as when the NWLB ended in 1918.\n\n", "id": "439769", "title": "National War Labor Board"}

It is a chemical process, and the cement is a precipitate which crystallises in the spaces between the matrix of grains. Silica (SiO) and calcium carbonate (CaCO) are the most common types of cement.\n\nIons carried in groundwater precipitate to form new crystalline material in sediment pores: this is how \"sediment\" becomes \"rock\". The new pore-filling minerals form \"bridges\" between original sediment grains, thereby binding them together. So \"sand\" becomes \"sandstone\", and \"gravel\" becomes \"conglomerate\". \n\nCementation occurs mainly below the water table. Large volumes of pore water must pass through sediment pores for new mineral cements to crystallize and so millions of years are generally required to complete the cementation process. \n\nSedimentation does not always occur. Many quarries used for sand and gravel have them as loose particles and stones, just as if they came from a present-day beach. In England, most of these quarries are from beds laid down in the Jurassic, 150+ million years ago.

According to the government of Greenland, one person in five has attempted suicide. Because of this, the Greenland government has taken a number of steps to reduce the suicide rate. One example is roadside posters.\n\nThe number of suicides in Greenland began to rise in the 1970s. Before that it had been very low. It kept getting higher until 1986. In 1986, suicide was the leading cause of death in several towns, such as Sarfannguit. Before 1970, the rate of suicide in Greenland had been very low. But by 1994, it had become one of the highest in the world. The rate was 107 per 100,000 persons committing suicide per year. Government data in 2010 suggested that almost one suicide occurred a week.\n\nAn article was published in the journal \"BMC Psychiatry\" in 2009. It reported that 1351 suicides took place in Greenland during the 35 years (1968–2002). The study noted seasonal changes in the suicide rate. Suicides were higher in June and lower in the winter months. Suicide rates in northern parts of West Greenland are higher than in southern parts. Suicide rates are higher for men than women. Most of the people committing suicide are young men between the ages of 15-24. Unlike in other Western countries, the suicide rate in Greenland goes down with age.\n\nSeveral reasons are blamed for Greenland's high rate of suicide. These including alcoholism, depression, poverty, poor relationships with partners and dysfunctional parental homes. The higher summer suicide rate is blamed on insomnia caused by longer periods of daylight.\n\nThe increase in suicide rates started about the time television appeared in Greenland. But it may be more the \"modernization package\" in general that is causing the problem. Culture clash between the traditional culture and modern Western culture is also assumed to be a factor.\n\nThe most common methods were hanging (46%) and shooting (37%). Other methods include jumping from heights, cutting with sharp objects, drowning, overdose of medication, and poisoning.\n\nGreenland's Government and other organizations have made a number of efforts to prevent suicides. There are different associations that provide support for people that feel suicidal. Measures include posters placed along the roads, which read: \"The call is free. No one is alone. Don't be alone with your dark thoughts. Call.\" Suicide consultants are used to show films discouraging teenage suicide attempts.\n", "id": "439987", "title": "Suicide in Greenland"}

It was created after the murder of Megan Kanka. Individual states decide what information will be made available and how it should be distributed. Most give out the offender's name, picture, address, Prison date, and nature of the crime. The information is often displayed on free public websites, but can be published in newspapers, distributed in pamphlets, or through various other means.\n\nRichard and Maurine Kanka and their three children lived in a small town in New Jersey. On 29 July 1994 their daughter Megan was lured into a neighbor's house to see a non-existent puppy. There she was raped and murdered by her , Jesse Timmendequas. Timmendequas had just recently been released from prison after his second conviction on sexual offenses against children. He had served six of the ten years of his sentence. Searches for the girl turned up nothing. The local police quickly focused on three known sex offenders living across the street from the missing girl. Police released two of the suspects when they verified where they were. Timmendequas became the main suspect. He was released after several hours of . After obtaining a detectives searched Timmendequas's trash and found a piece of Megan Kanka's clothing. Timmendequas was questioned again and after several hours told police \"She's in the park.\" When police then asked if she was still alive Timmendequas said \"No, she's dead. I put a over her head.\"\n\nThe Kankas were outraged to find they were living across the street from a convicted child sex offender. Two days after her murder, the parents of Megan Kanka started the \"Megan Nichole Kanka Foundation\". The mission of the foundation is to identify the location of convicted child sex offenders in every community. \n\nMaurine Kanka began pushing for laws disclosing the need to notify residents of the presence of convicted sex offenders in their communities. New Jersey was the first state to pass a \"Megan's law.\" In 1995 the Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld the State law. The continuing efforts resulted in President Bill Clinton signing the federal version of \"Megan's Law.\" The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Law, or \"Megan's Law\", was signed in May 1996. This was the first part. The second, or notification part of the law, was signed on 13 November 1996. It gave states one year to pass state versions of Megan's law. The District of Columbia and forty-seven states met the deadline and passed their own versions of the law. The notification portion of the law requires states to make public information about all sex offenders. They may each choose how they want to implement that part. Under the law sex offenders are grouped in risk bands based on the nature and details of their offense. The public is not notified of 'low risk' sexual offenders. Information on 'Medium risk' offenders is disclosed to schools and . 'High risk' sexual offenders' information is disclosed to the public. \n\nMegan's law is not without problems. As many as 20% of offenders have disappeared after providing false addresses. Others make sure to offend outside their own neighborhoods where they are not readily identified. Some states release information on offenders only if officials there decide it is necessary. While many states are open and disclose offender information readily, some are very restrictive as to who the information is released to. Many offender databases are inaccurate and often mistake one person for another. s can make sex offense charges go away when negotiating with prosecutors. They sometimes get 'pled down' to lesser offenses.\n\n", "id": "440078", "title": "Megan's Law"}

It is used mainly in the United States to describe buying something and quickly reselling (or \"flipping\") it for profit. It can apply to any asset but is often applied to real estate and initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nReal estate is bought and sold every day. The seller arranges for a realtor to advertise and sell their property. The realtor charges between 4 and 7 percent of the selling price as a commission. The sale is conducted between the owner of the property or house, and the who wants to purchase it. \n\nFlipping is used by real estate investors to describe someone purchasing a property then selling it quickly for a profit. Usually the investor will pay for improvements to make the property more attractive. The investor must have the money to buy the house and pay for the improvements. Realtors neither buy the house or resell it (although a realtor can also be a flipper). They simply broker the sale.\n\nFlipping involves a good deal of risk for investors. They must know the value of a property and not pay too much. They have to be careful not to invest too much in improvements. Very often run-down properties or are sold at auctions. The buyer may not be able to inspect the property before buying it. This can lead to additional costs to fix problems that could not be seen. A property needs to sell quickly or there is no quick return on their money. \n\nThere are also many risks for buyers of flipped homes.\n\nInitial public offerings are when a private company sells shares of stock to the public for the first time (called going public). Flipping is buying stocks and selling within the first 2 to 3 days after the company went public. The hope is the price will go up rapidly. Underwriters want investors want to hold onto stocks. They may blacklist investors who flip too many stocks even though it is legal.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the term is used to describe Members of Parliament switching their 'second home' between several houses. This was to maximize their taxpayer funded allowances.\n\n", "id": "440185", "title": "Flipping"}

They were discovered in the first half of the 19th century in the Old Red Sandstone of Britain. \"Cepalaspis\" was described and pictured in a popular work on the rocks and fossils of the Old Red Sandstone.\n\nIt was a medium-sized fish that lived in freshwater streams and estuaries of the early Devonian. Some of the fossils are well-preserved, and so we know quite a bit about its anatomy. Its armour was on the dorsal side, and its mouth on the ventral side. Therefore, it is likely that it was a bottom-feeder, nosing about in the mud of a river. It had a typical vertebrate type of brain, with front, middle and rear regions, and nerves to and from sense organs and muscles in the head region.\n\nIts pineal opening between its eyes was probably a light-sensitive organ. On its skull are three areas which obviously had a special function. Many modern fish which live in muddy rivers use both pressure-sensitive lateral lines, and also electrical fields to sense movement. \"Cephalaspis\" had no lateral lines, but the three fields on its skull were no doubt sensory, for sensing pressure change or electrical fields.\n\nThe animal had semi-circular canals to sense balance (one of the functions of our own semi-circular canals). They were capable of sustained swimming, and short rapid bursts. Almost all the fossils are found in strata laid down in freshwater conditions, so the various species live in rivers, streams connected with lakes and estuaries.\n", "id": "440211", "title": "Cephalaspis"}

He was later appointed to the Supreme Court in 1937. However, Black's proposal to require employers to adopt a thirty-hour workweek met stiff resistance. In 1938 a revised version of Black's proposal was passed that adopted an eight-hour day and a forty-hour workweek. It allowed workers to earn wages for an extra four hours of overtime as well. According to the act, workers must be paid minimum wage and overtime pay must be one-and-a-half times regular pay. Children under eighteen cannot do certain dangerous jobs.

They grow into juveniles or parr and remain in fresh water for a number of years while growing. When they leave fresh water they are called smolts. Smolts leave the streams and move into the ocean for feeding and growth. The post-smolts change from territorial behavior to that of open ocean, possibly shoaling, fish. Their mortality rate while in the ocean is very high. The rate is from 90% to as high as 99%. After 1–5 years at sea they return to spawn in the same streams they were born in.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440762", "text": "Long-term memory\n\nLong-term memory (LTM) is our memory of past events. It follows from short-term memory, and involves the growth of nerve synapses which are very long-lasting.\n\nThe brain does not store memories in one unified structure, as might be seen in a computer's hard disk drive. Instead, different types of memory are stored in different regions of the brain. Long term memory is typically divided up into two major headings: explicit memory and implicit memory.\n\nExplicit or 'declarative' memory refers to memories which can be consciously recalled such as facts and knowledge. These are partly encoded by the hippocampus, stored elsewhere. Exactly where is unknown, but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate. Research shows that amnesiac patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe performed more poorly on explicit learning tests than did healthy controls. However, the same patients performed at the same rate as healthy controls on \"implicit\" learning tests. This implies that the medial temporal lobe is heavily involved in explicit learning, but not in implicit learning. \n\nImplicit or procedural memory refers to the use of objects or movements of the body, such as how exactly to use a pencil, drive a car, or ride a bicycle. This type of memory is encoded and it is presumed stored by the striatum and other parts of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is believed to mediate procedural memory and other brain structures and is largely independent of the hippocampus. The parietal and occipital regions are associated with implicit memory.\n\nThe memory for events that evoke a particularly strong emotion may involve both declarative and procedural memory processes. Emotional memories are consciously available, but elicit a powerful, unconscious physiological reaction. Research indicates that the amygdala is extremely active during emotional situations, and acts with the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the encoding and consolidation of emotional events.\n\nWorking memory (STM) is not part of long term memory, but is important for long term memory to work. Working memory holds and works on information for a short period before it is either forgotten or put into long term memory. Then, to remember something from long term memory, it must come back into working memory. If working memory is overloaded it can affect the encoding of long term memory. \n", "id": "440762", "title": "Long-term memory"}

People who like the Human Era system say that it makes for easier geological, archaeological, dendrochronological and historical dating.

The \"Human Era\" was first thought of by the scientist Cesare Emiliani in 1993 (11993 HE).\n\nCesare Emiliani's reasons for wanting a new calendar include:\n\nInstead, HE places its epoch to 10,000 BC. This is a rough approximation of the start of the current geologic epoch, the Holocene (the name means \"entirely recent\"). The reason for this is that human civilization (e.g., the first settlements, agriculture, etc.) is believed to have started within this time. All important dates in human history can then be listed using a simple increasing date scale with smaller dates always before larger dates.\n\nConversion to the Human Era from Julian or Gregorian AD years can be achieved by adding 10,000.

The term was translated from French; A.M. Ampère used the term \"cinématique\". He constructed the term form the Greek , kinema (movement, motion), derived from , kinein (to move). The study of \"kinematics\" is often referred to as the \"geometry of motion.\"\n\nTo describe motion, kinematics studies the paths of points, lines and other geometric objects in space, and some of their properties such as velocity and acceleration. Astrophysics uses kinematics to describe the motion of celestial bodies and systems. Mechanical engineering, robotics and biomechanics use it to describe the motion of systems composed of joined parts such as an engine, a robotic arm or the skeleton of the human body.\n\nThe study of kinematics can be abstracted into purely mathematical functions. It is possible to represent rotation with elements of the unit circle in the complex plane. Other planar algebras are used to represent the shear mapping of classical motion in absolute time and space and to represent the Lorentz transformations of relativistic space and time. Mathematicians have developed a science of kinematic geometry, which uses time as a parameter.\n\nCertain geometric transformations which are called rigid transformations have been developed to describe the movement of components of a mechanical system. These transformations simplify the derivation of its equations of motion, and is central to dynamic analysis.\n\nKinematic analysis is the process of measuring the kinematic quantities used to describe motion. In engineering, kinematic analysis may be used to find the range of movement for a given mechanism, and, working in reverse, kinematic synthesis designs a mechanism for a desired range of motion. In addition, \"kinematics\" applies algebraic geometry to the study of the mechanical advantage of a mechanical system, or mechanism.\n", "id": "440972", "title": "Kinematics"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441081", "text": "China Airlines Flight 611\n\nChina Airlines Flight 611 was a scheduled international passenger flight from Taipei to Hong Kong, China. On May 25, 2002, the Boeing 747-209B airplane broke apart while flying over the Taiwan Straits and crashed into the water. It happened about 25 minutes after takeoff. The accident was caused by metal fatigue in the rear part of the plane. This was traced back to an incorrect repair that was done 22 years before the accident. All 225 people on board the plane were killed.\n\nThe Boeing 747-209B that flew China Airlines Flight 611 was registered as B-1866. This was changed to B-18255 on May 18, 1999. The plane was delivered to China Airlines on July 31, 1979. It was powered by 4 Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. At time of crash it had flown for 64,394 hours, taking off and landing 21,180 times.\n\nOn February 7, 1980 the tail of the plane struck the runway while landing at Hong Kong airport. The plane was then ferried back to Taipei. A temporary repair was done on February 8, 1980, while a permanent repair was done from May 23 to 26, 1980. Later it was discovered the repair was not done to Boeing repair standards. It was also discovered that from 1997 a total of 29 corrosion inspections were not completed. When the repair patch was recovered from the crash site, there was evidence that deep scratches had been polished out, thinning the metal. Several fatigue cracks were found in the scratches. Crash estimate a crack of about 71 inches may have caused the plane to break up.\n\nThe captain was Yi Ching-Fung (In Traditional Chinese, 易清豐), who was 51 years old. He joined China Airlines in 1991 before becoming a captain in 1997. He had flown for 10148 hours. First Officer Hsieh Ya Shiung (In Traditional Chinese, 謝亞雄), who was 52 years old, joined China Airlines in 1990. He had flown for a total of 10173 hours.\n\nAs the Boeing 747-200B was an older type of airplane, a flight engineer is needed. The flight engineer on this flight is Sen Kuo Chao (In Traditional Chinese, 趙盛國). He joined China Airlines in 1977 and had a total flying time of 19117 hours.\n\nAll three pilots had more than 24 hours of rest before this flight.\n\nOn the flight to Hong Kong, there were 190 Taiwanese passengers. Of the rest 16, 9 were from People's Republic Of China and 5 were from Hong Kong. There were also 1 Singaporean and 1 Swiss.\n\nAll 19 crew came from Taiwan.\n\nOn May 25, 2002, B-18255 was actually going to be sold to Orient Thai Airlines. This was the plane's last day of service with China Airlines. Takeoff was at 3.07 pm, and the plane was cleared to climb to 20,000 feet. At 3.16 pm the plane was again cleared to climb and maintain 35,000 feet. At about 3.30 pm, the plane was about to reach 35,000 feet when it suddenly disappeared from the radar systems of the air traffic controllers. Communications were also lost. No distress signals were sent out. However, two Cathay Pacific planes nearby received flight 611's emergency location-indicator signals.\n\nLater, the investigators discovered that flight 611 broke apart in mid-air when as it was reaching 35,000 feet. All 225 people on the plane were killed. This was one of the worst disaster in aviation history involving explosive decompression. China Airlines has had nine fatal crashes between 1970 and 2002. This is the worst record in commercial aviation.\nShortly after the plane vanished, Taiwan launched one of the country's largest search-and-rescue operations. As the plane broke apart in mid-air, wreckage were spread over a large area and this makes it difficult to recover all the wreckage. When the search-and-rescue teams arrived, they realised they could not do anything-all 225 people onboard were dead.\n\nWhen there was no more hope for survivors, the teams started to recover wreckage and human remains. These were sent to Penghu Islands. There, the wreckage were numbered and the human remains were sent for identification. In the end, out of 225 people on board, 175 bodies were recovered. 50 remain in the sea.\nThe investigation of the crash was by Aviation Safety Council (ASC) of Taiwan. During the investigation, it was found that the crash of China Airlines Flight 611 was similar with another crash, TWA flight 800. Investigators found out that both crashes had similar points such as:\nHowever, unlike flight 800, investigators determined that flight 611 was not caused by a fuel tank explosion.\n\nAs the investigation continues, both recorders of the flight were recovered. However, investigators could not find any possible cause from the recorders as the flight data recorder showed that the plane was working properly before it broke up. The cockpit voice recorder also showed nothing unusual. The recorder started ten minutes before the flight. After a last sentence said by captain Yi Ching-Fung, \"two thousand\" at 3.26pm, the recorder captured nothing more spoken. Then, the sound of the plane breaking up was heard at about 3.29pm.\n\nWith nothing possible showing up, investigators decided to use a method that the investigators of TWA Flight 800 used. Using several pieces of wreckage, investigators were able to use a computer and find out which piece fell off first. This provided a major clue-the wreckage from the back of the plane fell first. So, investigators began looking for wreckage from the back of the plane.\n\nFinally, investigators managed to find a piece of wreckage which was damaged in the tailstrike incident in 1980. A doubler plate was placed over the scratches that the tailstrike caused. The piece, item number 640, was sent to Taipei for further examination.\n\nWhen investigators removed the doubler that was installed over Item 640, they found out that the scratches, caused by the tailstrike 22 years ago, were still there. This was not the proper way to repair the damage from the tailstrike. From this investigators found out what really happened 22 years ago.\n\nAccording to the Boeing SRM (Structural Repair Manual), the scratches should be sanded down. But as the scratches caused by the tailstrike were too deep, the correct way to repair is to cut out the damaged section, then put a doubler plate that is 30% larger than the section that was cut out. However, in the repair of the accident plane, the workers did not follow the instructions. Instead they just placed a doubler plate over the damaged section, which was not 30% larger than the section that was supposed to be cut out. This weakened the structure behind the doubler. The workers then made one more mistake, by writing in the repair log that the repair was done correctly. So, anyone reading the log book would assume that the repair was done correctly and that the workers had cut out the damaged section and replaced it.\n\nOver the years, the cracks under the doubler grew worse and worse. Every time the plane took off and landed the cracks increased in length, in the end reaching 2.3 metres. Then, on May 25, 2002, the cracks reached the breaking point. It grew in all directions and caused the whole tail to break away from the plane. The plane went into a steep dive and was torn apart.\n\nAnother possible reason why the mistake could not be found out is that the maintenance procedures of China Airlines. In 1988, the roof of Aloha Airlines Flight 243 peeled off when the plane was cruising, causing explosive decompression. The plane landed safely. After the accident, the FAA ordered that the airlines evaluate again all the previous repairs that was done on planes.\n\nChina Airlines began evaluating the repairs in 2001. The workers took photographs of 31 different doublers on different 747s, including the one on B-18255. Although there was a stain on the doubler, the workers chose to ignore it. The stain was actually caused by smoke as passengers were allowed to smoke until 1995. The smoke was forced out through the crack and nicotine stained the plane's skin. It was said in Mayday that if China Airlines went on to find out how the stain formed, they may find out the cracks and prevent the crash.\n\nThe workers then scheduled the next maintenance check, 7C, on November 2, 2002. The check would definitely have led the workers to find out the cracks. However, the plane crashed 5 months before the check.\n\nChina Airlines no longer uses 611 as its flight number.\n\n", "id": "441081", "title": "China Airlines Flight 611"}

Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, and it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance.\n\nSarin can be lethal even at very low concentrations. Death comes in 1 to 10 minutes after breathing it in. It paralyses lung muscles. Antidotes, such as atropine, can save a person if given immediately.\nPeople who get a non-lethal dose, but do not get immediate treatment, may suffer permanent neurological damage.\nLike other nerve agents, sarin attacks the nervous system by stopping nerve endings in muscles from switching off. Death will usually occur as a result of asphyxia due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing function.\n\nIn vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, where signals are transmitted between neurons from the central nervous system to muscle fibres.\n\nNormally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase. This allows the muscle to relax. Inhibition of cholinesterase means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre. This stops breathing.\n\nSarin was discovered in 1938 in Wuppertal-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at IG Farben attempting to create stronger pesticides. it is the most toxic of the four G-Series nerve agents made by Germany.\n\nIn mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the chemical warfare section of the German Army Weapons Office, which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use.

It controls what gets from the bloodstream into the brain, and what does not.\n\nFor example, things that the brain needs to survive (water, glucose, and amino acids) can get through the barrier. However, the barrier stops many harmful things, like bacteria and viruses, from getting into the brain. This helps protect the brain from getting an infection.\n\nThe blood-brain barrier is formed by capillary endothelial cells. It allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion. It also allows the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids which are crucial to nerve function. On the other hand, the blood-brain barrier may prevent the entry of neurotoxins by means of an active transport mechanism. \n\nA few small areas in the brain do not have a blood-brain barrier. \n\nPaul Ehrlich, a German doctor, discovered the blood-brain barrier. He injected dye into mice's bloodstreams. The dye got to every organ except the brain. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting through to the brain. Then one of Ehrlich's students injected the dye right into the mice's brains. This time the brain turned blue, but no other organs did. The blood-brain barrier had stopped the dye from getting out of the brain into the bloodstream (which would have carried the dye to every other organ in the body).\n\nThe blood–brain barrier protects the brain from many common infections. Infections of the brain are rare. If they do happen, they are often serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies (which the body's immune system makes to fight infections) are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier. Also, many antibiotics cannot pass through the BBB to kill the infection in the brain. \n\nOne way to get medications into the brain is to inject them into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF helps protect the brain and spinal cord. However, it does not actually touch the brain. Instead, two of the layers that protect the brain and spinal cord hold the CSF. Because of this, even if medications are injected right into the CSF, they still do not get into the brain very well. \n\nSome bacteria, viruses, and other things can get through the blood-brain barrier and damage the brain.

This means: for every element \"b\" in the codomain \"B\" there is exactly one element \"a\" in the domain \"A\" such that \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\". Another name for bijection is 1-1 correspondence.\n\nThe term \"bijection\" and the related terms \"surjection\" and \"injection\" were introduced by Nicholas Bourbaki. In the 1930s, he and a group of other mathematicians published a series of books on modern advanced mathematics.\n\nFormally:\nThe element formula_5 is called the image of the element formula_6. \nThe element formula_6 is called a pre-image of the element formula_5. \n\nNote: Surjection means minimum one pre-image. Injection means maximum one pre-image. So bijection means exactly one pre-image.\n\nCardinality is the \"number\" of elements in a set. The cardinality of \"A\"={X,Y,Z,W} is 4. We write #\"A\"=4. \n\nFormally:\nLet \"f\" : \"A\" → \"B\" be a bijection. The inverse function \"g\" : \"B\" → \"A\" is defined by if \"f\"(\"a\")=\"b\", then \"g\"(\"b\")=\"a\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441537", "text": "Historical linguistics\n\nHistorical linguistics is the study of language change. It has five main concerns:\n\nModern historical linguistics dates from the late 18th century. It grew out of the earlier discipline of philology, the study of ancient texts and documents dating back to antiquity.\n\nAt first, historical linguistics was comparative linguistics. The focus was on the well-known Indo-European languages, many of which had long written histories. Scholars also studied the Uralic languages, another European language family for which less early written material exists. \n\nSince then, there has been linguistic work outside of European languages, such as on the Austronesian languages and various families of Native American languages. \n\nComparative linguistics is now part of a discipline of historical linguistics. For the Indo-European languages, comparative study is now a well-developed field. Most research is being carried out on the later development of these languages, such as the development of the modern standard varieties.\n\nSome scholars have done studies attempting to establish super-families. They have, for example, linked Indo-European, Uralic, and other families into Nostratic. These attempts have not been accepted widely. The information needed to establish relatedness becomes thinner the further back in time we go. The time-depth of linguistic methods is limited due to chance word resemblances and variations between language groups. Back to around 10,000 years scholars can trace language changes. The dating of the various proto-languages is also difficult; several methods are available for dating, but only approximate results can be got.\n", "id": "441537", "title": "Historical linguistics"}

The idea is that Nostratic was spoken after the ice sheets melted, but before people spread out throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nMany of today's languages are descendants of Nostratic, so it is thought. These include the Indo-European, Uralic, Altaic and Kartvelian languages. Usually also included are the Afroasiatic languages native to North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East, and the Dravidian languages of the Indian subcontinent. \n\nThe name \"Nostratic\" is derived from the Latin \"nostrates\" \"fellow countrymen\". The idea was expanded in the 1960s by Soviet linguists, called the \"Moscovite school\" by Bomhard. It has received renewed attention in English-speaking academia since the 1990s.\n\nThe hypothesis is controversial and has varying degrees of acceptance amongst linguists worldwide.

The customs and significance of eye contact vary widely between cultures, with religious and social differences often altering its meaning greatly.\n\nEye contact and facial expressions give social and emotional information. People, perhaps without consciously doing so, probe each other's eyes and faces for positive or negative mood signs. Sometimes, the meeting of eyes arouses strong emotions.\n\nEye contact is also an important element in flirting, where it may serve to establish and gauge the other's interest in some situations.\n\nIn traditional societies, the role of women is usually very different from men. So, women lower their eyes, and do not to look directly at a man's face. Lustful glances at the opposite sex, young or adult, are forbidden. \n\nAnother social difference is that of status. Japanese children are taught in school to direct their gaze at the region of their teacher's Adam's apple or tie knot. As adults, Japanese lower their eyes when speaking to a superior as a gesture of respect.\n\nIn many cultures, such as East Asia and Nigeria, it is respectful not to look the dominant person in the eye, but in Western culture this can be interpreted as being \"shifty-eyed\", or untrustworthy.\n", "id": "441688", "title": "Eye contact"}

One of the most popular and highest-paid Indian celebrities, she has established a career in Bollywood films, and is the recipient of two Filmfare Awards.\n\nDeepika Padukone was born on 5 January 1986 in Copenhagen,Denmark to Konkani-speaking parents. Her father, Prakash, is a former badminton player of international repute, and her mother, Ujjala, is a travel agent. Her younger sister, Anisha, is a golfer. Her paternal grandfather, Ramesh, was a secretary of the Mysore Badminton Association. The family relocated to Bangalore, India, when Padukone was a year old. She was educated at Bangalore's Sophia High School, and completed her pre-university education at Mount Carmel College. She subsequently enrolled at the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology, but later quit it due to scheduling conflicts with her modelling career.\n\nPadukone's first screen appearance was in Himesh Reshammiya's music video \"Naam Hai Tera\" in 2005. Padukone made her film debut by playing the titular protagonist in the Kannada film \"Aishwarya\" (2006). Her first Hindi film release came the following year with Farah Khan's melodrama \"Om Shanti Om\", in which she played dual roles opposite Shah Rukh Khan. For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and also received a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Her sole film role in 2008 was as one of Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in \"Bachna Ae Haseeno\".\n\nPadukone's first film release of 2009, the kung fu comedy \"Chandni Chowk to China\" opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a box office flop. However, her next release, Imtiaz Ali's romance \"Love Aaj Kal\" grossed worldwide, and garnered her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Padukone had five film releases in 2010. The comedy \"Housefull\" was a commercial success, though her other four releases that year failed at the box office. The series of poorly received films continued with both her 2011 releases, the drama \"Aarakshan\" and the comedy \"Desi Boyz\".\n\nThe role of an impulsive party-girl in Homi Adajania's \"Cocktail\" (2012) proved to be a breakthrough for Padukone. Critics praised her performance and she received several acting nominations for it. The year 2013 was key for Padukone; three of her four releases that year earned over in India. Among these were two of the highest-grossing Bollywood films of all timethe romantic comedy \"Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\" and the action-comedy \"Chennai Express\". She also won the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying Leela, a character based on Juliet, in \"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\" (2013). In 2014, Padukone appeared in \"Kochadaiiyaan\", an animation film in Tamil, which was shot using motion capture technology. Also that year, she played a young widow in Adajania's \"Finding Fanny\" and a bar dancer in the ensemble heist film \"Happy New Year\".

He was leader of his party from 1967 until 1976.\n\nIn 1979 at the Central Criminal Court in London, Thorpe was acquitted of conspiracy to murder model Norman Scott.\n\nIn 1961, Norman Scott (b. 12 February 1940), a former model, met Thorpe while working as a stable lad. He claimed that he and Thorpe had a sexual relationship between 1961 and 1963, when homosexual acts were illegal in Britain. \n\nEnquiries led to Thorpe and three others being charged with conspiracy to murder Scott. During the investigation, an antique firearms collector, Dennis Meighan, confessed he had been hired by a representative of a person called \"a Mr Big in the Liberal Party\" to kill Scott for £13,500. Meighan later claimed that his 1975 oral confession was significantly shortened when it was offered to him for signing: \"I read the statement, which did me no end of favours, but it did Jeremy Thorpe no end of favours as well, because it left him completely out of it...\" \n\nThe judge's summing-up was widely criticised for its bias, and it made headlines when he described Scott as \"a crook, an accomplished liar ... a fraud\". The four defendants were all acquitted on 22 June 1979. Dennis Meighan was never called to give evidence and remained silent until 2014, when he acknowledged his involvement and commented: \"It was a cover-up, no question, but it suited me fine\".\n\nThe Scott Affair ruined Thorpe, who resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, and was defeated at the next general election in 1979.\n\nThorpe was married to Caroline Allpass from 1968 until she was killed in a car crash in 1970. The couple's son was born in 1969. Thorpe was married to pianist Marion Stein (1926-2014) from 1973 until her death. Thorpe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

Through her movie career, she has become one of Bollywood's famous actresses and one of the most popular celebrities in India. She began her acting career in the 2010 movie \"Teen Patti\" for which she earned a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut category. \n\nThen, she followed it with her first leading role in the teen drama \"Luv Ka The End\" (2011) in which she won the Stardust award for Best Actress for her role. In 2013, she received appreciation for her performance in the romantic drama \"Aashiqui 2\", her first successful movie, which earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination, among others. Besides acting in movies, Kapoor is active in humanitarian work and is a celebrity endorser for several brands.\n\nKapoor was born on March 3, 1989 in Mumbai. She is the daughter of actors Shakti Kapoor and Shivangi Kolhapure Kapoor. She is the sister of actor Siddhanth Kapoor, niece of actresses Padmini and Tejaswini Kolhapure and grandniece of singers Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle and Usha Mangeshkar. On her father's side, Kapoor is of Punjabi descent, and on her mother's side, she is of Marathi ancestry. Like her mother, she has stated that she is a complete Marathi.\n\nShe did her schooling at Jamnabai Narsee School and later moved to the American School of Bombay. While there, she played soccer and handball competitively. At the age of eighteen she enrolled at Boston University majoring in theatre studies but later quit in-order to pursue her acting career.\n\nKapoor debuted in the 2010 movie \"Teen Patti\" alongside Amitabh Bachchan and Ben Kingsley. She played the role of a studious geek, who obeys her professor to gamble in cards, which later proved to be her biggest mistake of her life. Despite, the movie failed to do well at the box office Kapoor had been able to receive appreciation and a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance.\n\nAfter her debut, she signed a three-movie deal with Yash Raj Films and featured in their 2011 teen comedy \"Luv Ka The End\" with Taaha Shah. Kapoor played the lead role of a college student who plots against her boyfriend after he betrays her. The movie underperformed at the box office and gained mixed reviews from critics. However, her performance received appreciation and the Stardust Award for Best Actress.\n\nLater she was offered the lead role in \"Aurangzeb\" as a part of her deal with Yash Raj. But she went on to sign Mahesh Bhatt's \"Aashiqui 2\" instead, thereby cancelling the three-movie contract with Yash Raj Films.\n\nIn 2013, Kapoor appeared in the romantic musical drama \"Aashiqui 2\", the sequel to the 1990 classic \"Aashiqui\". Her character, Aarohi Keshav Shirke, is a small-town bar singer who becomes a successful playback artist with the help of a singing superstar Rahul Jaykar (Aditya Roy Kapur). The movie was a major box office success with a global revenue of 1.09 billion and was credited as a \"blockbuster\" by Box Office India. Kapoor earned praises and rose to fame for her role. She received several nominations in the Best Actress category, including one at the Filmfare awards.\n\nThat year, she also appeared in a supporting role for the romantic comedy movie \"Gori Tere Pyaar Mein\", playing the fiancée of Sriram Venkat (played by Imran Khan). Kapoor is simultaneously filming for two projects Ekta Kapoor's production \"The Villain \"where she will feature opposite Sidharth Malhotra, and Vishal Bhardwaj's adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" titled \"Haider\", with Shahid Kapoor, Irrfan Khan and Tabu. In 2014, she was confirmed to play the lead role in the sequel of 3D dance movie \"ABCD (Any Body Can Dance) \"alongside Varun Dhawan, Prabhu Deva and Remo D'souza.\n\nKapoor's off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She is known in the Indian media for being publicly outspoken and assertive. She is recognised for her contributions to the movie industry through her fashion style and movie roles.\n\nIn addition to acting in movies, Kapoor has supported charitable organisations and performed for stage shows. In 2011, she walked the ramps of Lakme Fashion Week and India International Jewellery Week. In late 2013, she performed in a fund raising event organized by STAR India.\n\nShe is the brand ambassador of several products including Lakmé, Wella, Vaseline, Gitanjali and Titan.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442124", "text": "Gum arabic\n\nGum arabic, also known as acacia gum, or meska, is a natural gum. It is made of hardened sap from two species of acacia tree; \"Senegalia (Acacia) senegal\" and \"Vachellia (Acacia) seyal\". The gum is got from wild trees throughout the Sahel from Senegal to Somalia. In the past it has also been cultivated in Arabia and west Asia. \n\nGum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides. It was historically the source of the sugars arabinose and ribose, both of which were first discovered and isolated from it.\n\nAcacia gum has been harvested in Arabia, Egypt, and west Asia since antiquity, and sub-Saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export. Traditionally harvested by semi-nomadic desert tribes on their travels, acacia gum is a main export of several African nations. The hardened gum is collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November).\n\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1990s Sudan did about 80% of gum arabic production. Today, the figure is under 50%. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods. It is still the world's largest single producer, and the production of gum arabic is heavily controlled by the Sudanese government.\n\nIn food, gum arabic is used as a stabilizer. It is edible and has E number E414. Arab populations use the natural gum to make a chilled, sweetened, and flavored gelato-like dessert.\n\nGum arabic has been used from ancient times as part of black ink. The main constituent is carbon soot from lamps or burnt plant material. Apart from water and gum arabic, the ancient Egyptian ink was made of not much else. Written on paper or papyrus, this ink has survived for over three thousand years.\n\nGum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional lithography and is used in printing, paint production, glue, cosmetics and various industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in textile industries. Nowadays less expensive materials compete with it for many of these roles.\n\nGum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any colour is suspended in the acacia gum to get in watercolor paint. Water acts as a vehicle to thin the watercolor paint and helps to transfer the paint to a surface such as paper. When all moisture evaporates, the acacia gum binds the pigment to the paper surface. After the water evaporates, the acacia gum in the paint film increases luminosity and helps prevent the colors from lightening. Gum arabic allows more precise control over washes, because it prevents them from flowing or bleeding beyond the brush stroke. In addition, acacia gum slows evaporation of water, giving slightly longer working time.\n\nThe historical photography process used gum arabic mixed with ammonium or potassium dichromate and pigment to create a coloured photographic emulsion that becomes relatively insoluble in water upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In the final print, the acacia gum permanently binds the pigments onto the paper.\n", "id": "442124", "title": "Gum arabic"}

George Meade was still in (nominal) command of the Army of the Potomac, but there was little doubt Grant was in direct control of the army's movements.\n\nGrant ordered General Franz Sigel to advance down the Shenandoah Valley to prevent reinforcements and supplies from reaching Lee's army. Grant ordered Benjamin F. Butler's Union Army of the James to cut the rail lines between Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. This interrupted Lee's main supply line.

His parents, Terence Powderly and Madge Walsh, were Irish immigrants. As a young man he worked for the railroad as a . In 1871, he became a member of the International Machinists and Blacksmiths union. He later became its president. During the Long Depression (1873–1879), he didn't have a job. He was blacklisted for being a 'union '. \n\nIn Scranton in 1976, Powderly joined the local branch of the Knights of Labor. He quickly moved up in the union. By 1879, he became the leader (his title was \"Grand Master Workman\"). While he was the leader, the Knights of Labor had the most members and most influence it ever had. After 1886, the Knights declined. In a struggle for power, Powderly was removed. His rival John William Hayes became the leader. Having lost his position, Powderly studied to become a lawyer. In 1894 he was admitted to the Bar (became a lawyer) in Pennsylvania. For this he was thrown out of the Knights of Labor.\n\nWhile he was the Grand Master Workman, he was also the mayor of Scranton (1878–1884). In the 1896 presidential campaign, he supported Republican William McKinley. As a reward, President McKinley appointed Powderly United States Commissioner General of Immigration in 1897. He was dismissed as Commissioner General in 1902 by President Theodore Roosevelt. Powderly's work for immigration reform led to his dismissal. But in 1906 an investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing. He was given the position of Special Immigration Inspector. He then became Chief of the Division of Information in the US Department of Immigration from 1907 to 1921. Next he became Commissioner of Conciliation for the United States Department of Labor (1921–1924).\n\nPowderly died in Washington, DC on 24 June 1924. Many early labor historians have been very critical of Powderly and the Knights of Labor. However, very few did more for the early labor movement. The actions and accomplishments of Terence V. Powderly have been reevaluated in the last twenty years. While he still has not had a \"competent biographer\", it is clear he and his Knights are becoming much more admired and respected.

The oil which is hot is circulated into a water storage system where it is used to change water into superheated steam, that then turns a turbine to generate electricity. The heat that is produced through this process powers a Stirling engine. The Stirling engine provides electricity and mechanical energy by having the fluid from within a cylinder expand, which then drives a piston that turns a shaft.\n\nSolar thermal energy is primarily used domestically for space heating, hot water, and in some cases air conditioning. Solar thermal energy is renewable and no fuels are required during the process to generate electricity or mechanical energy. It is also carbon free except for production and transportation, otherwise it is non-polluting. Solar thermal can also be combined with photovoltaics (PVs), in highly efficient cogeneration systems. Some downsides are that solar thermal generates low grade energy, installation and construction costs are very high, it is expensive compared to conventional water heaters, and is hard to compete against cheap natural gas. An example of a Solar Thermal Electric Generation Plant is the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System that uses 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors, that focuses sunlight to the top of 459-foot towers, where water is turned into steam to power turbines.\n", "id": "442610", "title": "Solar thermal energy"}

Scrubbers are of two types, wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers. Wet scrubbers use liquid chemicals to remove pollutants. Dry scrubbers typically use fabric filters. In many cases both are used together. As polluted air passes through a wet scrubber, chemicals in the scrubber react with the air pollution causing it to precipitate out. Modern scrubbers can remove up to 98% of the sulfur and 99% of the precipitate matter from within the smokestacks. The sulfur and metals that are removed from the scrubbers can be sold as a marketable products. Sludge from lime scrubbers can be sold to wallboard manufacturers, and fly ash from chimney flues can be sold to make lightweight concrete that can substitute for wood. The use of coal in the United States about doubled during the last quarter (25 years) of the 20th century. However, sulfur in the air was reduced by 30% during that same period.

When it is awarded for acts of heroism, the medal is awarded with the \"V\" device attached.\n\nThe medal is sometimes called the Bronze Star. Foreign soldiers, as well as officers from the other federal uniformed services are also eligible to receive the decoration. They must be serving with a service branch of the United States Armed Forces.\n\nThe Bronze Star Medal was an idea by Colonel Russell P. \"Red\" Reeder in 1943. He believed it would aid if there was a medal which could be awarded by captains of companies or batteries to deserving people serving under them. Reeder felt another medal was needed for ground forces that was equivalent to the Air Medal. He proposed that the new award be called the \"Ground Medal\". The idea eventually gained support. General George C. Marshall wrote a memorandum (note) to President Franklin D. Roosevelt dated 3 February 1944. He wrote: \n\nThe Air Medal had been adopted two years earlier to raise airmen's morale. President Roosevelt authorized the Bronze Star Medal by Executive Order 9419 dated 4 February 1944. The order was made to 7 December 1941. The Executive Order was amended by President John F. Kennedy. The Executive Order 11046 dated 24 August 1962 expanded the authorization to include those serving with friendly forces. This allowed for awards where US service members might be involved in an armed conflict where the United States was not a . At the time of the Executive Order the US was not a belligerent in Vietnam. So any US advisers serving with the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces would not have been eligible for the award.\n\nA study was conducted in 1947. The outcome was the policy was changed to make the retroactive award of the Bronze Star Medal (without the \"V\" device) to all soldiers who had received the Combat Infantryman Badge. It also included those who received the Combat Medical Badge during World War II. The reason for doing this was that the badges were awarded to soldiers who experienced the hardships described in General Marshall's memorandum. Both badges required a recommendation by the commander and a citation in orders.\n\nThe Bronze Star is worn on the uniform after the Soldier's Medal or the Airman's Medal.

It is awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed, while serving, on or after April 5, 1917, with the U.S. military. It is the successor to the Badge of Military Merit, which took the form of a heart made of purple cloth. The Purple Heart is the oldest military award still given to U.S. military members. The National Purple Heart Hall of Honor is located in New Windsor, New York.\n\nThe original Purple Heart, called the \"Badge of Military Merit\", was established by George Washington in 1782. The Badge of Military Merit was only awarded to three Revolutionary War soldiers. If any more had been awarded, any records of being given that award have been lost. The badge was never abolished, it was just forgotten about until after World War I. \n\nIn 1932 General Douglas MacArthur urged the revival of the Purple Heart medal and he was awarded the first one. The War Department authorized the medal under General Order Number 3. The award was \"to be awarded to persons who, while serving in the Army of the United States perform any singular meritorious act of extraordinary fidelity or essential service.\" \nWith the establishment of the Legion of Merit award, the Purple Heart was no longer awarded for meritorious service. By Executive Order 9277, dated December 3, 1942, the award was to only be given for wounds received. Additional Executive orders added circumstances where the award can be given. In 1962 it was ordered the medal could be given posthumously (after the person died). A 1984 change allowed the award to be given for woulds as a result of terrorist attacks or while serving as part of a peacekeeping force. In 1986 public Law 99-145 authorized the award for wounds received as a result of friendly fire. \n\nBecause the medal was given out during many conflicts, the exact number of Purple Hearts awarded is not known.\n\nThe Silver Star is worn on the uniform after the Bronze Star Medal. It is to be worn before the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. In the Army and Air Force when a second or more Purple Heart is awarded, oak leaf clusters are used. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard use 5/16 inch stars to show multiple awards.\n\n", "id": "442737", "title": "Purple Heart"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=442800", "text": "Algebraic variety\n\nIn mathematics, algebraic varieties (also called varieties) are one of the central objects of study in algebraic geometry. The first definitons of algebraic variety defined it as the set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations, over the real or complex numbers. Modern definitions of an algebraic variety generalize this notion while they try to preserve the geometric intuition behind the original definition.\n\nConventions regarding the definition of an algebraic variety differ: Some authors require that an \"\"algebraic variety\"\" is, by definition, \"irreducible\" (which means that it is not the union of two smaller sets that are closed in the Zariski topology), while others do not. When the former convention is used, non-irreducible algebraic varieties are called algebraic sets.\n\nThe notion of variety is similar to that of manifold. One difference between a variety and a manifold is that a variety may have singular points, while a manifold will not. \nProven around the year 1800, the fundamental theorem of algebra establishes a link between algebra and geometry by showing that a monic polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients (an algebraic object) is determined by the set of its roots (a geometric object). Generalizing this result, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz provides a fundamental correspondence between ideals of polynomial rings and algebraic sets. Using the Nullstellensatz and related results, mathematicians have established a strong correspondence between questions on algebraic sets and questions of ring theory. This correspondence is the specifity of algebraic geometry among the other subareas of geometry.\n", "id": "442800", "title": "Algebraic variety"}

Modern algebraic geometry is based on more abstract techniques of abstract algebra, especially commutative algebra, with the language and the problems of geometry.\n\nThe main objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of sets of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\n\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics. The concepts it uses connects it to such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. At the start, algebraic geometry was about studying systems of polynomial equations in several variables. Algebraic geometry starts at the point where equation solving leaves off: In many cases, finding the properties all the solutions a given set of equations have is more important than finding a particular solution: this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.\nIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry has split into several subareas.\n\nMuch of the development of the main stream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space. The developments in topology, differential and complex geometry occurred much in the same way. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles's proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach.\n", "id": "442949", "title": "Algebraic geometry"}

Its members play in NCAA Division I. In football, they play in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; known before 2006 as Division I-A), the higher of two levels of Division I football.\n\nThe American has its roots in the original Big East Conference. That conference was started in 1979 as a basketball-first league by a group of schools in the Eastern U.S. The Big East added football in 1991. That led to years of conflict between schools that played I-A/FBS football and those that did not. In July 2013, the Big East split into two conferences. The seven schools that did not play FBS football left to form a new Big East Conference. The FBS schools that did not go to other conferences stayed in the old conference structure. Along with several new members, they began operating as the American Athletic Conference.\n\nThe American kept the original Big East charter. That makes it the legal successor of the old Big East. However, both The American and the new Big East claim 1979 as their founding dates. Both also claim the pre-split history of the old Big East.\n\nAs of the 2015–16 school year, The American has three \"associate members\" that play only one sport in the conference.\n\nTwo schools left The American after spending only the 2013–14 school year in the renamed conference.

Blarney is in the historic Irish Province of Munster. The Blarney Stone is in the castle. The Blarney Stone is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Ireland.\n\nBlarney Castle is a well preserved 15th century building. It is in the small town of Blarney, County Cork in Ireland. Blarney is about 6 miles northwest of the city of Cork. There are not many good buildings in County Cork that were built before the 19th century. The castle is also one of Ireland's oldest and most historic castles. The walls of the castle are up to 18 feet thick.\n\nBlarney Castle was built in 1446 by Dermot MacCarthy. He was King of South Munster. The castle is the third building on the site. The first was built of wood. In about 1210 a stone building was built in place of the wooden one. Finally, in 1446 the current castle was built by MacCarthy.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I of England wanted the castle. She told the Earl of Leicester to get it for her. However, he was never able to get it because MacCarthy always made excuses to stop it happening.\n\nOliver Cromwell's army won the castle by force. They did not capture the soldiers living in it though. They had escaped through tunnels and caves underneath.\n\nThe Blarney Stone is a slab of limestone. The size of the stone is about 4 feet long and 1 foot wide. It is built into the castle's battlements 83 feet up from the ground.\n\nThere are lots of myths about where the stone came from. Some say it came from the prophet Jeremiah. Some say it came from Stonehenge. It is supposed to have been given to Dermot MacCarthy by Robert the Bruce. The gift was for help fighting against the English at the 1314 battle of Bannockburn.\n\nIn 2014 scientists in Scotland examined a piece of the stone. They found that it was a piece of limestone from close to the castle. The stone is about 330 million years old.\n\nThe Blarney stone is one of Ireland's biggest tourist attractions. Hundreds of tourists visit Blarney Castle every day. The visitors go to kiss the Blarney Stone. People think that kissing the stone will give them the \"gift of the gab\" (make them good at talking). There is usually a long queue of people waiting to kiss it. To kiss the stone people have to lie on their backs and let their heads hang back over a ledge.\n", "id": "443170", "title": "Blarney Castle"}

There, according to Theophrastus, an edible plant grew which could be propagated by rooting its leaves. \n\nPrickly pears (mostly \"Opuntia stricta\") were originally imported into Australia in the 18th century for gardens. They were later used as a natural agricultural fencing. They quickly became a widespread invasive weed. They changed of farming land into an impenetrable green jungle of prickly pear, in places high. \n\nIn 1919, the Australian federal government established the Commonwealth Prickly Pear Board to coordinate efforts with state governments to eradicate the weed. Early attempts at mechanical removal and poisonous chemicals failed, so in a last resort, biological control was attempted. There is a moth, \"Cactoblastis cactorum\", from South America, whose larvae eat prickly pear. It was introduced in 1925 and rapidly reduced the cactus population.

His theory is that all of reality is made up of force itself. His theory predicts that electricity, light, and gravity have finite propagation delays. Einstein's theory agrees with this. \n\nOne can make magnetic field lines show as if they were physical phenomena. For example, iron filings placed in a magnetic field line up to form lines that correspond to 'field lines'. \n\nIf there are a lot of lines through a magnet and not a great space between them, the magnet is strong. If the lines between a magnet are far apart and there aren't many lines, the magnet is weak. A way of determining the strength of a magnet is to do an experiment with iron filings. The iron filings will get attracted to the magnet and move into the shape of the flux lines. You then look at the shape of the iron filings and see the gap between the flux lines. This gives you an idea of the strength of the magnet.\n\nThe use of iron filings to display a field \"alters the magnetic field so that it is much larger along the \"lines\" of iron\". This caused by the large permeability of iron relative to air. Magnetic fields' \"lines\" are also visually displayed in polar auroras, when particles cause visible streaks of light that line up with the local direction of Earth's magnetic field.\n\nMagnetic field lines are like the contour lines (constant altitude) on a topographic map in that they represent something continuous, and a different mapping scale would show more or fewer lines. There is an advantage to using magnetic field lines as a representation. Many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of field lines through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form. \n", "id": "443211", "title": "Magnetic field line"}

It is a cold blooded Australian lizard, that lives in the desert regions of central Australia. \n\nThe thorny devil grows up to 200mm long and can live for at least 20 years. A thorny devil was first put on display in London by John Gould in 1840. It mainly eats ants, and may eat thousands of ants in a day.\n\nFemale thorny devils lay ten eggs during the September-December season (or Spring-Summer). They put the eggs in a burrow about 30 cm deep. These eggs hatch after about 3 or 4 months, but not all babies will survive, because of predators like wild birds and goannas.\n\nThe thorny devil is found in the arid regions of central Australia. It lives in sand, spinifex grasslands and scrub.\nIdeally adapted to its harsh, desert habitat, it uses narrow channels between the scales on its stomach and legs to collect morning dew and water from damp sand. The water travels up these channels to the lizard’s mouth.\n\nThe thorny devil has some unique adaptations. These are used mainly for hiding and self-defence from one of their predators, the goanna.\nThe thorny devil is coloured in shades of desert brown and tans, which blend in with their background. These colours change from pale colours during warmer weather and darker colours during colder weather.\nThe thorny devil has a “false head” on the back of its neck. When the lizard feels threatened, it lowers its real head, and reveals the false head so that the predators do not see the thorny devil's real head.\nThe thorny devil is covered in lots of hard spikes across its entire upper side. Predators do not like to eat the thorny devil, as it is hard to swallow with all the spikes on it.\n", "id": "443220", "title": "Thorny devil"}

He translated it into Latin for the benefit of all Europe.\n\nOliba was born in circa 971 in an rich family. He was the third son of a Catalan count house. He abdicated his possessions to take up the Benedictine habit in the Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll. He had three brothers and a sister.\n\nIn 988, the Count Oliba Cabreta takes the habits and retired to Montecassino with St. Romuald, which met in Cuixà.\n\nOliba begin to do his countal functions. So, while his brother Bernard inherited Besalú and Guifré Cerdanya, Oliva received Berga and Ripoll.\n\nBetween 988 and 1002, Oliva was count of Berga and Ripoll. He was associated with his brother Guifré.\n\nOliba promoted the movement of Peace and Truce of God (Catalan: \"Pau i Treva de Déu\"), towards 1022. In 1027 the agreement of this treaty with other bishops and noblemen took place in Toulouges (Roussillon). In this treaty was said that all agreed to make days in which nobody could fight with anybody and the fugitives could take refuge in churches.\n\nSo influential was Oliba, that, in 1023, King Sancho III of Navarre consulted him on the propriety of marrying his sister Urraca to her second cousin Alfonso V of León. The bishop objected, but Sancho ignored him. His letters to the various contemporaneous kings of Spain indicate to us that Alfonso and his successor, Vermudo III, were regarded as \"imperatore. \"And the king of Navarre was a mere \"rex\".\n\nOliba founded or reformed the monasteries of Montserrat (1025), Fluvià, and Canigó. And he consecrated or patronized numerous other churches, such as the Collegiate Basilica of Manresa. It was he who created the Assemblies of Peace and Truce, the seeds of the future Catalan \"corts\". He improved the decoration of his own church at Ripoll and rededicated it on 15 January 1032. He was a close advisor to Count Berengar Raymond I of Barcelona and reconstructed the cathedral of Vic with the support of his Countess Ermesinda. The new cathedral was rededicated to Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. He died at his monastery at Cuixà in 1046.\n\nIn August 1002, when he was 31 years old he entered the Benedictine Order in the Monastery of Ripoll.\n\nIn 1008, after the death of Abbot Seniofré, Olive was elected abbot of the monastery. Shortly months later he was elected abbot of the Monastery of St. Miquel de Cuixà. Olive began a series of actions to promote a more austere discipline in monasteries.\n\nThe fame of the abbot made ​​the following year, 1009, also elected abbot of Sant Martí del Canigó. Other monasteries accommodate his style of government, such as the monasteries of Sant Feliu and Sant Sadurní Tavèrnoles.\n\nOliba devotes much of its efforts to defend the property and rights of churches to attacks by his manor. In 1011 he had the audience in the Vatican and the Pope Sergius IV won a number of bulls for their monasteries. These papal bulls had significant power: the Pope, God's representative on earth, said that the monasteries and lands owned were under the protection of St. Peter and the Vatican attack on the monastery was an aggression against authority of the Pope.\n\nCatalonia, in the late tenth century, became a major cultural center, direct access to Arabic science and importantly the accumulated prestige \"scriptoria\" monasteries placed the Catalonia Catalan culture as a leader in Europe.\n\nOf all the Catalan \"scriptorium\" was the most important Ripoll. Pope Sylvester II introduced in Europe the Arabic numbers and the concept of zero, and the astrolabe thanks to lessons learned Ripoll. The library Ripoll was, at the time of Oliba, which comes to triple the number of volumes under its mandate, together with the Bobbio, one of the most important of all Christendom.\n\nUnder the mandate of Oliba, the Monastery suffered architectural modifications. Oliba did build a walkway around the sanctuary with three apses. Then, he built a dome over the altar and the crypt erected Nativity, Chapel of the Trinity and the two towers Lombard (of which only one is preserved).\n\nThe monastery of St. Martí del Canigó was founded by the brother of Oliba, Count Gifré II of Cerdanya-Conflent. Gifré took an old church at the foot of Canigó and became an important monastery. \nIn 1009 had become church and its community was made ​​up of monks from Cuixà, which became abbot in Oliba community until 1014 in which the community already had enough monks appoint an abbot among them.\n\n", "id": "443384", "title": "Abbot Oliba"}

The village was carbon dated to about 2600 B.C.\n\nThe monument was on \"an extraordinary scale\" and unique, researchers said.\nThe Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes team has been creating an underground map of the area in a five-year project.\nRemote sensing and geophysical imaging technology has been used to reveal evidence of nearly 100 stones without the need for excavation.\nThe monument is just under two miles (3km) from Stonehenge, Wiltshire, and is thought to have been a Neolithic ritual site.\n\nIt is the \"largest Neolithic settlement in the whole of northern Europe\". At 500m in diameter, the henge is the largest in Britain and recent evidence suggests that it was a complementary monument to Stonehenge.\n\nWhat visibly remains of Durrington Walls today is the 'walls' of the henge monument. This is now a ridge surrounding a central basin. Originally the ditch was some 5.5m deep, 7m wide at its bottom and 18m wide at the top. The bank was in some areas 30m wide. There were two entrances through the bank and ditch – at the north western and south eastern ends. The henge enclosed several timber circles and smaller enclosures – not all of which have been excavated. Several Neolithic house floors have been found next to and under the eastern bank of the henge. Their density suggests that there was a very large village on the sloping river bank on this side.\n\nAbout three feet underneath Durrington Walls, there are remains of about 90 standing stones, maybe from an earlier time. The stones are in a \"slightly curved row.\" They were found in 2015, using special archaeological research tools and methods including ground-penetrating radar.

It is the third installment in the \"Alpha and Omega\" franchise. Like the second one, this movie is directed by Richard Rich and Perry Andelin Blake and written by Tom Kane. \"Alpha and Omega 3\" follows the story of The Great Wolf Games, a contest where puppies from different packs compete. Runt, Stinky and Claudette also join in, even though their pack \"took a pass on the games\", with Humphrey as their coach.\n\nThe movie is a sequel to \"Alpha and Omega\" and \"\". It came out on iTunes on March 4, 2014 and it's available for download. It was released on March 25, 2014 as a Walmart Exclusive. Just like the second movie, \"Alpha and Omega 3\" received mixed reviews by critics (having 44% in Rotten Tomatoes and a 42 out of 100 in Metacritic) and mostly positive reviews by fans (with audience rating of 77%). However, it wasn't as successful as \"Alpha and Omega 2\".\n\nKate, Humphrey, and the puppies are back in Jasper. Kate has to leave on hunting trip with the others. Humphrey has to take care of the puppies. Runt, Stinky and Claudette hear about The Great Wolf Games from another puppy from the Northern Pack named Fleet. He has a crush on Claudette and tells them that the Western Pack won't be in the games. Claudette insists on forming their own team with Brent a grizzly bear cub, and Agnes a porcupine. Humphrey becomes their coach.\n\nDirector Richard Rich said there would be a third and fourth movies in the franchise. He directs \"Alpha and Omega 3\". Tom Kane wrote the script. He was also the uncredited co-director. \"Alpha and Omega 3\" came out on iTunes in March 4, 2014.

It had a 44% rating in Rotten Tomatoes and a 42 out of 100 in Metacritic. The movie's consensus in Rotten Tomatoes is: \"Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games\" does have improved animation, lovable characters and it'll definitely entertain kids and die hard fans of the franchise, but it seems to suffer from a lazy story and a thinly-written script\". Critics noted the animation's improvement, nice humor, likable characters and improved ending, but criticized the movie's story and the absence of the rest of the main characters. However, fans of the franchise had mostly positive reactions for the movie. Though they expressed disappointment on the story and for the lack of the original characters, they praised the movie on everything else. \"Alpha and Omega 3\" had a fresh audience rating of 77% on the Rotten Tomatoes Community.\n\n\"\" came out on iTunes on September 23, 2014.

Its remains were found in North and South Dakota. The type species is \"Anzu wyliei\".\n\n\"Anzu wyliei\" had a toothless beak, a prominent crest, long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws, long powerful legs with slender toes, and a very long tail. In life, the animal was about to long and to in weight. It was one of the largest known oviraptorosaurs and the largest known from North America (though the giant Mongolian oviraptorosaur \"Gigantoraptor\" was far larger).\n\nThe type species is the first well-preserved example of a North American oviraptorosaur. According to a paleontologist at the Smithsonian \"for almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptorosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery. With the discovery of \"A. wyliei\", we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs\". The creature's formidable appearance – \"big crests on their skulls, a beak, no teeth, and a very bird-like skeleton\" – led to it being jokingly called the \"chicken from hell\" in press releases.\n\nThe fossils of \"Anzu wyliei\" were found in mudstone rock that had once been part of ancient floodplains. Its Asian counterparts lived in arid or semi-arid conditions. \n\nIts lifestyle was that of \"a fast-running, ecological generalist that didn't quite fit the usual moulds of meat-eating or plant-eating dinosaur\". It was not on the direct line of descent of modern birds, but it did have bird-like features: \n\nThe function of \"Anzu's\" large crest is debated. The crest \"is very large and made of paper-thin bone, so it was not able to take much stress. All oviraptosaurs have this crest but it is certainly the largest in \"A. wyliei\"\". The most likely function is for display, signalling to members of its own species. Also, it might be used to attract a mate. \n\nThe fossils showed evidence of injuries, including a healed broken rib and an arthritic toe that was probably the result of a tendon being ripped away from the bone.

A seizure is caused by problems in the electrical activity in the brain. \n\nOne syndrome is \"Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures\" (BINS) and the other is \"Benign familial neonatal seizures\" (BFNS). Both syndromes usually happen in infants in the neonatal period, which is the first 28 days after birth. In most cases, the first seizure happens within the first few days after birth. However, some infants may have their first seizure later in the neonatal period, or even months after the neonatal period. The last seizure usually happens while the infant is still in the neonatal period, but seizures may continue after this time.\n\nA third syndrome called \"benign familial neonatal-infantile syndrome\" (BFNIS). It may cause the first seizure between the second day upwards to 6 months after birth, and usually stops within the first 12 months. \n\nThese syndromes are called \"\"benign\"\" because they usually cause no long-term harm to the infant, but there is a greater chance of getting seizures later in life. \n\nIn Benign idiopathic neonatal seizures the cause is not known (this is what the word \"\"idiopathic\"\" means). In Benign familial neonatal seizures and Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures, there is a \"genetic mutation,\" which means a change in the genes that an infant gets from their parents. These disorders are inherited (they \"run in the family\"). This is what the word \"\"familial\"\" means.\n", "id": "443858", "title": "Benign neonatal seizures"}

Minsky is sometimes described as a post-Keynesian economist because, like Keynes, he supported some government intervention in financial markets. He opposed some of the financial deregulation policies popular in the 1980s. He supported the Federal Reserve as a \"lender of last resort\" (which means he thought it right for the Fed to bail out banks which might go bust). He argued against too much private debt in the financial markets.\n\nMinsky proposed theories were about the normal life cycle of an economy. He linked financial market fragility with speculative investment bubbles in financial markets. Minsky claimed that in prosperous times, when companies make plenty of money, an irrational euphoria develops. Soon debts exceed what borrowers can pay off from their income, which produces a financial crisis. As a result, banks and lenders tighten credit, even to companies that can afford loans. Then the economy contracts.\n\nThis slow movement of the financial system from stability to fragility, followed by crisis, is something for which Minsky is best known, and the phrase \"Minsky moment\" refers to it.\n\nAt the University of California, Berkeley seminars attended by Bank of America executives helped him to develop his theories. His views were published in two books, \"John Maynard Keynes\" (1975), a classic study of the economist and his contributions, and \"Stabilizing an Unstable Economy\" (1986), and more than a hundred professional articles.\n", "id": "444058", "title": "Hyman Minsky"}
