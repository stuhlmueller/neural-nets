She was an honorary member of the Royal Philharmonic Society. Only 116 people have ever been made honorary members. She was the wife of the conductor Sir John Barbirolli. She was born Evelyn Rothwell, and was always known by that name until after the death of her husband, John Barbirolli, when she changed her professional name to “Evelyn Barbirolli”. She became famous at a time when there were very few women in orchestras.\n\nEvelyn Rothwell’s father was a tea dealer in the City of London. Her mother was related to Charles Reade, a 19th century novelist. She started to learn the oboe at her school, Downe House, near Newbury. Her father did not want her to study music, but in the end she was allowed to go to the Royal College of Music. She studied the oboe there, and the piano as a second instrument. She also played the cello and timpani. She was a student there at the same time as Benjamin Britten, who sometimes asked her to play some of the oboe music he had just written.\n\nEvelyn started her professional career as an oboist in the Drury Lane orchestra. She soon got a job with the Royal Opera House touring company whose conductor was John Barbirolli. Barbirolli was married, but his marriage did not last long.\n\nBarbirolli was then made conductor of the Scottish Orchestra (now called the Royal Scottish National Orchestra). He gave Evelyn the job of first oboe in this orchestra. He made an arrangement of a concerto by Handel for her to play. She played several other concertos with him conducting, and they made several recordings. Vaughan Williams was very pleased with their recording of his oboe concerto. Several composers wrote music especially for her. Henry Wood made her first oboist in the New Queen’s Hall Orchestra. \n\nEvelyn married Barbirolli in 1939, after he had divorced his first wife. By this time Barbirolli was conductor of the New York Philharmonic. He had taken this job after Toscanini had left. Barbirolli and his new wife lived in New York until 1943 when they returned to England so that Barbirolli could be the conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester. Sometimes she played in the orchestra, but not very often because she thought people might say that it was because her husband was the conductor. When the Hallé Orchestra went to Austria in 1948 she played Mozart’s oboe concerto with them. People at that time only knew this work in an arrangement for the flute.\n\nIn Manchester Evelyn helped her husband by being his secretary. She drove him everywhere, and was always by his side at rehearsals to help him. As Barbirolli gradually became ill she spent nearly all her time with him instead of playing the oboe. She travelled with him to America when he became conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra. Barbirolli kept working hard although he was not well. During his last years they had financial problems when Barbirolli’s manager caused them to lose a lot of money.\n\nAfter Barbirolli’s death in 1970 she started to play her oboe again. She taught at the Royal Academy of Music, and was always known as “Lady Barbirolli” (or “Lady B”). She often adjudicated at music competitions. Her pupils respected her for her honesty and kindness. She wrote a book about \"Oboe Technique\" and the \"Oboist’s Companion\", a book in 3 volumes. She also wrote an autobiography called \"Living with Glorious John\". She was made an OBE in 1984. She died the day after her 97th birthday.\n\n", "id": "89876", "title": "Evelyn Barbirolli"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89894", "text": "Joschka Fischer\n\nJoseph Martin \"Joschka\" Fischer (born 12 April 1948) was German foreign minister and Vice Chancellor in the government of Gerhard Schröder from 1998 to 2005. He was a leading figure in the German Green Party and according to opinion polls , he was the most popular politician in Germany for most of the government's duration. He left office on 22 November 2005.\n\nFischer was born in Gerabronn in Baden-Württemberg. His parents were Germans from Hungary. His nickname Joschka is from \"Jóska\", which is the Hungarian nickname for Joseph (). Fischer dropped out of high school in 1965, and started working for a photographer which he quit in 1966.\n\nIn 1967 he became active in the German student movement and Left-wing politics. Working in a left-wing bookstore in Frankfurt was when he started going to leftist university events as a guest student. He studied the works of Marx, Mao and Hegel and became a member of the militant group \"Revolutionary Combat\" ().\n\nFischer took part in some street battles when the anarchist \"Putzgruppe\" attacked the police and hurt some officers a lot. (In German the word \"Putz\" can mean a cleaner, but in \"Putz-group\" it is an acronym. That means the letters stand for other words. \"Proletarische Union für Terror und Zerstörung\", i.e. \"The Workers Union for Terror and Destruction\"). Photos of one battle in March 1973 show Fischer clubbing policeman Rainer Marx . getting a workout (photo)\n\nIn the German Autumn () of 1977, there were a lot of terrorist attacks by the Red Army Faction (RAF). Fischer says that these attacks, especially the kidnapping and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, made him give up violence as a way to get political change.\n\nInstead, he became involved in the new social movements and later in the newly-founded German Green Party, mainly in the state of Hesse.\n\nIn May 1981 the Minister of Economics of the state of Hesse, Heinz-Herbert Karry, was murdered. The gun that killed the minister was stolen from an American army base in 1973, and Fischer's car was used in the robbery.\n\nAs Foreign Minister, Fischer apologised for the violence of his \"Putzgruppe\" days,\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, Fischer was a member of the Bundestag for the Green party. In 1985, he became Minister for the Environment in Hesse in the first Social Democrat-Green coalition (1985-1987). Fischer caused a stir when he arrived to take his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers. These trainers are now on display in a museum in Bonn.\n\nFischer was again Environment Minister in Hessen from 1991 to 1994, and, later on, became co-chairman of the Greens parliamentary party in the Bundestag. During his years in opposition, Fischer was respected for his speeches. For a large part of the 1990s, with the SPD was not very popular, and Fischers friends often called him \"real\" Leader of the Opposition.\n\nIn September 1998 the Social Democrats, led by Gerhard Schröder, beat the Christian Democrat government of Helmut Kohl. With the SPD's 42% and the Greens' 7%, a coalition government could be formed. After several weeks of talks between Social Democrats and Greens, the new government took power on 27 October 1998. Fischer became Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 1999 Fischer supported German participation in the Kosovo War. This was very extremely controversial within the largely pacifist Green Party, because it meant that, for the first time since World War II, German soldiers would actively go into combat. He justified this war with allegations that Serbia was planning to commit genocide against the Kosovo Albanians.\n\nFischer was also in favour of stationing German troops in Afghanistan, but he advised Schröder not to join the war in Iraq. He is known as a good friend of Kofi Annan. By 2005 he was the second longest-serving foreign minister in German postwar history (after Hans-Dietrich Genscher).\n\nIn 2005 Fischer was accused by critics of carelessly relaxing controls on visa regulations for Ukraine, thus allowing many illegal immigrants to enter Germany with fake identities. A parliamentary committee was established to examine the case, and unlike in other such committee hearings, Fischer's statement (and that of other top officials) was shown live on public TV. Fischer's appearance before the committee took twelve hours. (See German Visa Affair 2005).\n\nAfter the defeat of the coalition government in the 2005 election, Fischer announced that he would retire to the backbench. \"After 20 years of power, now I want my freedom back\", he was quoted as saying. On 13 October 2005, it was announced that Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) would succeed Fischer as Foreign Minister.\n\nSince the beginning of September 2006 Joschka Fischer has been a senior fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination at Princeton University, a visiting professor at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University. He has also spoken at other American universities, notably Brandeis University, on various topic in foreign affairs and international relations.\n\nFischer has often been the most popular German politician, even among supporters of other parties.\n\nUntil 1996, Fischer had been an outspoken lover of good wines and food. He often bet cases of expensive wine with other politicians on the outcome of elections. Fischer had also been overweight. Within a short time he lose a lot of weight. Fischer said that this was due to his giving up alcohol completely and changing his diet. He had also been doing fitness training and even running marathons. He cashed in on his weight loss by writing the book \"My long race towards myself\" about his experience, which became an immediate bestseller. Recently he has been putting on weight again.\n\nFischer has been married five times: his first four marriages, to Edeltraud Fischer (1967-1984), Inge Vogel (1984-1987), Claudia Bohm (1987-1999), and Nicola Leske (1999-2003), all ended in divorce. In October 2005 he married (in Rome) Minu Barati, who was his common-law wife for 2 years. With Inge, his second wife, he has two children: David and Lara. In April 2005 Fischer became a grandfather for the first time.\n\n\nThe following sources reflect the views of U.S. adversaries of Fischer and his policies, especially Germany's decision not to participate in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.\n\nFischer writes a monthly commentary series, \"The Rebel Realist\", for Project Syndicate, a non-profit association of newspapers around the world.\n", "id": "89894", "title": "Joschka Fischer"}

Their newest release, \"Every Second Counts\" (2006), was the first Plain White T's album to reach the mainstream. When the album came out, one song, \"Hey There Delilah\", an acoustic love song, was played on many radio stations daily. Another famous song of theirs is \"Our Time Now\".\n\nThe singer of the band, Tom Higgenson, first wanted to be a drummer. He was in many bands during his High School. However, when Plain White T's were made, he decided to become a singer and a songwriter. Bassist, Ken Fletcher, and drummer, Dave Tirio, joined the band began performing in Downers Grove, Illinois.\n\nThey started out by playing other people's songs, but in the summer of 1999 the band was beginning to become known by record labels like Atlantic Recordings. In 2000 they released their first album, \"Come On Over\". They toured around Chicago to try and make the album sell more and to get more fans.\n\nAt the end of 2001, Plain White T's left Atlantic Recordings and signed to Fearless Records. They began recording for their next album, called \"Stop\". They chose in Downers Grove, Illinois and Santa Barbara, California. The album took four months to record, being finished in April 2002. The album was shown around Plain White T's home town before being released finally on August 20th 2002, a whole twenty months after it was started.\n\nIn October, the band went on their first big tour. The tour in the band ending up stopping being friends, this was solved with new members, with Dave switching from drums to guitar, Steve being replaced by Tim Lopez, Ken being replaced by Mike Retondo and De'Mar Hamilton taking up drums.\n\nThe band went into the studio to record their next album, called \"All That We Needed\",in May 2004. After recording the album, they toured the US. During this tour, they released their first single, \"All That We Needed\". They then promoted the album internationally, gathering a growing fanbase, before heading back for the 2005 Take Action Tour.\n\nDuring the \"Take Action Tour '05\", Plain White T's recorded their first music video with a single which they hoped would be more famous than \"All That We Needed\" .\n\nIn 2006 they signed to another new label, Hollywood Records, and then began recording a new album. Shortly before the release of the album, the single \"Hate (I Really Don't Like You)\" was released, it was the first single by them to achieve noticeable success.\n\nPlain White T's started touring in Winter and Autumn of 2006. By this time they were starting to get noticed in the music industry at last. Although they were beginning to get noticed in the minor US rock industry, internationally Plain White Ts were not doing so well, by this point, they had not even sold 100,000 copies of any album anywhere outside of the US. Hollywood Records thought that re-releasing \"Hey There Delilah\" would make the band famous.\n\n\"Hey There Delilah\" is an acoustic song, first released as a single in May 2006 as chasing cars, and was the last track in the band's first album, All That We Needed. One year later, in 2007, the song became the band's first mainstream hit. On 11 July 2007, the song reached number one for sales in the Billboard Hot 100. One month later, the song became a hit single all over the world. \"Hey There Delilah\" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and Ireland Singles Chart, number four in the Australian chart and number six in the United World Chart.

He was a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution. He is better known as the second President of Indonesia. He held the office for a long time, from 1967 to 1998. \n\nSuharto seized power from his predecessor, the first president of Indonesia Sukarno. For this, he used some force, but also took some political maneuvers. At the time, there was instability and unrest inside and outside of Indonesia. This helped him come to power. He took three decades to change the regime to work along militarist lines, with a strong central government. His movement was known as \"\"Orde Baru\"\". As he took an anti-communist position which he could defend, several Western governments supported him both in economic and political matters. This was during an era that is known as Cold War. For most of his three-decade rule, Indonesia experienced significant economic growth and industrialization. His rule, however, led to political purges and the deaths of millions of suspected Indonesian communists and Chinese-Indonesians. He also made some laws against communist parties and ethnic Chinese.\n\nHis New Order administration's authoritarian and increasingly corrupt practices led to much discontent in the 1990s. Suharto's almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians' standard of living. People inside the military and other institutions no longer supported him. There were some problems inside the country during the early 1990s. Suharto became more and more isolated, in a political way. After mass demonstrations in 1998, Suharto was forced to resign. Suharto had been the face of Indonesia for over 30 years. After retiring, he lived in seclusion. There were people who wanted to try him for genocide. This failed however, because he had a very bad health. His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and abroad.\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto has only one name. In contexts where his religion is being discussed he is sometimes called Haji or el-Haj Mohammed Suharto, but this Islamic title is not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" has been official in Indonesia since 1947 but the older spelling Soeharto is still frequently used.\n\nSuharto died January 27, 2008, at 1:10 P.M. local time due to organ failure. He died at Pertamina Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. He was taken off life support. He was buried at a family mausoleum near Solo town.\n\n", "id": "89937", "title": "Suharto"}

Industrialization changes the society as it happens. During the industrialisation of a country people leave farming work to take higher paid jobs in factories in towns.\n\nIndustrialization is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things. Using better technology, it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time. A single person can produce more things. \n\nAfter industrialization people also do more specialized jobs. For example before industrialization, a cobbler made the whole shoe. He worked on one pair of shoes, finished that, and then did the next pair of shoes. With industrialization, there are many people involved in making shoes. An individual shoemaker has a smaller task, however. There is one person that cuts the sole of the shoe. Another person stitches it on. In short there is division of labour. The machines to make the shoes cost a lot of money so the factory will be owned by a rich person who can afford the machines.\n\nIndustrialization started in England with the industrial revolution in the 18th century. It spread first to parts of Europe, and to North America. In the 20th century industrialization spread to most other countries.\n", "id": "90024", "title": "Industrialization"}

From north to south the delta is approximately 160 km in length. The Delta begins slightly down-river from Cairo.

Only 100 to 200 mm of rain falls on the delta area during an average year, and most of this falls in the winter months. The delta experiences its hottest temperatures in July and August, averaging 30 °C, with a maximum of around 48 °C. Winter temperatures are normally in the range of 5° to 10 °C.

His parents were from a very strict Christian sect called the Plymouth Brethren - and they believed that what ever they did in life, they would go to heaven anyway. He had one brother, William, born in 1903. His father died in 1914 and Adams was brought up by his mother. The family moved to Belfast but in 1918 William died from flu. Adams studied medicine at university. \n\nAdams worked for one year in a hospital in Bristol. He then moved to Eastbourne, England where he became a general practitioner. He cared for a lot of old female patients and many of them were very rich. 132 left him money or gifts when they died. Rumours started that Adams was killing them with heroin and morphine and the police decided to investigate. Many of the possible victims had been cremated (burnt), so there were few bodies for the police to analyse.\n\nAdams was arrested and tried for the murder of one patient in 1957, but found not guilty. Another charge was withdrawn - an event the judge later criticised. The trial was reported in newspapers around the world and was described at the time as \"one of the greatest murder trials of all time\".\n\nSome have claimed that the trial was not held fairly. Police files show that the prosecution gave secret records to the defence to help them defend Adams. Evidence (some notebooks written by the patient's nurses) was lost by the prosecution and then found later by the defence. When it was produced during the trial, the prosecution pretended that it had never seen it. Also, the case that was chosen (Mrs Morrell) was probably one of the least likely to succeed. \n\nOne historian claims that the government did not want Adams to be convicted, because he would then have been hanged. If this had happened, many doctors would have refused to treat government (NHS) patients and the government would have become very unpopular.\n\nAdams was later found guilty of 13 other crimes - prescription fraud, lying on cremation forms, obstructing a police search and failing to keep a register of the dangerous drugs he used.\n\nHe had his license to be a doctor taken away in 1957 but it was given back in 1961. He was banned for life from prescribing dangerous drugs.\n\nScotland Yard's files on the case were meant to be secret until 2033, but special permission was given in 2003 to open them.\n\nEven though he was found not guilty, most experts now consider him to have been a serial killer. The judge in his trial later wrote a book in which he said Adams was probably guilty. The police thought that Adams killed 163 of his patients. \n\n\n", "id": "90096", "title": "John Bodkin Adams"}

Savonarola is famous for burning books, and for the destruction of what he considered immoral art. Savonarola was a priest but he preached against the moral corruption of the clergy and the Church of Rome. His main enemy was Pope Alexander VI. He is sometimes seen as a forerunner of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, however he remained a devout Roman Catholic.\n\nIn the twentieth century, a movement for the canonization of \"Frà Savonarola\" began to develop within the Roman Catholic Church, particularly among Dominicans. Many believe that his excommunication and execution were not legal. However, his beatification and canonization is opposed by many Jesuits, who think Savonarola's attacks on the papacy to have been a serious crime.\n\nSavonarola was born in Ferrara, which was the capital of the independent Duchy of Ferrara.\n\nIn his youth he studied the Bible, and then went to the University of Ferrara. He wrote two poems which showed his anger at morally corrupt clergymen. The first, about the end of the world, was written when he was only 20. Savonarola wrote the second poem \"De Ruina Mundi\" (\"On the Downfall of the World\") in 1475. In this poem he said the Roman Curia was \"a false, proud whore\".\n\nSavonarola became a Dominican friar in 1475, and entered the convent of San Domenico in Bologna. He studied theology. In 1479 he went to the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli. In 1482 the Dominicans sent him to Florence, the ‘city of his destiny’. After five years, he went back to Bologna where he became 'master of studies’.\n\nHe returned to Florence in 1490 and began to preach about the end of the world. He had visions and prophecies which he said had come to him from God and the saints. Several disasters made his prophecies real. He spoke about the failing power of the ruling Medici family. Savonarola never tried to make war on the Roman Curia. He wanted to put an end to the sins of the popes who cared more about their riches and power than they did about God .\n\nAfter Charles VIII of France invaded Florence in 1494, the ruling Medici were removed. Savonarola became the new leader of the city, both as a secular leader and priest. He set up a rather modern democratic republic in Florence. Savonarola wanted to make Florence a city devoted to God, a good “Christian and religious Republic.” Homosexuality had been acceptable in Florence, and many were important people. One of Savonarola's first laws was to make sodomy a crime which would be punished by death.\n\nIn 1497, he and his followers went to the Piazza della Signoria, and began to burn mirrors, cosmetics, obscene pictures, pagan books, gaming tables, musical instruments, fine dresses, women’s hats, and the works of immoral and ancient poets. They also burnt paintings by some famous artists, such as Sandro Botticelli and Michelangelo. This event is now called the \"Bonfire of the Vanities\".\n\nFlorence soon became tired of Savonarola. The city had become an unhappy place to live. Savonarola's promises that God would change things in the city did not come true, and his predictions of the end of the world did not happen. During his Ascension Day sermon on May 4, 1497, groups of young men rioted in the streets, people began singing and dancing, and the taverns reopened. The riot became a revolution.\n\nOn May 13, 1497, Savonarola was excommunicated by Pope Alexander VI. In 1498, Alexander demanded his arrest and execution. On April 8, soldiers attacked the Convent of San Marco and after a bloody battle Savonarola's guards and religious supporters were killed. He surrendered and during the next few weeks was tortured to make him say that he was gulity of heresy, corruption, and other crimes against the Church.\n\nOn the day of his execution he was taken out to the Piazza della Signoria with Fra Silvestro and Fra Domenico da Pescia, two religious friends of Savonarola. They were stripped of their clerical clothing, and called heretics and schismatics. The three men were put on crosses,and burned alive. Savonarola died in the same place where he had burnt the paintings and books.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli, author of \"The Prince\", also saw and wrote about the execution. The Medici soon retook control of Florence.\n\n", "id": "90242", "title": "Girolamo Savonarola"}

But it is not a normal telescope that uses light to see distant objects. Instead, it uses neutrinos, very small and light particles that can fly through the earth. The name comes from Astronomy with a Neutrino Telescope and Abyss environmental RESearch project. There is also a star called Antares.\n\nIt uses 900 light sensors attached to 12 strings that float in the sea to detect neutrinos. The strings are held onto the sea floor by an anchor and straight up by a buoy floating in the sea. Although the neutrinos are invisible, they can create a different particle, a muon, in water. The muon then gives off light by the Cherenkov effect because it travels faster than light in water. \nThe sensors are so sensitive that they need only very little light and can even detect single photons. This is necessary because the muons produce only very little light.\n\nThe detector is located in the Mediterranean, about 40 kilometres off Toulon in southern France. There the sea is 2500 metres deep. It is built by a group of physicists from 12 European countries. Currently, 10 strings are running. The last two strings will be installed in May 2008.\n\nIt is the largest neutrino detector in the Northern hemisphere.

However, when light travels in a transparent medium (such as water or glass), it moves more slowly than it would in a vacuum. This means that particles can actually move faster than the speed of light in certain mediums. When a particle with an electric charge moves faster than light in a medium which can be polarized, it causes the medium to send out photons (light particles) and thereby loses energy. The photons that are sent out can be measured, as they are simple light.\n\nBecause nothing can move faster than light in a vacuum, there is no Cherenkov light in a vacuum. However, if we say that light in water moves only with 75% of its speed in vacuum, particles with very high energy are now able to move faster than light (through water) and create Cherenkov light.\n\nThe reason Cherenkov light often appears blue is because its effect is proportional to the frequency, in that the higher the frequency, the higher the effect of the radiation. Because higher frequency light equates to shorter wavelengths, and blue light has one of the shortest wavelengths of visible light, Cherenkov light is usually blue.\n", "id": "90323", "title": "Čerenkov radiation"}

He is in many temples, restaurants, and businesses. Budai has become a god of happiness and plenty, when taken in by Taoism and Buddhism. In Japan, Hotei is one of the Seven Lucky Gods (\"Shichi Fukujin\"). He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the \"Laughing Buddha\" (Chinese:笑佛).\n\nBudai comes from the time of Sakyamuni Buddha, where there was a monk named \"Angida\", whose name also meant \"calico bag\". In the legend, Angida was an Indian snake catcher who caught poisonous snakes to stop them from biting people. Budai and Angida look similar, they both are plump, seen laughing and carrying a bag.\n\nIn the Chinese tradition, Budai was a monk who lived in china at about 907 to 923. He was a man who was good and loving. Apart from his character, his likeness with the Maitreya Bodhisattva (the future Buddha) is also a Buddhist hymn (Chinese: 偈语; Pinyin: Jiéyǔ) which he said before his death:\n\nBudai is almost always shown carrying a sack, which never empties, and is filled with many precious things, including rice plants (which show wealth), sweets for children, food, and the sadness of the world. His duty is protector of the weak, the poor and children.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhist temples, Budai's statue is put in the front part of the entrance hall. He is shown as a stout, smiling or laughing man in robes with a largely shown stomach, which shows happiness, good luck, and plenty.\n\nSome statues show small children at his feet. Another item that is usually seen in Budai statues, is a begging bowl; to show that he is a Buddhist. All of these images show Budai as a wandering monk who goes around and takes the sadness from people. Because he represents richness and happiness, statues are often found in homes and businesses in China and Japan.\n\nThe main story that concerns Budai in Chan is a short koan. In it, Budai travels, giving candy to poor children, only asking a penny from people he meets. One day a monk walks up to him and asks, \"What is the meaning of Chan?\" Budai drops his bag. \"How does one get to Chan?\" he continued. Budai then picks up his bag and walks away.\n\nIn Thailand Budai is sometimes confused with another monk very respected in Thailand, Phra Sangkadchai or Sangkachai (Thai: พระสังกัจจายน์). \"Phra Sangkadchai\", a Thai spelling of Mahakaccayanathera (Thai: มหากัจจายนเถระ), was a Buddhist in Pali in the time of the Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha praised \"Phra Sangkadchai\" for his excellence in explaining complicated dharma (or dhamma) in an easily and understandable way.\n\n1. Phra Sangkadchai has a bit of hair on his head while Budai is bald.2. Phra Sangkadchai wears the robes in Theravadin Buddhist fashion with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered. Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.\n\nOne belief surrounding the figure of Budai in popular folklore is that if a person rubs his belly, it brings wealth, good luck, and prosperity. This belief however is not part of any Buddhist ritual, but more of a Chinese practice. He is often admired for his happiness, plenitude, and wisdom of contentment.\n\n\n", "id": "90374", "title": "Budai"}

His style of composition had a very important influence on music at the Burgundian court. Together with Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstaple he belongs to the greatest of 15th century composers.\n\nHe was probably born in Mons in what is now Belgium. His father, a councillor to Duke Guillaume IV of Hainault, had a job in a church in Mons. Nothing is known about Gilles until 1419, when he became organist at the church of Ste. Waudru in Mons. In 1423 went to live in Lille. He may have worked as a soldier.\n\nSometime near the end of the 1420s he joined the court chapel of Burgundy. He sang with the choir there. He spent many years working at the Burgundian court. He was not allowed much time to be away, so he did not travel much. We know that he went to Mons in 1449 on which occasion he met Guillaume Dufay. When he retired he went to live in Soignes. He had a good pension.\n\nBinchois wrote beautiful melodies which were much simpler than a lot of the music of the Middle Ages. They are easy to sing and remember. Many later composers used melodies by Binchois as a basis for their own masses. Most of his songs are rondeaux, which became the most common song form during the century. Binchois did not often write in strophic form.

He helped to develop the style of the Burgundian School.\n\nThe spelling \"Dunstaple\" is more often used today because in documents from his time this is the spelling that is more common, although some documents spelt his name \"Dunstable\".\n\nDunstaple was probably born in Dunstable, Bedfordshire around 1390. We know very little about his life. He was well educated and he worked for the Duke of Bedford who was the fourth son of Henry IV and brother of Henry V. He may have spent some time in France because the duke was Regent of France from 1423 to 1429, and then Governor of Normandy from 1429 to his death in 1435. Dunstaple owned property in Normandy, and also in Cambridgeshire, Essex and London, according to tax records of 1436. He also worked for the Duke of Gloucester.\n\nMany composers at that time were priests, but Dunstaple was not, although he had connections with St Albans Abbey. He was probably married.\nDuring his life he was not just known as a composer but also as an astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician.\n\nHe died on Christmas Eve 1453, and was buried in the church of St Stephen Walbrook in London which was later destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. \n\nWe hardly have any original manuscripts of Dunstaple’s music. England was a very musical country at the time, but almost all that music was destroyed between 1536 and 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries when Henry VIII was ruling. Most of Dunstaple’s works which survive were works which were found on the continent, mostly in north Italy. This shows that he must have been famous throughout Europe. He influenced Dufay and Binchois. The Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris wrote in 1476 that he was the most important musician of new music which had started in England.\n\nDunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using one melody as \"cantus firmus.\" He wrote many carols (religious songs), but we do not know which ones are by him because he did not sign his name to them. He wrote secular music, but it has been lost.\n\n", "id": "90411", "title": "John Dunstaple"}

It was not only different in the weapons it used, it was also the first war related to by press, by photography and journalists.

Its overall length of 4,700 km (2,922 miles) makes it the second longest in Africa (after the Nile). The river and its tributaries flow through the second largest rain forest area in the world, second only to the Amazon Rainforest in South America. \n\nThe river also has the second-largest flow in the world, behind the Amazon, and the second-largest watershed of any river, again trailing the Amazon. Its watershed is a little larger than that of the Mississippi River. Because large parts of the river basin sit above and below the equator, its flow is steady, as there is always at least one river having a rainy season.\nThe Congo gets its name from the old Kingdom of Kongo which was at the mouth of the river. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo, both countries sitting along the river's banks, are named after it. From 1971 to 1997, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was called Zaire and its government called the river the Zaire River.\n\nThe sources of the Congo are in the Highlands and mountains of the East African Rift, as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru, which feed the Lualaba River. This then becomes the Congo below Boyoma Falls. The Chambeshi River in Zambia is usually taken as the source of the Congo because of the accepted practice worldwide of using the longest tributary, as with the Nile River.\n\nThe Congo flows mostly west from Kisangani just below the falls, then slowly bends southwest, passing by Mbandaka, joining with the Ubangi River, and running into the Pool Malebo (Stanley Pool). Kinshasa (formerly Léopoldville) and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool, where the river narrows and falls through a few cataracts in deep canyons (collectively known as the Livingstone Falls), running by Matadi and Boma, and into the sea at the small town of Muanda.\n\nThe mouth of the Congo was visited by Europeans in 1482, by the Portuguese Diogo Cão, and in 1817, by a British exploration under James Kingston Tuckey that went up the river as far as Isangila. Henry Morton Stanley was the first European to travel along the whole river.\n\nAlthough the Livingstone Falls stop water coming in from the sea, almost all of the Congo is navigable in parts, especially between Kinshasa and Kisangani. Railways cross the three major falls that interrupt navigation, and much of the trade of central Africa passes along the river, including copper, palm oil, sugar, coffee, and cotton. The river can also be valuable for hydroelectric power, and the Inga Dams below Pool Malebo are some of the first dams built.\n\nIn February of 2005, South Africa's power company owned by the state, Eskom, said that they had a proposal to increase the holding amount of the Inga a lot through improvements and the building of a new hydroelectric dam. The project would bring the highest output of the dam to 40 GW, twice that of China's Three Gorges Dam. \n\nIn the Mesozoic period before the continental drift opened the South Atlantic Ocean, the Congo was the upper part of a river about 12,000 km (7,500 miles) long that flowed west across the parts of Gondwanaland, now called Africa and South America.\n\nListed from down a river, to up a river:\n\nThe Congo River was the location the novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.\n\n\n", "id": "90432", "title": "Congo River"}

It joined with Bavaria by popular vote in 1920. Before 1918, it was the larger of the two capital cities in the united duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nCoburg's Coat of Arms honoring the city's patron Saint Maurice was granted in 1493.\nCoburg is about 90 km south of Erfurt and about 100 km north of Nuremberg. Coburg was first mentioned in a document dated 1056, although there was a settlement at the site that before then called Trufalistat. Following several changes of noble owners, it came into the hands of the House of Wettin in 1353 when Friedrich III, the Strong, married Katherina von Henneberg. In 1596, it became the capital of one of the new Duchy of Saxe-Coburg under the leadership of Duke Johann Casimirs (ruled 1596-1633).\n\nDue to the royal connections among the royal houses of Europe, Coburg was the site of many royal Ducal weddings and visits. Britain's Queen Victoria made 6 visits to Coburg during her 64-year reign. In 1896 one ceremony brought together Queen Victoria, her son Edward (future Edward VII), her second son Alfred (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), her daughter the German dowager Empress Friedrich (Victoria), and many of her grandchildren, such as Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the future King George V of Great Britain.\nIn 1920, two years after the abdication of the last duke, the locals voted to join Bavaria. Thus whilst the other Saxon-Thuringian principalities were later incorporated into the German Democratic Republic after World War II, Coburg became part of West Germany As a result, the town spent the Cold War years lying right next to the Iron Curtain, surrounded by East German territory on three sides.\n\nCoburg has the typical features of a former capital of German little states. There are numerous houses from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The most important landmarks include:\n\nMost residents of Coburg are members of the Evangelical Church (Lutheranism). Other Christian communities are Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, the ICF Movement, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Old Catholics and the New Apostolic Church, as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are also three communities of Muslims. Coburg had a large Jewish community until the 1940s. Jews have lived there since the 14th century. The old synagogue was a former church. Today it is used by Old Catholics. Coburg became Protestant after the Reformation. All Catholics were persecuted. A new Catholic community was founded in the 19th century.\n\nCoburg is divided into 15 districts:\n\n\nOver two thirds of Coburg's population live in Coburg City.\nAmongst the associated royalty, one individual's 20th century association with Coburg proved especially tragic. This was that of the British Royal Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who was arrested and tried as a Nazi.\n\nBesides various royalty, other famous individuals associated with Coburg include Hans Berger (graduated), William Frishmuth (born), and Eduard Study (born).\n\nIn 1530, Martin Luther stayed in the \"Veste Coburg\" to follow negotiations at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. He also preached at St. Moriz church.\n\nIn 1887, Johann Strauss, the \"Waltz King\", left Vienna when the Roman Catholic Church would not let him divorce his 2nd wife. He moved to Lutheran Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with his future 3rd wife Adele, where he lived the last 13 years of his life in Coburg. He was however buried in Vienna.\n\nIn 1922, Adolf Hitler led several hundred stormtroopers in a march through the city, fighting pitched street battles with leftists. During the Nazi era, the Coburg Badge was one of the most prestigious party medals.\n\nHans Morgenthau, founder of International Relations as a field of study, was born here.\n\nThe US National Hot Dog and Sausage Council asserts that Frankfurt am Main is traditionally credited with originating the Frankfurter.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90656", "text": "Albrecht Dürer\n\nAlbrecht Dürer (21 May 1471 – 6 April 1528) was a German painter, engraver and mathematician.\n\nHe was born and died in Nuremberg, Germany and is best known as a maker of old master prints. His prints were often in a series, so that there is a group of different prints about a subject. The most famous series are the \"Apocalypse\" (1498) and his two series on the passion of Christ, the \"Great Passion\" (1498–1510) and the \"Little Passion\" (1510–1511).\n\nDürer's best known individual engravings (that is, ones that are not part of a series) include \"\" (1513), \"\" (1514) and \"Melencolia I\" (1514). His most iconic images are his woodcuts of the \"\" (1497–1498) from the \"Apocalypse\" series, the \"Rhinoceros\", and numerous self-portraits in oils. Dürer possibly did not cut his own woodblocks but may have employed a skilled carver who followed his drawings faithfully. He painted a number of religious works in oils and made many brilliant watercolours and drawings, which through modern reproductions are now perhaps his best known works.\n\nDürer's prints made him famous across Europe before he was 30, and many people say he is the greatest artist of the Renaissance in Northern Europe.\n\nDürer was the third child and second son of his parents, who had between fourteen and eighteen children. His father was a successful goldsmith from Ajtós, near Gyula in Hungary.\n\nDürer's godfather was Anton Koberger, who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year Dürer was born. He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany, and owned twenty-four printing presses and had many offices in Germany and abroad. His most famous publication was the \"Nuremberg Chronicle,\" published in 1493 in German and Latin. It had 1,809 woodcut pictures by the Wolgemut workshop. Dürer may well have worked on some of these, as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut.\n\nDürer had started to learn goldsmithing and drawing from his father. His father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith, but he was so good at drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486. A self-portrait, a drawing in silverpoint, is dated 1484 (Albertina, Vienna). Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time, and had a large workshop making different types of works of art, in particular woodcuts for books. Nuremberg was a rich city, a centre for publishing and many luxury trades. It had strong links with Italy, especially Venice, a relatively short distance across the Alps.\n\nAfter completing his term of apprenticeship in 1489, Dürer followed the common German custom of taking a \"wanderjahre\" — in effect a gap year. Dürer was away nearly four years, travelling through Germany, Switzerland, and probably, the Netherlands. Dürer wanted to meet Martin Schongauer, the best engraver of Northern Europe, but Schongauer died shortly before Dürer's arrival. He stayed at the house of Schongauer's brother, and got some pictures that Schongauer owned.\n\nHis first painted self-portrait is now in the Louvre. It was painted in Strasbourg, probably so that Dürer could send it back to his fiancée in Nuremberg. In fact, very soon after he got back to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494 Dürer was married to Agnes Frey. She was the daughter of a well known brass worker (and amateur harpist) in the city. He was 23, and the marriage was arranged while Dürer was away travelling. his absence. They had no children, and most people think that they did not marry for love, but because it was good to link the two families. Also, a single man could not set up in business for himself in Nuremberg. Dürer painted some portraits of his wife, but experts say that they \"\"lack warmth\"\". The experts think that if Dürer loved his wife he would have taken more time over those pictures to make her look more beautiful and friendly.\n\nWithin three months Dürer left for Italy. The start of plague in Nuremberg was one reason for his leaving.\n\nIn Italy, he went to Venice where artists were working in a more modern style. Dürer wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice.\n\nOn his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Dürer opened his own workshop. He started to use what he learned in Italy more and more, so his work was quite different from the other artists in Nuremberg who used only the traditional German style.\n\nDürer's father died in 1502 and his mother died in 1513.\n\nDürer probably did not cut any of the woodblocks himself. This was a job for experts. But he had designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut as part of his training in Wolgemut's studio, and he had seen many carved and painted altarpieces made in the studio. This means he knew what could be made into a woodblock print, and how to work with the expert block cutters. Dürer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way his drawing was destroyed when the block was cut.\n\nHis famous series of sixteen great designs for the \"Apocalypse\" are dated 1498. He made the first seven scenes of the \"Great Passion\" in the same year, and a little later, a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints. Around 1503–1505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin, which he did not finish for some years. Neither these, nor the \"Great Passion,\" were published as sets until several years later, but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers.\n\nThe Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari, whom Dürer had met in Venice, visited Nuremberg in 1500, and Dürer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective, anatomy, and Body proportions from him. de'Barbari did not want to tell Dürer everything he knew, so Dürer began his own studies, and he kept studying for the rest of his life. This is a series of drawings show Dürer's experiments in human proportion, before he made his famous engraving of \"Adam and Eve\" (1504). This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name.\n\nDürer made large numbers of other practice drawings, especially for his paintings and engravings, and many survive, most famously the \"Praying Hands\" (1508 Albertina, Vienna). He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour (usually combined), including a number of very beautiful still lives of meadow sections or animals, including his \"Hare\" (1502, Albertina, Vienna).\n\nIn early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time Dürer's engravings were very popular and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo. This was the altar-piece known as the \"Adoration of the Virgin\" or the \"Feast of Rose Garlands\". It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. Later, the Emperor Rudolf II took it to Prague. Other paintings Dürer made in Venice include, \"The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch\", \"Christ disputing with the Doctors\" (supposedly produced in just five days), and a number of smaller works.\n\nDürer was admired by the Venetians, but he was back in Nuremberg by mid-1507. He stayed in Germany until 1520. His reputation had spread throughout Europe. He was on friendly terms with most of the major artists of Europe, and exchanged drawings with Raphael.\n\nThe years between and his journey to the Netherlands are divided according to the type of work he made. During the first five years, 1507–1511, after his return from Venice Dürer mostly painted. He made his four best paintings, \"Adam and Eve\" (1507), \"Virgin with the Iris\" (1508), the altarpiece the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" (1509), and the \"Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints\" (1511). During this period he also completed the two woodcut series, the \"Great Passion\" and the \"Life of the Virgin\".\n\nHe complained that painting did not make enough money, so from 1511 to 1514 he concentrated on printmaking. The famous works he made in this period were the thirty-seven woodcuts for the \"Little Passion\", published first in 1511, and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512. In 1513 and 1514 he created his three most famous engravings, \"The Knight, Death, and the Devil\" (or simply, \"The Knight\", as he called it, 1513), \"Melencolia I\", and \"St. Jerome in his Study\" (both 1514).\n\n'Melencolia I' has a magic square which is believed to be the first seen in European art. The two numbers in the middle of the bottom row give the date of the engraving, 1514.\n\nIn 1515, he created his woodcut of the \"Rhinoceros\". The rhinoceros was in Lisbon, but Durer never saw it. He made it from a sketch and description from another artist. It was not very lifelike, but still being used in some German school science text-books early last century. The rhinoceros was from an extinct Indian species.\n\nUp to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including portraits in tempera on linen, experiments in etching on plates of iron, and parts of the \"Triumphal Arch\" and the \"Triumphs of Maximilian\" which were huge woodcut projects ordered by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nIn the summer of 1520 Dürer made his fourth and last major journey.\n\nHe wanted to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him. Maximilian had died in 1519, so the city of Nuremberg stopped paying it. Dürer also needed new patrons following the death of Maximilian, and to avoid an outbreak of sickness in Nuremberg.\n\nHe took his wife and her maid and left Nuremberg for the Netherlands in July 1520, to be at the coronation of the new emperor, Charles V. He travelled by the Rhine to Cologne, and then to Antwerp, where he made many drawings in silverpoint, chalk, and charcoal.\n\nDürer went to Aachen for the coronation, but also made trips to Cologne, Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, and Zeeland. In Brussels he saw \"the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\" — the Aztec treasure that Hernán Cortés had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico. Dürer wrote that this treasure trove \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles. These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins\". Dürer appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.\n\nDürer took many prints with him. He wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged, or sold them, and for how much. This is some of the few times the price of prints was recorded, so historians think it very important to show the values of prints compared to paintings at that time. Dürer returned home in July 1521. He had an unknown illness which stayed with him for the rest of his life, and slowed his rate of work.\nBack in Nuremberg, Dürer started work on a series of religious pictures. There are many practice sketches and \"studies\" (practice paintings for a bigger painting) but no big paintings from this time. This was partly because of his illness, but more because of the time he spent preparing to write books about geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.\n\nHis writings show that Dürer was highly sympathetic to Martin Luther, and he may have been influential in the City Council declaring for Luther in 1525. However, he died before religious divisions had hardened into different \"Catholic\" and \"Protestant\"churches. Dürer probably thought of himself as a reform-minded Catholic.\n\nDürer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56. He left money and goods worth 6,874 florins - a considerable sum. His workshop was a part of his large house. His widow lived there until her death in 1537. The house is now a museum.\n\n\n\n", "id": "90656", "title": "Albrecht Dürer"}

He trained and became a master of that kind of art before travelling at 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570, he moved to Rome and opened a workshop and made a series of works. While he was in Italy, El Greco added elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance to his style.

His younger sister Margaret (1890–1974) married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Archibald Hill.\n\nKeynes first went to King’s College, Cambridge, in 1902. At first he studied mathematics. Later he studied economics under A.C. Pigou and Alfred Marshall. People think Professor Marshall prompted Keynes to change his studies from mathematics and classics to economics. Keynes received his B.A. in 1905 and his M.A. in 1908.\n\nWhen Keynes was young, he had romantic and sexual relationships with men. One of his great loves was the artist Duncan Grant, whom he met in 1908. Keynes was also involved with the writer Lytton Strachey. Keynes appeared to turn away from homosexual relationships around the time of the first World War. In 1918, he met Lydia Lopokova, a well-known Russian ballerina. Keynes and Lopokova married in 1925.\n\nKeynes was a successful investor and he built up a big fortune. He nearly lost all of his money after the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Later he re-built his fortune.\n\nHe enjoyed collecting books: for example, he collected and protected many of Isaac Newton's papers.\n\nLord Bertrand Russell said Keynes was the most intelligent person he had ever known. Lord Russell said: \"Every time I argued with Keynes, I felt that I took my life in my hands, and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool.\"\n\nKeynes accepted a lectureship at Cambridge in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Soon he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance, where he was able to put economic theory into practice.\n\nDuring World War I he worked for the Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the Treasury on Financial and Economic Questions.\n\nKeynes also attended the Conference on the Versailles Treaty to end World War I. He wrote \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" in 1919, and \"A Revision of the Treaty\" in 1922. In his books he said that the reparations which Germany was being made to pay would ruin the German economy and would lead to further fighting in Europe. These predictions were shown to be true when the German economy suffered in the hyperinflation of 1923. Reparations were only completed in 2010.\n\nKeynes's \"magnum opus\" (Latin for \"\"Great Work\"\", meaning his most famous book) was the \"General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\". The \"General Theory\" was published in 1936. The ideas in that book were very different from classical economics.\n\nHistorians agree that Keynes influenced U.S. president Roosevelt's New Deal, but disagree as to what extent. Spending more the government earned in taxes (called \"deficit spending\") was used in the New Deal from 1938. But the idea had been agreed to by President Herbert Hoover. Few senior economists in the U.S. agreed with Keynes in the 1930s. With time, however, his ideas became more widely accepted.\n\nIn 1942, Keynes was raised to the House of Lords. He became Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex. When he sat in the House of Lords he was a Liberal member.\n\nDuring World War II, Keynes wrote a book titled \"How to Pay for the War\". He said the war effort should be paid for by higher taxes. He did not like deficit spending because he wanted to avoid inflation.\n\nKeynes died of a heart attack at his holiday home in Tilton, East Sussex. His heart problems were made worse by the strain of working on post-war international financial problems. He died soon after he arranged a guarantee of an Anglo-American loan to Great Britain. Keynes' father, John Neville Keynes (1852–1949) outlived his son by three years. Keynes's brother Sir Geoffrey Keynes (1887–1982) was a distinguished surgeon, scholar and bibliophile. His nephews include Richard Keynes (born 1919) a physiologist; and Quentin Keynes (1921–2003) an adventurer and bibliophile. Keynes did not have children.\n\n\nThese people influenced Keynes:\n\n\n\n", "id": "90724", "title": "John Maynard Keynes"}

Also known as the North American robin, it belongs in the thrush family, \"Turdidae\". It was named after the European robin. This is because the European robin has a bright orange-red face and breast. The two species are not closely related. The American robin has seven subspecies. \"T. m. confinis\" is the most different subspecies.\n\nThe American robin lives throughout North America. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe (a vagrant is a bird that is found outside its normal species' range). It has also been a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize. The American robin can be found in many different kinds of habitats. It likes open areas of ground to feed and areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep. Because it has a large range, the IUCN Red List says that the American robin will not decline, and is listed as of least concern.\n\nThe American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south. The female will choose where to build the nest. She will make the nest with grass, sticks, paper, feathers, rootlets, and moss. Once the nest is built, she will lay 3 to 5 eggs. After the chicks leave the nest, both parents will continue to take care of them, until they can live on their own.\n\nAmerican robin eggs and juveniles are eaten by squirrels, snakes, blue jays, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. The adults are eaten by hawks, cats, and larger snakes. Sometimes, the brown-headed cowbird lays its eggs in the Robin's nest. This is called brood parasitism. However, the robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs.\n\nThis species was first described in 1766 by Linnaeus. It was described in the twelfth edition of his \"Systema naturae\". He called it \"Turdus migratorius\".\n\nThe American robin is large songbird. It has a round body. Its legs are long. It has a long tail. It has a long, yellow bill. It is dark gray-brown on its head, back, wings, and tail. It has an orange-red breast. There is a white patch on the underside of the belly, near the tail. This can be seen when it is flying. American robins that live in western North America are very pale (pale means light in color). American robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright. They have a white throat. It has black stripes in it. Females have lighter gray-brown heads than males. They also have lighter orange-red breasts. A young American robin (called a juvenile) is also lighter than the male. It has dark spots on its breast. Both sexes are 20–28 cm (7.9–11 in) long. They have a wingspan of 31–40 cm (12.2–15.7 in). American robins that live in western North America are very pale. American robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright.\n\nThe American robin was named after the European robin. This is because the European robin has a bright orange-red face and breast. The two species are not closely related.\n\nThe American robin has seven subspecies. They are very hard to tell apart and they do breed with each other.\n\nThe American robin can be found all over North America. It is found from Alaska and Canada south to Mexico. Most American robins winter in Florida and the Gulf States to Mexico to the Pacific Coast. They will sometimes winter in southern Canada and the northern United States.\n\nThe American robin is a rare vagrant to western Europe. Most of the American robins have been found in Britain. The most recent sighting of an American robin in Britain was in January 2007. It has also been a vagrant to Greenland, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Belize.\n\nAmerican robins are found in many different kinds of habitats. Some of them are gardens, parks, yards, fields, pastures, tundra, woodlands, pine forests, and shrublands. They like open areas of ground to feed. They like areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep.\n\nThe American robin has a large range. It is estimated that its range is 16 million square kilometers (6 million square miles). It is also estimated that there are about 320 million individual American robins. The IUCN Red List says that the species is not believed to reach the threat of decline. It is therefore considered Least Concern.\n\nAmerican robins used to be killed for their meat. They were killed in the southern states. The meat was thought as a very good food. The American robin is now protected in the United State by the Migratory Bird Act.\n\nThe American robin is most active during the day. During the winter, it groups together in large flocks at night. They sleep together in thick vegetation. During the day, these large winter flocks break up into smaller flocks. They feed in these smaller flocks. During the summer, American robins are less social. This is because they are defending their breeding territories.\n\nJuvenile robins spend their first four months of life near their nesting place. They then flock together with other American Robins before they migrate to their wintering places.\n\nThe American robin eats invertebrates. In the spring, they like to eat earthworms and snails. Some other invertebrates that American robins eat are beetles, grubs, and caterpillars. It will also eat fruits and berries. Some kinds of berries that they like to eat are chokecherries, hawthorn berries, dogwood berries, sumac fruits, and juniper berries.\n\nThe American robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south. It is one of the first North American birds to lay eggs. It has two to three broods (a brood is a group of offspring) each breeding season. The breeding season starts in April and ends in July. It is one of the first birds to sing at dawn. Its song is made up of several small groups of sounds that are repeated.\n\nThe female chooses where to make the nest. She will usually make the nest on one or many branches that are hidden in leaves. In the west, the female will make the nest on the ground or in thickets. In Alaska, the female will make the nest on a cliff. The female makes the nest. She starts with the inside. She uses grass and sticks to make a cup-shaped center. Other things that the female will use are paper, feathers, rootlets, and moss. After the center is done, she uses mud on the outside of the nest to make it stronger. She then puts soft grass in the cup. The nest is usually 15.2 to 20.3 cm (6 to 8 in) long. It is 7.6 to 15.2 cm high (3 to 6 in).\n\nThe female will lay 3 to 5 eggs in the nest. They are blue or blue-green. They are 2.8 to 3 cm (1.1 to 1.2 in) long. They are 2.1 cm (0.8 in) wide. Only the female incubates the eggs (incubate means that the adult will sit on the eggs and keep them warm and help the babies inside grow). It takes 12 to 14 days for the eggs to hatch. \n\nFor the first few days, the chicks have no feathers and their eyes are closed. The young live in the nest for about 13 days. As the chicks grow older, the female will protect them only at night and during bad weather. After the juveniles leave the nest, they will follow their parents around and beg them for food.\n\nBoth parents help feed and protect the fledged (fledged means a young bird that has just learned how to fly) juveniles until they can live on their own. The adults will give an alarm call to warn the juveniles that there is a predator near by. The parents will then attack the predator. Some of the predators they will attack are cats and dogs. They will even go after humans if the human gets close to their young. Fledged juveniles are only able to fly short distances. The coloring of the juveniles helps them hide better in bushes or trees. This kind of coloring is called camouflage.\n\nBird banders have found that only 25% of juvenile American robins live through their first year. The average life of an American Robin lasts about 2 years. The longest known lifespan of a wild American Robin is 14 years.\n\nEggs and juvenile robins that still live in the nest are eaten by squirrels and snakes. Some birds also eat eggs and juvenile robins. When feeding together in flocks, American robins will watch each other for signs of predators. If a predator is seen, they will make a warning call. Sometimes, the Brown-headed Cowbird lays its eggs in the robin's nest. This is called brood parasitism. The robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs. Because of this, brood parasitism by the cowbird is rare.\n\nThe American robin is known to carry a disease called the West Nile Virus. This disease comes from mosquitoes. Crows and jays are the first to die from this disease. The American robin is more responsible for the transmission of the disease to humans. This is because it lives longer with the disease than the crows and jays. This allows it to spread the disease to more mosquitoes which then spread the disease to humans and other animals.\n\nThe American robin is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It was also shown on a 1986 Canadian $2 note, but it is no longer on the bill.\n\nThere is color named after the American robin's eggs. It is called \"robin's egg blue\".\n\nThe robin is considered a symbol of spring. A good example is a poem by Emily Dickinson. It is called \"I Dreaded That First Robin So\". There are other poems about the first robin of spring. One of them is \"The First Robin\" by Dr. William H. Drummond. According to the author's wife, it is based on a Quebec false belief. The belief says that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck.\n", "id": "90726", "title": "American robin"}

He became famous all over the world for his organ playing, and he composed a lot of music for that instrument.\n\nMarcel Dupré was born in Rouen (Normandy, France). His family were musical. His father Albert Dupré was organist at the gothic abbey of St Ouen in Rouen. The young Marcel was a child prodigy. He entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1904, where he studied the piano and organ. His organ teachers were the most famous organists in France: Alexandre Guilmant and Louis Vierne, and also Charles-Marie Widor who taught him how to compose. In 1914, Dupré won the Grand Prix de Rome for his cantata, \"Psyché\". Twelve years later, he became professor of organ at the Paris Conservatoire, and stayed in that job until 1954.\n\nDupré became famous for performing more than 2,000 organ recitals in Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia. In 1920 he gave a series of concerts at the Paris Conservatoire in which he played all the organ works by Johann Sebastian Bach from memory. \n\nHe soon became world-famous. In 1934 Widor resigned as organist at St. Sulpice in Paris, and Dupré took over the post, which he kept for the rest of his life.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1954, he was director of the American Conservatory, which was in the Château de Fontainebleau near Paris. In 1954, Dupré took over from Claude Delvincourt (who had been killed in a car crash) as director of the Paris Conservatoire, where he stayed until 1956. He died at the age of 85.\n\nWhen Dupré gave organ recitals he often played his own compositions as well as those of other composers, especially Bach. Like Widor and Vierne, he composed long works in several movements which he called “symphonies”. When he played in church services he would start by playing composed music which was suitable for the time of year. Then he would improvise, playing complicated fugues, trio sonatas and chorale improvisations. He was so good at improvising that many people thought he had composed the music beforehand.\n\nWhen playing in concerts he was often given a tune, and then he would immediately make up a large work from that tune. In 1906, when he was still a student, he played for a wedding and two services when the famous Widor was going to be absent. Dupré asked Widor what music he should play. Widor told him to improvise something. Dupré waited for Widor to go out of the church before he started practising, but Widor crept back in and listened to him. He realized that Dupré would manage very well.\n\nDupré was famous as an organ teacher. He taught two generations of well-known organists including Jehan Alain, Marie-Claire Alain, Pierre Cochereau, Jeanne Demessieux,Jean Guillou, Jean Langlais, and Olivier Messiaen. \n\nDupré composed a great deal of organ music. When he was a boy he got to know Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, the most famous organ builder in France. Cavaillé-Coll had built the organ that Dupré’s father played, so he was used to the sound of modern French organs. Most of Dupré's music for the organ is very difficult to play. It includes the \"Three Preludes and Fugues\", Op. 7 (1914). Even Widor thought that the Prelude of the third piece was simply impossible to perform. However, Dupré could play it, and many organists after him learned to play it, too. Other notable works of Dupré's include the \"Symphonie-Passion\", the \"Esquisses\" and \"Évocation\", and the \"Cortège et Litanie\". \n\nAs well as composing lots of music, Dupré prepared study editions of the organ works of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schumann, César Franck, and Alexander Glazunov. He also wrote music for people who were learning to play the organ, and books on how to improvise on the organ.\n\n“Marcel Dupré at Saint-Sulpice” – Gerard Brooks: Organist’s Review Aug 1986 p. 161-166\n", "id": "90745", "title": "Marcel Dupré"}

It is at version 1.341. \"Notrium\" was developed by independent Finnish programmer Ville Mönkkönen. It is the seventh game that Ville has made, but it is only the fifth game to be made in English. Released in 2003, it won second place in the 'Adventure Game of the Year' contest on GameTunnel.\n\nThe game takes place on the invented planet Notrium. The game world is split up into squares, each of which has its own climate, land, and goals. The player can move between squares to reach the other areas, though some of the areas can only be reached by using vehicles or teleportation. There are climates such as jungle, desert, and tundra. All area squares can are changed by a day-night cycle, except for levels that are set indoors.\n\nThe game's graphics are all randomly generated (put together) at the start of the game, except in special game areas. This random generation changes where items and plants are, though most items and scenery will stay in their environment square. Environment squares do not change when the game is started. For example, a tree in the Jungle zone will be put in a different place each time a new game is begun, but the player character will still start in the same place as always.\n\nThe plot of the game is that a team of four, an Alien, a Human, an Android (a robot), and a Psionic creature, have left Earth in a spacecraft, because Earth was going to be destroyed. After the player has chosen the character he/she wants to control, the game begins. The spacecraft is shot at by missiles from the planet Notrium, which is close by. The player's character gets into an escape pod and crashes on the planet's surface. From there, the player must find a way to survive, as well as a way to escape.\n\nJournal entries, which are different for each character, appear every game day for two game weeks. These entries tell about what happened to the characters while they were on the spacecraft. For example, the journal of the Human tells that he was the captain of the ship; while the journal of the Android shows that he was the ship's mechanic. Other happenings can be discovered by going to special places in the game, or finishing a goal.\n\n\"Notrium\" has more than one ending to the game. Different characters can get different endings. Some endings can only be won by one character, while other endings can be won by other characters as well.\n\nA person plays \"Notrium\" looking from a top-down view. The player may move in all directions while facing in a different one, similar to the way a first-person shooter is controlled, and similar to the freeware PC shooter game \"Crimsonland\". \n\nDuring the game, the player can find items and objects, such as plants, weapons, and machines. Most important items, like a force field to protect the character, are not found in one piece. The player can build them out of two or three other parts. \n\nGameplay is about collecting parts to build, defending from enemies, and then winning one of the game's endings. Depending on the character the player has picked, the game is played in a different way. The fast-moving Alien starts with a very strong attack and gets more attacks over time, but it cannot use any weapons. The Human starts with a very weak attack, but he can make many weapons and armor to get more powerful.\n\nThe game also has weather. If \"Notrium\" is played on a setting harder than 'easy', the character will be changed by the weather. Standing near a fire will make the player more hot, and standing under a tree will make the player less hot. In some areas of the game, there is dangerous weather, like sandstorms, blizzards, or acid rain.\n\n\"Notrium\" was made to be easy to mod (change), and a guide about how to change is on Ville's website. \nWhen the player starts a new game after getting a new mod, he or she can choose what mod they want to play. \n\nMods can make many changes, such as putting new items or goals into the game, changing or making new environment squares. Mods can even make a new character that the player can choose, such as in the 'Werivar' mod.\n", "id": "90797", "title": "Notrium"}

Before the building opened, it was called Burj Dubai. The building is 160 stories high. Construction of the tower was started in 2004. The building was officially opened on 4 January 2010. It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world. The building is more than taller than Taipei 101. Taipei 101 was the tallest building until 2010 before Burj Khalifa was built. But the Burj Khalifa may not hold this record for very long because an even taller building called the Jeddah Tower is being built in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and it will be taller than 1 kilometer.\n\nAdrian Smith designed the tower. He worked with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) until 2006. It was built by Samsung Engineering & Construction, Besix, and Arabtec. The tower cost US $1.5 billion to build. The building is part of a 2 km building project on Sheikh Zayed Road, Downtown Burj Khalifa. It is near Dubai's main business district.\n\nThe main contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea. They also built the Taipei 101 and Petronas Twin Towers. Other contractors who helped with the building included Belgian group Besix and Arabtec from the UAE. The Turner Construction Company was chosen as the construction project manager. \n\nThe design architect, Adrian Smith, did not like the first design of the upper part of the building. He added 27 new floors and an aluminium spire to the top of the plans. The design of Burj Khalifa based on those used in Islamic architecture. Burj Khalifa has been said to have had several other planned height increases since it was first built. This has not been proven to be true yet. The TV/radio communications mast was added to the tower's plans in 2007. This was after building work had begun in 2006. There are pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors about every 35 floors. These were put into the tower in case of an emergency or fire.\n\nThe unusual design and engineering problems of building Burj Khalifa have been shown in many television documentaries. These include the \"Big, Bigger, Biggest\" series on the National Geographic and Five channels, and the \"Mega Builders\" series on the Discovery Channel.\n\nThe most important building materiel of Burj Khalifa is reinforced concrete. A special concrete was needed because of the high pressures of the building's weight and the hot local climate of Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach . Any major cracks could have caused a large amount of damage to the building.\n\nThe foundation of the building is deep. It was built with 192 columns being put into the ground. Each column was 1.5m in diameter and 43m long. 55,000 tonnes of steel rebar was used in the construction of the tower. It took 22 million man-hours to build. A high density, low permeability concrete was used in the foundations of Burj Khalifa. A cathodic protection system is used to lessen any bad effects from corrosive chemicals in local ground water.\n\nA fountain system was built outside the tower. It was designed by WET Design of California. They built and planned out the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel Lake in Las Vegas. The fountain cost Dh800 million (US$217 million). It is lit by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors. The fountain is 275 ft long. It shoots water 150 ft into the air to the sounds of classical and modern Arabic and world music. On 26 October 2008, the fountain was named the Dubai Fountain.\n\nEmaar Properties said on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was slowed because of changes to finishes. An Emaar official said that the luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was first planned, were being being replaced by better finishes. The design of the apartments were also made better. This was done to make them both look better and work better. There were problems with the marble decorations, flooring, the top floors' sanitation system, broken glasswork and a poorly done wall mural of the Sultan of Oman. A new ending date of 2 December, 2009, was then given. Burj Khalifa opened on 4 January 2010.\n\nBurj Khalifa was built mainly by people from South Asia. Press reports said in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned UK£4.34 a day, and labourers earned UK£2.84. According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report, the workers lived in very bad conditions. Often they were not paid for the work. Their passports were taken by their employers. It was said that they were working in dangerous conditions that caused high number of deaths and injuries. Companies not paying workers has been reported to the authorities several times.\n\nOn 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers protested. They were mad about buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts. They damaged cars, offices, computers, and construction equipment. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said they caused almost UK£500,000 in damage. Most of the workers who were part of the riot returned the following day but would not work.\n\nThe building is not only the tallest structure in the world, it also holds the following records- \n\n\n \n", "id": "90826", "title": "Burj Khalifa"}

It is built of masonry and held in place just by gravity. It was the first dam across the Nile, and was built by the British between 1899 and 1902. When it was done, it was the largest masonry dam in the world. This type of dam is called a buttress dam. \n\nThe dam was built at the former first cataract of the Nile, and is about 1000 km up-river and 690 km (direct distance) south-southeast of Cairo. When initially constructed between 1899 and 1902, nothing of its scale had ever been attempted. \n\nThe dam was designed to provide storage of annual floodwater. The water was used to help dry season flow and support more irrigation. Its height was originally limited because of concern for the Temple of Isis at Phillae (Philae Temple). That temple was later moved to Agilkia Island in Lake Nasser. \n\nThe dam provided inadequate storage capacity for planned development and was raised twice, between 1907–1912 and again 1929–1933. These heightenings still did not meet irrigation demands and in 1946 it was nearly over-topped by water in an effort to maximize pool elevation.\n\nThis eventually led to the construction of the Aswan High Dam upstream.\n\nThe second function of the dam is to provide electricity. The dammed water drives a water turbine and generator. It still works today. This technology (hydroelectricity) had been invented in the 19th century in England and Germany, and was by 1900 used in the USA and most European countries.\nEgypt got access to the technology because she was, at that time, under British control.

The Georges Head fort is one of many forts that were built on Sydney Harbour meant to defend the colony of New South Wales, just encase another country tried to invade our country Australia. The fort became the boss of all other forts in the 1890s organizing all of Sydney's harbour forts.\n\nThe area where the fort is was once home to Aborigines that lived in the area for thousands of years and long before Europeans visited and decided to stay.\n\nGeorges Head fort was built in 1871 after the British Army decided to leave Australia in 1870. When they left the responsibility for protecting Sydney and Sydney Harbour was now in the hands of rich colonies like New South Wales and Victoria who now had to organise its own defences.\n\nGeorges Head was near the entrance to Sydney Harbour and was meant to attack baddies (foreign ships that are not friendlies) before they could get into the harbour. The fort was on a very good spot and was positioned high above sea level with clear views to the entrance of Port Jackson (Sydney Harbour/Sydney Heads). Other forts were also on Middle Head, South Head, Shark Point and Bradleys Head, but none were ever used for fighting ships or troops from other countrys.\n\nGeorges Head was armed with four 80 pounder cannons and two 68 pounder cannons. These cannons were 'muzzle-loading', which meant the cannonballs or bullets along with the explosive charge (T.N.T dynamite) were loaded into the front of the cannons barrel. It took three months and 250 soldiers to roll the gun barrels all the way from North Sydney to the forts. They came along a dirt road which later became Military Road. Once they were put in place, the cannons had been placed so close together that it created the risk of one cannon firing upon another. Also, the cannons and the men could be seen from ships in the harbour. In 1877 large mounds of earth were placed between the pits to make sure the guns neither could fire upon each other and to help protect the gun crew from enemy fire. When construction of the fort was finalised, there were a total of 41 gun emplacements around Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe planning of defence was planned using telescopes and plotters sitting in the middle of the second gun pit. From the telephone exchange, the Port Jackson District Commandant could talk with all the other forts around the harbour. Telephone wires ran through tunnels, down the cliff and under the harbour to forts on the other side.\n\nGeorges Head was later chosen as the best place to spy and fire mines which were laid underwater. In 1888 Georges Head battery was upgraded for the latest in harbour defences in the form of submarine bombs. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners. From Georges Head, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. Their job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to the firing post.\n\nThe work of the submarine miner was secretive, technical and dangerous. During a demonstration in 1891, a crowd of several thousand watched as a terrible accident killed four miners and injured another eight.\n", "id": "90839", "title": "Georges Head Battery"}

He is one of the greatest contributors to the Dîvân tradition of Turkish literature, \n\nFuzûlî wrote his collected poems (dîvân) in three different languages: Azerbaijani Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. Although his Turkish works are written in Azerbaijani, he knew both the Ottoman and the Chagatai Turkish literary traditions as well. He was also very able in mathematics and astronomy.\n\nFuzûlî was born around 1483 in what is now Iraq; he was probably born in either Karbalā’ or an-Najaf. Fuzûlî's ancestors had been of nomadic origin, but his family had long since settled in towns.\n\nFuzûlî was educated by his father—who was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah — and then by a teacher named Rahmetullah. It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani. \n\nOne of the few things that is known of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word \"fuzûlî\"—which literally means \"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\"—because he \"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\". Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning—what is called \"tevriyye\" (توريه) in Ottoman Divan poetry — as Fuzûlî himself explains: \"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary \"fuzûl\" (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of \"fazl\" (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as \"‘ulûm\" (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and \"fünûn\" (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')\".\n\nIn 1534, the Ottoman sultan Süleymân I conquered the region of Baghdad, where Fuzûlî lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuzûlî now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman patronage system, and he composed a number of poems in praise of the sultan, and as a result, he was granted a stipend. But he did not really get it. Therefore he citicized bureaucracy in one of his best-known works, the letter \"Şikâyetnâme\" (شکايت نامه; \"Complaint\"):\n\nThe loss of his stipend meant that Fuzûlî never became secure. He died during a plague outbreak in 1556, in Karbalā’, either of the plague itself or of cholera.\n\n\n\n", "id": "90857", "title": "Fuzûlî"}

When the queen discovers her husband's passion for a servant girl, she becomes very angry and orders that this girl is sent to prison; but it turns out that the girl is a princess, therefore the affair is accepted in the end.\n\n\"Abhijñānashākuntala\" tells the story of a king, \"Dushyanta\", who meets in the forests \"Shakuntalā\", the adopted daughter of a wise man who lives with him in a cottage in the forests. \nDushyanta and Shakuntalā fall in love with each other and get married.

As in the pipe organ, the sound is made by air blowing through the pipes, but power to make the air blow does not come from bellows or from electricity as in the modern organ, but from water, for example from a waterfall.\n\nA hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water. It was invented in the 3rd century B.C., probably by the Hellenistic scientist Ctesibius of Alexandria. It was the world's first keyboard instrument. Many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ.\n\nThe water organ works by having water and air arriving together in the camera aeolis (wind chamber). Here, water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind-trunk on top of the camera aeolis, to blow the organ pipes. Two perforated ‘splash plates’ or ‘diaphragms’ stop the water spray from getting into the organ pipes. \n\nThe water, having been separated from the air, leaves the camera aeolis at the same speed as it enters. It then drives a water wheel, which in turn drives the musical cylinder and the movements attached. To start the organ, the tap above the entry pipe is turned on and, given a continuous flow of water, the organ plays until the tap is closed again. \n\nDuring the Renaissance many Italian gardens had water organs. The most famous water organ of the 16th century was at the Villa d'Este in Tivoli. It was about 6 metres high and was powered by a beautiful waterfall. It could play three pieces automatically, but there was also a keyboard.\n", "id": "90882", "title": "Water organ"}

The word was then used in the late 19th century (1800s) for poor painters, writers, musicians and actors who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money. Paris was a famous town for painters, writers, and musicians to gather, to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city. Many of them lived at Montmartre, not far from the \"Moulin Rouge\". One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. He loved to paint the can-can dancers and prostitutes. He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs. The posters are now famous works of art. \n\nIn the 20th century the word \"Bohemian\" spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts. The sort of behaviour that was thought of as \"Bohemian\" included whether a person had a regular job, how they dressed, their political views, their religious views, their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked. \n\nPeople who were called \"Bohemians\" were often very poor, because they tried to live by painting, acting or writing. It was hard to make a living. They generally wore old or second-hand clothing, and could not afford a good hair-cut. They often shared the room in the roof of a house, which was cheap, because it was cold in winter, hot in summer and often had birds living there as well. In some ways the life of a bohemian artist was difficult, but it gave people freedom to express themselves, that was often not found in more conservative society, where everyone worried about what other people thought of them, and cared a lot about things like clothes and houses. Sometimes students from richer families would come to live a \"Bohemian life style\", so that they could feel the same freedom to express themselves. \n\nDuring the 20th century, many cities apart from Paris have areas where people have lived Bohemian lifestyles. One of the problems is that these areas often become fashionable for rich people. This soon drives away the poor artists and students, because they can no longer afford the rent.\n\nBohemian areas in different cities are: \n\n\n\n", "id": "90967", "title": "Bohemianism"}

He used ideas that had been created by the French organ builder Cavaillé-Coll and by Barker. He made several inventions himself, including the thumb piston, which made it possible for an organist to change the combination of stops without taking his hands off the keyboard.\n\nFour generations of the Willis family continued the family tradition of organ building until 1997, when Henry Willis IV retired and the new Managing Director of the firm was not a member of the Willis family.

The other manuals - there were usually two others, but sometimes three - could be “coupled” to the Great.

The 2005 season of the contest attracted more than 120,000 applicants during the preliminary selection rounds, held in the provinces Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan and Zhejiang. Many applicants travelled long distances to take part in the competition. Each contestant was allowed 30 seconds to perform to judges and find out if they were selected for the preliminary regional rounds. To prevent another overwhelming audition season, the minimum age of 18 was later set during the 2006 season.\n\nFollowing the selection of contestants in the five regions, the competition began with the preliminary rounds. Preliminaries were held in each of the five locations where auditions were located. Vviewers were able to watch each of the preliminaries and vote for their favorite singers. Voting was conducted by telephone and SMS.\n\nThe regional preliminaries are followed by a weekly broadcast single-elimination (knockout) tournament held in Changsha, Hunan. The least voted two face-off subsequently in a \"PK.\" The term \"PK\" comes from \"Player Kill,\" a reference to kill-or-be-killed online games. The singer with the least number of votes is then eliminated. The last event is contested between the final 3.\n\nJudges for the competition were selected from different backgrounds in society. \"Audience judges\" were selected in addition to several professional judges.\n\nThe original version of the show was known as \"Super Boy\" and aired in 2003 on Hunan Entertainment Channel, a local broadcaster based in Changsha, Hunan. The show was a success and the counterpart \"Super Girl\" aired at the beginning of 2004 and became the most viewed show in Hunan. However, the programme's impact was limited as the channel does not broadcast outside the province.\n\nOn 6 May 2004, \"Super Girl\" was introduced to a national audience by its producer Liao Ke through Hunan Satellite Television. In addition to broadcasting the original episodes created by Hunan Entertainment Channel, the network also developed this show in other 3 cities: Wuhan in Hubei, Nanjing in Jiangsu and Chengdu in Sichuan. This show attracted an average of 10,000 contestants in each city and received nationwide attention.\n\nHunan Satellite Television introduced a second season of \"Super Girl\" on 19 March 2005. The preliminary rounds were filmed in five cities: Changsha in Hunan Province, Guangzhou in Guangdong Province, Zhengzhou in Henan Province, Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, and Chengdu in Sichuan Province. By the middle of the season, the competition captivated a nationwide audience and became one of the most watched television entertainment shows in China with tens of millions of viewers.\n\nThe final episode of the 2005 season was one of the most popular shows in Chinese broadcast history, drawing more than 400,000,000 viewers, more than CCTV's New Year's Gala earlier that year. The final peaked at 280,000,000 viewers at a given time, higher than the 12,000,000-viewer figure for the finals of \"Pop Idol\". Despite the show being condemned by CCTV as being \"vulgar and manipulative\", season 3 of the show was launched and finished in early October 2006.\n\nOn 18 January 2006, China National Philatelic Corporation released a postage stamp issue featuring 2005 winner Li Yu Chun. The set was shortly earlier than Li's twenty-second birthday in her commemoration.\n\nOn 11 May 2009, \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", a worldwide famous television show, invited Zhang Liangying, who ranked 3rd overall in the 2005 contest, to make an American television singing debut. The subtitle of the show was \"The World's Got Talent\" and Zhang Liangying was the only east Asian singer in the show.\n\nSome who were not chosen as winners have also been able to enter the recording industry through other means. Ji Min Jia, who ranked fifth overall in the 2005 contest, worked in Los Angeles in 2006 to help with production of the title song for Japanese anime series \"The Galaxy Railways\". On 15 March 2007, Japanese recording group Hello! Project announced Li Chun, one of the top 50 contestants in the 2006 Changsha regional, as one of two new members of Chinese ancestry of its pop group Morning Musume.\n\nThe contest has also inspired television producers to create other talent search shows.\n\nOne of the main factors contributing to the show's popularity was that viewers are able to participate in the judging process by sending SMSs with their mobile phones to vote for their favorite contestants. During the 2005 regional contest in Chengdu alone, 307,071 message votes were cast for the top three contestants, each vote costing ¥0.5 to ¥3.\n\nOver 800,000,000 text messages were sent during the third season of \"Super Girl\", and fan clubs began to appear throughout the country. After the large response to the ability to vote, the Chinese government banned the show from continuing to a fourth season. The show was the feature of a 2007 documentary titled \"Super, Girls!\", produced and directed by independent Chinese filmmaker Jian Yi on the 2006 Super Voice Girls contest, released at the Cambridge Film Festival. An ARTiSIMPLE Studio production, \"Super, Girls!\" is the only independent feature-length documentary ever made about the \"Super Girls.\"\n\nWhile some culture and media experts praised \"Super Girl\" in blazing \"a trail for cultural democracy\" and breaking elitism in China's entertainment industry, others stated that \"the show represented a superficiality in society, propelled by behind-the-scenes manipulation and state-of-the-art pomp and circumstance\".\n\nMengniu reportedly paid ¥14,000,000 to Hunan Television for rights to sponsor the show's broadcast outside Hunan province beginning with the 2005 season. The 2005 contest was estimated to have drawn in a total of ¥766,000,000. Indirect business impact of the competition was estimated at several billion yuan.\n\nTelevision advertisement slots cost an average of ¥33,400 for 15 seconds in 2006, compared to the average of ¥28,000 in 2005. Advertising sales were expected to reach ¥200,000,000, nearly double that of the previous year.\n\nThe first season of \"Super Girl\" aired from 6 May to 22 September 2004. Although the winners of the competition were not promised recording contracts, the top three winners signed such deals.\n\n\nThe second season of \"Super Girl\" aired from 19 March to 26 August in 2005. There was much controversy about the Li Yu Chun being the season's grand champion as she had the most votes even though she had \"the weakest voice among the top finalists\". Despite the heavy criticism that arose during the competition season, the three 2005 finalists have been considered the most successful singers from the entire show.\n\nThe third season of aired from 2 April to 30 September 2006. Shang Wen Jie's selection as grand champion over Tan Wei Wei, who is a professional vocalist from Sichuan Conservatory of Music, raised questions at each candidate's public appeal. Speculations arose that Shang, who appeared to be a copycat of Li Yu Chun's image, was voted grand champion due to the appeal of her Cinderella story.\n\n\n", "id": "91007", "title": "Super Girl"}

The title was often used by English composers in the late Renaissance or Baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style, i.e. it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue. It was meant to sound as if it was being improvised (the word voluntary in general means “free”, i.e. not “forced to do something”).\n\nComposers such as Orlando Gibbons, John Blow and Henry Purcell wrote voluntaries, although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as \"fancy\" (an English form of the Italian word \"fantasia\"), or even \"fugue\". However, these \"fugues\" were not composed in the proper fugue style: they just started off with imitation as in a fugue, but continued in a freer style.\n\nSome voluntaries were called \"double voluntaries\". These were pieces written for organs with two manuals (keyboards). The pieces contrasted a loud manual with a soft one.\n\nSome voluntaries were known as \"trumpet voluntaries\". These were voluntaries which had a tune which was played (with the right hand) on a stop called a “trumpet” or a “cornet”. Two very famous trumpet voluntaries, often played at weddings, are the trumpet voluntary by Henry Purcell and the one by Jeremiah Clarke (which people used to think was composed by Purcell). In the 18th century the composer John Stanley wrote many trumpet voluntaries.\n\n", "id": "91021", "title": "Voluntary (music)"}

When a person changes their main home in Germany, or buys a new car, they must buy new number plates.\n\nNumber plates can be bought which are valid all year round or between 2 to 11 months within any 12 months. This allows changing between summer and winter cars, such as a convertible and a sedan/saloon without having the time and money wasted for de- and re-registering. \n\nThe present number plate format, used since 1994, uses black print on a white background and first provides information about the country where the car is registered within the European Union. German licence plates show a \"D\" (for \"Deutschland\"=\"Germany\") on the blue strip on the left, which shows the European Union's flag, 12 golden stars in a circle on blue ground.\n\nAfter that, there are between one and three letters for the city or region where the car is registered, such as B for Berlin. These units usually coincide with the German districts, in few cases an urban district and the surrounding district share the same letter code. Usually if an urban district and a rural district share the code, the number of the following letters is different. For example, the urban district (Straubing) SR has one letter after the code (SR - A 123). The surrounding district Straubing-Bogen has two letters (SR - AB 123) after the code. It depends on the number of registered cars (or citizens) whether the City or the district has two letters, because there are more possibilities with two letters, so the part with more citizens usually has two letters. For example, the urban district Regensburg has more citizens than the rural district Regensburg, so the city has two letters after the code R.\n\nThe number of letters in the city/region code usually shows the size and location of the district: the largest German cities generally only have one letter codes (B=Berlin, M=München (Munich), K=Köln (Cologne), F=Frankfurt am Main), most other districts in Germany have two or three letter codes. Districts in eastern Germany usually have more letters, for two reasons:\n\nThis is only a rule of thumb, there are a number of exceptions e.g. Germany's second largest city Hamburg (HH, Hansestadt Hamburg, because of its historical membership in the Hanseatic League) or the west German district Ammerland (WST, Westerstede is the capital of the district).\n\nThe reason for this scheme is however not to display size or location, but simply to have enough combinations available within the maximum length of eight characters per plate.\n\nAfter the location name there are the emission test and vehicle safety test stickers (see below), followed by one or two letters and one to four numbers. These letters and numbers can be chosen by the vehicle owner or if they prefer, random ones can be allocated by the licensing office. The total quantity of letters and numbers on the plate is never higher than eight. One letter with low numbers are normally reserved for motorcycle use since the plate space of these vehicles is smaller.\n\nVarious combinations that could be considered politically unacceptable—mainly due to implications relating to Nazi Germany—are disallowed or otherwise avoided. The district Sächsische Schweiz uses the name of its main town, Pirna, in its code \"PIR\", to avoid the use of \"SS\", the name of the nazi group; similarly \"SA\" is also unused. This is why cars for the government and parliament in Saxony-Anhalt are registered with LSA (Land Sachsen Anhalt). In 2004 in Nuremberg, a car owner was refused a number plate beginning N-PD because of the connection to the political party, the NPD. \n\nBanned combinations include the Nazi abbreviations HJ (\"Hitlerjugend\", Hitler Youth), NS (\"Nationalsozialismus\", National Socialism), SA (\"Sturmabteilung\"), SS (\"Schutzstaffel\") and KZ (\"Konzentrationslager\", concentration camp). Some registration offices have overlooked this rule by mistake, however; there are a few cars registered carrying prohibited codes, such as \"B-SS 12\". Some counties also allow these combinations if they are the initials of the owner (e.g., Norbert Schmidt might be able to get XX-NS 1234), but in this case, if the car is sold and re-registered in the same county by the new owner, the number can be changed (otherwise the number stays with the car until it registered in a different area).\n\nCertain types of vehicle bear special codes:\n\n\n\nThe German Federal President's license plate is 0-1, the Chancellor's 0-2, the Foreign Secretary's 0-3. The plate of the President of the Bundestag is an exception: it shows 1-1. This is to show that the Bundestag's President is not part of the government but still ranks higher in importance than the Chancellor. These vehicles are tax-exempt and need not to be insured since the German government acts as insurer.\n\n", "id": "91031", "title": "German car number plates"}

Blizzards start when a high pressure system touches as low pressure system. The word \"blizzard\" is sometimes used incorrectly by news media to talk about big winter storms, even if the storm is not a blizzard.\n\nSome areas are more likely to be hit by blizzards than others, but a blizzard can occur in any place where snow falls. In North America, blizzards happen often in the northern-east states, and in the provinces of Canada. In this region, blizzards can happen more than twice each winter. They also occur often in the mountain ranges of western North America. Because these regions have low populations, blizzards sometimes are not reported.\n\nA very dangerous type of blizzard is a whiteout. In a whiteout, downdrafts and snowfall are so thick that people cannot tell the ground and sky apart. People caught in a whiteout lose their sense of direction very fast. This is a large danger to pilots when they are flying airplanes, because they cannot tell how close they are to the ground, and may crash.\n\nThe Great Blizzard of 1888 was very damaging for the Northeastern United States. In that blizzard, 400 people died, 200 ships sunk, and snowdrifts were 10 or 15 feet high. In the Great Plains, states were hit by the Schoolhouse Blizzard that trapped children in schools and killed 235 people. \n\nIn 1880–1881 there was a winter that people in the Dakotas called the \"Hard Winter\".

The book is almost all true. Her story of two men from the town of DeSmet, South Dakota, going after some wheat stored some miles south of DeSmet in February 1881 is true, and Ingalls later married one of the men, Almanzo Wilder). If the two men had not found and brought back the wheat, the people would have starved. The snow and ice thawed in April, and the railroads could start again. The train picture above was photographed on March 29, 1881, not far from DeSmet.\n\n34 people died during a 3-day spring blizzard on March 1920 in North Dakota. One of the people who died was Hazel Miner, a teenage girl who died of freezing to death when she got lost on her way home from her one-room-school. \n\nThe Armistice Day Blizzard in 1940 surprised many people with how fast the temperature dropped. It was in the morning, but by noon, it was snowing. Some of the people froze to death in the snow. 154 people died in the Armistice Day Blizzard. \n\n105 years after the Great Blizzard of 1888, a giant blizzard, named the Storm of the Century, hit the U.S in 1993. It dropped snow on 26 states and reached as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico. In many southern U.S. areas, such as parts of Alabama, more snow fell in this storm than ever fell in an entire winter. Highways and airports closed across the U.S. The blizzard also made 15 tornadoes in Florida. When the storm was over, 270 people died and 48 were reported missing.\n\n\n\n", "id": "91088", "title": "Blizzard"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91098", "text": "Samuel Sebastian Wesley\n\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley (born London, 14 August 1810; died 19 April 1876) was an English organist and composer. He was the greatest English composer of church music of his day. He lived at a time when the standard of music in England had become very bad. He did a lot to improve it, especially church music. He had a hard life earning enough money. This was largely his own fault: he was a difficult man with a bad temper and often argued with his employers. \n\nHe was born in London, the illegitimate son of the composer Samuel Wesley and his partner Sarah Suter. He was given the name of his father (Samuel) and the name Sebastian after the composer Johann Sebastian Bach. \n\nAs a boy he sang in the choir of the Chapel Royal. The Chapel Royal was not nearly as good as it had been in the 16th and 17th centuries when it had been associated with many famous composers. When choirboys made mistakes the music teacher William Hawes would hit them with a riding whip. Samuel Sebastian was an excellent choirboy, and he and another boy were sent to Brighton to sing to King George IV who had gone there for his holiday. He also sang at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nWhen he was a young man he played the organ in several churches in London and started to compose. He wrote some music for melodramas in theatres. When he was 22 he became organist of Hereford Cathedral. This changed his life, because his career now focussed on church music. The choir at Hereford was not very good. The organ was broken, and his lodgings were not nice. However, he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival and he composed some church music, including the popular anthem \"Blessed be the God and Father\", written for an Easter Day service when the choir only had boys and one male singer. He married the sister of the dean of the cathedral. Her family did not approve and did not go to the wedding.\n\nIn 1835 he moved to Exeter Cathedral. He improved the choir there and persuaded the authorities to renovate the organ. He had a good salary there, but soon got fed up because he argued with his employers. He often went fishing instead of going to work, sending one of his choir boys to play the organ instead. One day, when Wesley was supposed to play “God Save the King” he played “Rule Britannia”. This sort of behaviour did not do his reputation much good. He wanted to get a doctorate degree from Oxford University so he wrote an anthem \"O Lord thou art my God\". The professor at Oxford, William Crotch, wanted him to make some changes in the music, but he refused. In the end he was given the degree anyway. \n\nThe next job he had was at Leeds Parish Church. This was the only job he had in his life which was not at a cathedral, but his choir at Leeds was probably better than any of the cathedral choirs he had. The services there were very good, and he improved the choir singing. Leeds was not a nice town in those days. It was very badly polluted through industry. Wesley earned extra money by giving music lessons. He was also in demand for giving organ recitals in different churches. He gave the choir more modern music to sing, including his own compositions. He wrote an introduction to a book of psalm tunes in which he criticized the state of the church in England. He did it in a very personal way and it made his employers angry.\n\nOne day he went fishing when he should have been at choir practice. He fell when climbing over a stile and broke his leg. After that he always walked with a limp. While he was in hospital he wrote an anthem \"Cast me not away\" to words from Psalm 51. When the music gets to the words “the bones which thou hast broken” he set them to strange, crunching chords.\n\nIn spite of his awkward behaviour the people in Leeds were sorry when he left. He conducted a performance of the \"Messiah\" and he was given a portrait of himself.\n\nHe went to Winchester Cathedral. At first he got on very well with the clergy. He performed and composed new music. He spent a lot of time collecting and publishing all the anthems he had written. He composed hymn tunes. He persuaded his employers to spend money on improving the organ.\n\nAlthough he was being paid a good salary (£80 a year) Wesley did less and less work. He performed less and left a lot of the playing to his pupils so that he could go fishing and sailing. He did not like the new precentor who was appointed in 1858. \n\nIn 1863 he composed an anthem \"Give the King thy Judgement\" for the marriage of the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII and Princess Alexandra of Denmark). He did not like Winchester. He said there were no other good musicians to talk to.\n\nWhen the job of organist at Gloucester Cathedral became available he took it and left Winchester very quicky. Once again he found himself in a cathedral with a bad choir and an organ in a bad state of repair, but this time he seemed to make little effort to do anything about it. He spent a lot of time editing other people’s music. Once more, after a gap of 30 years, he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival. He conducted the music of Louis Spohr, his father Samuel Wesley and also some music by the young Hubert Parry who was not yet well-known. When he conducted he often did not think about what he was doing and got muddled. In 1871 he conducted Bach’s St Matthew Passion, the first time it had been performed in England outside London. \n\nHe was offered a knighthood but chose to be given money instead. He started to become ill. He had a kidney disease. The last time he played the organ was at Christmas in 1875. He died on 19th April 1876 and was buried next to his daughter in Devon. There was no music at all at his funeral.\n\nWesley is remembered for his music composed for the Church of England. He wrote many anthems, including \"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace\", \"Blessed be the God and Father\", \"The Wilderness\" and \"Ascribe unto the Lord\". The last two of these are verse anthems (anthem which contrast sections for the full choir with sections for a few soloists). The popular short anthem \"Lead me Lord\" is part of \"Praise the Lord, O my soul\".\n\nHe wrote a number of organ works. One of his most charming pieces is \"Holsworthy Church Bells\" (1874). He also wrote chamber and orchestral music.\n\nWesley had an important influence on organ building. He went to the Great Exhibition in 1851 and saw organs with pedals that, instead of being exactly parallel, spread out at the top like a fan. He liked these radiating pedal boards and persuaded the great organ builder Henry Willis to put pedal boards like that in the organs he built. \n\nSamuel Sebastian Wesley was a very famous performer and throughout his life he was often asked to play the first concerts on new organs (“inaugural concerts”). His music is still very popular today, and some of his short anthems are not too difficult for the average church choir to sing.\n\n", "id": "91098", "title": "Samuel Sebastian Wesley"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91105", "text": "La bohème\n\nLa bohème (pronounced, \"La bo-EM\") is an Italian opera in four acts. The music was written by Giacomo Puccini. The libretto was written by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa.\n\nThe opera tells the story of a love affair between a poor poet and an equally poor seamstress in 19th century Paris. The opera is based on a book by Henri Murger called \"Scenes from Bohemian Life\" (). \nArturo Toscanini conducted the first performance of \"La bohème\" on February 1, 1896 at the Teatro Regio in Turin, Italy. The opera was adapted to a movie in 1965 and the 1996 Broadway musical, \"Rent\".\n\nHenri Murger was born in 1822 to an immigrant German tailor in Paris. He worked as a secretary until 1841 when he became a journalist and joined the poor artists and writers who called themselves Bohemians.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1848, Murger's stories about Bohemian life in Paris were serialized (published in parts) in a French magazine. The book brought Murger little income. Playwright Théodore Barrière suggested making a play of the book, and Murger accepted. The play appeared in 1849. It was a success.\n\nAlmost every chapter of Murger's book mentions an incident or event which found its way into Puccini's opera. However, the love affair between the poet and the seamstress appears only as a little tale in the book about a sculptor named Jacques and a seamstress named Francine.\n\nAfter the publication of the play, adaptations appeared. In 1877, an operetta was staged in Paris. In 1897, an opera by Ruggero Leoncavallo was staged in Venice. Another play based on the book was performed in New York in 1896. The first movie was released in 1916, and other movies were released in the following years.\n\nPuccini wrote most of \"La bohème\" at Torre del Lago, a village in Tuscany he had just made his home. Most decisions about the opera were made through letters sent back and forth between Ricordi (Puccini's publisher), the two librettists, and the composer. This arrangement was not the best for getting the work done in a timely manner.\n\nPuccini began toying with the idea of writing another work called \"La lupa\" (\"The She-Wolf\"). The librettists were furious. Puccini was dividing his time between two projects while taking them to task for their slowness on the present one. Giacosa complained that he used more paper and time on \"La bohéme\" that he had on any of his other dramas.\n\nWhole scenes were rewritten, revised, and even discarded before going through the cycle again. Despite the turmoil, Puccini was considering the David Belasco play \"Tosca\" as yet another project. He briefly interrupted work on \"La bohème\" to travel to Florence to see Sarah Bernhardt perform the play.\n\nPuccini and Ruggero Leoncavallo (composer of the 1892 opera \"I pagliacci\") both chose to set Mürger's book to music. Each claimed he was the first to make this decision. Leoncavallo's \"La Bohème\" was first performed in 1897, the year after Puccini's opera. Leoncavallo's opera never attained the fame that Puccini's did probably because Puccini's opera was gaining a popularity in 1897 that left Leoncavallo's opera in the dust.\n\n\"La bohème\" was first performed in Turin, Italy on February 1, 1896 at the Teatro Regio. It was conducted by Arturo Toscanini. In 1946, Toscanini conducted a radio performance that was released to LP records and later compact discs. It is the only recording of a Puccini opera by its original conductor.\n\nWithin a few years, the opera was performed in theatres throughout Italy including La Scala and La Fenice. The first performance outside of Italy was in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1896. Other performances followed in the next ten years around the world.\n\nThe first performance in United Kingdom took place in Manchester, on 22 April 1897. It was performed by the Carl Rosa Opera Company in English and was supervised by Puccini. On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera's first staging at the Royal Opera House in London.\n\nThe opera was first performed in the United States by the Carl Rosa Opera Company on October 14, 1897 in Los Angeles, California. It was performed in New York City at Palmo's Opera House on May 16, 1898. The Metropolitan Opera House staged the opera for the first time on December 26, 1900.\n\n\"In the four bohemians' attic room\"\n\nAct 1 takes place in Paris around 1830. A group of bohemians live in a room in an attic. Marcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window. They are so poor and so cold that they burn a drama that Rodolfo has written. Colline, the philosopher, comes in shivering and cross because he had not been able to pawn some books. Schaunard, the musician of the group, arrives with food, firewood, wine, cigars, and money. He tells his friends that he has got these things because he has a job with an English gentleman. The others hardly listen as they are so hungry that they try quickly to eat the food. Schaunard interrupts them, taking the meal away, and saying that they will all celebrate his luck by having dinner at Cafe Momus instead.\n\nWhile they drink, Benoit, the landlord, arrives to collect the rent. They give him lots of wine so that he becomes drunk and starts to tell the people his adventures about love. He then says that he is married, but the others throw him out of the room. The money that should have been used for paying the rent is divided among the group so that they can have a good time\n\nThe other Bohemians go out, but Rodolfo stays alone for a moment in order to finish a newspaper article, promising to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door, and Mimì, a seamstress who lives in a flat below, enters. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She thanks him, but returns a few seconds later, saying she has lost her key. Both candles go out. It is dark, and the couple try to feel their way about. Rodolfo wants to spend time with Mimi. He finds the key, but does not tell her and puts it in his pocket. In two very famous arias (Rodolfo's \"Che gelida manina — What a cold little hand\" and Mimi's \"Sì, mi chiamano Mimì — Yes, they call me Mimì\"), they tell each other about their different backgrounds. Rodolfo’s friends call for him to come. He would prefer to stay there with Mimì but she decides they should both go together. They go out singing about their love for one another.\n\n\"Latin Quarter on Christmas Eve\"\n\nThe streets are crowded with happy people. Rodolfo buys Mimi a bonnet. The friends go into a café. Musetta, who used to be Marcello's sweetheart, comes into the cafe with Alcindoro, a rich, old man. She is tired of him. She sings a naughty song, hoping Marcello will notice her.\n\nMarcello becomes mad with jealousy. To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to have a tight shoe and sends him with it to the shoemaker. Musetta and Marcello fall into each other's arms.\n\nThe sound of a military parade is heard. Marcello and Colline carry Musetta out on their shoulders while everyone claps. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe. The waiter hands him the bill. He is surprised by how much he has to pay, and sinks into a chair.\n\n\"At a toll gate a month or two later\"\n\nMimì passes through the toll gate. She is coughing. She finds Marcello, who lives in a little tavern near the gate. She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who has left her that night.\n\nRodolfo comes out of the tavern looking for Marcello. Mimì hides. She hears Rodolfo telling Marcello why he left her. At first he says Mimì does not love him, but then he says he left her because she is dying of an illness.\n\nRodolfo is poor and can do little to help Mimì. He hopes that a rich man may fall in love with her and pay for her to have medical treatment. Out of kindness towards Mimì, Marcello tries to stop Rodolfo, but she has already heard everything.\n\nShe has to cough, and Rodolfo discovers her. They sing of their lost love, and agree that they should separate. They love one another so much and agree to stay together until the spring. Marcello and Musetta are heard quarreling in the background.\n\n\"The attic room\"\n\nMarcello and Rodolfo are both sad at losing their loved ones. Schaunard and Colline arrive with a tiny bit of food. They pretend they are having a big feast, and they all dance. Musetta arrives with news: Mimi, who had found a rich gentleman, has now left him and is wandering in the streets feeling very ill and weak.\n\nMusetta has brought Mimi back with her to the attic room. Mimi is helped into a chair. Musetta and Marcello leave to sell Musetta's earrings in order to buy medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his overcoat. Schaunard leaves quietly to give Mimi and Rodolfo time together. Left alone, the two remember their past happiness.\n\nThey remember their first meeting. Rodolfo gives Mimi the pink bonnet he bought her, which he has kept as a souvenir of their love. The others return, with a gift of a muff to warm Mimi's hands and some medicine, and tell Rodolfo that a doctor has been called, but it is too late. As Musetta prays, Mimi dies. Rodolfo collapses in tears.\n\n\"La bohème\" is scored for the standard orchestra of the period:\n\nIn 1965, a West German movie version of the opera was released. It was filmed on location in Milan and Munich. The movie was produced by conductor Herbert von Karajan and designed by Franco Zefferelli. It starred Mirella Freni as Mimi, Adriana Martino as Musetta, Gianni Raimondi as Rudolpho, and Rolando Panerai as Marcello. The movie won the 1966 National Board of Review for Top Foreign Film.\n\n", "id": "91105", "title": "La bohème"}

The air for this system came from a pump operated by the players feet, and in some later models, an electric pump. Inside the piano are paper rolls which have holes punched in. These holes release air which in turn triggers the keys to play. When the pianola plays itself the keys of the piano can be seen \"playing themselves\".\n\nThe pianola was developed around the 1880s. It was fitted with control levers so that the player (\"player pianist\" or \"pianolist\") could play in the way he wanted. The pianola made it possible for the player to sound as if he was playing very difficult music that he was not capable of playing. At the same time he could control the performance.\n\nThe pianola became popular in the late 19th and early 20th century as mass-produced pianos became popular in people's homes and more and more people bought sheet music.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91216", "text": "Sewing machine\n\nA sewing machine is used to stitch fabric together with thread. Sewing machines were an invention of the industrial revolution that made it possible to sew faster than people could sew by hand. Some sewing machines are also used for embroidery. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry.\n\nHome sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type. In a modern sewing machine the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles and thimbles and other such tools used in hand sewing, automating the process of stitching and saving time.\n\nIndustrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task.\n\nCharles Fredrick Wiesenthal, a German-born engineer working in England was awarded the first British patent for a mechanical device to aid the art of sewing, in 1755. His invention consisted of a double pointed needle with an eye at one end.\n\nIn 1790, the English inventor Thomas Saint invented the first sewing machine design, but he did not successfully advertise or market his invention. His machine was meant to be used on leather and canvas material. It is likely that Saint had a working model but there is no evidence of one; he was a skilled cabinet maker and his device included many practically functional features: an overhanging arm, a feed mechanism (adequate for short lengths of leather), a vertical needle bar, and a looper.\n\nHis sewing machine used the chain stitch method, in which the machine uses a single thread to make simple stitches in the fabric. A stitching awl would pierce the material and a forked point rod would carry the thread through the hole where it would be hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch. Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the London Science Museum.\n\nIn 1804, a sewing machine was built by the Englishmen Thomas Stone and James Henderson, and a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan in Scotland. An Austrian tailor, Josef Madersperger, began developing his first sewing machine in 1807. He presented his first working machine in 1814.\n\nThe first practical and widely used sewing machine was invented by Barthélemy Thimonnier, a French tailor, in 1829. His machine sewed straight seams using chain stitch like Saint's model, and in 1830, he signed a contract with Auguste Ferrand, a mining engineer, who made the requisite drawings and submitted a patent application. The patent for his machine was issued on 17 July 1830, and in the same year, he opened (with partners) the first machine-based clothing manufacturing company in the world to create army uniforms for the French Army. However, the factory was burned down, reportedly by workers fearful of losing their livelihood following the issuing of the patent.\n\nA model of the machine is exhibited at the London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American lockstitch sewing machine was invented by Walter Hunt in 1832. His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854. In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle and the use of two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.\n\nThe first machine to combine all the disparate elements of the previous half-century of innovation into the modern sewing machine was the device built by English inventor John Fisher in 1844, thus a little earlier than the very similar machines built by the infamous Isaac Merritt Singer in 1851, and the lesser known Elias Howe, in 1845. However, due to the botched filing of Fisher's patent at the Patent Office, he did not receive due recognition for the modern sewing machine in the legal disputations of priority with Singer, and it was Singer who won the benefits of the patent.\n\nElias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically. An important improvement on his machine was to have the needle running away from the point, starting from the eye. After a lengthy stay in England trying to attract interest in his machine, he returned to America to find various people infringing his patent, among them Isaac Merritt Singer. He eventually won a case for patent infringement in 1854, and was awarded the right to claim royalties from the manufacturers using ideas covered by his patent, including Singer.\n\nSinger had seen a rotary sewing machine being repaired in a Boston shop. As an engineer, he thought it was clumsy and decided to design a better one. The machine he devised used a falling shuttle instead of a rotary one; the needle was mounted vertically and included a presser foot to hold the cloth in place. It had a fixed arm to hold the needle and included a basic tension system. This machine combined elements of Thimonnier, Hunt and Howe's machines. Singer was granted an American patent in 1851, and it was suggested he patent the foot pedal or treadle, used to power some of his machines; unfortunately, the foot pedal had been in use too long for a patent to be issued. When Howe learned of Singer's machine he took him to court, where Howe won and Singer was forced to pay a lump sum for all machines already produced. Singer then took out a license under Howe's patent and paid him $1.15 per machine before entering into a joint partnership with a lawyer named Edward Clark. They created the first hire-purchase arrangement to allow people to buy their machines through payments over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Allen B. Wilson developed a shuttle that reciprocated in a short arc, which was an improvement over Singer and Howe's. However, John Bradshaw had patented a similar device and threatened to sue, so Wilson decided to try a new method. He went into partnership with Nathaniel Wheeler to produce a machine with a rotary hook instead of a shuttle. This was far quieter and smoother than other methods, with the result that the Wheeler & Wilson Company produced more machines in the 1850s and 1860s than any other manufacturer. Wilson also invented the four-motion feed mechanism that is still seen on every sewing machine today. This had a forward, down, back and up motion, which drew the cloth through in an even and smooth motion. Charles Miller patented the first machine to stitch buttonholes. Throughout the 1850s more and more companies were being formed, each trying to sue the others for patent infringement. This triggered a patent thicket known as the Sewing Machine War.\n\nIn 1856, the Sewing Machine Combination was formed, consisting of Singer, Howe, Wheeler, Wilson, Grover and Baker. These four companies pooled their patents, with the result that all other manufacturers had to obtain a license and pay $15 per machine. This lasted until 1877, when the last patent expired. James Edward Allen Gibbs (1829–1902), a farmer from Raphine in Rockbridge County, Virginia patented the first chain stitch single-thread sewing machine on June 2, 1857. In partnership with James Willcox, Gibbs became a principal partner in Willcox & Gibbs Sewing Machine Company.\n\nWillcox & Gibbs commercial sewing machines are still used in the 21st century.\n\nElias Howe, born in Spencer, Massachusetts, created his sewing machine in 1845, using a similar method to Fisher's except that the fabric was held vertically.

In the 1860s consumers began purchasing them, and the machines—ranging in price from £6 to £15 in Britain depending on features—became very common in middle-class homes. Owners were much more likely to spend free time with their machines to make and mend clothing for their families than to visit friends, and women's magazines and household guides such as \"Mrs Beeton's\" offered dress patterns and instructions. A sewing machine could produce a man's shirt in about one hour, compared to 14 1/2 hours by hand.\n\nIn 1877 the world's first crochet machine was invented and patented by Joseph M. Merrow, then-president of what had started in the 1840s as a machine shop to develop specialized machinery for the knitting operations. This crochet machine was the first production overlock sewing machine. The Merrow Machine Company went on to become one of the largest American Manufacturers of overlock sewing machines, and continues to be a global presence in the 21st century as the last American over-lock sewing machine manufacturer.\n\nIn 1885 Singer patented the Singer Vibrating Shuttle sewing machine, which used Allen B. Wilson's idea for a vibrating shuttle and was a better lockstitcher than the oscillating shuttles of the time. Millions of the machines, perhaps the world's first really practical sewing machine for domestic use, were produced until finally superseded by rotary shuttle machines in the 20th century. Sewing machines continued being made to roughly the same design, with more lavish decoration appearing until well into the 1900s.\n\nThe first electric machines were developed by Singer Sewing Co. and introduced in 1889. By the end of the First World War, Singer was offering hand, treadle and electric machines for sale. At first the electric machines were standard machines with a motor strapped on the side, but as more homes gained power, they became more popular and the motor was gradually introduced into the casing.\n\nThere are four main types of sewing machines:\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewing_machine\n", "id": "91216", "title": "Sewing machine"}

It lasted 116 years from 1337 to 1453. The war started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without a son. Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother. \n\nThe French did not want a foreign king, so Philip VI of France said he ought to be king because by the Salic law women could not rule or transmit the right to rule to their sons. The two countries went to war because of this disagreement.\n\nAt the beginning of the war France was the stronger of the two countries. France had about 17 million people while England had only about 4 million people. France had an alliance with Scotland against England, and England tried to ally with parts of the Low Countries. The English won a great victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1340 which prevented France from invading England. After that the war was fought almost totally in France. England won again at the Battle of Crécy in 1346: the English longbow was part of the reason for the victory.\n\nFrom 1348 to 1356 there was very little fighting because of the Black Death. Then Edward, the Black Prince won the Battle of Poitiers for England. King John II of France was captured during the battle. The English invaded France again but were not able to take any more cities. A truce gave England about one quarter of France.\n\nThe new king Charles V of France was more successful, with Bertrand du Guesclin as his best knight. The Black Prince was busy at another war in Spain, and Edward III was too old to lead an army again. So France allied with Castile against England and Portugal. France won back many French towns from the English during this time. A peace followed from 1389-1415.\n\nThe most famous part of the war began in 1415. Henry the V of England invaded France and won the Battle of Agincourt with many bowmen. King Charles VI of France was insane and unable to rule, and nearly all his sons died young. The queen of France, Isabeau of Bavaria, married one of her daughters to Henry the V and signed the Treaty of Troyes to make Henry V the next king of France. Both Henry V and Charles VI died at almost the same time. So the English believed Henry VI of England was the new king of France and many French people agreed. Charles VI's last son Charles VII of France said he ought to be the new king, but many people said he did not deserve to be king because somebody else had probably been his father.\n\nThe English continued to capture land in France until Joan of Arc led the army to success at the Siege of Orleans and the Battle of Patay in 1429. She regained many cities and brought Charles VII to his coronation, but she did not recover Paris. Her enemies captured and killed her. After her death, the French continued to take back territory, although more slowly. France had a diplomatic win in 1435 with the Treaty of Arras. The war ended in 1453.\n\n\n", "id": "91219", "title": "Hundred Years' War"}

About 30 species invade human homes. This is less than 1% of all the cockroach species. Four species are pests. \n\nThe families of Mantodea, Isoptera, and Blattaria are usually combined by entomologists into a larger group called Dictyoptera. Current evidence strongly suggests that termites have evolved directly from true cockroaches, and many authors now consider termites to be in the family of cockroaches.\n\nHistorically, the name Blattaria has been used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea. Blattodea refers to a larger group that includes fossil groups related to roaches, but not true cockroaches themselves. These earliest cockroach-like fossils (\"Blattopterans\" or \"roachids\") are from the Carboniferous period between 354–295 million years ago. However, these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantis as well as modern cockroaches. The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the Lower Cretaceous.\nA proposed phylogeny of the families is shown in the diagram.\n\nCockroaches in the broader sense (Blattodea) have existed a very long time. The earliest cockroach fossils are 354–295 million years old. Science student, Cary Easterday, found a giant 300 million year old fossil cockroach long, in a coal mine in Ohio.\n\nMost cockroaches are omnivores. They are tough, and hard to kill. A cockroach can live for two weeks without a head.\n\nCockroaches become adults in 3-4 months and can live up to one year. A female German cockroach can produce 8 egg cases in her lifetime and each egg case may contain 30-40 eggs.\n", "id": "91223", "title": "Cockroach"}

Several organizations have stated that difficulties currently experienced by the Armenian minority in Turkey are a result of an anti-Armenian attitude by the Turkish government as well as by ultra-nationalist groups such as the Grey Wolves.\n\nModern anti-Armenianism often seems to lacks a racial and cultural basis and appears to be based more on geopolitics and history, in addition to diplomatic and strategic interests, involving the modern states of Turkey and Azerbaijan. The controversy and emotions surrounding the Armenian Genocide and Nagorno-Karabakh are two examples of intense anti-Armenianism in both countries. Modern Anti-Armenianism is usually associated with either extreme opposition to the actions or existence of the Armenian Republic, and belief in an Armenian conspiracy.\n\nFor several months in 1994, Ahmet Coşar going by the alias of Serdar Argic posted thousands of messages, claiming that the Armenian Genocide did not happen or that Armenians massacred Turks, on Usenet newsgroup threads mentioning the word Turkey. Samuel Weems published the book \"Armenia: The Secrets of a \"Christian\" Terrorist State\" where he has made such claims as the \"number one export of Armenia is terrorism\" and that there was no Armenian Genocide. American historian Justin McCarthy is known for his controversial support of Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide. Azeri cartoonist \"Kerim Kerimov Mammadhan\" has produced around 4500 Anti-Armenian cartoons, most of which depict crude caricatures of Armenians. His cartoons are often included with the phrase “Terrorism, narkomania, and armenism are the same disease”. His works also often mocks the Armenian Genocide and its recognition by foreign countries, especially countries in Europe. Murad Gumen is another individual who espouses anti-Armenian rhetoric in his website \"Tall Armenian Tale\". Barbaros Agri uses the social networking site Facebook to advocate anti-Armenianism by being the creator of \"The Biggest Lie Ever Told: The Armenian Genocide\".

Jews and Armenians living in the city and their businesses were also targeted in the pogrom, which was, according to some circles, orchestrated by the Turkish government.\n\nA Turkish mob, most of which was trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul’s Greek community for nine hours. Although the leaders of the pogrom did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, between 13 and 16 Greeks (including two Orthodox clerics) and at least one Armenian died during or after the pogrom as a result of beatings and arson.\n\nThirty-two Greeks were severely wounded.

She is played by Hannah Murray.\n\nCassie is a very complicated character. She suffers from anorexia nervosa, self harm, and low self esteem. Her entire self worth is dependent on her weight, in one episode saying \"I didn't eat for three days... so I could be lovely.\" She also drinks alcohol and takes drugs. In the episode \"Tony\" she is seen sorting food, a common occurrence shown by people with anorexia. Despite Cassie's many \"problems\", she is a very gentle, caring, and loving person. Written on her \"about me\" section of the \"Skins\" website, she talks about how much she loves her baby brother, Reuben. Cassie will even act positive to bad news so that she will not offend.\n\nCassie is released from a clinic, where she received treatment for her eating disorder. In the first episode, called \"Tony\", she stays with Sid and offers to have sex so he can lose his virginity, but she passes out before anything happens. In the second episode \"Cassie\", it is shown that she is not better and is still sick. She has also developed a crush on Sid. In \"Sid\", the fifth episode of the season, Cassie tries to kill herself after Sid cancels a date they planned, so that he could be with Michelle Richardson. In \"Michelle\", Michelle takes Sid to see Cassie, but Cassie is dating someone called Simon, a patient in the hospital she is currently in. In the last episode of the season, Cassie says she is moving to Scotland with her family, away from Bristol. Cassie writes Sid a letter and leaves it at his house after sneaking out the hospital. She is also given a letter Sid wrote to her from Tony Stonem. In the last moment of the season, Sid finds Cassie and they sit together and hold hands.\n\nCassie and Sid are in a serious romantic long distance relationship. In \"Sid\", the third episode, Sid thinks Cassie is cheating on him and becomes angry at her. Cassie is also angry, but because Sid does not trust her. At the end of the episode Cassie takes a train from where she lives in Scotland to Bristol, to visit Sid. She waits in his bedroom for him, but when Sid enters the bedroom he is kissing Michelle (not noticing that Cassie is also there). In \"Chris\", the fifth episode, Cassie bitterly tells her friends that Sid is together with Michelle. She copes with her feelings by having sex with almost anyone, doing drugs, and partying. In \"Effy\" Sid finally confronts Cassie and her bad behavior. The two get back together, but in \"Cassie\", it is clear that Cassie is still angry towards Michelle. After Cassie's roommate and friend Chris Miles dies, she runs away to New York City, where she is taken care of by a boy called Adam.

The name was given to Stevens by the person who founded Subud, a spiritual community. Stevens said in an interview, \"It sounds like Devendra Banhart kind of grew up in this strange kind of cultish environment, and I don't mean that word in a demeaning way. I think we probably come from similar backgrounds. There's a little bit of that in my history.\"\n\nStevens is a multi-instrumentalist, a person who can play many musical instruments. He is well known for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums by using multitrack recording. When he was in school, he learned the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums. He is one of the few musicians in pop music to use these instruments. A lot of instruments are played in unison to give his songs a \"symphony-like\" sound. Strings and horns are used very often in many of his songs.\n\nStevens lives in the Brooklyn part of New York City in the neighborhood Kensington where he makes up the Asthmatic Kitty Records staff of the Brooklyn office.

While on tour for about two years, they had no new songs to perform. In January 2007 the band went into \"hibernation\" in a cabin (just outside the strip), as they began writing new songs for the next six months hoping for a second album to be released during fall 2007.

Later that night however, the band decided that they did not like the music had written and scrapped all the songs they had written (which was about 3/4 of an album, as they were almost done recording).\n\nA month later Panic announced two newly written songs, the first named \"Middle of Summer\" (later changed to \"When the Day Met the Night\"), and \"Nine in the Afternoon\". In December, a part of \"Nine in the Afternoon\" was played on an episode of the television show \"Heroes\". Panic then began viral marketing, building puzzles on their official website. For about two weeks the puzzle gave snippets from an unknown song, along with the caption \"YOU DONT HAVE TO WORRY...\". On January 1, 2008, the snippets finally were revealed to be part of a new song entitled \"We're So Starving\". A rough version of this song was then released for listening on their official MySpace page, but was later pulled with the release of \"Nine in the Afternoon\".

For example, Chick-fil-A billboards have cows trying to get people to eat chicken.\n\nPainted billboards are made usually by hand. They are painted onto large pieces of paper, which are then attached to large panels. The panels are then installed using cranes.\n\nDigital billboards use large screens to show the advertisement. Some digital billboards can change their message every so often, so several advertisements show up on the same billboard.\n\nSome of the earliest billboards were made in the 1880s.

It is the dominant form of Islam in only one Muslim country, Oman. There are also Ibadis in Algeria as well as Libya. It is probably one of the earliest schools, founded less than 50 years after the death of the prophet Muhammad. The branch developed out of the seventh-century Islamic sect known as the Khawarij or Kharijites. Some Ibadis however do not consider themselves to be Kharijite. Some Ibadi doctrines permit an individual interpretation of hadiths, by stressing the use of common sense.\n\nThe name is from ˤAbdullāh ibn-Ibāḍ at-Tamīmī. Some followers of this branch, however, claim its true founder was Jabir ibn Zaid al-'Azdi from Nizwa, Oman.\n\nIbāḍī communities are generally seen as conservative. Ibāḍiyyah rejects the practice of \"qunūt\" or supplications while standing in prayer. Sunni Muslims traditionally think the Ibāḍiyyah are a Kharijite group. Modern-day Ibāḍīs think other Muslims are not \"kuffar\" \"unbelievers\" (as most Kharijite groups did), but as \"kuffar an-niˤma\" \"those who deny God's grace\". Today, this attitude has changed a lot. They believe that the attitude of a true believer to others is expressed in three religious obligations:\n\nUnlike the Kharijites, Ibāḍī have abandoned the practice of assassination of mainstream Muslims.\n\nIbāḍīs agree with Sunnis in approving of Abū Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab, whom they regard as the two rightly-guided Caliphs. They think Uthman ibn Affan has introduced \"bidˤa\" \"innovations\" into Islām. They approve of the revolt which overthrew him. They also approve of the first part of ˤAlī's caliphate, and, like Shi'as, disapprove of ˤĀ'isha's rebellion against him and also disapprove of Muˤāwiyya's revolt. However, they regard ˤAlī's acceptance of arbitration at the Battle of Siffin against Muˤāwiyya's rebels as un-Islamic and as rendering him unfit for the Imamate, and they condemn ˤAlī for killing the early Kharijites of \"an-Nahr\" in the Battle of Nahrawan.\n\nIbadis also have several doctrinal differences with orthodox Islam, chief among them:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn their belief, the fifth legitimate Caliph was Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi. All Caliphs from Muˤāwiyya onwards are regarded as tyrants except Umar ibn Abdul Aziz, on whom opinions differ. However, various later Ibāḍī leaders are recognized as true imāms, including Abdullah ibn Yahya al-Kindi of South Arabia and the imāms of the Rustamid dynasty in North Africa.\n\nIbāḍī Muslims are also found in Jabal Nafusa in Libya, Mzab in Algeria, East Africa (particularly Zanzibar) and Djerba Island in Tunisia. The early medieval Rustamid dynasty in Algeria was Ibāḍī, and refugees from its capital Tahert founded the North African Ibāḍī communities which exist today.\n\n", "id": "91564", "title": "Ibadi"}

Hitler thought about this, and then joined near the end of September 1919. There were no membership numbers or cards when Hitler joined the party. In January 1920 the DAP began to give membership cards and numbers. They started at number 500 to make the party look bigger. Hitler got number 555, but he was also committee member number 7. Later Hitler said he was party member number 7, to make it look like he was a founder member of the DAP.\n\nThe small number of party members were quick to believe in Hitler's ideas.\n\nTo try to make the party more popular the DAP changed its name on 24 February 1920 to the National Socialist German Workers' Party. The name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time (Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Arbeiterpartei).

It is generally the preferred form of tea in the West.\n\nUnblended black teas are named after the region in which they are produced.\n\nOne of the most famous countries producing black tea, exporting more than 12% of the world's tea. Darjeeling, Assam, and Nilgiri are known as representative producing areas.\n\n\n\n\nSri Lanka is next to India in the total production of black tea. The generic name for black tea which grown in Sri Lanka is Ceylon tea. \n\n\nTea produced in China has characteristic that the taste is not so bitter. Straight tea is popular than tea with milk or sugar in China.\n\n\nBlack tea is often blended with other black tea or various other plants.\n\n\nBlack tea without milk or sugar contains no calories. Black tea also contains tannin and the caffeine. There is a connection between blood-cholesterol-lowering (BCL) and drinking black tea. According to a 2001 Boston University study, there is a relationship between a more drinking black tea and a decrease in a kind of cardiovascular disease. \n", "id": "91610", "title": "Black tea"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91777", "text": "New York City Subway\n\nThe New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that is in New York City, United States. It is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It is one of the biggest rapid transit systems in the world, with 468 stations. It has 229 miles (or 369 km) of routes on 656 miles (or 1056 km) of track. The New York City Subway almost never closes; the trains run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year. The system has only closed three times.\n\nThe first elevated trains started working on October 9, 1863, and the first underground trains started working on October 27, 1904.\n\nAlfred Ely Beach built an underground subway tunnel to test in 1869. His Beach Pneumatic Transit only extended under Broadway in Lower Manhattan. The subway car in the tunnel was pneumatic, or pushed by air. The tunnel was never made longer. It could have gone to Battery Park to the south and the Harlem River to the north.\n\nThe first underground subway line opened on October 27, 1904. The oldest elevated train line in the subway system opened in 1885. The oldest right-of-way was a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road. That railroad opened in 1863.\n\nBy the time the first subway opened, there were two private subway companies. They were the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Corporation (BRT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Most subway lines built after 1913 were built by the New York City government. These tracks were leased to the companies. The first line of the city-owned and city-run Independent Subway System (IND) opened in 1932.\n\nIn 1940, the two private systems were bought by the city. Some elevated train lines closed and were destroyed. The New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was made in 1953 to run subway, bus, and streetcar operations. It was made part of Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968.\n\nBy the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was really bad to ride. There were very few people riding the subway. There was a lot of graffiti and crime on the subway. This was fixed in the 1990s.\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, there were train disruptions on lines running through Lower Manhattan. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy flooded the subway system. It closed many lines for a long time.\n\nThere are subway stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. About 40% of the tracks are above ground and the other 60% are below ground. Every day about 5,076,000 people take rides on the subway. 463 out of the system's 468 stations are always open.\n\nMany stations have \"mezzanines\". These are the levels of the station where you pay a fare before entering the subway platforms. Everyone must pay a fare to enter the subway system. They are usually between street level and platform level.\n\nMany station entrances and exits have lamp posts. At the top of the lamp posts are colored balls. Green balls usually show the station is open all day. Red balls can show two things. An entrance lamp post with a red ball can show that you can only enter during the daytime. There are also red exit lamp posts, which show that you can only exit the station. Some of the balls do not show the right information about an entrance or exit.\n\nMost subway stations have waiting platforms that are from long. People wait for trains on these platforms.\n\nAll new stations have platforms with air conditioning.\nMany stations also have artwork on the subway station walls.\n\nMost of the stations wers built before 1990. That is when a new law said that many new buildings, like subway stations, should have elevators and ramps so people with wheelchairs can enter these buildings.\n\nThe MTA has run the \"Music Under New York\" (MUNY) program in the subway since 1987. People must compete in order to be allowed to play music in a station. There are now more than 100 musicians and performers in the subway system.\n\nThere are only 129 open restrooms in 77 of the system's stations.\n\nSome platforms have newspaper stands as well. They sell many things, including newspapers and food. There are also stores in some stations.\n\nIn other cities' subway systems, a train \"line\" is the same as a train \"route\". In New York City's subway system, however, the \"line\" is the actual tracks, which a train \"route\" uses. \"Routes\", also called \"services\", have a letter or a number, such as \"1\" or \"A\". \"Lines\" have names, like \"Broadway Line\".\n\nThere are 24 train services. This includes 3 short \"shuttle\" routes. Each route has a color. R. Raleigh D'Adamo, a lawyer who entered a contest in 1964, planned the colors that are used on subway maps now. Before, subway maps used different colors for every route. People who live in New York City do not call lines and services by color (such as, Blue Line or Green Line). However, tourists often use colors to tell between routes.\n\nThere are three different types of subway services. \"Local\" trains make all stops at \"local\" stations as well as at \"express\" stations. \"Express\" trains skip some stations, but stop at \"express\" stations. There is one \"skip-stop\" service, the J/Z, where two train routes run on the same line; each route only stops at every other station along the line.\n\nThe subway system runs 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, but some routes do not run when not many people ride the subway. When a line is closed, the transit authority uses free shuttle buses. The transit authority shows planned service changes on its website, on station walls, inside subway cars, and through its Twitter page.\n\nThere are many routes on the subway. Many people who have never ridden on the Subway get confused because there are so many routes going to so many different places. The Subway has signs that hang from the stations' ceilings to show the routes and where they go.\nFrom 1904 until 1948, people paid a nickel to go into the subway. On July 1, 1948, the fare was raised to a dime. In July 1953, the fare was raised to 15 cents. The MTA gave out subway tokens, which people used to enter the subway. People stopped using tokens in 2003.\n\nThe fare is $2.75. Riders must pay with MetroCards. The subway started using them in 1994. At subway stations, riders can buy MetroCards from the station booth or from vending machines. Riders can also buy MetroCards from many places in New York City, like convenience stores and newspaper sellers.\n\nRiders are allowed to take pictures using cameras, but are not allowed to take pictures with cameras that flash or with cameras that are on tripods.\n\nSubway police can search riders to make sure they do not have weapons or other items that could be used to hurt other people.\n\nWhen riders get hurt, usually it is because they slip when they are getting on or off the train. This is because there is a gap between the train and the platform. In recent times, workers have made the gaps smaller to prevent people from slipping. Often messages are played from loudspeakers that say \"Please watch the gap when entering and exiting the train\".\n\nThe MTA makes sure that New York City Subway trains run without accidents. There are railroad switches, railroad signals, and speed limits on the subway. All tracks also have a stopper on the side. If the train passes a red signal, the stopper will stop the train.\n\nA black-and-white striped board hangs above the middle of each platform. The conductor has to point to the board in front of him or her. After the conductor points to the board, the train doors will open.\n\nThe subway has had over 56 train accidents since 1918. The Malbone Street Wreck on November 1, 1918 was the most deadly. That crash killed 93 people.\n\nSince the late 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA has been trying to make trains run by themselves. New York City Subway trains normally run with a train conductor and a train engineer. In 2006, the L train was the first route to be run by computers. The 7 train is becoming the second route to be run by a computer. There are computers both on the train and along the side of the tracks. The computer does the engineer's job by driving and stopping the train.\n", "id": "91777", "title": "New York City Subway"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=91778", "text": "Fundamentalism\n\nFundamentalism was used at first to describe some people in the Protestant community in the United States in the early 20th century. These people had a set of well-defined (\"fundamental\") values. These values were in opposition to more modern ideas. The group also said it was important to stick to what faith (the Bible) told them. When people look at religion this way they see the ideas in the religion as \"absolute\". This means that it is not possible for them to change. When religion is seen as absolute it becomes fundamentalism.\n\nToday, the term is used more generally. It is now often used to describe groups of people who will stick to their (mostly moral, and religious) values even though these values may be criticised by many people. These values may also be unpopular. Modern-day fundamentalists want to go back to the roots of certain ideological or religious positions.\n\nReligious fundamentalism has been prevalent in society since its beginnings in the late 19th- and early 20th-century. People today who study fundamentalism see it as a response to modern society. Today society is not as simple as it was: many people live in societies that can be difficult to understand. Changes in familiar things can make people feel unsafe. So some people look in their religion to see something that does not change. They also want rules about how to act that do not change. So they see their religion as this thing that does not change.\n\nSome people who are called religious fundamentalists do not like that name, as the term has other meanings. They do not like it because 'religious fundamentalist' has some negative ideas about it. Many people who are politically \"progressive\" or \"liberal\" sometimes do not like religious fundamentalists. They believe bad things about them like that they are not clever, they are not educated, or that they do not respect people's human rights. \n\nSome people who are Christian fundamentalists \"do\" like that term and use it to name themselves. But they do not like being called religious fundamentalists because Islamic fundamentalists are in this same group.\n\nFundamentalism began as a movement in the U.S., starting among conservative Presbyterian academics and theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the first decade of the Twentieth Century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations during and immediately following the First World War. The movement's purpose was to \"reaffirm\" orthodox Protestant Christianity and zealously defend it against the challenges of liberal theology, German higher criticism, Darwinism, and other movements which it regarded as harmful to Christianity.\n\nThe term \"\"fundamentalism\"\" has its roots in the Niagara Bible Conference (1878–1897) which defined those things that were \"fundamental\" to Christian belief. The term was also used to describe \"\"The Fundamentals\"\", a collection of twelve books on five subjects published in 1910 and funded by Milton and Lyman Stewart\n\nNot all religious fundamentalists believe the same things. But there are many issues that they have strong beliefs about. Some of these issues are similar even in different religions. Some of these issues are:\n\nMany criticisms of fundamentalist positions have been offered. One of the most common is that some claims made by a fundamentalist group cannot be proven, and are irrational, demonstrably false, or contrary to scientific evidence. For example, some of these criticisms were famously asserted by Clarence Darrow in the Scopes Monkey Trial.\n\nOne of the critics, Elliot N. Dorff wrote:\nIn order to carry out the fundamentalist program in practice, one would need a perfect understanding of the ancient language of the original text, if indeed the true text can be (found...) among variants. Furthermore, human beings are the ones who transmit this understanding between generations. Even if one wanted to follow the literal word of God, the need for people first to understand that word (requires) human interpretation. Through that process human fallibility is inextricably mixed into the very meaning of the divine word. As a result, it is impossible to follow the indisputable word of God; one can only achieve a human understanding of God's will.\n", "id": "91778", "title": "Fundamentalism"}

It started on June 13, 2006 with a weekly television series. The ECW brand was one of WWE's three brands, the other two being RAW and SmackDown.\n\nWWE got Extreme Championship Wrestling and its video library in 2003 and later began reintroducing ECW through a series of DVDs and books. The big popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize ECW One Night Stand, an ECW reunion pay-per-view in 2005. The financial and critical success of the event encourages WWE to start a second One Night Stand the next year. With rejuvenated interest in the ECW product, WWE began exploring the possibility of reviving the promotion full time. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone brand, congruous to Raw and SmackDown!, with its own show on the Sci Fi Channel. Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by the Sci Fi Channel's demographic, network President Bonnie Hammer said that she believed ECW would fit the channel's theme of \"stretching the imagination\". Sci Fi Channel is owned by NBC Universal, parent company of USA Network and exclusive cable broadcaster of WWE programming.\n\nThe ECW brand initially tried to differentiate itself from WWE's other brands. The hard cameras were placed in a different location and the ring mat had an ECW logo on it. The male performers were also referred to as \"Extremists\" as opposed to Superstars, and female performers were called \"Vixens\" instead of Divas. It also had the first ECW talent. Later however, changes were made to differentiate it from the original ECW promotion, including changing the original promotion's rules where weapons were legal in all matches and there were rarely any count outs or disqualifications. WWE now classifies such matches as having \"Extreme Rules\", and are only fought when specified. The only pay-per-view event hosted exclusively by the ECW brand since its launch was December to Dismember in December 2006. On March 14 2007, before another one could be scheduled, WWE announced that all future pay-per-views would feature all three brands. \n\nFormer ECW owner Paul Heyman served as the on air \"ECW Representative\". According to an interview in the UK newspaper The Sun, Heyman wrote the brand's weekly scripts and gave them to writers for possible changes, and then Vince McMahon for final approval. After the December to Dismember 2006 Heyman was relieved from both his on and off air duties with World Wrestling Entertainment. After Heyman left, there was no ECW authority figure until August 14 2007, when Armando Estrada was announced as the General Manager.\n\nECW's weekly series was first given a thirteen episode run as a \"summer series\" on the Sci Fi Channel. The first episode got a 2.79 rating, making it the highest rated show on cable in its time slot. Because of its good ratings it was given an extended run through the end of 2007. On October 23 2007, the network renewed the series through 2008.\n\nWhile the show started out a ratings success, it began drawing criticism from fans of the original ECW early on. This was most evident by the negative crowd reaction \"old school\" fans gave the main event of Batista vs. the Big Show at the August 1 2006 show from Hammerstein Ballroom.\n\nOn October 16 2007 a \"talent exchange\" was started between the SmackDown! and ECW brands, allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand.\n\nAt ECW's launch, WWE.com introduced Hardcore Hangover, a video feature which allowed fans only in the United States to stream or download video footage from the weekly show. On October 16, 2007 it was replaced by a new feature which made full episodes of the show available for streaming on WWE.com the day after they were shown. After making a list of names from fans and conducting an online poll, the feature was named ECW X-Stream on October 31 2007.\n\nECW brand shows are held in big arenas as a part of the SmackDown! brand's Tuesday taping schedule. This is in sharp contrast to the first Extreme Championship Wrestling which ran most of its events in smaller venues. The show usually airs live on Tuesdays directly before — when touring the west coast — or after \"SmackDown!\" has taped, though it has been recorded and placed on a broadcast delay until later in the night depending on what circumstances dictate.\n\nECW's initial theme song was \"Bodies\" by Drowning Pool, which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established. Since then the theme song has changed between a number of different songs before settling on \"\"Don't Question My Heart\"\", sung by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere. A remix of \"\"Don't Question My Heart\"\" by Saliva featuring Brent Smith is now used.\n\nStarting with the January 22 2008 version, \"ECW\" began broadcasting in HD, along with a new HD set, which is shared among all three WWE brands.\n\nECW's initial theme song was \"Bodies\" by Drowning Pool, which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established.

A remix of \"\"Don't Question My Heart\"\" by Saliva featuring Brent Smith was in use when the show ended.\n\nOn February 2, 2010, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that \"ECW\" would be going off the air and would be replaced with a new weekly program in its slot in what McMahon announced as \"the next evolution of WWE; the next evolution of television history.\" It was later announced that the show would air its final episode on February 16, 2010. On the February 4, 2010 episode of \"WWE Superstars\", the new show's name was announced as \"WWE NXT\". The ECW brand is set to be disbanded, with every ECW wrestler becoming a free agent after the show ends.\n\nIn addition to being broadcast on Syfy in the United States, \"ECW\" was broadcast on a number of channels in many different countries.\n", "id": "91870", "title": "ECW (WWE)"}

It is a Trojan, sharing an orbit with Jupiter. It was found in 1907 by August Kopff, and was the second Trojan asteroid to be found. Recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy comets, rather than rocky asteroids.\n\nPatroclus orbits in Jupiter's trailing Lagrangian point, L, in an orbit called the 'Trojan node' after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War (the other node is called the 'Greek node'). Patroclus is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek character; the naming rules for the Trojan asteroids were not made until after Patroclus was named (similarly, the asteroid Hektor is the only Trojan character to appear in the Greek camp).\n\nIn 2001, it was found that Patroclus is a binary object, made up of two asteroids which are almost the same size. In February, 2006, a team of astronomers led by Franck Marchis measured accurately the orbit of the system using the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system. They thought that the two asteroids orbit around their center of mass in 4.283±0.004 d at a distance of 680±20 km, describing a close to circular orbit. Putting together their sightings with thermal measurements taken in November 2000, the team thought what the size of the asteroids of the system could be. The slightly bigger asteroids, which measures 122 km in diameter, continues to have the name Patroclus. The smaller asteroid, measuring 112 km, is now named Menoetius (full name (617) Patroclus I Menoetius), after the legendary Patroclus's father. Its provisional designation was S/2001 (617) 1.\n\nBecause of the density of the asteroids (0.8 g/cm³) is less than water and about one third that of rock, the team of researchers led by F. Marchis suggest that the Patroclus system, previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids, is more similar to a comet in make up. It is thought that many Trojan asteroids are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of Jupiter-Sun system during the farther migration of the giant planets, 3.9 billion years ago. This scenario was suggested by A. Morbidelli and colleagues in a series of articles published in May 2005 in \"Nature\" journal.\n\n\n", "id": "91941", "title": "617 Patroclus"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92041", "text": "Fra Angelico\n\nFra Angelico (c. 1395– February 18, 1455), was an Italian Early Renaissance painter. Giorgio Vasari, who wrote the \"Lives of the Artists\" said he had \"\"a rare and perfect talent\"\".\n\nFra Angelico has been known by many different names. When he was born, he was called Guido di Pietro. People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole (Brother John from Fiesole). When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in \"Lives of the Artists\", in the 1500s, he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico (Brother Giovanni who is like an Angel).\n\nThe Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico (the Blessed Angelico). He has been called this for a long time, because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting, and also because he was such a good and holy man. The name \"Blessed Angelico\" has now been made official, because in 1982 Pope John Paul II \"conferred beatification\" which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint.\n\nVasari says about him: \"\"It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father, who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said, and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith.\"\"\n\nFra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany, Italy probably about 1385–87 and died in Rome in 1455. Nothing is known about his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino.\n\nIn 1407, he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole. In 1423, when he became officially a friar, he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni (Brother John). (People who are accepted into a holy order, usually take a new name.) Like the other \"brothers\" (friars) of the Dominican Order, he wore a white robe and a black cloak, and shaved part of his head. \n\nFra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar. Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts. Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well. The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted. He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived, but he still found time to paint pictures, which very soon became famous. In January and February of 1418, he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte.\n\nBetween 1418 and 1436, Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole, which has been damaged. Age caused the some of the paint to come off, or fade, and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelico's work while trying to repair the paintings. The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery, London. It shows Christ in Glory, surrounded by more than 250 figures, and is a large and magnificent piece of work. It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery.\n\nIn 1436, a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings. Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence. This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn. The convent had a very wealthy \"patron of the arts\" called Cosimo de' Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches. Cosimo took the largest of the friars' rooms, called cells, at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought. Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimo's cell.\n\nCosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent. All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle (called a cloister). On the wall at the top of the stairs, Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This is one of his most famous pictures. Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monk's cells. Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window. At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico, and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting. These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers. \n\nIn 1439, he finished one of his most famous works, which is the altarpiece for San Marco's Church, which is where the friars worship. It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne, surrounded by saints from different dates, who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven, talking about holy things. This type of painting called a \"Sacred Conversation\" later became very popular, but this is one of the first ones.\n\nIn 1445, Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peter's. The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new St.Peter's Basilica and Fra Angelico's work was lost. Vasari says that one of the popes (it might have been Eugenius or Pope Nichoas V) asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence. But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position. In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil, Benozzo Gozzoli, to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there . One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi, but he did not become as famous as Benozzo.\n\nFrom 1447 to 1449, Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately. The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, who were both \"martyrs\" (they were killed because of their Christian faith). The small chapel, with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box. From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior (the head man). Fra Angelico's pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel.\n\nIn 1455, Fra Angelico went back to Rome, probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas' Chapel. He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, making him \"officially\" known as the \"Blessed Angelico\". In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists.\n\nFra Angelico never wanted to be important, and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people. He thought his most important job was caring for others. He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint, and he never made any changes to his pictures later, because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him. He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them.\n\nThe words on his grave say:\n\nFra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto. Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the \"Life of Saint Francis\" that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. In Giotto's paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s. Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling. His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it.\n\nAt the same time, rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth. They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds. The red colour called \"vermilion\" was one of the most expensive. But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi-precious stone called Lapis lazuli. This type of painting is called \"International Gothic\". Some artists of Fra Angelico's day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy. But other painters, like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way.\n\nFra Angelico was able to paint in both ways. If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours, then Fra Angelico could do it. But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours. They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos.\n\nThis gallery shows stories from the life of Jesus. The square paintings are in tempera. They are all parts of a big altarpiece and are about 25 cm wide. The \"tondo\" (round painting) is a small altarpiece about 1.4 metres wide. All the paintings with arched tops are frescos and were painted for the Dominican brothers. \n\n\n", "id": "92041", "title": "Fra Angelico"}

Although some other writers had written about art, this book, which was published in 1550 makes Vasari the first art historian. \n\nVasari was born in 1511 to a rich family in the city of Arezzo in Tuscany. When he was 13 he was sent to Florence to study at the workshops of the well-known artists Andrea del Sarto. Florence is so famous for the arts that students like Vasari have been going there to learn painting and sculpture, ever since Giotto in the 1200s. The two most famous artists in the world, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were both alive when Vasari was a boy and had both studied in Florence. Vasari had the good luck to meet Michelangelo, who was like a great hero to Vasari. \n\nVasari learnt well, and became one of the favourite artists of the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family who ruled Florence at that time. He did all sorts of important jobs for them. One of the most important buildings in the city was the Palazzo Vecchio (the \"Old Palace\") which was really a Medieval fortress, where the town council had always met. Vasari got the job of decorating the walls of the enormous meeting room with painted frescos. \n\nVasari was very good at directing important artistic jobs, but he was not really as good a painter as he was architect. One of his most important architectural jobs was to begin the building of the Uffizi (Offices) in Florence. These are two long buildings that face each other across a long narrow courtyard with one end opening on the town square, and the other end opening onto the Arno River. At the end where the river is, Vasari designed a beautiful \"loggia\" which is a sort of two-storey veranda that joins the two buildings. It makes the narrow courtyard and the view of the river look like a stage set where wonderful things might happen. The Uffizi is now one of the most famous art galleries in the world.\n\nVasari had another important job for the Medici family. Eleanor, the wife of Duke Cosimo I, had bought a house. It was by far the biggest house in the city, and was across the river from the Uffizi. The Medici family was not always popular. The previous duke, Alessandro, had been murdered. So to keep the family safe, they needed an escape route from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river. Vasari was expected to design it. The escape route is named after its designer. It is called the \"Vasari Corridor\". \n\nThe corridor begins at the Palazzo Vecchio and runs along the top floor of the Uffizi and across the loggia near the river, then it runs on top of arches along the street by the riverbank, above a nice covered walkway at street-level where nowadays people can buy souvenirs. The Vasari Corridor then gets to a bridge, the Ponte Vecchio. It is the oldest, most famous bridge in the city, and on both sides it had rows of shops and houses. But the Medici did not mind that! They just had anything that was in the way pulled down. When the Corridor gets to the other side of the river, it makes some twists and turns. Some buildings were knocked down to make way, but the Mannelli family who lived in a large tower were not so obliging and so the corridor is made to go around its walls. Eventually it gets to the Pitti Palace, which is an enormous building of brown stone, with big carved lions' heads beneath all the windows. Vasari built other buildings that are more beautiful, but the Vasari Corridor is probably his most famous.\n\nVasari's masterpiece is his book, \"\"The Lives of the Great Architects, Painters and Sculptors of Italy\"\", first published in 1550. It is a book of biography. It tells the stories of the lives of Italian artists from Giotto who lived around 1300 to Michelangelo who was still alive when Vasari was writing his book. For some of the artists, very little is known about them except the stories that Vasari heard and wrote in his book. Even though nowadays it is known that Vasari sometimes made mistakes, he gives a wonderful picture of the characters of the artists, and tells all sorts of amusing stories. \n\nVasari does not just tell the stories of the artists' lives. He also describes their artworks in great detail. It is because of Vasari that art historians know of many important artworks that have been lost. It is because of Vasari that we know that the Mona Lisa once had eyebrows. Vasari writes about the artworks as a history. He believed that the Gothic art of the Middle Ages was not as good as the art of Florence in the 15th century (1400s) and that Michelangelo, who painted in the early 16th century (1500s) was the greatest artist since the days of Ancient Greece. He believed that the change towards the great art of the Renaissance began with Giotto around 1300. Vasari puts all these ideas into his book and shows how one artist learnt from each other, and how the changes in art came about. \"Vasari's Lives\" is the first art history book that was ever written. \n\n\n\n", "id": "92076", "title": "Giorgio Vasari"}

She decides to run away from home just long enough to show her family what they would be missing without her. Unfortunately, she does not enjoy hardship or discomfort, so running away has lots of problems. To solve this problem, Claudia decides to stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92208", "text": "Messiah (Handel)\n\nMessiah is an oratorio by Georg Frideric Handel. It is Handel’s most famous work, and in England, the most often performed of any big choral work. The title Messiah means “the anointed one” and is the name given to Jesus Christ in the Christian teaching.\n\nGeorg Frideric Handel was born in Germany. When he was a young man he came to England and he liked it so much that he soon visited England again and stayed there for the rest of his life, becoming a naturalised Englishman says the legend. Actually he was composer for the King of Hannover, who then became King of England, and Handel followed his \"employer\".\n\nThe main reason why Handel liked England at that time was because the people liked his music and gave him support. At this time Handel was known as a composer of operas. For about 20 years Handel spent most of his time working on operas: composing them, organising performances and looking for opera singers to sing his works.\n\nBy the late 1730s, however, people’s tastes started to change and opera was not so popular. Handel changed to writing oratorios. Although it is thought that Handel invented the oratorio he in fact did not.Oratorio is Italian, after the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri at Rome, where famous musical services were held in the 16th century. Handel is just one composer of many who wrote oratorios. His oratorios are based on the English tradition of the Masque, which was something between a play and an opera. However, oratorios were about stories from the Old Testament. Instead of ancient Gods or Roman emperors (which is what operas were about at that time) he used dramatic stories from the Bible. Among many great oratorios that he wrote, \"Messiah\" is his most famous one. However, it is different from his other oratorios in some ways.\n\nThe words of \"Messiah\" were written by a librettist Charles Jennens. He chose several passages from the Bible and made a libretto, which he sent to Handel in 1741 (although people today often call the work “The Messiah”, both Handel and Jennens call it “Messiah” without the word “the”). Handel immediately realized that a great work of music could be made from Jennens’ libretto. He thought that Jennens was a very clever person, and in his letters to him he calls the work “Your Oratorio \"Messiah\"”. Handel sat down in the front room of his house in Brook Street, London, and wrote the whole oratorio in twenty four days. It is a long work, lasting over four hours, and when one thinks that Handel had to write out all the parts for the choir and orchestra, he must have worked unbelievably hard. When he had finished the work, he put it in a drawer for seven weeks. Perhaps he thought it would never be played in London, because at that time the London audiences did not seem to like him.\n\nJust at that time he got an invitation to go to Dublin. He was asked to give a concert to get money for charity. The main charity for which money was being raised was the debtor’s prison. In those days people who ran into debt (meaning that they owed lots of people money but had no money to pay them) were sent to prison. There they were fed by charity (people who fed them out of kindness). If no one fed them they just starved to death. Handel had nearly been sent to a debtor’s prison himself a few years earlier. \n\nHe went to Dublin as soon as he could, and he was there by November. On 23 December he performed his oratorio \"L’Allegro\". Unlike the London audiences, people in Dublin loved it. This was followed by \"Alexander’s Feast\", \"Imeneo\" and, in April, \"Messiah\". He was a very great success in Dublin, and he stayed there until August, when he returned to London.\n\nThe writer Alexander Pope helped people to change their minds and listen to Handel’s new music. He had just published volume 4 of \"Dunciad\". In this work he said how wonderful Handel’s choruses were. When he heard \"Messiah\" he must have known that he had written the truth.\n\n\"Messiah\" tells the story of Christ. It is divided into three parts. Part One tells of the coming and the birth of Christ. Part Two is about his death on the cross, and his Ascension into Heaven, and Part Three has some thoughts about Christ, with words from the books of Job and Corinthians Book One. Handel usually performed his oratorios in theatres, not in churches, and his audience went as a change from going to the opera. They did not go for religious worship. \n\nHandel’s oratorios are normally dramatic, with the four solo singers (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) each taking the part of a character from the Bible. \"Messiah\" is different. The soloists sing about the story of Christ. The great choruses, where the choir sings, praise the Lord in the wonderful music. Some of the music is homophonic (e.g. the \"Hallelujah\" chorus), some of the choruses are dramatic dialogues (e.g. \"Lift up your heads\"), or they are a fugue (\"He trusted in God\" and \"Amen\"), or they describe things dramatically (\"All we like sheep\").\n\nThe most well known of all the movements in The Messiah is the one popularly known as the \"Hallelujah Chorus\", because of the frequently sung word “Hallelujah”. It occurs at the end of the Part Two of the oratorio.'\nThere is a famous story about King George II\nwho attended a royal performance of \"Messiah\". When it came to the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" he stood up. Whenever the king stood up, everyone in his presence had to stand up, so the whole audience stood. No one is really sure whether the king stood up because he liked the music or for some other reason, but it has become tradition for the audience to stand up when the \"Hallelujah Chorus\" is sung.\n", "id": "92208", "title": "Messiah (Handel)"}

After being posted to the 1st Battalion at first, in March, 1916 he was moved to the 53rd Battalion, which was part of the 5th Division, when the Australian Imperial Force was helped by new soldiers from Australia. The 5th Division was soon moved from Egypt to France where they were put into the hard fighting of the Western Front.\n\nBy 19 July 1916 Murray's 53rd Battalion were in the first fighting by the Australian Imperial Force on the Western Front. It was the Battle of Fromelles. 5,533 Australian soldiers were killed, wounded or taken prisoner, because the fighting plan went wrong. The Australian War Memorial sayss the fighting was \"the worst 24 hours in Australia's entire history\" \n\nJohn Murray became a Major in June 1917 and was soon known for his very good leadership and very brave \"night raiding\" (crossing at night into enemy trenches). In September 1918 during the very hard fighting of the Second Battle of the Somme, Murray's good leadership was mentioned again, and after fights near Peronne, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.\n\nMurray was still fighting on the Western Front when peace started 11 November 1918. Having been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Service Order, and also having twice being told of in dispatches he went back home to Australia in May, 1919.\n\nBy 25 August 1919 the all of the men in the Australian Imperial Force had been sent home. Murray was happy to go back to his job at Anthony Hordern & Sons in Sydney, but he did not want to stop being a soldier, and he joined the Australian Citizens Military Forces.\n\nOn 4 January 1923 John Murray married Mary Madeline Cannon at St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and soon after became the manager of the delivery department at Anthony Hordern & Sons.\n\nBy 1925 Murray became a of Lieutenant-Colonel. From 1934 to 1938 Murray was the Commanding Officer of the Australian Army Service Corps, 1st Division.\n\nWith war coming again, John Murray was given the command of the 9th Infantry brigade, and they got ready to move for war in February, 1940. He was chosen for the Second Australian Imperial Force in April 1940 and was given command of the 20th Brigade which went by ship to the Middle East in October 1940 to begin training in Palestine.\n\nMurrays brigade was made a part of the 9th Division. Even though the troops were not ready to fight, the 9th Division was sent to Libya to help the 6th Division win Tobruk. \n\nOn 4 April 1941, the \"Afrika Korps\" starting fighting Murray's 20th Brigade. The Australians slowed down Rommell's forces, but there were so many Germans they could not be forced back. Murray and his troops moved into Tobruk itself. For his leadership, John Murray was granted a \"bar\" to his Distinguished Service Order (the bar is given instead of a second medal).\n\nMurray's knowledge of Trench warfare and night-raiding was very helpful to the defenders during the Siege of Tobruk. In November 1941, Murray was mentioned in dispatches for the third time in his career for his excellent resistance to Rommell.\n\nMurray returned to Australia in January 1942, just as the Japan was fighting south towards New Guinea. Instead of the recruiting job he expected, Murray was put in charge of the Newcastle Covering Force, and immediately promoted him to temporary Major-General.\n\nThe Newcastle Covering Force was soon re-named the 10th Division and Murray was sent to Western Australia in August 1942 to lead the 4th Division which was then moved to North Queensland due to fears of Japanese invasion during April and May 1943.In October 1944, he was made General of the Rear Echelon at Mareeba, before commanding the Northern Territory Force from March, 1945 until January, 1946, when he retired.\n\nJohn Murray was made Australian trade commissioner to New Zealand from 1946 until 1949 and then the same role for \"Ceylon\" in 1949. \n\nGeneral John Murray died on 8 September 1951 at the Military Hospital, Concord, Sydney. He received a funeral with full military honours, and was buried in French's Forest Cemetery. His wife, three sons and two daughters survived him.\n", "id": "92210", "title": "John Murray (general)"}

It was found in 1907 by August Kopff.\n\nHektor is a D-type asteroid, dark and reddish in colour. It lies in Jupiter's leading Lagrangian point, L, called the 'Greek' node after one of the two sides in the legendary Trojan War. Ironically, Hektor is named after the Trojan hero Hektor, and is thus one of two Trojan asteroids that is \"misplaced\" in the wrong camp (the other being 617 Patroclus in the Trojan node).\n\nHektor is one of the most stretched bodies of its size in the solar system, being 370 × 200 km. It is thought that Hektor might be a contact binary (two asteroids joined by gravitational attraction) like 216 Kleopatra. Hubble Space Telescope sightings of Hektor in 1993 did not show an obvious stretched shape because of a limited angular resolution. On July 17, 2006, the Keck-10m II telescope and its Laser guide star Adaptive Optics (AO) system indicated a stretched shape for Hektor. Additionally, since this AO system provides an excellent and stable correction (angular resolution of 0.060 arcsec in K band), a 15-km moon at 1000 km from Hektor was found. The moon's provisional designation is S/2006 (624) 1.

Nicknamed the \"Oricon comet\" for her success in Japan, she has currently released eight singles and one album in that country with varying degrees of success. Also, many of her songs have been featured in TV shows.\n\nYounha was signed to Epic Records, a branch of Sony Music Entertainment Japan, from 2004 to 2008. She then moved to Sistus Records, a Geneon Entertainment label. In South Korea, she is signed to Lion Media and Stam Entertainment.\n\nBorn in South Korea to musical parents, Younha began to play the piano at the age of 4. She developed an interest in Japanese drama shows and began to teach herself Japanese. Before long, she was skilled enough to translate to her school friends what happened on recent Japanese TV episodes. What began as an interest in Japanese dramas developed into an interest in Japanese music. At the recommendation of an older student in her school's broadcasting club, she listened to such artists such as Utada Hikaru and Misia. Younha began to dream about debuting as a singer alongside her favorite artists.\n\nIn order to seek her dreams, she began to try out in auditions within Korea. She claimed that she went through as many as 20 auditions. She also commented in her interview that certain companies refused to sign her to their labels because they believed she was not \"pretty\" enough, although she sang very well. Her mother also discouraged her dream and even locked her bedroom door to prevent Younha from leaving the house. Younha, however, climbed out the window and made it to the audition. At one audition, she made an overwhelming impression and signed a contract with a Korean company. Soon after, Younha's voice was heard by a company in Japan. In order to make her childhood dream of debuting in Japan come true, Younha underwent recording while going back and forth between Korea and Japan. Quickly, Younha's Japanese skills advanced so much that she surprised even the staff around her.\n\nAfter a TV drama producer heard her demo tape, her song \"Yubikiri\" was chosen as the insert song for the Fuji TV Monday drama show \"Tokyo Wankei ~Destiny of Love~\". In October of that same year, she debuted with her official first single \"Yubikiri\".\n\nYounha's second single \"Houkiboshi\" was used as an ending song for the popular anime show \"BLEACH\". It became a hit - debuting on the Oricon chart at #18, it peaked at #12 and propelled Younha into the limelight. With this single, she became only the second Korean, after BoA, to have broken the Oricon chart's top 20. Between \"Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki\" and \"Houki Boshi\", she released \"Motto Futari de\". It flopped massively, only reaching #117 on the Oricon Charts possibly due to a lack of promotion. Her later single, \"Touch / Yume no Tsuzuki\", first charted at the #15, with the tie-in and went as high as #11. After releasing five singles, Younha released her first album entitled \"Go! Younha\". It reached the #10 spot on the Oricon weekly charts.\n\n\"My Lover\" was a re-cut single from Go! Younha, her debut album, and was re-cut because it was the theme to the \"Bleach GC: Tasogare Ni Mamieru Shini Kami\". It was limited to 70,000 copies and flopped, selling only about 2,000 copies, ranking at #58. Because of the limited print, however, it has become extremely valuable and rare to the fans. Younha was also chosen to sing the ending theme to the anime \"Jyu Oh Sei\". \"Tewo Tsunaide\" only did slightly better than \"My Lover\", peaking at #50.\n\nYounha began to compose her own music. The song \"Kaerimichi\" released on \"My Lover\" is the first song released for which she wrote the lyrics and composed the music for. In addition, she composed the music for the song \"homegirl\", the B-side released on \"Te wo Tsunaide\".\n\n\"Imaga Daisuki\" was released, with more live performances than \"Te wo Tsunaide\", and a tie-in. It seemed that Younha has a bigger budget on this single. It did significantly worse, as her second worst ranking single, at #71. \"Imaga Daisuki\" was also used as an opening song for the animation Jang Geum's Dream while the b-track \"Inori\" was used for the animation's ending song.\n\nYounha released a digital Korean single titled \"Audition\". The single includes \"Audition (Time 2 Rock)\" and \"Waiting (기다리다)\". Although it was released as a digital single, very limited hard copies of the single were available as well. Many performances for this song were shown on Korean TV, unusual for Younha as her last appearance on TV was with her single \"Touch.\" Much promotion occurred for this single and it helped for a long charting life for \"Audition\", lasting well over 3 months in all the Korean charts. She stayed in Korea during this release, as well as January.\n\nYounha was once again chosen to be an anime theme singer for \"Kiba\". The song \"Hakanaku Tsuyoku\" was used as the second opening for the show. The single was released on 17 January 2007. This single, unlike her other singles, has only 3 tracks. Surprisingly, this single appeared on the Top 20 Daily Charts for exactly one day, at #16. The Weekly rank was at an above-average #36, but sales were only slightly better. This single did not have a PV because Younha was in Korea during the month before and most likely January as well.\n\nExactly two months after \"Hakanaku Tsuyoku\", Younha went back to her home country to release her first Korean Album entitled \"고백하기 좋은 날\" (Go Baek Ha Gi Jo Eun Nal, translated \"The Perfect Day to Say I Love You\" or literally translated \"Good Day to Confess\"). She recorded a MV for the third track \"비밀번호 486\" (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated \"Password 486\") which stars fellow Stam artist Yoon Ji Hoo. The video featured many image changes for Younha which include her first ever kiss. The album also features a collaboration with Wheesung.\n\nWith the single welcomed well into the market, Younha proceeded to release her Korean debut album. The album received excellent success, peaking at #1 on the charts. The first song to be promoted from the album was 비밀번호 486 (Bi Mil Bun Ho 486, translated \"Password 486\"). She won the SBS Inkigayo Mutizen award twice for Secret Number 486. This song was also well received by the Korean audience. The second song to be promoted from this album was 연애조건 (Yeonae Jogeon, translated \"Love Condition\").\n\nOn July 14th 2007, Younha appeared on the Korean GomTV MSL Grand Finals (Starcraft tournament) and played in the opening ceremony.\n\nYounha has also been picked as publicity envoy for the anti-corruption Clean Wave Campaign for her pure and clean image.\n\nAt the 2007 MKMF held on November 17th 2007, Younha won the Best New Solo Artist award.\n\nWith Younha's success rising, she released a new version of Go! Younha, all re-recorded in Korean. The album, with tracklist changes, is now called 혜성 (Comet), and was released on October 23.\n\nOn January 18th, Younha left Korea to continue her music career in Japan. She is expecting to release a new Japanese Album/Music Video DVD, \"SONGS-Teen's Collection. \" This Collection is expected to include all of her music videos so far, plus a 32 page photobook, in the limited edition of the disk. The release date of this album is March 26th, and on-line Music Shops already have started getting pre-orders.

Younha performed the song \"Diamonds\", which was the number 1 seller of the year 1989 in Japan. (03.08.06)\n\nThis is the discography of pop artist 'Younha'.\n\n", "id": "92277", "title": "Younha"}

Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nHughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri, the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves. At that time, the term used for African-Americans was \"negro\" which means a person with black skin. Most \"negroes\" did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa, even though it was a big influence on their culture and, in particular, their music. Hughes was unusual for his time, because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture. Through his poetry, plays and stories, Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people, so that now the term \"African-American\" is used with pride.\n\nHughes became a famous writer, but all his life he remembered how he started out, and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers.\n\nLangston Hughes was born on February 1, 1902 in Joplin, Missouri. His parents were James Hughes and Carrie Langston Hughes who was a teacher. Langston's father, James Hughes, was so upset about the racism towards African-Americans that he left his family and moved to Mexico. During his childhood, Hughes was cared for by his grandmother, in Lawrence, Kansas while his mother worked to support the family. Langston's grandmother was a great story teller. She told stories that made him feel proud to be an African-American.\n\nAfter his grandmother died, Hughes and his mother moved about 12 times until settling in Cleveland, and then, as a teenager went to live in Lincoln, Illinois with his mother, who had remarried. He was often left alone because his mother was at work. Even though his childhood was difficult and had lots of changes, he was able to use these things in the poetry that he started to write while he was at school. He never forgot the stories of his grandmother and tried to help other African-Americans when they were having problems. These were the people that he later wrote about in his own stories.\n\nWhen Hughes went to school in Lincoln, there were only two African-American children in the class. The teacher talked to them about poetry. She said that what a poem needed most was rhythm. Langston later said that he had rhythm in his blood because, \"as everyone knows\", \"all\" African-Americans have rhythm. The children made him the \"class poet\".\n\nAt high school in Cleveland, Ohio, Langston learned to love reading. He loved the poetry of the American poets Paul Laurence Dunbar and Carl Sandburg. He wrote articles for the school newspaper, he edited the school yearbook and he wrote his first short stories and plays.\n\nWhen Langston Hughes was 17, he went to spend some time with his father in Mexico. He was so unhappy while he was there that he thought about committing suicide. Hughes could not understand how his father felt. He said: \"I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand it, because I was a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much!\"\n\nHughes later wrote this poem: \n\nWhen he was finished at high school in Lincoln in 1920, he went back to Mexico, to ask his father to pay for him to go to university. Hughes' father was a lawyer and a wealthy landowner. He could afford to send his son to university but he made difficulties about it. He said that Hughes could only go to university if he went overseas and studied engineering. Hughes wanted to go to university in the US. After a time, they made an agreement that he should go to Columbia University but study engineering, not an arts degree. He went to Columbia in 1921 but left in 1922, partly because of the racism in the university.\n\nUntil 1926 Hughes did many different types of work. In 1923 he went as a crewman on the ship \"S.S.Malone\" and went to West Africa and Europe. He left the ship and stayed for a short time in Paris where he joined several other African-Americans who were living there. In November 1924, Hughes returned to the U.S. to live with his mother in Washington, D.C.. In 1925 he got a job as an assistant to Carter G. Woodson who worked with the \"Association for the Study of African American Life and History\". Hughes did not enjoy his work because he did not have enough time to write, so he left and got a job as a \"busboy\", wiping tables and washing dishes at a hotel. Hughes is sometimes called \"The Busboy Poet\". Meanwhile, some of his poems were published in magazines and were being collected together for his first book of poetry. While he was working at the hotel he met the poet Vachel Lindsay, who helped to make Hughes known as a new African-American poet.\n\nIn 1926 Hughes began studying at Lincoln University, Pennsylvania. He had help from patrons, Amy Spingarn, who gave him $300 and \"Godmother\" Charlotte Osgood Mason. Hughes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929 and became a Doctor of Letters in 1943. He was also given an honorary doctorate by Howard University. For the rest of his life, except when he travelled to the Caribbean or West Indies, Hughes lived in Harlem, New York.\n\nLangston Hughes sometimes went out with women, but he never married. People who have studied his life and poetry are sure that he was homosexual. In the 1930s it was harder to be open about being gay than it is nowadays. His poetry has lots of symbols which are used by other homosexual writers. Hughes thought that men who had very dark skin were particularly beautiful. It seems from his poetry that he was in love with an African-American man. He also wrote a story which might tell of his own experience. \"Blessed Assurance\" is the story of a father's anger because his son is \"queer\" and acts like a girl.\n\nHughes' life and work were an important part of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, alongside those Zora Neale Hurston, Wallace Thurman, Countee Cullen, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Aaron Douglas, who together started a magazine \"Fire!! Devoted to Younger Negro Artists\". Hughes and these friends did not always agree with the ideas of some of the other African-American writers who were also part of the \"Harlem Renaissance\" because they thought their ideas were Middle class and that they treated others who had darker skin, less education and less money with discrimination. All his life, Hughes never forgot the lessons that he learned about poor and uneducated African-Americans in the stories that his grandmother told.\n\nIn 1960, the \"NAACP\" awarded Hughes the \"Spingarn Medal\" for \"distinguished achievements by an African American\". Hughes became a member of the \"National Institute of Arts and Letters\" in 1961. In 1973, an award was named after him, the \"Langston Hughes Medal\", awarded by the City College of New York.\n\nHughes became a famous American poet, but he was always ready to help other people, particularly young black writers. He was worried that many young writers hated themselves, and expressed these feelings to the world. He tried to help people feel pride, and not worry about the prejudice of other people. He also tried to help young African-Americans not to express hatred and prejudice towards white Americans.\n\nHughes wrote: \n\nOn May 22, 1967, Hughes died in New York City at the age of 65 after having surgery for prostate cancer. His ashes are buried under the floor of the \"Langston Hughes Auditorium\" in the \"Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\" in Harlem. Over his ashes is a circle with a beautiful African design called \"Rivers.\" At the centre of the design are words from a poem by Hughes: \"\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "92287", "title": "Langston Hughes"}

This means that every place can be specified by a set of three numbers, called coordinates. \n\nA full circle can be divided into 360 degrees (or 360°); this was first done by the Babylonians; Ancient Greeks, like Ptolemy later extended the theory.\n\nToday, degrees are divided further. There are minutes, and seconds; 1 minute (or 1') in this context is 1/60 of a degree; 1 second (or 1\") is 1/60 of a minute.\n\nThe first concept needed is called \"latitude\" (Lat, or the Greek symbol \"phi\", formula_1). For it, the Earth is cut up into 180 circles, from the Equator. The poles are at 90°, the North Pole is at 90° N(orth), the South Pole is at 90° S(outh). Places with the same latitude are on a circle, around the Earth.\n\nThe other concept is called \"longitude\" (Long, or the Greek symbol \"lambda\", formula_2), sometimes referred to as \"meridian\". The 0° longitude line (or zero meridian) goes through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. Greenwich is a part of London. Then lines are drawn in a similar way; the opposite (or \"antipodal\") meridian of Greenwich is considered both 180°W(est), and 180°E(ast).\n\nThe third number is the height, altitude, or depth. This is given with respect to some fixed (usually easily calculable point). One of these is called mean sea level.\n", "id": "92288", "title": "Geographic coordinate system"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92374", "text": "Silverwing (novel)\n\nSilverwing is a best-selling novel, written by Kenneth Oppel, published in 1997 by Simon & Schuster It tells the story of a group of silverwing bats. The tone and artistic honour of this series of bestsellers has been compared to the classic animal novel \"Watership Down\". Silverwing is the second installment of the Silverwing series, following the prequel Darkwing.\n\nThe first book has been made into a successful 13 episode, animated television mini-series, shown on the Canadian cable channel Teletoon and currently being shown on Toon Disney's Jetix. These episodes have also been strung together to make 3 movies. The whole series is now available on DVD.\n\nThe main character is a runt named Shade. The novel and its sequel, \"Sunwing\", tell the story of the hard time of Shade and his friends to find his father and free his \"fellow bats\" from an ancient and unjust punishment. The second sequel, \"Firewing\", describes the adventures of Shade's child.\n\nThe bats' punishment came about long ago when a great war was fought between the birds and the land animals. The bats, sharing aspects of both, declared themselves neutral. As a result, the bats were only allowed to come out at night, never to see the sun again without suffering terrible penalties (the backstory is inspired by one of Aesop's fables). Shade sets the main plot of the novel in motion when he breaks that law, and starts a chain of events that leads to the destruction of his group's home, forcing their premature migration, and his separation from them. \n\nWhen he's separated from his group he is found by a Brightwing bat named Marina, and soon the two are in a city where pigeons are very angry with the two bats. They are soon being beaten by the pigeons. The reason is that \"two giant cannibal bats\" have killed a few pigeons, and Shade and Marina are being held responsible for the killings.\n\nWhile the two small bats escape, the scene changes to the two giant bats (\"Vampyrum spectrum\", the False Vampire Bat) on the night they escape. Their names are Goth and Throbb, two carnivorous bats who have only been chasing mice for a while. They escape from the humans who trapped them.\n\nSoon after escaping Shade meets with a bat named Zephyr (who reveals to him that his father is still alive) and is attacked by an owl (who is also chasing him after the death of the pigeons). Goth defends him by attacking and eating the owl, and introduces himself and where he's going. It turns out he needs Shade's help to find his jungle. Shade suggests that he can find his group first and they can help Goth in his search for his homeland. Marina believes that Goth and Throbb should not be trusted, but Shade trusts them since they saved them from the owl. \n\nSoon Shade realizes the truth when he sees Throbb eating a Brightwing. Shade runs off but runs into Marina, whom he feared had been killed. They soon escape after Goth and Throbb are shot by darts from a human flying machine, which is actually an airplane. Shade saw the dart hit Goth in the chest. Yet he is not sure whether the dart hit Throbb.\n\nSoon after they meet with Goth and Throbb again, but escape into the sewer where they meet the rat twins, Romulus and Remus. They are treated as spies by Prince Remus, and as punishment are sent to be eaten by Remus's crazy brother Romulus (who considers himself half bat because of the skin webbing between his legs and arms)but he turns out to be not crazy after all (he only pretends to be crazy to avoid being killed by his brother Remus, as the elder brother Romulus is the rightful Prince) frees them in the end. \n\nThey are soon captured by Goth and Throbb, and Goth explains about his god, Cama Zotz, saying that the said Zotz has greater power than Shade's Nocturna. When Shade half-believes Goth's story, he soon gives the impression of deciding to go with Goth to the jungle to grow big and strong and have Goth kill his family because he was always mistreated, and never cared for, or so he says. He is given a bat to eat but fakes it first then is forced to eat it by the threat to Marina. This disgusting act gives him the opportunity to drug Goth and Throbb with a soporific herb. While the False Vampires sleep, Shade and Marina escape. They are chased by owls, then by Goth and Throbb. During the fight Throbb gets hit by lightning and bursts into flames. Goth survives, but only by a scant margin.\n\nAfter they leave, however, Goth moves again, and kills a bird near him. The last moments the bird saw was a set of double rowed teeth. Although weak he tries to fly; once he does, he soon vows revenge against Shade.\n\nShade and Marina meet up with Shade's group, telling stories of what had happened to them. They decide to find Shade's father, Cassiel, and Chinook volunteers to help. They plan to go after hibernating, but Shade wishes to go now. It ends with Shade starting to fall asleep, with Ariel and Marina roosting beside him.\n\nShade Silverwing is the protagonist of the series. He is a runt Silverwing, and often made fun of by his peers, who take pride in their size and strength. While Shade's strength may be lower than the other bats', he is a master of the sound, often making illusions or moving materials with echoes. \n\nMarina Brightwing is Shade's newfound friend. When Shade had been blown away by the storm, she met him. She is a lot bigger than Shade, and does not fail to remind him of it.\n\nChinook is Shade's competitor and the biggest and strongest newborn of the group. All the bats like him, and he said he caught two tiger moths which are known by all the others in the group to be an extraordinary achievement by such a young bat. Shade loathes him for his airs and size. Shade and Chinook become friends later in the story. His parents are Plato and Isis. \n\nFrieda is an older bat of the Silverwing group. She is wise in many ways, and makes good decisions. Frieda has a silver band on her forearm. She was a big contributor to the rebellion against the owls fifteen years previous.\n\nAriel is Shade's mother. She had protected Shade from the wrath of the rest of the group. She had lost her mate, Cassiel, before Shade was born.\n\nGoth is a sly and smooth-talking cannibal bat, half responsible for the killing of many pigeons. He is a prince in his own group, and worships Cama Zotz, the brother of Nocturna, whom the Silverwings and other bats like them believe in. Goth comes from the jungle, and had been captured by humans.\n\nThrobb is another one of the cannibal bats. Unlike Goth, he is a coward and according to Goth he feeds on carcasses already killed by other cannibal bats in the jungle.\n", "id": "92374", "title": "Silverwing (novel)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92432", "text": "Impressionism\n\nImpressionism is a style of painting which began in France in the late 19th century. Impressionist painting shows life-like subjects painted in a broad, rapid style, with brushstrokes that are easily seen and colours that are often bright. The term 'impressionism' comes from a painting by Claude Monet, which he showed in an exhibition with the name \"Impression, soleil levant\" (\"Impression, Sunrise\"). An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just \"impressions\". The word stuck. \n\nImpressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas. Some impressionist painters also made watercolours and prints. There is also some impressionist sculpture.\n\nIn the 19th century, most artists learned to paint by attending an art school or academy. The academies were very strict about the way that young artists learnt to paint. The popular style of painting was called classicism. Classical paintings were always done inside a studio. They often showed stories from mythology. An artist would prepare for a painting by doing lots of drawings. The paintings were very smoothly and carefully painted. \n\nAt the same time there were several painters who loved to paint the French landscape and the village people in a realist way, different from Classicism. They would often make small quick paintings out of doors, and then finish them in the studio. These artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste Corot. Edgar Degas wrote in 1883: \"There is one master, Corot. We are nothing in comparison, nothing\". A group of young painters who admired the work of these artists became friends and started painting together. These artists were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.\n\nEvery year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the \"Salon de Paris\". In 1863 an artist called Edouard Manet put a picture into the show called \"Lunch on the Grass\" (\"Le déjeuner sur l'herbe\"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute! The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the \"Salon des Refusés\" which showed all the pictures that had been \"refused\". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new \"movement\" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. \nIn 1872 Monet and his friends formed a society called the \"\"Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\"\". They began to organize their own art show. In 1874 thirty artists held their first exhibition. The critic Louis Leroy made fun of their work and wrote an article called \"The Exhibition of the Impressionists\". The public who came to the exhibition also began to use this name. The painters themselves soon started to use the name \"Impressionists\" and they have been called by that name ever since. They had eight exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. They paid a dealer called Paul Durand-Ruel to organise exhibitions, and he arranged shows in London and New York. Bit by bit, their paintings became popular. Some of the Impressionists, Monet and Renoir, lived to be old and famous, but others died very poor. The main artists who are called \"Impressionists\" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Armand Guillaumin, Mary Cassatt, Gustave Caillebotte and Frederic Bazille. \n\nMany artists worked with the Impressionists for a short time, but then began to try out new ideas. These artists all painted in different ways, but together are called the Post-Impressionists. They include Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Vincent van Gogh. \n\nWhile the French Impressionist painters were at work in France, painters in other countries were also beginning to paint outdoors in a broader style. Eventually the Impressionist style spread to many countries across Europe, to North America and Australia. Some artists continued to paint in the Impressionist style right through the 20th century.\n\nBefore the time of the Impressionists, many artists worked by painting portraits. Before the invention of the camera, painted portraits were the main way to record a person's \"appearance\" (what they looked like). But by the time the Impressionists started painting, there were many photographers who had studios where people could go to be photographed. As cameras improved, photographers started taking \"snapshots\" of scenery and people outdoors. \n\nPhotography had two effects on painters. Firstly, it meant that it was much harder for them to live by painting portraits. Many artists became very poor. Secondly, the image taken by a camera often has interesting angles and viewpoints that are not usually painted by artists. Impressionist painters were able to learn from photographs. Many Impressionist paintings make the viewer feel as if they were right there, looking at the scene through the eyes of the artist.\n\nImpressionist painters did not paint from their imagination, from literature, history or mythology like most other painters of the 19th century. They painted what they saw in the world around them: the town where they lived, the landscape where they went on holiday, their family, their friends, their studios and the things that were around their home. Sometimes they were \"commissioned\" (given a job) to paint a portrait of someone. \n\nImpressionist painters liked to paint \"ordinary\" things that were part of everyday life. They painted women doing the washing and ironing, ballet dancers doing exercises, horses getting ready for a race and a bored-looking waitress serving a customer. Nobody, before the Impressionists, had ever thought that these subjects were interesting enough to paint.\n\nEven though many Impressionist artists painted people, they are thought of mainly for their landscape painting. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with doing some drawings or quick painted sketches outdoors and then making grand pictures in the studio. Impressionist painters were not satisfied with painting the shape of the land, the buildings and trees. They wanted to capture the light and the weather.\n\nThe Impressionist painters looked for a \"technique\" (a way of doing something) to paint landscapes that showed the light and the weather. The light and the weather change all the time. The light of the sun on the landscape changes every minute as the Earth turns. Impressionist painters looked at the works of earlier French artists such as Camille Corot and Gustave Courbet. Courbet often took his paints outdoors and made quick coloured sketches that he could then use to make large paintings in his studio. The Impressionist painters were more interested in the sketches than the finished paintings. \n\nAnother artist, Eugene Boudin, used to sit on the beach at Deauville with his oil paints, and make quick paintings of the people on holiday. They would sometimes buy his paintings as souvenirs. \n\nClaude Monet met Boudin and learnt that the only way to \"capture\" the way that a landscape looked at a particular time was to paint small pictures, very quickly, and without bothering to mix the paints up to make nice smooth even colours. Impressionist painters would use big brushstrokes of different bright colours and let them get mixed up on the canvas, instead of carefully mixing them up on a palette first. By painting in this way, without bothering with the details, Impressionist painters capture a realistic \"impression\" of a the world that they saw around them. \n\nSome of the things that they painted were: snow gently falling over a town, mist rising on a river in the pink morning light, people walking through a field of wheat with bright red poppies growing in it, sunlight dappling through leaves onto people dancing, a train sending up clouds of smoke in a big railway station, and water lillies floating on a pool under drooping willows. \n\nMost Impressionist landscape paintings are small, so that the artist could carry them outdoors. Some artists, particularly Claude Monet, would take several canvases, and as the day went on and the light changed, he would put down one and take up another. He rented a room from which he could see Rouen Cathedral so that he could paint it from the window at different times of day. Monet also did a series of \"Haystack\" paintings, showing them standing in the field from different angles and in all sorts of weather, bright sunshine, morning frost and snow. Paintings that are done outdoors are called \"plein air\" paintings. The Impressionist painters often used to go out together on painting trips, so there are many pictures that can be compared.\nThe term \"impressionism\" has been used for other forms of art, such as writing and music. Octave Mirbeau is often described as an impressionist writer. In 1887, music critics said the works of Claude Debussy were impressionist. Later, other composers were also described as impressionist, including Maurice Ravel, Paul Dukas, Erik Satie and Albert Roussel.\n\nClick on each image to enlarge it, to see the way each artist has used brush-strokes and colour. \n\n\n", "id": "92432", "title": "Impressionism"}

He was the most important English composer of madrigals. He studied the madrigals by Italian composers and created the tradition of the English madrigal, a tradition that became extremely popular, but which only lasted about 30 years.\n\nMorley’s father was a brewer who lived in Norwich, so it is likely that Morley was born there. He may have been a choirboy in Norwich Cathedral. We know that in 1583 he got the job of organist there. In a book he published later in his life he said that William Byrd was his master. If this means that he had lessons from Byrd he must have travelled away from Norwich. In 1588 he got a degree from Oxford, and soon afterwards he became an organist at St. Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nIn 1588 Nicholas Yonge published a book called \"Musica transalpina\". It was a collection of Italian madrigals with words translated into English. Soon after this Morley started to publish his own madrigals. In 1592 he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal.\n\nIn London Morley lived near Shakespeare. We do not know whether the two men worked together, but Morley did set Shakespeare’s words \"It was a lover and his lass\" from \"As You Like It\". We do not know whether it was ever used in a performance of Shakespeare's play. It is quite possible, because Morley was well-known.\n\nFrom 1593 onwards Morley published a great deal of music and also made a lot of money out of music publishing, both of his own and other composers’ music.\n\nIt is thought that Morley died in October 1602.\n\nMorley wrote sacred music as well as madrigals. His church music is strongly influenced by William Byrd. \n\nHis madrigals are his most important works. They are often very lively and have tunes that are easy to sing. One of his best known madrigals is called \"Now is the Month of Maying\". He started by using the Italian style and changed it to make it sound English. The madrigals of Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye are usually more serious. \n\nAs well as madrigals, Morley wrote music for instruments, including keyboard music. Some of his pieces are in the famous collection called \"Fitzwilliam Virginal Book\"). He also wrote music for the typically English combination of two viols, flute, lute, cittern and bandora.\n\nMorley wrote a book about music theory called \"Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke\". It was published in 1597 and was read by many people for two centuries after his death. It tells us a lot about how music was performed in Morley’s\n", "id": "92541", "title": "Thomas Morley"}

He also designed woodcuts, painted and worked as a miniaturist. He is one of the most important of the \"Little Masters\", a group of German artists making old master prints in the generation after Albrecht Dürer.\n\nBeham was born in Nuremberg in 1500 into a family of artists. In 1525, he and his brother were banished from Nuremberg because they were thought to have not accepted the Churches ideas (heresy) and blasphemy. They came back to the city in 3 months, but Beham was banished again in 1528 for publishing a book which was plagiarised from an unpublished manuscript by Albrecht Dürer. \n\nFrom 1532 he lived mostly in Frankfurt until he died in 1550.\n\nMost people know him as \"Sebald Beham\". However, he signed some of his prints before 1532 with \"HSP\". After he moved to Frankfurt, he signed his prints with \"HSB\".\n\nBeham made about 252 engravings, 18 etchings and 1500 woodcuts. He worked on small, very detailed engravings (sometimes as small as a postage stamp). This makes him part of the German printmaking school called the \"Little Masters\", since their works were so small. He created and published his works himself, but his larger works were mostly commissioned work to be sold.\n\nHe also made prints to be used as cards, wallpaper, coats of arms, designs for other artists and designs for stained or painted glass. He also painted a table top (now in the Louvre ) for Cardinal Albrecht, Archbishop of Mainz.\nBeham mostly engraved pictures of peasants and scenes from myths or history, sometimes with erotic scenes as well. Since he was working at the same time as Dürer, the most recognised artist at the time, one of his early woodcuts, \"Head of Christ\", was thought to have been done by Dürer. Beham also worked with his brother Barthel, and shared ideas with him. Later, he re-drew some of Dürer's works like gus Melancholia of 1539.\n\nAfter publishing a book about drawing horses, for which he was exiled, he wrote a book on drawing the human figure. His book was mostly just a simplified book of Dürer's own books, but his book was easier to use and cheaper than Dürer's books, so artists preferred to buy his.\n\n", "id": "92543", "title": "Hans Sebald Beham"}

His father may have been the rector at that church.

After working for a short time at the house of Edward Darcye, he got the job of organist at Winchester College. He was paid 13s 4d (almost 67p in modern money) per quarter (i.e. every three months), but was given food and somewhere to live. He stayed there for two or three years. \n\nDuring his time in Winchester Weelkes composed two more volumes of madrigals, published in 1598 and 1600. He got his B. Mus. Degree from New College, Oxford in 1602, and moved to Chichester to take up the job of organist and choir master at the Cathedral.. He was also a lay clerk at the Cathedral, and was paid £15 2s 4d (£15.11 in modern money) in addition to having food and lodgings. The next year he married Elizabeth Sandham, who came from a rich family. They had three children.\n\nWeelkes' fourth and final volume of madrigals, published in 1608, has a title page where he says that he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal. However, his name does not appear in the records at the Chapel Royal, so it is likely that he was only there for a short time until someone else was found for the job.\n\nIn later years Weelkes got into trouble with the Chichester Cathedral authorities because of his heavy drinking and bad behaviour. In 1609 he was in trouble because he was absent from work. In 1616 he was in trouble again for swearing. In the end he lost his job because he was drunk at the organ and used bad language during the service. However, he got his job back, but his behaviour was still bad.\n\nThomas Weelkes died in London in 1623, a year after his wife died. He was buried in St Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, London. In Chichester Cathedral there is a memorial stone to him.\n\nThomas Weelkes is best known for his vocal music, especially his madrigals and church music. Weelkes wrote more Anglican services than any other important composer of the time, mostly for evensong. Many of his anthems are verse anthems, which would have suited the small choir he was writing for at Chichester Cathedral.\n\nWeelkes was friends with the madrigalist Thomas Morley. When Morley died in 1602, Weelkes wrote an anthem called \"A Remembrance of my Friend Thomas Morley\", (also known as \"Death hath Deprived Me\".)

In the early Middle Ages, the meaning changed and the word was used for one of the highest officials of the Catholic Church in the pope's service and also for one of the big nobles of the Holy Roman Empire, who was then named Count Palatine. The word paladin was also used in 19th century Hungary and in the German Empire and United Kingdom during the early 20th century.\n\nIn medieval literature, the paladins or Twelve Peers were known in the Matter of France as the retainers of Charlemagne. Because of the way that this word was used in books, paladin was then known to be a knight with honor. \n\nThe paladins of the imperial guard were named after the Scholae Palatinae.\n\nIn the beginning, the word paladin was applied to the Chamberlains and to some soldiers guarding the palace of the Roman emperor. In Constantine's time, the word was also used for the best infantry of the army, the Praetorian Guard, that might guard the Roman Emperor during wars.\n\nAfter the Middle Ages, the word palatine was put onto many different people of power across Europe. The most important of these was the \"comes palatinus\", the count palatine, who in Merovingian and Carolingian times, was an official of the lords' household and court of law. \n\nDuring the 800s, Carolingean rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it. About a century later, the title was made alive again by Otto I, though the new empire was now centered in Germany rather than France. The term palatine is found again under Charles IV, but they were less powerful than the previous palatines.\n\nIn the early days of England, the word \"palatinate\", or county palatine, was also used in counties of lords who could use powers normally used by the crown. \n\nIn Britain and Germany, paladin was an official rank and was a very good title for one in the service of the emperors. It was a Knight with additional honours, they were allowed to use powers normally used by the crown.\n\nThe word \"paladin\" is still used to describe a good, heroic person, or a defender of a good cause. \n\nSome role playing games now use paladins as a character class that you can choose when starting a new game.\n", "id": "92581", "title": "Paladin"}

His mother died when he was one and ten years later his father died. In 1895 he became a priest and obtained the title Vardapet (or Vartabed), meaning a \"priest\" or a \"church scholar\".\n\nHe established and conducted the monastery choir till 1896 when he went to Berlin, to the Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm University. Here he studied music at the private conservatory of Prof. Richard Schmidt. In 1899 he acquired the title \"doctor of musicology\" and returned to Echmiadzin. He traveled extensively around the country, listening and recording details about Armenian folk songs and dances performed in various villages. This way he collected and published some 3000 songs, many of them adapted to choir singing.\n\nHis major work is Badarak (Divine Liturgy), still used today as one of the two most popular musical settings of the Armenian Church liturgy. \n\nHe was the first non-European to be admitted into the International Music Society of which he was a co-founder.\n\nOn April 24, 1915, said to be the day when Armenian Genocide officially began, he was arrested. The next day he was put on a train with 180 other Armenian notables and sent to the city of Çankırı in northern Central Anatolia, at a distance of some 300 miles. His good friend, Turkish nationalist poet Emin Yurdakul, the authoress Halide Edip, and the U.S. ambassador Henry Morgenthau intervened with the government and, by special orders from Talat Pasha, Komitas was sent back to the capital. In autumn 1916, he was taken to a Turkish military hospital and he moved to Paris in 1919 where he died in a psychiatric clinic \"Villejuif\" in 1935. Next year his ashes were transferred to Yerevan and buried in the Pantheon. \nThe Yerevan State Musical Conservatory is named after Komitas. There also a world famous string quartet named after Komitas. \n\n", "id": "92602", "title": "Komitas Vardapet"}

The first part of the building process around this time was done under the watchful eye of Major George Barney, a Commanding Royal Engineer who used hired workers provided by Governor Gipps.\n\nIn 1871 the fort got an extra barracks. The barracks were made from large sandstone blocks and carved out of the rock on the headland. This addition was the work of James Barnet, a colonial architect. This most recent add-on had three gun pits and had connecting walkways for the people in the army that worked there.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92945", "text": "Reservoir Dogs\n\nReservoir Dogs is a 1992 American crime drama thriller movie. The movie was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and starred Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Steve Buscemi. It is the first movie directed by Tarantino and is about the events before and after a jewelry store robbery that went wrong. The movie was released on October 23, 1992. The title, and promo shots associated with the movie, was a take on the violent Sam Peckinpah movie, Straw Dogs. Although Reservoir Dogs failed at the theater it found new life after being released on VHS and DVD, quickly becoming a cult classic.\n\nThe movie shows the events before and after a robbery at a jewelry shop in Los Angeles, California, that went wrong. The men are given nicknames with colours so that they do not know each others names; Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel). They work for a gangster Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, \"Nice Guy\" Eddie (Chris Penn). \n\nThe robbery goes wrong and several of the men are killed, and Mr. Orange is shot and bleeding. The rest of the men return to the hideout and talk about what went wrong. Mr. Blonde has captured a police officer, Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) and beat him to try to get an answer. Mr. Blonde tries to torture the police officer while the rest of the men are away but is killed by Mr. Orange who is actually an undercover police officer. \n\nThe rest of the men argue and are in a Mexican standoff and are all shot. Mr. Pink, who hid from the shootout, steals the diamonds and runs away.\n\n\n\nAt the movie's release at the Sundance Film Festival, movie critic Jami Bernard of the \"New York Daily News\" compared the effect of \"Reservoir Dogs\" to that of the 1895 movie \"L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat\", where audiences watched a moving train approaching the camera and ran away frightened. Bernard claimed that \"Reservoir Dogs\" had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of the \"New York Times\" enjoyed the cast and the use of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close-ups in the movie. Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" also enjoyed the movie and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said \"Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.\"\n\nRoger Ebert was less enthusiastic; he felt that the script could have been better and said that the movie \"feels like it's going to be terrific\", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also stated that \"[Tarantino] has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.\" Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four also claiming that he enjoyed it, and that it was a very good movie from a talented director, like other critics, he enjoyed the cast, but stated \"I liked what I saw, but I wanted more\".\n\n\"Reservoir Dogs\" has received a lot of criticism for its strong violence and language. One particular scene that viewers did not like was Michael Madsen cutting off the police officer's ear, and Madsen himself reportedly had a great deal of difficulty finishing the scene especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea \"I've got a little kid at home\". Many people have left theaters during the movie and Tarantino commented at the time: \nIt happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing. During a screening of the movie at a Film Festival in Barcelona, fifteen people walked out, including horror movie director Wes Craven and special effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walk out as a \"compliment\" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism.\n\nCritic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in \"Psycho\" and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\". After this movie, Tarantino was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara. For its nonlinear storyline, \"Reservoir Dogs\" has also often been compared to \"Rashomon\". Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the movie on its \"deadpan sense of humor\". Todd McCarthy called the movie \"undeniably impressive\" and was of the opinion that it was influenced by \"Mean Streets\", \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Killing\".\n\n", "id": "92945", "title": "Reservoir Dogs"}

In 1938 the column was moved to its present location, and a fourth ring, decorated with golden garlands was added.\n\nAround the base are four bronze reliefs showing the three wars and the winning army marching into Berlin.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93102", "text": "Church music\n\nChurch music is music that is intended to be part of Christian worship in churches, chapels, cathedrals or anywhere Christians meet to worship. Church music is sacred (religious) music, but not all religious music is church music. Some music may be inspired by religion, but it may not be church music. For example, some songs are about religion, but they may not be church music. Although it uses the words of the Requiem mass, Verdi’s \"Requiem\", was composed for performance in a concert hall. Britten’s \"War Requiem\" was written for performance in a cathedral, but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship, so it would not usually be thought of as “church music”.\n\nChurch music has varied enormously during the history of Christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship. Most church music is based on singing. Music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy (the words used in services). The organ is the most important musical instrument in church music, although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well.\n\nDuring many periods in history composers writing for the church used traditional music rather than the newest fashions. This was particularly the case in the early 17th century when composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often wrote in two different styles: the old style for church music (which, at the time, they called “stilo antico”) and the new style for secular (non-religious) music (which they called “stilo moderno”).\n\nDuring the early history of Christian worship the churches were spread through many countries in the Roman Empire. The musical traditions that already existed in these countries were used, so there was great variety. Musical instruments were associated with the devil and with dancing, and so they were thought to be wicked and were not allowed in churches. The only music that was allowed in churches was singing. In the 4th century Bishop Ambrosius of Milan introduced the antiphon and encouraged newly composed hymns. Psalms were an important part of the early Christian worship. Responsorial psalms were psalms which were sung by one person (who may have been called a “reader”), and the congregation may have responded at the end of a verse with something simple such as “Alleluia”. Gradually “antiphonal psalmody” was developed. This meant that the choir stands on opposite sides facing one another and they sing the verses of the psalm alternately (first one side has a turn, then the other). Antiphonal psalm singing can still be heard today in Anglican cathedrals.\n\nThe kind of music heard in the Catholic Church was known as chant or plainchant, often known as “Gregorian chant” (after St Gregory the Great, who was Pope from 590-604). The text (the words that were sung) were the standard words of the liturgy. The words of the Mass were set to music by many composers. Music for the dead was called Requiem Mass. There was also music for Vespers and the Compline. Until the 16th century the organ was only used to accompany the singing. In the Renaissance period many great composers such as Giovanni da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus wrote polyphonic music for the Catholic Church. They often wrote motets: short pieces based on texts which were not part of the liturgy.\n\nDuring the period called Reformation some Protestant groups broke away from the Catholic Church. From this time on Catholic and Protestant music developed in different ways.\n\nMartin Luther started the Protestant movement in Germany. In the Lutheran church the chorale was the most important part of the musical worship. Luther himself composed many chorale tunes. These are like hymns. The great Johann Sebastian Bach based much of his organ music on the chorale (these pieces are called Chorale Preludes). The choir often sang a motet. Sometimes these choir pieces became very long and turned into cantatas. The words were not from the liturgy but made up by poets or taken from the Bible. Bach wrote about 200 cantatas for the church. He also wrote two great passions which tell the story of Jesus dying on the cross. Other composers who have contributed to Protestant church music in Europe include Heinrich Schütz, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Dietrich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, and Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.\n\nMusic for the Catholic Church includes instrumental music such as “church cantatas”. Arcangelo Corelli and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote many examples of these. Mozart also wrote several masses. Great Italian composers of the 16th and 17th centuries who wrote church music include Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi. In the 19th century Rheinberger and Max Reger wrote music in the Romantic style. French composers of this time wrote in a style which was similar to music.\n\nWhen King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church he founded his own church, known as the Anglican church. Many great composers wrote music for the Anglican service. Their music for choirs was mostly service settings and anthems. They also wrote many hymn tunes. Important composers include William Byrd (who also wrote Catholic church music) and Thomas Tallis in the Renaissance, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell in the Baroque period, and in later periods Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Charles Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Bairstow, William Mathias and John Rutter.\n\nChurch music in American churches developed, at first, in a similar way to European music. The Book of Common Prayer was the basis of American worship. Both Puritans and Baptists thought that congregational singing was important. In the 18th century Singing Masters from Singing Schools in the north eastern states used to travel around to try to teach people in church to sing properly. The most famous of these singing masters was William Billings. Because most people could not read, a system called Lined-out Hymnody developed, in which the priest sang a line and the congregation copied him. Later in the century, during the “First Great Awakening”, the hymn tunes of English composers such as Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley became popular.\n\nIn the 19th century people from different churches met at Camp Meetings. These were led by Evangelists. The songs reflect the belief that sinners can be saved by . The music of black people and of folk music became important influences. Songs became tuneful and often had refrains. In the middle of the century Sunday Schools for children became extremely popular and many songs were written for them. Gospel songs and negro spirituals also became very widely used and influenced the development of church music in America.\n\nChurch music in the Orthodox Church in East European countries is always sung. It is based on the Byzantine musical tradition.\n\n", "id": "93102", "title": "Church music"}

There are technologies like internet, mobile phones, computers and Wi-Fi in some parts of the world, and in other parts there are not. It is the difference of people that can access the internet, and the people that cannot. \n\nA digital divide can be born for many reasons like socioeconomic problems (few people are rich and lots are poor), racial problems (there is a majority or a minority that control the other), or geographical problems (in the cities there are technologies but there are not in rural areas). \n\nCountries on the rich side of the divide include Canada, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Europe and Australasia. They have big internet connection developments, and most people can afford computers and other technology. On the poor side are Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where there are many social problems. Technology has a long way to go before getting interest in those countries, because of problems like the price of technology and the fact that sometimes there are not any resources to help.\n\nIn some parts of the world there is a large digital divide. Sometimes it is just in half of a country, or just a region, for example Africa. As with other things like education or transport, some people have things that others don't have. There are big cities where technologies are cheap and there are many villages and rural communities where there is no digital/electronic technology. In this case the digital divide creates other problems. Because a part of the country is rich and another part is poor, there are often problems with trading and connections.\n\nMany rich countries (for example, Canada, the United States, Japan, Italy, France, United Kingdom) send old computers or make charity projects by non-profit associations or communities or projects for schools in poor countries, for example One Laptop Per Child, to fight the digital divide and to make a culture involving internet and other technologies.\n", "id": "93154", "title": "Digital divide"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93275", "text": "Duck Hunt\n\nDuck Hunt is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game system. The game was made by Nintendo, and was released in 1984 in Japan. In \"Duck Hunt\", players use the NES Zapper to shoot ducks on screen to get points. The ducks come onto the screen one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. \n\n\"Duck Hunt\" was one of the two first Pack-in games for the NES. The game did not get many reviews, but many gamers enjoyed playing it, and many people said it was a good game. Before Nintendo made the game, it also made a \"Duck Hunt\" game about the Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976.\n\nIn \"Duck Hunt\", players use the Nintendo Zapper Light Gun that must be plugged into their NES consoles. Then they try to shoot down ducks or clay pigeons. \"Duck Hunt\" was also released as an arcade game in 1984, and was also in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console.\n\nThe game has three modes: one-duck mode, with only one duck on the screen; two-duck mode, with two on the screen; and a third mode called \"clay pigeon shooting\". The clay pigeons are much smaller than the ducks and are harder to hit. Players need faster reaction time when playing this mode than when shooting ducks. In \"Vs. Duck Hunt\", Clay Shooting mode is the second mode after two-duck mode, because the arcade \"Duck Hunt\" games never had a one-duck mode. \n\nDuring the game, there is a dog that laughs at the player if no duck is hit. If the player hits a duck, the dog will congratulate them. A popular urban legend is that players have found a way to shoot the dog. This cannot happen in \"Duck Hunt\", but it can happen in a bonus round of the arcade game \"Vs. Duck Hunt\". \n\n\"Duck Hunt\" does not have a way for more than one person to shoot ducks, but a second player may plug in a NES controller in the other controller port and control the duck that appears. This only can happen in one-duck mode, and can not be done with the clay pigeons.\n\nNobody knows much about the development of \"Duck Hunt\", but Nintendo Research & Development 1 made the game. They also created the Light Gun used in \"Duck Hunt\". Work on the game was led by Takehiro Izushi, and was produced by Gunpei Yokoi. \n\n\"Duck Hunt\" has been placed in several cartridges with more than one game. In the Action Set cartridge of the NES in the 1980s, \"Duck Hunt\" came with \"Super Mario Bros.\". If a player bought the NES system with the Power Pad, then \"Duck Hunt\" came on a 3-in-1 cartridge that also had \"World Class Track Meet\" and \"Super Mario Bros\".\n\nThe music was composed, or written, by Koji Kondo and Hirokazu \"Hip\" Tanaka. Both men made music for other Nintendo games at the time, such as Metroid. Some people have called the sound effects, \"pretty much what you'd expect for a game from the early 1980s - that is, awful by today's standards...\", but the game's music was played on the Video Games Live concert tour.\n\nBecause it was made in the 1980's, \"Duck Hunt\" did not get very many reviews. Most critics have not reviewed \"Duck Hunt\". All Game Guide called the game an \"attractive but repetitive target shooter\" and \"utterly mindless ... the game is fun for a short time, but gets old after a few rounds of play.\" Video Game Critic, another website, gave the game a review in 2004, scoring the game a \"D\". It said, \"there's really not much substance to it ... overall Duck Hunt is pretty lame, and only worth playing for a trip down memory lane.\" Video game players say that they like the game. IGN users gave it an 8.7 out of 10, and the GameSpot users gave the Mario-Duck Hunt cartridge a 9.1 out of 10. It was rated the 155th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list.\n\n\"Duck Hunt\", and the characters in it, have been in other video games since the game first came out in the 1980s. The dog in \"Duck Hunt\" has appeared in \"Barker Bill's Trick Shooting\" and can be shot in the \"Balloon Saloon\" game. In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", a trophy shows the ducks from \"Duck Hunt\". Also, games in the \"WarioWare, Inc.\" series have games about \"Duck Hunt\". Level 19 in Tetris DS is also about \"Duck Hunt\"\n\nOne of the games in \"Wii Play\" for the Wii console is Shooting, a game that is similar to \"Duck Hunt\". The game replaces the light gun used in the NES game with the Wii controller, and it has a targeting reticle that \"Duck Hunt\" did not have. The new game also has different things to shoot, such as UFOs and targets, and has a two player mode. \n\n", "id": "93275", "title": "Duck Hunt"}

Its capital has the same name, San José de Ocoa.\n\nIt was created on 6 September 2000 but it started on 1 January 2001. It was a municipality of the Peravia province before being raised to the category of province.\n\nThe province is named after its capital city, San José de Ocoa. \"Ocoa\" is the name of the river that crosses the province; it is a Taíno word that means \"a place with many mountains\".\n\nBartolomé de Las Casas was the first person that wrote about the region when he said that \"Maniey\" (now, \"Maniel\") was a Taíno province. Maniey or Maniel meant \"a place where there are peanuts\"; mani ( (Spanish) is the Taíno word for peanut. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera did not write about the \"Maniey\" but he wrote about a lake in the region of Rancho Arriba; there is not a lake (or lakes) there anymore, only a swamp.\n\nFor a long time, the region was visited only by \"monteros\" (men that hunted wild cows and pigs). Then some \"s\" (runaway slaves) came to live here, in the high mountains of the region. One settlement was called \"Maniel\"; since then, Maniel meant in Hispaniola a place where maroons live and not only the name of the region. \n\nThe first settlement by maroons in the region is from the beginning of the 16th century and was called Maniel Viejo de Ocoa. This settlement lasted until 1666 or 1667 because many people died from smallpox and measles that affected the island in those years. There was also a military action in the region to capture maroons.\n\nThe second settlement was during the first years of the 19th century (around 1802), and it is known as Maniel de los Lorenzos (\"Lorenzos' Maniel\") because of the last name (\"Lorenzo\") of its founders. It was founded at El Canal, north of the city of San José de Ocoa.\n\nVery soon some families from Baní, on the south, began to move to the region and made their houses at what is now the city of San José de Ocoa.\n\nDuring the Dominican War of Independence (1844), there were two important battles in the region: the battles of \"El Memiso\" and of \"El Pinar\", won by Dominican soldiers. So the Haitian soldiers could not go on to Santo Domingo, and had to go back to Haiti.\n\nIn December 1858, San José de Ocoa was made a municipality of the old province of Santo Domingo; in 1895, it was changed to a municipality of the Azua province. With the creation of the Peravia, San José de Ocoa was a municipality of that new province. Then, on 6 September 2000, San José de Ocoa was made a new province with the northern half of the Peravia province and with the municipalities of San José de Ocoa, Rancho Arriba and Sabana Larga, and the municipal district of La Ciénaga.\n\nIn 2004, Nizao-Las Auyamas and El Pinar became municipal districts, and El Naranjal in 2006.\n\nSan José de Ocoa is bordered to the north by the Monseñor Nouel and La Vega provinces, to the east by San Cristóbal, to the south by the Peravia, and to the west by Azua.\n\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the San José de Ocoa province, and 37,466 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km².\n\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 29th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 56,565 inhabitants.\n\nThe largest city of the province is San José de Ocoa, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in ) of 22,383 inhabitants.\n\nThe San José de Ocoa province has a total area of .

It was released on November 18, 1988, the same day as Disney's \"Oliver & Company\". The movie's success led to 13 sequels being made.\n\nAn orphaned long-neck dinosaur named Littlefoot goes off in search of the legendary Great Valley, a place with lots of vegetation where dinosaurs can live in peace. Along the way he meets four other young dinosaurs, each one a different species, and they encounter several problems as they learn to work together in order to survive.\n\nThere are five main characters known as the \"Gang of Five:\"\n\nLittlefoot: The leader of the gang, Littlefoot is a \"long-neck,\" the in-universe name for Brontosaurus. He is brave, and good at making decisions. He lives with his grandparents in the Great Valley.\n\nCera: Cera is a \"three-horn,\" also known as a Triceratops.

She looks most like a Saurolophus, but she is called a Parasaurolophus on the Land Before Time Website . She is the nicest of the group, and trusts others easily. She lives with her mother and father (though her father is not often seen) and says in the sixth film that she is one of thirteen twins, although the original shows tht she is one of four. She also has her adopted brother Spike.\n\nPetrie: A \"flyer,\" or a Pteranodon, Petrie gets scared very easily and is too trusting, but he is loyal and can be brave at important times. He lives with his mother and brothers.\n\nSpike: Spike is the youngest of the group. He is a \"Spiketail,\" which is a Stegosaurus. Spike does not talk, though it was shown in the 4th movie that he can when he wants to. He enjoys eating and lets Ducky sit on his back if she needs to. Ducky is his older sister, since she adopted him during the first movie. He lives with Ducky's family.\n\nAlso of note is a \"Sharptooth\" named Chomper, who was born in the 2nd movie and was so popular with fans that he returned in the 5th movie and the TV series. He is friends with all the main characters, despite his natural instincts telling him to eat them.\n\n\nIn addition to the movies, there is \"The Land Before Time: Sing-Along Songs\" (1997) and \n\"The Land Before Time: More Sing-Along Songs\" (1999)\n\nAfter the success of the original movie and its sequels, a television series based on the movies began airing on YTV in Canada as a test on January 5, 2007. It aired in Canada, Britain, and the United States of America, and had 26 episodes. It then aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on March 5, 2007 where it was animated after the DVD release of \"The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers\". In the UK, it was once shown just on Boomerang, showing every day at 4pm, but it is now programmed on its sister preschool channel Cartoonito.

Many of the performances were \"\", that people did to amuse others. Others were more serious, and tried hard to perform well.\n\nMost of the acts made Barris and his staff laugh.

The show debuted in 1976, and became a hit.\n\nTwo versions of \"The Gong Show\" aired at first: A nighttime version, hosted by Gary Owens, and a daytime version, hosted by Barris himself. Barris later took over the nighttime version also. Each version worked the same, but featured different judges and performers. A live band played music for the performances. Live audiences attended each show, and cheered on the acts they liked. When they did not like an act, they would call on the judges to \"Gong 'em!\" If a judge sounded the gong, the act had to stop, and lost their chance for a prize. The performer who rated highest with the judges won a cash prize. (The \"prize\" was mostly for show; all the performers were paid the same, whether they won or not.)\n\nMany celebrities served as judges on the show, including Jaye P. Morgan and Jamie Farr. One well-known comedian, Murray Langston, performed on the show with a paper bag over his head. He called himself the \"Unknown Comic\", and told simple jokes when he appeared onstage. Langston won his round, and was invited back to appear other times. Many people wondered who the Unknown Comic really was. Langston later admitted he had appeared on the show just for some quick cash, because he needed money. He hid his identity so his performance would not hurt his comedy career, since he was already well-known.\n\nNo real stars were made by \"Gong Show\" appearances, but thousands of people got a chance to perform on national television, and others got the chance to watch. One popular member of the show's cast was \"Gene, Gene, the Dancing Machine\", who would dance in front of the show's band between acts. Barris himself was also well-liked by the audience. He treated all the performers on the show kindly and seriously, and hosted the show like it was a party.\n\nMany of the acts who auditioned for \"The Gong Show\" were not suitable for television, or for times when children or families might watch. Some of these acts appeared in a movie, which was released in 1980.\n\nIn time, new and unusual acts became hard to find, as more people performed on \"The Gong Show\". The television audience also lost interest. Barris was tired from working on the show. \"The Gong Show\" was cancelled by 1982. Reruns came later, but they also stopped with time.\n\nToday, \"The Gong Show\" is remembered fondly by the people who watched it. Amateur talent contests still sometimes feature a gong, for when an act does not go over well. (They are rarely used.)\n\nBarris wrote a , titled \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", that talked about his time on the show.\n", "id": "93385", "title": "The Gong Show"}

He was best known as the creator of many popular television game shows. Some of his most famous shows were \"The Dating Game\", \"The Newlywed Game\" and \"The Gong Show\". These shows appeared on American television from the mid-1960s until the early 1980s.\n\nBarris was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied at Drexel University.\n\nEarly in his career, Barris tried songwriting. One of his songs, \"Palisades Park\", was a hit record for Freddy Cannon, a popular singer.\n\nBarris got his start in television as a page and later staffer at NBC in New York, and eventually worked backstage at the TV music show \"American Bandstand\".\n\nBarris was promoted to the daytime programming division at ABC in Los Angeles and was put in charge of deciding which game shows ABC would air. Before long, Barris admitted to his bosses that he disliked all the shows he was given to choose from, and believed he could make better ones. They suggested that he quit his programming job and become a show producer himself.\n\nBarris first became successful during 1965 with his first game show creation \"The Dating Game\" on ABC. The next year Barris began \"The Newlywed Game\".\n\nHe went on to create several other short-lived games for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, all of which revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and oftentimes, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, or anger of female contestants or participants in the game. \n\nBarris became a public figure in a big way in 1976, when he produced - and served as the host of the talent contest spoof \"The Gong Show\", which he packaged in partnership with TV producer Chris Bearde. The show's cult stature far outstripped the two years it spent on NBC (1976-78) and the four years it ran in syndication (1976-1980).\n\nAfter \"The Gong Show\" went off the air, Barris kept a lower , but still worked in television. In the 1980s, he published a , \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\". Barris claimed in the book to have been a CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) agent and assassin, who regretted his earlier life. He also regretted making \"\" television shows, that to poor taste. It was republished in the 1990s.\n\nMany people believe \"Confessions\" does not tell a true story. Others are not sure if it is fact or fiction. Some, including celebrities who knew Barris, do not know or care, and enjoy his stories as entertainment. The CIA itself denies Barris ever worked for them.\n\nGeorge Clooney made \"Confessions\" into a movie, starring Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts.\n\nBarris was married to Lyn Levy from 1957 until they divorced in 1976. He later married Robin Altman from 1980 until they divorced in 1999. He later married Mary Rudolph in 2000. Barris had one child with Levy.\n\nBarris died on March 21, 2017 of natural causes at his home in Palisades, New York at the age of 87.\n\n", "id": "93398", "title": "Chuck Barris"}

He reigned from AD 37. After only four years, he was assassinated by members of his bodyguard and the Roman Senate. During his reign, many innocent people were killed without fair trials. Even with all that, he was popular with the Roman public in his time.\n\nCaligula's father Germanicus was the nephew and adopted son of emperor Tiberius. He was a very successful general. He was one of Rome's most beloved public figures. \n\nWhen Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD, his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children. She had a bitter feud with Tiberius. That eventually led to the destruction of her family. Caligula was the only male survivor. In 31, he joined the emperor on the island of Capri. Tiberius had gone there five years earlier. When Tiberius died in 37, Caligula became emperor.\n\nThere are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign. He is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane tyrant. \n\nCaligula worked to give more authority to the emperor. He put a lot of his effort into ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself. He started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the \"Aqua Claudia\" and the \"Anio Novus\". During his reign, the empire took over the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province.\n\nIn early 41, Caligula was assassinated. There was a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard, members of the Roman Senate and members of the imperial court. After Caligula's death, the conspirators' tried to bring back the Roman Republic, but they were unsuccessful. The Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle Claudius emperor in his place.\n\nThere are stories about Caligula that show cruelty and insanity. He was accused of killing just for amusement. He was accused of committing incest with his sisters and prostituting them with other men. He was accused of turning the palace into a brothel. \n\nCaligula appeared in public dressed as various gods. He demanded to be worshipped as a god. He appointed a horse to the priesthood.\n\nIt is difficult to know anything for certain about Caligula. Only two sources from his time still exist. Those are the works of Philo and Seneca. They give mostly anecdotes. At one time, there were detailed histories on Caligula. Now they are lost. Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an autobiography which certainly had a lot of information about Caligula's reign. It is also lost.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93639", "text": "Respiratory system\n\nThe respiratory system, also called the gas exchange system, is the body getting rid of carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, goes out of the body. Oxygen, which the body needs, comes in. \n\nThe first step in this process is breathing in air, or inhaling. The taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body is called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide from the body is called exhalation. The second step is gas exchange in the lungs where oxygen is diffused into the blood and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood. The third process is cellular respiration, which produces the chemical energy that the cells in the body need, and carbon dioxide. Finally, the carbon dioxide from cellular respiration is breathed out of body from the lungs.\n\nFor respiration to happen, the body needs a constant supply of oxygen, which is done by breathing. Inhalation is the breathing in of air. To inhale, the lungs expand, decreasing the air pressure in the lungs. This is caused by the diaphragm (a sheet of muscular tissue that separates the lungs from the abdomen) and the muscles between the ribs contracting to expand the chest, which also expands the lungs. As the air pressure inside the lungs are lower when it has expanded, air from outside at higher pressure comes rushing into the area of low pressure in the lungs. Air first passes through the nose and mouth, then through the larynx (voice box), then down the trachea (windpipe), and into the lungs and comes out\n\nThe lungs are made of many tubes or branches. As air enters the lungs, it first goes through branches called the bronchi, then through smaller branches called bronchioles, and finally into the air sacs. Gas exchange occurs in the air sacs where oxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide in the air sacs now need to be exhaled, or breathed out. In the reverse process to inhaling, the diaphragm and the rib muscles relax, causing the lungs to be smaller. As the air pressure in the lungs is greater when the lungs are smaller, air is forced out. The exhaled air has a high concentration of carbon dioxide and a low concentration of oxygen. The maximum volume of air that can be inhaled and exhaled is called the vital capacity of the lungs and is up to five liters.\n\nThe inhaled air goes down to the air sacs at the end of each bronchiole. The air sacs are called alveoli — they have a large surface area, and are moist, thin, and close to a blood supply. The inhaled air has a much greater concentration of oxygen than carbon dioxide whilst the blood flowing to the lungs has a more carbon dioxide than oxygen. This creates a concentration gradient between the air in the air sacs and the blood, meaning there is more oxygen in the air than the blood. As the membrane, oxygen can easily diffuse in and out. Oxygen at high concentration in the air sacs diffuses into the blood where oxygen concentration is low, and carbon dioxide at high concentration in the blood diffuses into the air sacs where carbon dioxide concentration is low. The oxygen in the blood enters the circulatory system and is used by the cells in the body. The carbon dioxide in the air sacs are exhaled out of the body.\n\n", "id": "93639", "title": "Respiratory system"}

It is a machine that makes large pressure increases inside a sealed box (cylinder). The pressure increase pushes a rod which is attached to a wheel. The rod pushes the wheel and makes it spin around. The spinning wheel is attached to other wheels, such as four car wheels, with a belt or a chain. The engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move. \n\nEngines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick. Parts of a car engine are measured to 0.01 of a millimeter and some engine parts fit together very tightly.\n\nInternal differs from external combustion where the fire is outside the engine, such as a steam engine. \n\nMost road vehicles use the internal combustion engine today, and most of those use the four-stroke engine. Rocket and jet engines are combustion engines but they do not turn wheels. The fire in their combustion chamber pushes gases rapidly out the back, which pushes the rocket forward.\n\nAnother type of internal combustion engine is the Wankel engine.\n", "id": "93641", "title": "Internal combustion engine"}

The arena is home of the New York Knicks NBA team and the New York Rangers of the NHL. It also is the site of many concerts and special events each year and a few college basketball games are played there There have been four arenas with the name Madison Square Garden at three different sites in Manhattan. The first was an open-air arena built in 1879 at East 26th Street and Madison Avenue, also known as Madison Square. It was torn down and replaced with an indoor arena at the same site in 1890. The third MSG, on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, opened in 1925. The current Madison Square Garden opened in 1968. It is at 4 Penn Plaza, close to the intersection of 8th Avenue & 33rd Street in Manhattan, New York City. Was named after 4th President of the United States of America.\n\nThe arena has six sections of seats. One of them is not open if hockey is played, because a hockey rink is larger than a basketball court. The other sections used to have different colors. There were red, orange, yellow, brown and blue seats. However, the fans of the New York Rangers only wanted to sit in the blue seats. They did not want to use any of the other sections. They even did not let other fans use the blue seats. For this reason, the MSG does not use these colors today. The most active fans sit in the section 400.\n\nThe number of people who can visit the arena changes. If hockey is played and the first section is taken out to make room for the rink, 18,200 people may be there. For basketball, 19,763 people can watch.

This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\n\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now called Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\n\n", "id": "93704", "title": "List of tallest buildings in the world"}

The band's five albums have sold more than 17.5 million in the United States alone and more than 30 million albums worldwide. The band had fifteen top ten singles, or songs sold on their own, on the Billboard rock charts, including six #1's, and one #1 album on the pop charts (1994's \"Purple\"). In 1994, the band won a Grammy for \"Best Hard Rock Performance\" for their song \"Plush\". Stone Temple Pilots were also ranked at #40 by VH1 on the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock list. \n\nThe band released the greatest-hits album \"Thank You\" in 2003. The band then fell apart. Since the band's end, Weiland moved on to become the frontman of Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N' Roses. The DeLeo brothers started the band Army of Anyone with Richard Patrick from the band Filter. Army of Anyone released its first album in 2006, which was also called \"Army of Anyone\".

It performs most of its concerts at the Avery Fisher Hall in New York.\n\nThe orchestra started in 1842. At that time it was called the Philharmonic Society. At its first concert the orchestra played a very long programme which included Beethoven’s \"Symphony No. 5\" conducted by Ureli Corelli Hill. The musicians worked as a cooperative or \"communistic\" society. This meant that the musicians themselves made up the rules about how the orchestra should be run: who would become a member, which music would be performed, and who would conduct. At the end of each season they divided any money the orchestra had earned amongst themselves.\n\nThe orchestra were a great success, but they needed a new concert hall. They gave a fund-raising concert which included Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\". It was the first time it had ever been played in America. The concert took place in Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan. There were about 400 performers in the orchestra and choir. The words that the choir sings were translated into English. It was the first time this work had been sung in English anywhere in the world. However, the tickets cost a lot of money: US$2.00 each, so not so many people came. It was some time before the orchestra got their concert hall. Many people thought Beethoven's 9th symphony was a strange piece of music because the choir only sing in the last movement which is called \"Ode to Joy\". In 1865 Theodore Eisfeld conducted the Orchestra’s memorial concert for the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln, but the last movement was not performed because it was thought that the \"Ode to Joy\" was not suitable for the sad occasion.\n\nLeopold Damrosch, who had been Franz Liszt's concertmaster at Weimar, was the orchestra’s conductor for the 1876-1877 season. But the public did not like him, so he started his own orchestra: the Symphony Society of New York. When he died in 1885, his 23-year-old son Walter Johannes Damrosch took over and continued the competition with the old Philharmonic. It was Walter who would make the rich Scotsman Andrew Carnegie realize that New York needed a really good concert hall and on May 5, 1891 both Walter and the Russian composer Tchaikovsky conducted at the first concert of the city's new Music Hall. A few years later this new hall was renamed Carnegie Hall after the man who gave the money for it to be built.\n\nTheodore Thomas began conducting the Philharmonic in 1877 and made it a very good orchestra. In 1891 Thomas left New York to found the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAnton Seidl conducted the orchestra until 1898. Seidl had worked as Wagner's assistant and was famous for conducting Wagner’s music. He gave the first performance of Antonín Dvořák's Ninth Symphony \"From the New World.\" Many people were sad when Seidl suddenly died in 1898 from food poisoning at the age of 47. Twelve thousand people applied for tickets to his funeral at the Metropolitan Opera House at 39th Street and Broadway and the streets were jammed with people and traffic.\n\nIn 1909 the orchestra was organized differently. Instead of a cooperative, they were run by a small group of people called . They persuaded Gustav Mahler to be principal conductor. Instead of 18 concerts a season they gave 54, which included a tour of New England. Mahler was used to conducting opera, but now he could conduct symphonies, and he introduced audiences to his own compositions. During his time the orchestra were given regular salaries for the first time.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1920, the Philharmonic's conductor was Josef Stransky, who led every single one of the orchestra's concerts during this period.\n\nWhen the Philharmonic joined together with the National Symphony in 1921, they had the Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg. He stayed there for nine years, although other conductors, including Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Igor Stravinsky, and Arturo Toscanini, led about half the concerts. They started to have an outdoor symphony series, playing low-priced summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in upper Manhattan. In 1920 the orchestra hired Henry Hadley as \"associate conductor\" to perform concerts which included works by American composers.\n\nIn 1924, the Young People's Concerts were started, and soon grew to 15 concerts per season by the end of the 1920s. They started to make recordings. In 1928 they joined together with another orchestra, the New York Symphony Society. Toscanini conducted the newly organized orchestra, and continued until 1936.\n\nThe English conductor John Barbirolli and the Pole Artur Rodzinski, were joint replacements for Toscanini in 1936. The next year Barbirolli was made the main conductor, a post he held until the spring of 1941. In 1943, Rodzinski became conductor. He had also been conducting on the Sunday afternoon radio broadcast when CBS listeners around the country heard the announcer break in on Arthur Rubinstein's performance of Brahms's Second Piano Concerto to tell them about the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nArtur Rodzinski, Bruno Walter, and Sir Thomas Beecham made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records during the 1940s.\n\nLeopold Stokowski and Dimitri Mitropoulos were the orchestra’s two conductors in 1949, with Mitropoulos becoming conductor in 1951. Mitropoulos often conducted new music and music that was not well known. In 1957, Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein served together as Principal Conductors until, in the course of the season, Bernstein was made conductor, becoming the first American-born-and-trained conductor of the Philharmonic.\n\nLeonard Bernstein was Music Director for 11 seasons. Many new things happened during this time. Two television series were started on CBS: the \"Young People's Concerts\" and \"Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.\" The first of these started in 1958. It was a new idea and it won every award for educational television. Bernstein continued the orchestra's recordings with Columbia Records until he retired as music director in 1969. He got lots of composers, especially American composers such as Aaron Copland, to write new works for the orchestra.\nIn 1971 Pierre Boulez became the first Frenchman to have the job of conductor of the Philharmonic. Boulez had new ideas about music to be performed. He was a composer himself and often performed modern music.\n\nZubin Mehta became conductor in 1978. He, too, conducted a lot of new music. \nKurt Masur, who had often been conducting the Philharmonic since 1981, became conductor in 1991. During his time he included a series of free Memorial Day Concerts at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and annual concert tours abroad that included the orchestra's first trip to mainland China. His stayed until 2002, and was then given the honorary title “Music Director Emeritus of the Philharmonic”.\n\nOn 26 February 2008 the Philharmonic gave a concert in Pyongyang in North Korea. It was the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that there had been an important cultural visit from the United States to North Korea.\n\nIn September 2002, 60 years after conducting the Orchestra at the age of twelve at Lewisohn Stadium, Lorin Maazel became conductor of the Philharmonic. In his first subscription week he conducted the first ever performance of John Adams' \"On the Transmigration of Souls\". This work had been composed in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. He performed new music as well as music of the well-known composers. He will stay with the orchestra until the end of the 2008-2009 season.\n\n", "id": "93797", "title": "New York Philharmonic"}

The smaller English army won against the much larger French army. New tactics and weapons make this an important battle in the history of warfare because the English used longbows to win against French knights. The longbow was a faster weapon to fire than the French and Genoan crossbow and could send arrows farther than the crossbow could and with more force. Before this battle during the Middle Ages, knights had been the most important part of an army. Because of this change some historians call this battle the beginning of the end of chivalry.\n\nIn the battle, the French knights, protected by chainmail reinforced with metal plate, were nearly exhausted by charging several miles into the battle (against their king's wishes). Their horses had to walk through deep mud and charge up a hill into English and Welsh arrow storm. They were cut down. Many French nobles died.\nThe knights' horses were barely protected at all. The storm of arrows killed or disabled the knights' mounts, and left the knights floundering in the mud on foot beneath a hail of arrows.\n\nThe bolts (heavy arrows) of the Genoese crossbowmen at the forefront of the battle could not reach the English. They fell short because the crossbow strings were wet. The archers had also misjudged the range and shot too early and too low. The English, controlling the high ground, were able to run a short distance down the hill and pick off the Genoese with volleys of arrows. As the Genoese attempted to retreat, they were cut down by the French knights, who thought the withdrawal was cowardly. This wasted the first charge of French cavalry, and left them disorganized for the charge on the English.\n\nIn a strong defensive position, Edward III ordered that everyone fight on foot. He split the army in three divisions, one commanded by his sixteen-year-old son, Edward, the Black Prince. The archers were set in a 'V-formation' along the top of the hill. While they waited, the English built a system of ditches, pits and caltrops, to hurt and bring down the enemy cavalry.\n", "id": "93836", "title": "Battle of Crécy"}

The German constitution (the Grundgesetz) lists the five levels of government and says what each level should do. \n\nThe five levels are:\n\nSome states have \"regierungsbezirke\" which are a group of counties and cities in an area to help run certain tasks across the area.\n\nOther states have \"Amt\" which is a collection of municipalities in a district usually because the municipalities themselves are too small to run many services\n\nRegierungsbezirke and Ämte are not guaranteed by the constitution, they are a way of helping the various levels of government to do their job.\n\nThe idea of subsidiarity means that government jobs should be done by the lowest possible level.\n\nThere are two types of tasks (jobs) for a municipality. \"Voluntary\" which a town or municipality can do if it wants, and \"mandatory\" or things which must be done because of a federal or state law.\n\nSetting up a theatre, a museum, a sports field or a meeting hall is a voluntary task. If the municipality can afford to set these things up, the \"Land\" cannot stop them. Also the \"Land\" cannot order the municipality to set these things up.\n\nThe mandatory self-government tasks are things which a municipality must do itself, or must arrange to be done on its behalf. For example one of the most important jobs of any local council is to providing the citizens with water, electricity, district heating, gas as well as wastewater services and waste removal.\n\nA council could run its own waterworks or join with others to share a larger facility. Modern electricity supply means that a council does not have to run their own power station anymore. But they must help private companies get the electricity supply to local houses and factories.\n\nAlthough the Federation or state might have the right to control some things, the idea of subsidiarity means that they are \"administered\" (carried out) at the lowest possible level. For example, marriage ceremonies and issuing birth and death certificates are arranged by the town registrar, the Federation and the Land arrange legal and expert supervision so that the task is done properly and is the same across Germany.\n\nOther transferred tasks include:\n\n\nWho runs the town or district government depends on where in Germany the town is.\n\nThe town council, or town council meeting is responsible for all jobs not given to the \"magistrat\". The magistrat is the executive responsible for administering services. It is chosen by the town council, and can have both professional and honorary members. The mayor is head of the magistrate, but not of the town council meeting. The mayor is chosen separately by the people not the council. the system is only used in Hesse. It is the oldest system, and the only system where a group of elected people are responsible for the administration, instead of just one, the mayor.\n\nThe mayor is head of the council and the administration.\n\nPower is split between the mayor and the town clerk. The mayor has some functions, but day to day administration is done by the professional town clerk.\n\nUsed in Bavaria and the old eastern länder. The mayor is elected by the people, and he heads the council and the town government. The council is responsible for nearly all decisions. Some decisions are taken by the mayor. The council may give some of its tasks to the mayor, in which case they cannot change the mayor's decision.\n\nUrban districts of Germany\nRural Districts of Germany\n", "id": "93878", "title": "Local government in Germany"}

For thousands of years, people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children. However, Mendel's work was different because he did experiments on plants, and designed those experiments very carefully. \n\nIn his experiments, Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants. He started his crosses with plants that bred true, and counted characters that were either/or in nature (either \"tall\" or \"short\"). He bred large numbers of plants, and expressed his results numerically. He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters.\n\nMendel's laws apply widely, but not to all living things. They apply to any organism which is diploid (has two paired sets of chromosomes) and which engages in sexual reproduction. They would not apply to bacteria, for example, or to asexual reproduction. They do apply to the great majority of plants and animals.\n\nMendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws:\n\nMendel's laws explained the results he got with his pea plants. Later, geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things, even humans. Mendel's findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics. His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered. Mendel's care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments.\n\n\n", "id": "93899", "title": "Mendelian inheritance"}

In 2004 he was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest person who has been to all the countries in the world. In 2006/2007 he worked for the UN.\n\nMaurizio Giuliano was born on 24 February 1975 in Milan, Italy, with a lawyer as a father and a housewife as a mother. He lived in Cuba, Chile, and Indonesia, among other countries. As of 2004, he knew eight languages according to one source, while another source specified that he \"spoke\" five and had a \"passion\" for two more.\n\nHe went to school in Milan and Manchester, and then studied at the University of Oxford in 1996 and the University of Cambridge in 1997. At Oxford, he studied at University College to know about Oxford's inter-disciplinary course in \"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics\" (PPE), especially Latin America and eastern Europe.\n\nAs of 1998, he was a research fellow at the Centre for Social Studies (CESOC) in Santiago, Chile.\n\nHe wrote two books and some articles on Cuban politics, especially on the US embargo (which usually stops Americans from doing business with Cubans), which he thinks (in the book \"\"La Transición Cubana y el \"Bloqueo\" Norteamericano\"\" and other works) is not good.\n\nIn an article published in the British academic journal \"Democratization\" in 1998, he focused in particular on how the US embargo against Cuba helps create \"empathy\" by third parties towards Cuba, so that Cubans think it is support for Cuba's government. So he argued that the US Government – in addition to the embargo's direct influence on supporting Cuba's regime – indirectly interferes with the possibility of improving Cuba. That is because third countries, foreign non-governmental organizations and prominent individuals lend support to Cuba's resistance to the US embargo, and this offsets external pressures for democracy, thereby allowing the Cuban regime to convert such \"empathy\" into a source of legitimacy at home.\n\nHis scholarly work on internal Cuban politics, notably on the 1996 purge of Havana's Centre for American Studies (CEA) (contained in the book \"\"El Caso CEA\"\" published in 1998), has been the object of academic reviews, as it exposed the internal conflicts between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intelligentsia (most intelligent people), previously unknown.\nAccording to some reviews, the book, a work of investigative journalism helped by academic analysis, dealt a strong blow to hard-liners within the regime,\nby exposing for the first time the internal conflicts between Cuba's apparatus and its intelligentsia.\nIn 2001, Cuban exiled scholars Alberto Álvarez and Gerardo González, who were among those purged from the CEA, wrote the book \"\"¿ Intelectuales vs. Revolución ? El caso del Centro de Estudios sobre América\"\", which strongly built upon Giuliano's book to offer further insights on relations between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intellectuals.\n\nBesides work on Cuba, other countries Giuliano covered in his journalistic work include East Timor and Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).\n\nIn 2000, he visited North Korea and published an essay about his visit, essentially describing his tour around the country as being like a movie made by the North Korean authorities.\n\nIn his journalistic work, he reportedly ran into problems with the authorities of at least two countries. In 1998, he was denied entry to Myanmar after making contact with the National League for Democracy and taking photos of its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. And on 30 October 2002, he was reportedly detained and manhandled by Israeli authorities while crossing the Allenby Bridge.\n\nGiuliano's writings have also included lighter topics. During his time in Kabul, for example, he wrote restaurant reviews for a local English-language magazine.\nIn the early 2000s, Giuliano was a consultant for the Italian Senate's Committee on Human Rights. At that time, at least some of his writings were also intended to influence the positions of the Italian Government on certain human rights issues, as was the case with material that he wrote on North Korea.\n\nIn 2004, Giuliano worked for the International Organization for Migration in the elections for Afghan refugees in Pakistan,\nand in 2005 worked in Afghanistan for the United Nations Development Programme.\nIn both cases, he was working in the field of communications with the media.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2008, he served with the United Nations, again in the field of media relations, in the Central African Republic,\nSudan,\nChad,\nand Cameroon following the refugee crisis caused by the battle of N'Djamena of February 2008.\nAccording to the Guinness Book, through his work, he had travelled to every single sovereign country in the world (which totalled 193 according to the Guinness Book) by 20 February 2004, aged 28 years and 361 days. He claimed that he had visited a total of up to 238 territories (including the 193 sovereign countries recognized by Guinness), and stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) had been the hardest country to get into, after numerous attempts and long waits to get a visa.\n\nHe started travelling at age 14, and believes that, as of 2004, he had travelled at least two million miles, including on the Trans-Siberian Railway and through 11 round-the-world air journeys. Some of his earliest journeys were to Albania and Sierra Leone in 1991, aged 16, and to Mongolia in 1992 for their national festivities Naadam. Most of his later travels were related to his journalistic work.\n\nOn 20 February 2004 he visited Suriname, thereby completing his visit to all sovereign nations of the world. He held a press conference there on 24 February, where he stated that he had chosen Suriname to complete his record, as the country had always fascinated him due to its richness and variety in cultures and ethnicities.\nHe then travelled from Suriname to London, with 42 passports (of which 30 were Italian and 12 British) filled with immigration stamps, in order to prove his record to Guinness World Records.\n\nHe claimed that most of his travels were unrelated to the record, and that only since 2001, on the suggestion of friends, did he have the Guinness Record in mind when planning his travels. In explaining his record, however, he stated that he might have an \"addiction to crossing borders\".\n\n", "id": "93932", "title": "Maurizio Giuliano"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93934", "text": "Aang\n\nAang is a fictional character and the main hero in Nickelodeon's television series \"\". The character was made by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen. He has take part in all the episodes of \"Avatar\", except \"Zuko Alone\" (7th episode of ). Aang is also in the first episode, \"The Boy In The Iceberg\". Aang appears in other media, like trading cards (a card that is collected), video games, T-shirts, and web comics.\n\nAang is the last Airbender. They were the only race of people who could control the air. He is 112 years old. He has not become older because he had been frozen in an iceberg for 100 years, and is still like a 12 year old, because he used Avatar State to protect himself and his bison. In the second show, it is discovered that Aang is the living form of the Avatar. This is the spirit of the planet in human form. As the Avatar, Aang controls the elements and must keep the Four Nations at peace. The show follows Aang's journeys to do this.\n\nMost of Aang's habits, such as vegetarianism, are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition. Aang is the series' unwilling hero. He shows hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation. His \"lighthearted\" personality has been praised by critics. The creators wanted Aang to \"win enemies with his wits\" and be a \"trickster hero\".\n\nAang's character was created by Bryan Konietzko. The sketch showed a middle-aged man with an arrow on his head. Konietzko changed the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison. At the same time, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole. The idea caused the pair to think:\nThe plot they described relates with the first and second episodes of the series, where the \"water people\" (Katara and Sokka) find the \"air guy\" (Aang) while \"trapped in a snowy wasteland\" (the Southern Water Tribe) with \"some fire people [that] are pressing down on them\" (Fire Navy and Zuko). The creators of the show made Aang to be frozen in an iceberg for 1000 years. He was to wake inside a futuristic world, where he would have a robot named Momo and a flying bison named Appa. The creators lost interest in the theme, and changed it to 100 years of suspended animation. The robotic Momo was changed to a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.\n\nAang's character has a well grown cultural belief. According to the show's creators, \"\"Avatar\" based on the belief of Buddhism and Taoism.\" A important part of the character is his vegetarian diet, regular with Buddhism or Taoism. In the Brahmajala Sutra, a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged. In \"The King of Omashu\" (the 5th episode of first season), Aang shows his vegetarian beliefs by refusing to eat meat. Aang shows a reluctance to fight and an dislike of killing. In \"The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)\", Aang gets into a fight with an angry spirit who is destroying a village because the people burned his home (one forest). Instead of fighting the spirit, Aang talks with it. \n\nAirbending, the element that Aang mainly uses in the show, is based on Baguazhang, an \"internal\" Chinese martial art. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves. These characteristics were meant to show the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show.<ref name=\"avatar2/index.jhtml\"></ref>\n\nIn the episode \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\" (the 15th episode of ), Aang’s name was written as (ān áng) in Chinese.\n\nThe creators of the show call each a \"book\" and each episode a \"chapter\"; each of these books was take the name of element that Aang must control, except the air. Flashbacks also reveal events that happened before the show opened. In a flashback during \"The Storm\", Aang remembered the day when elder monks told him that he was the Avatar. Monk Gyatso, Aang's teacher and father-figure, said that Aang must be raised as a normal child. Nearing the end, the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much, so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple. Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor; he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison, Appa. It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and sends him into the ocean during his escape. Aang then enters the Avatar State, unknowingly, for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble. An image of this air bubble, resembling an iceberg, ends the flashback.\n\nAfter the 100 years he was in the iceberg with his bison, the story starts when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the . In the next episode, they all started the trip to the Northern Water Tribe, with hope to find a waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control the water. During their journey they are chased by Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who must capture the Avatar to return his honor. In one episode, Aang meets his previous incarnation, Avatar Roku (born on Fire Nation), who said him that he must learn all four bending arts and win Fire Lord Ozai before the end of summer. When the team, named team \"Avatar\", arrived in the Northern Water Tribe, a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang (and later Katara) waterbending. Later, in the , Aang meets Toph Bei Fong, a blind earthbending, who becomes his earthbending teacher. Later, Aang and his friends learn about the solar eclipse, which will occur before the end of the summer, and will block the Firebenders powerless. During the season finale, a guru tried to teach Aang how to open up his seven \"chakras\" in order to control the Avatar State. When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger, he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh \"chakra\" is opened, locking it. He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se. He is killed when Azula strikes him with lightning, but is brought back to life thanks to Katara's special water that has healing abilities, and also her healing abilities.\n\nIn the , Aang and his friends had to win a new enemy - an killer hired by Zuko who shoots with his third eye. Aang and his friends from Earth Kingdom attack the Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse, but the invasion failed because Azula knew about it. In the next episode, Zuko offers to teach Aang firebending. Aang accepts, despite the group's strong opposition. In \"The Firebending Masters\" (the 13th episode of third season) Aang learns firebending with the help of the last two dragons.\n\nBefore the , he is trapped with his friends because he does not find correct he kills Ozai. After he sleepwalks into a forest, he speaks with four previous Avatars (Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen), and asking for advice. Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord Ozai, discouraging him. After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion-turtle, and receiving advice from said lion-turtle, he prepares to confront the Fire Lord. Once Ozai arrives, Aang engages him in battle. After sparing Ozai when redirecting his lightning and then being backed into a corner, Aang enters the Avatar State. The Avatar State tips the battle in Aang's favor, and makes swift work of Ozai. Using a technique taught to him by the lion-turtle, which called Energybending, Aang removes Ozai's ability to firebend, effectively eliminating the threat. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen in monk robes, standing beside Zuko while he become Fire Lord. He is later seen relaxing with his friends in Ba Sing Se. The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing.\n\nMichael Dante DiMartino, one of the show's creators, said:\nAang is a vegetarian, as shown in \"The King of Omashu\" (the 5th episode of first season) and \"The Headband\" (the 2nd episode of third season) when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that life is holy. Aang states a reluctance to fight in \"The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)\"; Aang hopelessly negotiates with a spirit who is destroying a village instead of fighting. Due to his non-violent nature, he also shows ethical reluctance refusing to killing Firelord Ozai, and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him. In the show, Aang has a complex network of friends extending over all four nations.\n\nAang, in \"The Storm\" (the 12th episode of first season), said that he wishes he had been there to help Air Nomads a century ago, but would rather live a child's carefree life. Many times in the show, Aang shows how much he cares for those are close to him. He also showed that he can act immaturely, and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together. In \"Bato of the Water Tribe\" (the 15th episode of first season), Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father. Aang hides the map showing their father's whereabouts and lies about having it in the first place.\n\nIn some episodes, he shows flight abilities with airbending. One technique for this is to make a sphere of air and ride on it, which Aang calls the Air Scooter. Other methods of flying include his glider, and Appa. In the Avatar State, Aang can also fly inside a ball of air.\n\nIn the show's intended demographics, Aang has been received very well. Kendall Lyons said that, \"Aang seems to be the happy kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with\", and that he \"seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or trouble situations.\" There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a childlike character who is \"reckless and excitable\". Reviews point out that \"as the Avatar, Aang seems unstoppable, but as Aang, he is just another like an airbender\". The review says later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by showing many weaknesses in his character.\n\nAang's character showed in the \"\". He is 1 of the 4 characters of , a video game based on the first season of the show. Two sequels were made: \"\", a video game based on the second season of the show, and \"\", a video game based on the third season. Avatar T-shirts, some with Aang's face on them, are being sold on the Nickelodeon Shop website. Tokyopop has published a films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga), in which Aang is the main character, like in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\".\n\nAang is in \"Escape from the Spirit World\", an online video game that is on Nickelodeon's real website. The game has some plot changes that are not in the show. The show's directors, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, say the events are canon.\n\nIn 2008, M. Night Shyamalan, a film director, cast 12-year-old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series, \"The Last Airbender\". The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily Caucasian cast) in the Asian-influenced \"Avatar\" universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras.

It is named after the two heroes of the games. Right now, five games are in the series.\n\nAll of the \"Jak and Daxter\" games happen on a planet that is similar to Earth, where many creatures who look like humans with long ears live. A long time ago, beings called \"Precursors\" lived on the planet, but disappeared, and the people use the machines the Precursors left behind. Outside of cities and villages, there are many wild and dangerous animals.\n\nA substance called \"Eco\" is also used by the people. It can be found as gas, liquid, or even solid crystals. There are several different kinds of Eco, and all the different Ecos can do special things. Green Eco can heal injuries or damage, and Blue Eco can make things move faster. There is also Dark Eco, a dangerous kind of Eco which can kill or mutate. In the first \"Jak and Daxter\" game, \"\", the character Daxter falls into a pit full of Dark Eco and turns into an \"Ottsel\", a fictional, or not real, cross between an otter and a weasel.\n\nWhen Naughty Dog first told people about \"Jak and Daxter\", people were very excited, because Naughty Dog had made the famous \"Crash Bandicoot\" series. \"Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy\" was one of the first video games to use something called streaming, which means that the game loads while it is being played, so there are no loading screens. It was also very similar to the games \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Banjo-Kazooie\", because players need to jump, explore, and collect a special kind of object to win the game.\n\nAfter \"The Precursor Legacy\", the \"Jak and Daxter\" games started to be about other things, not just jumping and finding things. \"Jak II\", the second game, gives the player guns to shoot and vehicles to drive. This is like in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" video games.\n\nThe first three games of the \"Jak\" series; \"Precursor Legacy\", \"Jak II\", and \"Jak 3\"; are still mainly about platforming. The player controls the character Jak or the character Daxter in jumping puzzles to get to a goal. The character can only get hit by wild animals or monsters only a few times before dying and having to start the goal over, but the character can get life back by touching Green Eco. In \"Jak 3\", the player can get armor that lets Jak be hit more before dying.\n\nThe player can also use attacks or guns to kill the monsters before Jak or Daxter is hit and hurt.\n", "id": "93950", "title": "Jak and Daxter"}

The Buick Opel which was originally an Isuzu Gemini and was also offered to future GM marque Daewoo as the Maepsy (which was sold as a Saehan and later Daewoo model). Geo cars were a joint venture between GM and its Japanese partners which included Toyota, Suzuki and Isuzu. Chevrolet's revived Nova (the Corolla Sprinter) led to Chevrolet Sprint (Suzuki Cultus) and the Spectrum (Isuzu Gemini). All three cars were rebranded as Geo in 1989. Geo was cancelled in 1997 and merged into the Chevrolet brand. The Geo models were the Metro, Prizm, Storm, Tracker, and Spectrum. The Prizm was made at New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. which was jointly owned by Toyota and General Motors. While the Metro and Tracker were made at CAMI Automotive a joint venture between GM and Suzuki, and the Storm and Spectrum were made entirely in Japan by Isuzu, and because of dwindling Isuzu sales they were short-lived.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93978", "text": "Malware\n\nMalware, short for malicious software, is a kind of software that can be installed on a computer without approval from the computer's owner. There are different kinds of malware that can hurt computers, such as viruses and spyware. These programs can steal passwords, delete files, collect personal information, or even stop a computer from working at all. Computer security or anti-malware software is usually good at stopping malware from installing itself. When security software is not installed, malware can get into the computer. Getting rid of malware can be difficult, even when using programs designed to remove it.\n\nPeople first started writing malware in the 1970s and early 1980s. Computers were very simple then. They did not have any interesting information for malware to take. Instead, people wrote malware for fun or just to show that they could. Even the most common piece of malware from this time did not do damage to people's computers. In fact, malware was so rare that the word \"malware\" was not coined until 1990. \n\nMore people started using the computers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Computers were getting more complex just as fast. People saw that they could use malware to get useful information now, like passwords and credit card information. So, more programmers started writing malware. The number of malware programs on the Internet has grown very quickly ever since then the late 1990s and is still growing today. Experts think that 31.5% of the world's computers have some type of malware installed.\n\nThe main reason people write malware is to hurt others and make money, usually by stealing or deleting important information. The Cryptolocker computer virus, for example, makes it so a person cannot use their own computer until they pay the malware writers for a software key to unlock it. Another virus, CIH, tries to make it so the victim can never use their files or turn on their computer again. Malicious keystroke logging software remembers everything a user types in and gives it to the malware author to read.\n\nWorld governments have written malware to hurt their enemies. Experts think that the United States government made a virus named Stuxnet to stop an important place in Iran from working. The Chinese government probably used a virus to stop people from protesting its decisions.\n\nThere are a lot of ways malware can get onto someone's computer. One common way is through email attachments. These attachments are usually sent from other computers that already have malware on them. When someone downloads and opens the attachment, the virus installs and uses their computer to send itself to even more people. \n\nAnother way malware installs itself is when a victim gets malware just by going to a website with the malware hidden on it. This is called drive-by downloading. A user does not have to click anything for their computer to get infected from a drive-by download. This kind of malware attack is usually found on websites that are not used a lot or whose security methods are very old. However, even current websites that people use all the time can host drive-by downloads when someone hacks the site. \n\nPeople who write malware also get their programs onto computers by attaching them to real programs that people want. This is most common with pirated programs. This is because the downloader was doing something illegal and cannot complain to the authorities without getting in trouble themselves. However, some non-piracy websites also put malware (or other unwanted programs that are almost as bad as malware) in a download with real, legal software in a process known as bundling. Computer security experts complain about websites that bundle real software with malware. Their complaints do not always stop the websites from bundling.\n\nThere are many different kinds of malware. Each acts a different way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons why computers get programs a user didn't mean to install. One common reason is because of regular programs that have software bugs. Malware can use bugs, such as a buffer overflow, to make a program do something it was not designed to do. Malware can also get onto a computer if it tricks a user into putting it there themselves. This can happen when a user plugs in a USB flash drive that has a virus on it already. Malware also commonly uses social engineering to get users to run it, like pretending to be an important email attachment for work. Some malware even pretends to be an anti-malware program to get people to run it.\n\nSince malware is such a big problem, many companies make programs to try to stop it. These anti-malware programs have a lot of different ways to find malware. One is static analysis, which looks at the source code of a program before it is run. Then, if the program is similar to malware the static analysis program has seen before, the anti-malware program will stop the code from running. Another way of finding malware is dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis runs only part of a program it is checking. If this part of the program tries to do anything that could be bad or harmful, the anti-malware program will not let the program run.\n\nMalware can also be stopped without a program. This can be done by not letting a computer connect to the Internet or other computers, called creating an air gap. However, these computers can still get malware if someone puts it there another way. One example is when someone plugs in a USB drive that was already plugged into a computer with a virus.\n", "id": "93978", "title": "Malware"}

There are now 16,000 members of Matrixism.\n\nMatrixism is a syncretic religion (a religion that joins together all religions). The words \"the matrix\" are seen in a Baha'i book from the year 1912 named \"The Promulgation (starting) of Universal (complete international) Peace\". Matrixism uses this fact to make a connection to the history of world religion but the three \"Matrix\" motion pictures are Matrixism's Bible (prime book).\n\nMatrixism has four beliefs called \"The Four Tenets (rules) of Matrixism\". The four rules are; 1) Belief in the prophecy of the One. 2) Use of psychedelics (mind expansion medicine) as sacrament. 3) Seeing the relative nature of the world. 4) Acting by the rules of one of the world's religions. For Matrixism April 19th is a holiday (special day) named Bicycle Day. November 22nd is another holiday for Matrixism named the Day of Remembrance and Reflection. Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis all died on this day in 1963.\n\nThe sign for Matrixism is , the Japanese kanji for the word \"red\". This sign was used in the computer game \"Enter the Matrix\". The color is a reference to the \"red pill\", from the motion picture \"The Matrix\", which is representative of being able to see that which is true. The word (sign) 赤 is also a Chinese word (character). In fact, the Japanese kanji is from a Chinese character.\n", "id": "93982", "title": "Matrixism"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=94129", "text": "Carbon footprint\n\nThe term carbon footprint is how much carbon goes into the air because of something done by people or that is not done by nature. Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas in the smoke. Carbon dioxide has carbon in it. Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint, burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air, which is called a carbon footprint. Total carbon footprint/emission quantification would include energy emissions from human activities - that is, from heat, light, power and refrigeration and all transport related emissions from cars, freight and distribution\n\nOil, gas, and coal are called \"fossil fuels\" because they come from fossils of ancient plants and animals. Those plants and animals had carbon in them. So when we burn oil, gas, and coal, the carbon becomes carbon dioxide and goes into the air as smoke. This makes pollution. It also makes the greenhouse effect, which means that the carbon dioxide makes the earth warmer, like a greenhouse. A carbon footprint is the carbon dioxide that is put into the air because of a person, a group of people, an event or a product.\n\nThe words \"carbon footprint\" are often seen in the news. They are used with the word sustainability, which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen. That is, if there is too much of a carbon footprint, then there is no sustainability. People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air, and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming. This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car, because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas.\n\nThe most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse. Another easy option is to drive less. By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving, not only is a person going to save money on gas, but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere. However, if walking is not an option, one can look into carpooling use public transportation options in their area.\nYet another option for reducing the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. \nChoice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet. \n", "id": "94129", "title": "Carbon footprint"}

He bought the Louisiana territory from France, which was being led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the time, for $15,000,000 USD. At first, the men sent to France were allowed to spend up to $10,000,000 USD in order to buy New Orleans and, if possible, the west bank of the Mississippi River. But then the French government said that for five million more dollars they would sell all of the Louisiana territory. Thomas Jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land. Napoleon sold the land because he was desperate for money and he was afraid of losing his North American territories to the British.\nNapoleon Bonaparte had been busy with a war in Europe, and no matter how badly that Bonaparte wanted to go about in his interests with America, there was no way that he could do so with what he had been occupied in Europe with. Thomas Jefferson took this as an opportunity to make America larger, even if it meant going against his republican principles of small government (some would say he exceeded his constitutional power by accepting the deal on his own).\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase is important because it gave the U.S. control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans, both of which were used by farmers to ship their crops and get paid. It also got rid of one country that might try to harm the new nation because France sold all of their North American territory. \n\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition explored the Louisiana Purchase and the Oregon Territory.

This movement resulted in the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. The word \"Zionism\" comes from Zion, which means Jerusalem. Theodor Herzl started the Zionist movement. At the time, Palestine was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The British during the First World War made a statement called the Balfour Declaration agreeing to support a Jewish homeland in Palestine, although they opposed an independent Jewish state. After the war Palestine became a British colony and the British allowed a Jewish homeland to be created there. Hitler's regime in Germany gave limited support to Zionism during the 1930s as a means of removing Jews from Germany. Hitler's regime in 1933 negotiated an agreement with the Jewish Zionist Federation of Germany, that supported the emigration of the German Empire's Jews to Palestine and allowed them to keep their wealth. Some German leaders opposed the agreement because they feared it would result in the creation of a Jewish state that would become a center for Jewish agitation against Germany, but Hitler decided in 1937 and in 1938 to renew the agreement because he felt that it was more important to get the Jews out of Germany than to prevent a Jewish state from being created. However, Hitler restricted his support of Zionism to supporting a Jewish homeland in Palestine under British political control, and opposed an independent Jewish state, because of the concern it would be a center of Jewish agitation against Germany. Hitler's regime stopped supporting Zionism after World War II began in 1939. Zionism is a radical agenda that to this day continues to wield influence. Zionist policies include destabilizing neighboring countries of Israel to secure their foothold in the region.

He was born at Stavenhagen in Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nIn 1831, Reuter started to study at the University of Rostock, and in 1832 went to the University of Jena. At Jena he joined a \"Burschenschaft\" (political students' club). In 1833 he was arrested in Berlin by the Prussian government. He had only been only wearing the club's colours, but he was condemned to death for high treason. King Frederick William III of Prussia changed this to imprisonment for thirty years. In 1838 he was sent to a prison in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he spent two years in the fortress of Dömitz. Reuter was set free in 1840, when Frederick William IV became king of Prussia.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Reuter started studying law again at the University of Heidelberg but had to leave and go back to Stavenhagen and help to run his father's farm. When his father died, he gave up farming, and in 1850 became a private teacher in a little town then called Treptow-an-der-Tollense in Pomerania. Here he married Luise Kunze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor.\n\nReuter's first book was written in Low German. It was published in 1853. Three years later Reuter decided to give up teaching to become a writer, so he left Treptow and moved to Neubrandenburg.\n\n\"Ut de Franzosentid\" and \"Ut mine Stromtid\" are Reuter's best books.

His fellow poet Du Fu counted him to the group of Chinese scholars that he called the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup\" in a poem. Li Bai is often regarded, along with Du Fu, as one of the two greatest poets in China's literary history. Today we know about 1,100 of his poems.\n\nThe first translations in a Western language were published in 1862 by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his \"Poésies de l'Époque des Thang\". The English-speaking world was introduced to Li Bai's works by a Herbert Allen Giles publication \"History of Chinese Literature\" (1901) and through the liberal, but poetically influential, translations of Japanese versions of his poems made by Ezra Pound.\n\nLi Bai is best known for the imagination and Taoist imagery in his poetry. He spent much of his life travelling. People tell the story that he fell from his boat when he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon, and therefore drowned in the Yangtze River.\n\nLi Bai was probably born in Central Asia, though the exact location is unknown. His ancestors had lived in exile in that area since around the 7th century. He grew up in a fairly poor family. His father was a merchant. Li Bai did not receive any formal schooling as a child. Despite this, he had always been skilled with the art of words even as a young boy. In 705, Li Bai's father moved the family back to Mien-chou in Sichuan. It was there that he spent most of his early childhood.\n\nAs Lai Bai grew up he developed his sword fighting skills. He spent his teenage years traveling all of Sichuan as a knight-errant. At age 25, he traveled to Central China. In 727, Li Bai traveled to A-lu in Hubei. He married the daughter of the retired prime minister. There, he continued to explore the natural world where he lived.\n\nIn 735, Li Bai traveled north to the Yellow River, and east to the Yangtze River. In 742, he traveled to Chang’an, and was presented to the Emperor. The Emperor gave Li Bai many compliments, and thought highly of him. He gave Li Bai a position at the Hanlin Academy. Li Bai received a lot of attention from fellow scholar-officials.\n\nLi Bai enjoyed drinking liquor. He is known for often getting very drunk with seven other officials in city taverns. This earned them the title the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup\" from Du Fu, another one of China's best poets at the time.\n\nIn 744, Li Bai left the city of Chang'an. He was bored with the luxuries of city life. A year later, he met up with Du Fu, in Loyang. It was here that he also became a Taoist, a decision that would change the rest of his life. After settling his family down in Loyang, he left on another ten-year journey wandering around northern China. During this time, his poetry reflects his shift in interest to Toasm rather than his youthful interests of knightly behaviors and gallantry. While famous and well known, Li Bai started to struggle with problems like lack of money and property. \n\nLi Bai is best known for his imaginative and witty poetry. It involves romantic descriptions of nature, and opinions on ethics and death. He was famous among both nobles and commoners in his time, and is thought of as one of the four best poets during the Tang Dynasty. He is also well known for his Taoist beliefs and rebellion against Confucian teachings through his writing.\n\nOne of Li Bai's most famous poems is \"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\" (, pinyin: Yuè Xià Dú Zhuó), which is a good example of some of the most famous aspects of his poetry—a very spontaneous poem, full of natural images. Li Bai actually wrote several poems with the same title; Arthur Waley's version of the most famous reads:\n\nLi Bai’s poetry reflects the state of low feeling one experiences when he finds his life is wasted, and talents unused. To drown his own sorrows, Li Bo became very drunk very often, until it became a lifelong habit. Wine, however did help him write. While he was drunk, Li Bai was able to compose beautiful verses without restraint. Without anything holding him back, Li Bai’s finest poems were composed with much spontaneity and imagination. \n\nLi Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound's versions of some of his poems in the collection \"Cathay\", such as . In the east he influenced poets like Mi Fei in the Song Dynasty.\n\nA crater on the planet Mercury has been named after him.\n\n\nOnline translations (some with original Chinese, pronunciation, and literal translation):\n", "id": "94232", "title": "Li Bai"}

In his childhood Mahfouz read extensively. His mother often took him to museums and Egyptian history later became a major theme in many of his books.\n\nThe Egyptian Revolution of 1919 had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old. From the window he often saw English soldiers firing at the demonstrators, men and women. \"You could say,\" he later noted, \"that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution.\"\n\nBefore the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.\nBecause of his outspoken support for Anwar el Sadat's treaty with Israel, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel prize.\n\nLike many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on a \"death list\" by Islamic fundamentalists.

Puritans thought that the English Reformation had not gone far enough. They also did not agree with some of the things the Church of England did.\n\nKing Henry VIII separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and established the Protestant Church of England. This Church remained until 1553. Queen Mary returned the Church to be Roman Catholic until 1558 when Elizabeth I of England became Queen. Since she was a Protestant many people were happy but thought that the Church had not changed enough and was still too much like Catholicism.\n\nA Puritan was any person who tried to become more pure through worship and doctrine. The Puritans' way of life and set of beliefs were called Puritanism. The most important parts of Puritanism were piety (obeying religious rules), dressing simply, and living a modest life.\n\nThe Puritans believed some of the same things as Calvinists and Scottish Presbyterians. All of these groups were devoted to the Bible and to being morally pure.\n\nOne of the Puritans' most important beliefs was that every person needed to understand the Bible in his own way. (This belief is shared among most Protestants.) Puritans tried to live by the Bible's teachings in every way. They tried to be morally pure in even the smallest ways. They also tried to be spiritually pure in every way. They thought that man existed for the glory of God. They believed that man's most important job in life was to do God's will (what God wanted). By doing God's will, man would be rewarded with happiness in the future.\n\nBecause they did not agree with the way the Church of England did things, the Puritans made reforms, or changes, in their own churches and societies. Some of the Reformed churches in Europe made similar changes. The Puritans made preaching very important. They used as little ritual and decoration as possible. Very often, sermons talked about Hell. One famous sermon is \"Sinners in the hands of an angry god\", by Jonathan Edwards, an important Puritan preacher. The sermon talks about God being angry with people for sinful behavior, and throwing them into the fires of Hell as a punishment.\n\nMany Puritan groups emigrated to New England so that they could start their own societies there and practice Puritanism the way they wanted. Puritan beliefs and writings became very important in New England. One important work was Puritan John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\n\nThose who left the Church of England altogether were known as Separatists. Many of the Plymouth Colony Pilgrims who established the first successful colony in New England were separatists.\n\n", "id": "94252", "title": "Puritanism"}

Premchand's parents died young - his mother when he was seven and his father while he was fourteen and still a student. Premchand was left responsible for his stepmother and step-siblings. \n\nEarly in life, Premchand faced immense poverty. He earned five rupees a month tutoring a lawyer's child. He was married at the early age of fifteen but that marriage failed, later he married again, to Shivrani Devi, a balavidhava (child widow), and had several children. She supported him through life struggles. \n\nPremchand passed his exam with great effort in 1898, and in 1899 he took up school-teaching job, with a monthly salary of eighteen rupees. In 1919 he passed his B.A. with English, Persian and History. \n\nLater, Premchand worked as the deputy sub-inspector of schools.\n\nPremchand lived a life of financial struggle. Once he took a loan of two-and-a-half rupees to buy some clothes. He had to struggle for three years to pay it back.\n\nWhen asked why he does not write anything about himself, he answered: \"What greatness do I have that I have to tell anyone about? I live just like millions of people in this country; I am ordinary. My life is also ordinary. I am a poor school teacher suffering family travails. During my whole lifetime, I have been grinding away with the hope that I could become free of my sufferings. But I have not been able to free myself from suffering. What is so special about this life that needs to be told to anybody?\". \n\nDuring his last years,he became terribly ill. The money his wife used to give for his treatment was used in running his press \"The Saraswati\". He was also writing a book \"Mangalsutra\" which would never be completed. All this had serious impact on his health leading to his early death on 8th October 1936, at the age of 56.\n\nThe main characteristic of Premchand's writings is his interesting story-telling and use of simple language. His novels describe the problems of the rural peasant classes. He avoided the use of highly Sanskritized Hindi (as was the common practice among Hindi writers), and also Spanish language.\n\nPremchand has written about 300 short stories, several novels as well as many essays and letters. He has also written some plays. He also did some translations. Many of Premchand's stories have been translated into English and Russian.\n\n\"Godaan\" (The Gift of a Cow), his last novel, is considered the finest Hindi novel of all times.

They belong to a sovereign state, and are dependent on that state to some degree. There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence. They are commonly distinguished from subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the state. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper, while a dependent territory is a legally separate territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy.\n\nAs an example, Greenland is a dependent territory of Denmark, and Saint Helena is a dependent territory of the United Kingdom.\n\nDependency claims without general international recognition, including all claims in Antarctica, are listed in \"italics\". The list includes several territories that are not included in the list of non-self-governing territories listed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, as well as those that are not legally classified as dependencies by their respective sovereign government.\n\nAlthough all territories of Australia are considered to be fully integrated in its federative system, and the official status of an external territory does not differ largely from that of a mainland territory, debate remains as to whether the external territories are integral parts of Australia, due to their not being part of Australia in 1901, when its constituent states federated. They are often listed separately for statistical purposes.\n\nOverseas France consists of 5 overseas departments (\"Départements d'outre-mer\") and all overseas territories (\"Territoires d'outre-mer\").

Certain groups, for example, Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico, also use an octal numbering system.

Each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral. The grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left. The first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral, then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral.\nIn the decimal system (base 10), each digit in octal is equal to that digit multiplied by the exponent of 8 that is equal to its location minus one.\nExample: o3425 to decimal\nOctal is similar to hexadecimal because they are both easily converted to binary.

This gives hints to the reader what the whole character means. Later, the term was given a \"second\" meaning, the 部首 (Pinyin: \"bùshǒu\", Japanese \"bushu\", Korean \"busu\"). This means \"section header\", which refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary. \n\nRadicals are typically simpler characters, or variants of simpler characters, which combine with other radicals to form a more complex character. People can only make so many unique ideographs for the huge number of words and morphemes that make up a language. Combining already existing ideographs together to form a compound ideograph is a very convenient solution to make many more words. While there are thousands of Chinese characters (well over 45,000) that exist, it is said that nearly all characters used in daily life are made up of just 214 radicals. \n\nOne example of simpler characters combining to form a more complex one is the complex character 明 \"míng\" meaning \"bright\" or \"tomorrow\", which is made up of the radicals 日 \"rì\" meaning \"sun\" or \"day\" and 月 \"yuè\" meaning \"moon\" or \"month\", both of which are simple characters that can exist by themselves, and the putting together of sun 日 and moon 月 to make one character show that either the sun and moon pass before tomorrow comes, or that they are the bright objects in the sky that shine light on the earth. An example of characters with radicals that don't exist by themselves is the complex character 休 \"xìu\" meaning \"to stop\", “to cease” or \"to rest\", which is made up of the radical 亻, which is a variant of the simple character 人 \"rén\" meaning \"person\" or \"human\", though the variant never exists as by itself must therefore attach itself to another character to form a complete character, and the radical 木 \"mǔ\" meaning \"wood\" or \"tree\", hinting what a person might want to do after he/she ceases working (like lying on a tree). \n\nA more complex is the character 媽 \"mā\" meaning “mother” (shown right), in which the left part 女 \"nǚ\" meaning \"woman\" or \"female\" happens to be the semantic component, and also the section header under which dictionaries list the graph. However, not all section headers function in a particular character as the semantic component. Some are based on phonetics, or hint as the character's pronunciation, like the right part 馬 \"mǎ\" meaning \"horse\" of the character 媽. Although the meaning of the character 媽 has no clear, obvious connection to a horse, 馬 is included to help the reader remember its pronunciation. Other section headers are merely chosen for convenience of finding the character in a dictionary, and play neither a semantic nor a phonetic role, like 二 \"èr\" \"two\" in 亞 \"yà\" \"second\" or \"inferior\",亅 \"jué\" (no meaning) in 了 \"liào\" \"past tense marker\", and 一 \"yī\" \"one\" in 丁 \"dīng\" \"fourth\". These two meanings of “radical” are not synonymous, though they may coincide in a particular example, causing a lot of confusion. (For clarity, both semantic component and section header terms are used here.)\n\nThe equivalents in cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics are called determinatives.\n\nChinese character components, whether semantic or phonetic in role, are the building blocks for all Chinese Hanzi as well as in the derived forms of Japanese Kanji, Korean Hanja, and Vietnamese Chữ nôm and Chữ nho.\nSince the Kangxi dictionary of 1716 was indexed using the 214 \n\"Zìhuì\" section headers, the standard list thereof has remained unchanged. Section headers are foundationally important for the organisation and use of Hanzi, Kanji, and Hanja dictionaries.\n", "id": "95441", "title": "Radical (Chinese character)"}
