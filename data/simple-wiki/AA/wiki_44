The most notable storm this year was Hurricane Kenna, which reached Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It made landfall near Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico, on October 25. It killed four people and was one of the most powerful hurricanes to ever strike the western coast of Mexico. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Julio made landfall in Mexico, and Tropical Storm Boris dumped torrential rain along the Mexican coast, although it remained offshore. \n\nOther storms were individually unusual. Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category 5 intensity, but neither did any damage. Hurricane Fausto, while it had no effect on land, regenerated into a tiny tropical storm at a very high latitude.\n\nIt officially started May 15, 2002, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 2002, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 2002. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nThere were twelve tropical storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean this season. Of those, six became hurricanes and five became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or high on the Saffir Simpson Scale. A record three Category 5 storms formed. In the central Pacific, one tropical storm, one hurricane, and one major hurricane formed. The season saw below average activity in terms of the number of systems, but above average activity in terms of stronger storms. This was due to a moderately strong El Niño that also suppressed activity in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAlso of note this season is an unusual gap in storm formation during the first three weeks of August. That time usually sees several nameable storms, but for some reason there were none.\n\nOn June 8, an area of disturbed weather that had absorbed a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E. It became a tropical storm the next day. After peaking on June 9, steering currents collapsed and Boris stalled out in the ocean between two ridges of high pressure. Shear increased, and the cyclone weakened to a depression on June 10. The next day, Boris degenerated into a remnant low. The remnant drifted east and then southeast before dissipating on June 12.\n\nBoris dumped heavy rains on sections of the Mexican coast. Several homes at an unspecified location were damaged. There were no deaths.\n\nAn area of convection and disturbed weather possibly related to outflow from Hurricane Isidore developed a circulation on September 23 and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 25. The depression headed northward and strengthened into a tropical storm the same day. Julio turned to the northwest and peaked just before landfall near Lazaro Cardenas on September 26. The storm quickly dissipated over Mexico.\n\nNo one was killed by Julio. Around 100 houses in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo were damaged or washed away by flash flooding.\n\nA powerful Category 5 hurricane at its peak, the third of the season, Kenna made landfall on Mexico as a Category 4. As of 2005, it is the most recent Pacific hurricane to have its name retired.\n\nKenna killed four people in Mexico and left thousands homeless. Its total damage was from 5 to 100 million dollars.\nEleven-E threatened land. It resulted in warnings and watches being issued for parts of the Baja California Peninsula, but it weakened to a remnant low before strengthening into a storm. No deaths or damages were reported. Eleven-E was the final storm of the season. It lasted for two days in November and dissipated on the sixteenth day of that month.\n", "id": "142817", "title": "2002 Pacific hurricane season"}

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nOf note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms. Hurricanes Emilia, Gilma, John, and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars. Elsewhere, Hurricane Rosa killed several people in Mexico.\n\nThis season had slightly above average activity. Five hurricanes reached Category 2 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. In addition, there were four other hurricanes and eight tropical storms. In the Central Pacific, two tropical storms and one hurricane formed.\n\nHurricane Emilia was a powerful Category 5 storm. It briefly threatened the Hawaiian Islands near peak strength, but instead encountered wind shear and weakened. There was minor damage to roofs and some downed trees, and moderate rainfall.\n\nHurricane Gilma was the strongest storm of the season, and the first Category 5 storm in the East Pacific since Ava in 1973. It is also the strongest July storm in the east Pacific, and is the fifth strongest overall.\n\nHurricane John was the longest lasting and most continuous tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history. Its life began on August 11 south of Mexico, and 31 days later the storm became extratropical south of Alaska, after reaching Category 5 strength and passing the International Date Line twice. John caused $15 million (1994 USD) in damage on Johnston Island.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located 740 miles (1190 km) southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression moved westward without organizing, and dissipated on the 14th. Moisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii, totaling to over 15 inches. The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo, and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years. The rainfall destroyed 2 homes and damaged 214, 14 severely. It also damaged roads and businesses. Damage throughout the island totaled to $5 million (1993 USD).Flooding occurred in Maui as well, where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway. \n\nHurricane Olivia was the second strongest storm of the season. It is one of the ten most intense east Pacific hurricanes ever recorded. At the time, it was the strongest October storm.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8. It had trouble organizing, and advisories were discontinued for a while. The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa. It moved glacially, but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast. Rosa intensified quickly, peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepcion on the morning of October 14. Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico, and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the Plains and Mississippi Valley, moistening the atmosphere enough in Texas ahead of a slow moving occluded cyclone to help set the stage for a significant flood event in east Texas on the October 17.\n\nFour deaths, two in each of Nayarit and Durango, were reported. Four people were missing in Sinaloa. More than 100,000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit. Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa. Rain caused landslides and flash-flooding in mountainous areas.\n", "id": "142821", "title": "1994 Pacific hurricane season"}

It moved across the unfavorable Atlantic, and reached the Eastern Pacific on August 8th. It slowly organized, and became Tropical Depression 10-E on August 11th, 300 nautical miles south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Conditions were not ideal for development, but it developed banding features and well-defined outflow, and managed to strengthen to become Tropical Storm John later that day.\n\nA strong ridge of high pressure over the Northeastern Pacific Ocean forced John westward, where upper level shear kept John a tropical storm as its intensity fluctuated. The shear greatly lessened greatly on the 19th, and John became a hurricane on the 20th. Later that day, it became a major hurricane, and crossed into the Central Pacific shortly thereafter.\n\nHurricane John continued to strengthen, and reached a peak of 150 knots (175 mph winds) on the 23rd, passing 300 nautical miles south of Hawaii. John had posed a threat to the island days before, but the ridge of high pressure pushed John safely south of the island. The hurricane still caused heavy waves and rains, though. During these days, John's intensity was constantly checked by Air Force Reserve aircraft reconnaissance.\n\nJohn turned more northerly, where it steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane on the 26th. Then, it crossed just north of Johnston Island, where it caused moderate damage. Conditions again favored strengthening, and John re-strengthened to a 135 mph Category 4 hurricane, but upper level shear again weakened it. John crossed the International Date Line, and became Typhoon John.\n\nThe system continued to weaken, becoming a tropical storm on the 31st and a tropical depression on the 2nd while drifting eastward. John looped back to the northwest, and gradually restrengthened. An upper trough pulled the storm to the northeast on the 7th, and re-entered the Central Pacific on the 8th. John became a hurricane again late on the 8th, and retained that intensity for another day. Upper level shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on the 10th, and John became extratropical in the North Central Pacific about a thousand miles south of Unalaska Island. John dissipated later that day, after an unprecedented 31 days at sea.\n", "id": "142824", "title": "Hurricane John (1994)"}

Paka, which is the Hawaiian name for Pat, developed on November 28 from a trough well to the southwest of Hawaii. The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on December 7 it crossed into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as it crossed the Marshall Islands. On December 16, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230 km/h (145 mph), and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on December 23 Paka dissipated.\n\nTyphoon Paka first impacted the Marshall Islands, where it dropped heavy rainfall and left $80 million in damage (1997 USD, $100 million 2007 USD). Later, it passed just north of Guam, where strong winds destroyed about 1,500 buildings and damaged 10,000 more; 5,000 people were left homeless, and the island experienced a complete power outage following the typhoon. Damage on the island totaled $500 million (1997 USD, $645 million 2007 USD), which warranted the retirement of its name.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142828", "text": "Hurricane Ioke\n\nHurricane Ioke (also Typhoon Ioke, international designation 0612, JTWC designation 01C also sometimes called Super Typhoon Ioke) is the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Central Pacific. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, Ioke is a long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific, reaching Category 5 status twice as a hurricane. As a typhoon, Ioke managed to achieve Category 5-equivalent one-minute sustained winds one more time before weakening.\n\nIoke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon, but the storm passed over Johnston Atoll as a Category 2 hurricane and Wake Island as a Category 5 typhoon. Despite its strength, Ioke only caused moderate damage to Wake Island, and was not responsible for any fatalities.\n\nThe system began in the third week of August as a persistent tropical disturbance south of the Hawaiian Islands. It was initially embedded in a trough, but gained convection and developed into a tropical depression about 775 miles south of Honolulu on August 19. It continued to strengthen, and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system with the name \"Ioke\" (IPA /iːˈəʊ.keɪ/), which is Hawaiian for the name Joyce, becoming the first tropical storm to form in the Central Pacific since 2002.\n\nIoke quickly began to enter a process of rapid development; strengthening into a hurricane just 24 hours after it had formed. While safely avoiding the Hawaiian Islands, it continued to rapidly intensify and became a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater) on the morning of August 21. Later that day, Ioke intensified even further into a Category 4 hurricane. On August 22, it began to weaken as a result of cooler water and eyewall replacement cycle, and was downgraded back to a Category 2. As a Category 2 storm, Ioke affected Johnston Atoll.\nThe storm began to rapidly deepen again late on August 23 as it moved over increasingly warm water, reaching major hurricane status for the second time while moving to the west-northwest. From there, conditions would become even more favorable for development.\n\nOvernight between August 24 and August 25, Ioke strengthened rapidly, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the 25th - the first system originating from the Central Pacific to reach that intensity while still in the Western Hemisphere. Ioke then began to travel over a large environment highly favorable for hurricane development, and would maintain its strength for an extended period of time. Ioke also became the most intense hurricane ever to develop in the Central Pacific, with a central pressure of 921 mbar (27.19 inHg) at that point (which dropped to 920 mbar at its Central Pacific peak).\n\nIoke began to fluctuate in intensity afterward; weakened back to a Category 4 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, regaining Category 5 strength on August 26. Ioke held that intensity until crossing the International Date Line that evening (August 27 after the crossover), becoming Typhoon Ioke in the process. The storm weakened to Category 4 strength according to the JTWC, but by 2100 UTC on August 29, the JTWC advised that Ioke had regained Category 5 strength for the third time.\n\nAfter maintaining Category 5 strength for 12 hours, Ioke weakened back to a Category 4 for the final time on August 30 while approaching Wake Island. Ioke passed almost directly over the island on early September 1 and continued tracking to the west-northwest while slowly weakening over gradually cooling waters. On September 3, under the influence of an approaching trough, the typhoon began to recurve to the northwest, then to the north and away from Japan, while weakening more rapidly. Ioke began to transition into an extratropical storm late on September 4 due to increased wind shear and rapidly cooling seas, and the JTWC issued its last advisory at 1200 UTC on September 5 after it was decided that Ioke had begun extratropical transition. The JMA followed suit early on September 7 after Ioke had become completely extratropical east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\nThe remnant extratropical low is currently monitored by National Weather Service and is expected to be near Alaska in 48 hours.\n\n\nDespite Ioke's extreme intensity and impacting two small land masses, damage was surprisingly moderate. Little damage was done on Johnston Atoll, and damage to infrastructure on Wake Island was less than expected, despite Ioke's eyewall brushing the island.\n\nThe National Weather Service reported that the eastern eyewall of Ioke passed over the uninhabited Johnston Atoll, buffeting it with hurricane-force winds.\n\nTwelve people on a United States Air Force vessel in the Pacific were forced to abandon ship and take shelter in a hurricane-proof bunker on the island. They were reported safe the next day, and a reconnaissance flight reported little damage on the island.\n\nDue to Typhoon Ioke's projected path near Wake Island, all 188 people who live and work there were evacuated in two C-17 Globemaster IIIs to Oahu in Hawaii. The typhoon's powerful winds, estimated to gust as high as 190 mph, damaged weather sensors on the island, causing them to fail after the instruments reported a 100 mph gust. A reconnaissance mission by the Coast Guard indicated the typhoon caused moderate damage on the island, including blown off roofs, damaged sides of buildings, and downed trees. However, the damage was repairable, and the major infrastructure on the island was intact.\n\nThe JMA issued evacuation orders for its staff on Minami Torishima on September 1 in view of the approaching typhoon, but so far, no damage has been reported.\n", "id": "142828", "title": "Hurricane Ioke"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=142930", "text": "Closure (computer science)\n\nIn computer science, a closure is a function that has an environment of its own. Inside this environment, there is at least one bound variable. Closures were first used in programming languages such as ML and Lisp.\n\nWhen a closure is used more than once, the bound variables stay the same in between.\n\nAnonymous functions are sometimes wrongly called closures. This is probably because most languages that have anonymous functions also have closures and it's common for programmers to learn about both at the same time. Closures and anonymous functions are similar but have important differences.\n\nComputer scientists worked out how closures should work in the 1960s and programmers were first able to use them in the Scheme programming language. Since then, many languages have been designed to support closures.\n\nFunction objects are sometimes also called closures.\n\nClosures are normal in languages where functions are first-class values, meaning they can be moved around in the program like other variable types: returned by functions, bound to a variable name, etc. For example, take a look at the following Scheme function:\nIn this example, the lambda expression codice_1 is part of the function codice_2. When the function is run, Scheme needs to determine the value of the lambda. It does this by creating a closure with the code for the lambda and a reference to the codice_3 variable, which is a free variable inside the lambda.\n\nThe closure is then passed to the codice_4 function and the function runs it on each book in the list to determine which books to add. Because the closure itself has a reference to codice_3, it can use that variable each time codice_4 calls it. The function codice_4 itself might be defined in a completely separate file.\n\nHere is the same example rewritten in ECMAScript (JavaScript), another popular language with support for closures:\nThe codice_8 keyword is used here instead of codice_9, and an codice_10 method instead of a global codice_4 function, but otherwise the code does the same thing in the same way.\n\nA function may create a closure and return it. The following example is a function that returns a function.\n\nIn Scheme:\nIn ECMAScript:\nBecause the closure in this case outlives the scope of the function that creates it, the variables codice_12 and codice_13 live on after the function codice_14 returns. In languages without closures, the lifetime of a local variable coincides with the execution of the scope where that variable is declared. In languages with closures, variables must continue to exist as long as any existing closures have references to them.\nThis is most commonly implemented using some form of garbage collection.\n\nWhile this is not always clarified, a closure need not be formed using an anonymous function. The Python programming language, for example, has very limited support for anonymous functions but fully supports closures. For example, one way the above ECMAScript example could be implemented in Python is:\n\nIn this example, the function named \"gradient\" forms a closure together with the variables \"f\" and \"dx\".

This is shortened from \"commedia dell’arte all’improvviso\", or “comedy of improvisation”.\n\nThe plays of Commedia dell'arte were often performed by a small group of actors who traveled around and performed in town squares. The actors would pass a hat around for people to put money in.\n\nThe earliest known company was in Padua in 1545. By the turn of the seventeenth century there were several troupes (group of actors) such as the Gelosi, Confidenti, and Fedeli. Some troupes were popular at foreign courts, especially in France, where images from the commedia became a favorite theme of well-known artists.\n\nThe actors often wore masks. The stories were often about people being cunning. Hunger, love and money were important in the stories. There were several characters who often appeared in lots of the stories. These are called \"stock characters\". Examples of stock characters from Commedia dell'arte are: Harlequin, Pantalone, Arlecchino, Colombina, Pulcinella, Pierrot, Scaramuccia.\n\nCommedia dell'arte had a lot of influence on theatre plays in many countries.

It accelerates charged particles by whirling them in a circle. The first cyclotrons were the size of a hand. Some modern circular accelerators use a circle as wide as a city.\n\nCyclotrons use perpendicular magnetic field to bend electrons and particles through into a semicircular path by an applied electric field. The applied electric field accelerates electrons between the \"D\" electrodes(also called \"dees\") of the magnetic field region.\n\nThe accelerating electric field reverses just at the time the electrons finish their half circle, so that it accelerates them across the gap. With a higher speed, they move in a larger semicircle. After repeating this process several times, they come out the exit port at a high speed.\n\nA moving charge in a cyclotron will move in a circular path under the influence of a constant magnetic field. If the time to complete one orbit is calculated:\n\nformula_1.\n\nIt is found that the period is independent of the radius. Therefore if a square wave is applied at angular frequency qB/m, the charge will spiral outward, increasing in speed.\n\nWhen a square wave of angular frequency ω=qB/m is applied between the two sides of the magnetic poles, the charge will be boosted again at just the right time to accelerate it across the gap. Thus the constant cyclotron frequency can continue to accelerate the charge (so long as it is not relativistic).\n", "id": "143055", "title": "Cyclotron"}

Her most famous book was \"Heidi\". \n\nShe was born Johanna Heusser in Hirzel, Switzerland. Her father was a doctor and her mother was a poet. \n\nShe lived with her extended family: her grandmother, two aunties, and two cousins as well as her mother, father, two brothers and three sisters. This large household inspired her when she wrote \"Gritli's Children\". \n\nShe spent several summers around Chur in Graubünden when she was young. This setting was later used in her novels.\n\nHer only education was her village school in Hirzel. She wrote poetry as a child.\n\nShe married Bernhard Spyri, an employee , when she was 25. They met when they were children. They lived in Zurich, Switzerland and had only one child, a son, Berhard Diethelm Spyri, in 1855. In Zurich, they were friends with the musician Richard Wagner and poet Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. Both her husband and son died of tuberculosis in 1884.\n\nIn 1870, she started writing to help orphans and refugees of the Franco-Prussian War by describing their situation and giving money from her books to help them.\n\nHer first stories were very popular, so she wrote another story about another orphan, Heidi. She published the first part of \"Heidi\" anonymously in 1881. It became popular, so she wrote the second part in 1882 using her own name. She became very famous, but preferred a quiet, private life.\n\nShe wrote more than forty stories for children in German. Most of these stories have been translated into English. \"Heidi\" is still her most popular book, with new editions still published today.\n\nShe died in Berlin on July 7, 1901, but is buried with her family Zurich.\n\n", "id": "143057", "title": "Johanna Spyri"}

She is an English folk singer.\n\nJune Tabor wanted to sing after she heard an Anne Briggs record called \"Hazards of Love\" in 1965. \"I went and locked myself in the bathroom for a fortnight and drove my mother mad. I learned the songs on that EP (extended play record) note for note, twiddle for twiddle. That's how I started singing. If I hadn't heard her I'd have probably done something entirely different.\"\n\nShe went to St Hugh's College, Oxford University. In 1968 she was on the TV show \"University Challenge\", as captain of the college team. She joined the Heritage Society at Oxford University. She sang with a group called \"Mistral\". One of her first recordings was in 1972 on a collection called \"Stagfolk Live\". She became famous in 1976 when she made the album \"Silly Sisters\" with Maddy Prior. She also made her first solo album, \"Airs and Graces\" in 1976. She recorded again with Prior, this time using the name Silly Sisters for their act together. In 1977 guitar player Martin Simpson worked with her in the recording studio for three albums. He moved to America in 1987. (Simpson has come back from America to be a guest player on her albums in the 2000s.) After he left, she worked with piano player Huw Warren.\n\nTabor stopped singing after many years as a performer. She worked as a librarian\n. With her husband David Taylor she ran a restaurant called \"Passepartout\" in Penrith, Cumbria, England. She returned to performing in the 1990s.\n\nIn 1990, June Tabor made an album with the folk-rock band The Oyster Band called \"Freedom and Rain\". She went on tour with the Oyster Band. A live recording from the tour was made into an album by the Rykodisc label in 1991. In 1992 singer Elvis Costello wrote \"All this Useless Beauty\" just for Tabor. She recorded the song on \"Angel Tiger\". Costello didn't record it himself until 1996, on his album \"All This Useless Beauty\".\n\nIn 1983 June Tabor sang the title song for the BBC TV series \"Spyship\". In 1997 she was on Ken Russell's TV show, \"In Search of English Folk Song\" shown on Channel 4. Tim Winton, author of the 2001 novel \"Dirt Music\", made a selection of music to go with his novel. The CD \"Dirt Music\" (2001) includes \"He Fades Away\" by June Tabor, a sad song about the death of a miner. The song was on her 1994 CD \"Against the Streams.\" In 2002, at the \"Passchendale Peace Concert\" in Flanders, Tabor shared the stage with Coope Boyes and Simpson. On 30th June 2006 BBC Radio 3 broadcast \"Night Waves\" to remember the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. It was broadcast live, with World War I songs sung by June Tabor.\n\nOver the years she has worked in various styles including jazz and art song. She usually has a very plain and simple sound with a sad feeling to it. Her 2003 album \"An Echo of Hooves\" went back to the traditional ballad style. Many people said it was a great album. \"Allmusic\" said it was \"A stunning jewel in a remarkable career, and one of the best things Tabor’s ever released.\" \"Always\" (2005) is a boxed set of four CDs, with songs from her whole career. It has many rare recordings.\n\nOn 24th October 2003 Tabor appeared on \"Later With Jools Holland\" (BBC TV), singing \"Hughie Graeme\". This was later put on a DVD of the series. \"Folk Britannia\" was the name of a concert at the Barbican centre, and a TV mini-series (February 2006, repeated in October). She sang \"Fair Margaret and Sweet William\" at the Barbican, under the heading \"Daughters of Albion\". Tabor sang one song on Ashley Hutchings' album \"Street Cries\" (2001). She also sang on a collection of folk musicians singing songs by the Beatles - \"Rubber Folk\" (2006). She sang Lennon's \"In My Life\" a cappella (with out any instruments).\n\nThe way June treats songs is different. For example she often sings traditional songs with just a piano. On the album \"Singing The Storm\" (2000) she sings with Savourna Stevenson's harp, and Danny Thompson's bass. In May 2004 she performed as part of \"The Big Session\" and sang Love Will Tear Us Apart as a duet with John Jones of The Oyster Band. In 1992, The Wire voted her song \"Queen Among the Heather\" one of the \"Top 50 Rhythms of all Time\".\n\nShe also has a sense of humour and fun. This can be seen in her work with Les Barker's The Mrs Ackroyd Band which performs his funny songs. Tabor has sung on three of their albums. In 1990 on the album \"Oranges and Lemmings\" she sang \"The Trains of Waterloo\", a funny version of the folk song \"The Plains of Waterloo\" in a duet with Martin Carthy. In 1994 on \"Gnus and Roses\" she sang \"The January June\", which made fun of her sad and serious singing style. In 2003 on the album \"Yelp!\" she sang \"There's a hole in my bodhran\", to the tune of \"There's a Hole in my Bucket\". She sang two songs on \"Beat The Retreat\", a tribute to Richard Thompson.\n\nDuo with Maddy Prior\n\nSolo albums\n\nRecordings with The Oyster Band\n\nRecordings with The Mrs Ackroyd Band\n\nCollections\n\n\n", "id": "143063", "title": "June Tabor"}

Alabama gained statehood on 14 December 1819.\n\nMany of the first settlers came from South Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Many came to this region after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814. The 1820 census records say that Shelby County contained 2,492 people at that time, 2,044 whites and 448 Africans.\n\nU.S. Highway 31 was a two-lane highway at that time. Because it was the main artery from Birmingham to Montgomery, the highway played an important part in the growth of the community.\n\nGeorge L. Scott, Sr. was an Alabaster pioneer. He owned and operated Alabaster Lime Co. His shipping point, which was named after him, was known as “Scott Rock”. Later, houses were built for his employees to live in. These houses became a community. It got its name from alabaster, a white chalky mineral. The First Bank of Alabaster opened in 1952. Its president was George L. Scott, Jr. He later became the first mayor of Alabaster. The first attempt in 1952 to incorporate Alabaster failed. In January 1953 the petition was filed again. On 23 February 1953, Alabaster was officially incorporated. There were 427 people living there. Other Alabaster pioneers were Kenton B. Nickerson and William J. Maxwell. In 1955, the Alabaster Water and Gas Board was formed. Alabaster merged with the adjoining city of Siluria, Alabama April 27, 1971.\n\nToday, Shelby County is the fastest-growing county in Alabama.\n", "id": "143145", "title": "Alabaster, Alabama"}

It lived in enormous migratory flocks — sometimes containing more than two billion birds — that could stretch one mile (1.6 km) wide and 300 miles (500 km) long across the sky, sometimes taking several hours to pass.\n\nSome estimate that there were three billion to five billion passenger pigeons in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America. Others argue that the species had not been common in the Pre-Columbian period, but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food.\n\nThe species went from being one of the most usual birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century. At the time, passenger pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal, second only to the Rocky Mountain locust.\n\nSome reduction in numbers happened because of habitat loss when the Europeans started settling further inland. The primary factor emerged when pigeon meat was commercialized as a cheap food for slaves and the poor in the 19th century, resulting in hunting on a massive scale. There was a slow decline in their numbers between about 1800 and 1870, followed by a catastrophic decline between 1870 and 1890. Martha, thought to be the world's last passenger pigeon, died on September 1, 1914, in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIn the 18th century, the passenger pigeon in Europe was known to the French as tourtre; but, in New France, the North American bird was called tourte. In modern French, the bird is known as the pigeon migrateur.\n\nIn Algonquian languages, it was called \"amimi\" by the Lenape and omiimii by the Ojibwe.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143225", "text": "Sergei Eisenstein\n\nSergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein (; January 23, 1898 – February 11, 1948) was a Soviet Russian movie director and movie theorist. He was known mostly for his silent movies \"Strike\", \"Battleship Potemkin\" and \"\". He was also known for his historical epics \"Alexander Nevsky\" and \"Ivan the Terrible\". His work had a major impact on early movie directors because of his creative use of and writings about montage.\n\nEisenstein was born in Riga, Latvia but his family moved a lot in his early years. Eisenstein continued to move often during his life. Eisenstein's father Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein was of German-Jewish and Swedish descent and his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a Russian Orthodox family. He was born into a middle-class family. His father was an architect and his mother was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. Julia left Riga the year of the 1905 Revolution. She brought Sergei with her to St. Petersburg. Sergei would return at times to see his father. His father would later move to join them around 1910. His mother soon divorced his father and moved to France away from the family.\n\nAt the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the job of his father. At school with his fellow students however, Sergei would join the military to serve the revolution. His father did not support his joining the army. In 1918 Sergei joined the Red Army with his father, Mikhail, supporting the opposite side. This brought his father to Germany after defeat, and Sergei to Petrograd, Vologda, and Dvinsk. In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in Minsk, after success providing propaganda for the October Revolution. At this time, Sergei studied Japanese. He learned some three hundred kanji characters which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development. This also allowed him to see Kabuki theatre. Because of his studies, he traveled to Japan.\n\nIn 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for Proletkult. His productions there were named \"Gas Masks,\" \"Listen Moscow,\" and \"Wiseman\". Eisenstein would then work as a designer for Vsevolod Meyerhold. In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist, by writing \"The Montage of Attractions\" for LEF. Eisenstein's first movie, \"Glumov's Diary\", was also made in that same year. Dziga Vertov hired at first as an \"instructor\" for the film The movie formed part of his theatre production \"Wiseman\".\n\n\"Strike\" (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length movie. \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) was well liked by critics throughout the world. Because he was known throughout the world, Eisenstein was able to direct \"\" (also known as \"Ten Days That Shook The World\"). The movie was part of the tenth anniversary celebration of the October Revolution of 1917. He then directed \"The General Line\" (also known as \"Old and New\"). People in the outside world praised the movies. However, in the Soviet Union, Eisenstein's focus on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements and montage, was not liked by the much of the Soviet movie community.\n\nIn the autumn of 1928, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe. He was joined by Grigori Aleksandrov and cinematographer Eduard Tisse. The trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and others to learn about sound motion pictures. It would also show the famous Soviet artists to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zurich, London, and Paris. In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Edouard Tissé entitled \"Frauennot - Frauenglück\".\n\nIn late April 1930, Jesse L. Lasky, working for Paramount Pictures, offered Eisenstein the chance to make a movie in the United States. He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in Hollywood in May 1930. However, this agreement failed. Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking did not work with the style and way movies were made in American movie studios.\n\nEisenstein proposed a biography of munitions invester Sir Basil Zaharoff and a movie version of \"Arms and the Man\" by George Bernard Shaw. He also made plans for a movie of \"Sutter's Gold\" by Jack London. But the studio's producers did not like the plan. Paramount then proposed a movie version of Theodore Dreiser's \"An American Tragedy\". This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930. Paramount disliked it completely. They also found themselves intimidated by Major Frank Pease, president of the \"Hollywood Technical Director's Institute\". Pease, an anti-communist, started a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract canceled. Eisenstein and his movie partners were given return tickets to Moscow, at Paramount's expense.\n\nEisenstein was faced with returning home as a failure. The Soviet movie industry was solving the sound-movie issue without him and his movies. His methods and ideas were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures'. They were called examples of formalism. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as \"Eisenstein on Disney\", have been found decades later as important scholarly texts. These are used in movie schools around the world.\n\nEisenstein spent a large amount of time with Charlie Chaplin. Chaplin recommended that Eisenstein meet American socialist author Upton Sinclair who Chaplin thought might help Eisenstein. Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the Soviet Union, and were known to Eisenstein. The two liked each other's work. Between the end of October 1930, and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had gotten an extension of Eisenstein's leave from the Soviet Union. He also received permission for Eisenstein to travel to Mexico to make a movie to be produced by Sinclair and his wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair. They joined with three other investors to make the Mexican Film Trust.\n\nOn November 24, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust. The deal was \"upon the basis of Eisenstein's desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity.\" The contract also said that the movie would be \"non-political.\" The money first came from Mrs. Sinclair and would be \"not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars.\" The schedule for making the movie would be \"a period of from three to four months,\". The contract also said that \"Eisenstein...agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair...\" An addition to the contract, dated December 1, allowed that the \"Soviet Government may have the [finished] movie free for showing inside the U.S.S.R.\" Reportedly, it was verbally decided that the movie was expected to be an hour long.\n\nBy December 4, 1930, Eisenstein was on his way to Mexico by train. He was joined by Alexandrov and Tisse. Later he came up with a short summary of the six-part movie which would come. This would be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, \"¡Que viva México!\", was decided on some time later. While in Mexico, Eisenstein mixed socially with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Eisenstein liked these artists and Mexican culture in general. They inspired Eisenstein to call his movies, \"moving frescoes.\"\n\nAfter a long time away from the Soviet Union, Stalin sent a telegram saying he was worried that Eisenstein had become a deserter. Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, for the film's problems. Kimbrough had been sent along to act as a line producer on the movie. Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to stop Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the movie in his own way.\n\nThe upset Sinclair shut down production. He ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining movie footage. The three Soviets came as well to see what they could do with the movie already shot. For the unfinished filming of the \"novel\" of Soldadera, Eisenstein had gotten 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army. This was lost due to Sinclair's canceling of production.\n\nWhen Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of Jesus along with other material of a pornographic nature. Eisenstein's re-entry visa had expired, and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Alexandrov and Tisse were, after a month's stay at the U.S.-Mexico border outside Laredo, Texas, allowed a 30-day \"pass\" to get from Texas to New York. From there, they would be allowed to leave for Moscow. Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining movie.\n\nEisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to get the services of Sol Lesser. Lesser had just opened his own distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corp.. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative — at the Sinclairs' expense — and distribute any finished product. Two short movies and a short subject — \"Thunder Over Mexico\" based on the \"Maguey\" footage, \"Eisenstein in Mexico\", and \"Death Day\" respectively — were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934.\n\nEisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser movies, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called \"Time In The Sun.\" He would publicly say that he had lost all interest in the project.\n\nEisenstein's trip to the west made the Soviet movie business look at him with a suspicion that would never completely go away. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in Kislovodsk in July 1933. This was possibly a result of depression because he realized that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage which was turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors.\n\nHe was then given a teaching job with the movie school GIK (now Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography) where he had taught before. In 1933 and 1934 he was in charge of writing the education plan. Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer Pera Atasheva (1900–65) in 1934. They remained married until his death in 1948. There is some question about his sexuality.\n\nIn 1935, he began another project, \"Bezhin Meadow\". It appears the movie had many of the same problems as \"Que Viva Mexico\". Eisenstein decided to movie two versions of the plot. One was for adult viewers and one was for children. He failed to set a clear shooting schedule. He also used a lot of film which meant a lot of costs and missed deadlines. The movie ran into problems because it was not fully supported by its American financers.\n\nThe thing that may have saved Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up saying that the \"Bezhin Meadow\" problems, along with several other problems facing the business, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been watching him. In the end, this made Boris Shumyatsky, \"executive producer\" of Soviet movies since 1932 to blame. In early 1938, he was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot. (The production executive at movie studio Mosfilm, where Meadow was being made, was also replaced, but without more executions).\n\nEisenstein was then able to impress Stalin again for \"one more chance\", and he chose, from two offerings, the job of a movie of \"Alexander Nevsky,\" with music composed by Sergei Prokofiev. This time, however, he was also given a co-writer, Pyotr Pavlenko, to bring in a completed script. He had professional actors to play the roles. He also had an assistant director, Dmitri Vasilyev, to make the filming faster.\n\nThe result was a movie critically received by both the Soviets and in the West. He won the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. It was an obvious allegory and hard warning against the growing forces of Nazi Germany. This was started, completed, and put in theatres all within 1938. It was Eisenstein's first movie in nearly a decade. It also his first movie with sound.\n\nBut, within months of its release, Stalin entered into his agreement with Hitler. \"Nevsky\" was quickly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching. He was assigned to direct Richard Wagner's \"Die Walküre\" at the Bolshoi Theatre. Eisenstein had to wait until Hitler's sent German troops across the Soviet border in a fatal first strike, to see \"Nevsky\" receive wide distribution and real international success.\n\nWith the war coming to Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to Alma-Ata. There is where he first considered the idea of making a movie about Czar Ivan IV. Eisenstein wrote letters to Prokofiev from Alma-Ata. Prokofiev joined him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed the score for Eisenstein's movie. Eisenstein designed sets for an opera version of \"War and Peace\" that Prokofiev was creating.\n\nEisenstein's movie, \"Ivan The Terrible, Part I\", showing Ivan IV of Russia as a national hero, was liked by Joseph Stalin (and it won a Stalin Prize). The sequel, \"Ivan The Terrible, Part II\", was not approved of by the government. All the film from the not-finished \"\" was taken away, and most of it was destroyed (though several filmed scenes still exist today).\n\nEisenstein's health was also failing. He had a heart attack during the making of this movie. He died soon after of another heart attack at the age of 50. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n\nEisenstein was one of the first to use montage, a specific form of movie editing. He and Lev Kuleshov, two of the first movie theorists, said that montage was the basis of movies. His articles and books — especially \"Film Form\" and \"The Film Sense\" — explain the need for montage in detail.\n\nHis writings and movies have continued to have a major impact on later filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just explaining a scene or moment through a \"linkage\" of related images. Eisenstein felt the \"collision\" of shots could be used to control the feelings of the audience and create movie metaphors. He believed that an idea should be concluded from comparing two different shots. This is what made a collage or montage within movie. He developed what he called \"methods of montage\":\n\n\nEisenstein taught movie making during his career at GIK. He also wrote the lessons for the directors' course there. His classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭ's \"Lessons with Eisenstein.\" Exercises and examples for students were based on literature such as Honoré de Balzac's \"Le Père Goriot.\" Another situation students had to produce was the staging of the Haitian struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's \"The Black Consul,\". Eisenstein also taught the specifics of directing, photography, and editing. He encouraged his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity. Eisenstein's teaching, like his movies, were politically charged and contained quotes from Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn his first movies, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives did not focus on individual characters. Instead, they addressed broad social issues, especially class conflict. He used basic characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the matching classes. He avoided using stars. Eisenstein's vision of communism brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling system of Joseph Stalin. Like many Bolshevik artists, Eisenstein pictured a new society which would pay for artists totally. This would free them from bosses and budgets. It would leave them free to create. But budgets and producers were as important to the Soviet movie business as the rest of the world. The isolated, post-revolution, new nation did not have the resources to nationalize its movie business at first. When it did, limited resources — both monetary and equipment — required production controls as big as in the capitalist world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "143225", "title": "Sergei Eisenstein"}

The name probably comes from an Aboriginal word, \"Yarrh\" (or \"Yharr\"), which means 'running water'.\n\nYass is about 280 km southwest of Sydney and is 56 km north of Canberra. It is on the Hume Highway which is the main road between Melbourne and Sydney. The new Hume Freeway goes around the town. The Yass River flows past the town. It later flows into the Murrumbidgee River.\n\nYass has an impressive and historic main street. It includes many 19th century hotels with large verandahs. It is popular with tourists, some from Canberra and others taking a break from the Hume Highway.\n\nThe Pride of Erin Festival and Yass Show are held in March. The Yass Arts-and-Crafts Festival is held in November.\n\nIn 1821 the Yass area was discovered by the European explorer Hamilton Hume. In 1830 a small village began. It started where the road crossed the Yass River. The road became the main road to Melbourne.\n\nYass became a District Council in 1842. By 1848 there were 248 people living in Yass. On 13 March, 1873, the Municipal District of Yass was begun. James Cottrell was elected as the first Mayor of Yass.\n\nOne of Australia's best known poets, A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson came to the area with his family in 1871. He was only 7 and spent his childhood in the district, near Binalong. He later bought a property at Wee Jasper, near Yass, so that his children could enjoy a country life. Poet and priest Patrick Hartigan was born near Yass in 1878. He studied at the local convent school as a youth. He wrote using the name John O'Brien.\n\nSir Walter Merriman started a farm called 'Merryville'. It became one of Australia's most famous sheep farms. It produced some of the best fine wool in 1903. Yass is an important area for raising sheep which have very fine wool. This is because of the soil and climate in the Yass area.\n\nYass was one of the sites suggested for the Australian Federal Capital after 1901.\n\nBecause of the steep hills the New South Wales Government Railways built the railway a few kilometres from the town. The people in Yass wanted the railway to pass closer or even through the town. In 1892, a light railway or tram was built to connect Yass Junction on the main railway line and Yass Town.\n\nYass Junction was the nearest railway station on the Sydney Melbourne railway to serve the national capital at Canberra. The uniform gauge (distance between the rails) railway line between Melbourne and Sydney was opened in 1961. The special train had to stop at Yass Junction to pick up William Charles Wentworth. He was a member of parliament who had worked hard to get the railway built. He could not get on the train at Sydney because he was needed in the parliament at Canberra.\n\nSt Augustine's Parish Yass began in 1838 with the laying of the foundation stone of the church now called the Chapel.\n\nAn unusual modern style new building (the 'big' church) was begun in 1954. The bishop in charge was Bishop Young who later became the Archbishop of Hobart. The design for the church was by the architects Fowell Mansfield and Maclurcan of Sydney. The builder was James Wallace of 123 Sussex St Sydney.\n\nThere are important works of art by famous Australian sculptor Tom Bass in the Church:\n\n\nThe foundation stone of the new church was laid on 11 April 1954 by Archbishop Eris O'Brien and the church was opened on 29 April 1956, by Archbishop Guilford Young. Fifty year celebrations were organised on 29 April 2006 by Father Laurie Bent.\n\n\n", "id": "143240", "title": "Yass, New South Wales"}

Especially its frequency is between 300 MHz and 3 GHz (3,000 MHz). Because of short wavelength, UHF has strong directivity and it has small area. UHF is commonly used for television signals. It is strong enough to be protected from other signal, but because of its strong directivity, receiving error by an obstacle occurs more. Hence it needs sensitive sensors.\nUHF frequencies have higher attenuation from atmospheric moisture and benefit less from 'bounce', or the reflection of signals off the ionosphere back to earth, when compared to VHF frequencies. The frequencies of 300–3000 MHz are always at least an order of magnitude above the MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency). The MUF for most of the earth is generally between 25–35 MHz. Higher frequencies also benefit less from ground mode transmission. However, the short wavelengths of UHF frequencies allow compact receiving antennas with narrow elements; many people consider them less ugly than VHF-receiving models\n\nOn December 29, 1949 KC2XAK of Bridgeport, Connecticut became the first UHF television station to operate on a regular daily schedule. \nIn the United States, UHF stations (broadcast channels above 13) originally gained a reputation for being more locally owned, less polished, less professional, less popular, and for having a weaker signal than their VHF counterparts (channels 2–13).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143324", "text": "Photoelectric effect\n\nThe photoelectric effect is a phenomenon in physics. The effect is based on the idea that electromagnetic radiation is made of a series of particles called photons. When a photon hits an electron on a metal surface, the electron can be emitted. The emitted electrons are called photoelectrons. The effect is also called the Hertz Effect, because it was discovered by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, but this name is not used often.\n\nThe photoelectric effect has helped physicists understand the quantum nature of light and electrons. The concept of wave–particle duality was developed because of the photoelectric effect.\n\nNot every electromagnetic wave will cause the photoelectric effect, only radiation of a certain frequency or higher will cause the effect. The minimum frequency needed is called the \"cutoff frequency\" or \"threshold frequency'. The cutoff frequency is used to find the work function, w, which is the amount of energy holding the electron to the metal surface. The work function is a property of the metal and is not affected by the incoming radiation. If a frequency of light strikes the metal surface that is greater than the cutoff frequency, then the emitted electron will have some kinetic energy.\n\nThe energy of a photon causing the photoelectric effect is found through E = hf = KE + w, where h is Planck's constant, 6.626X10^(-34) J*s, f is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, KE is the kinetic energy of the photoelectron and w is the work function for the metal. If the photon has a lot of energy, compton scattering(~thousands of eV) or pair production(~millions of eV) may take place.\n\nThe intensity of the light does not cause ejection of electrons, only light of the cut off frequency or higher can do that. However increasing the intensity of light will increase the number of electrons being emitted, as long as the frequency is above the cut off frequency.\n\nThe first observation of the photoelectric effect was by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. He reported that a spark jumped more readily between two charged spheres if light was shining on them. Further studies were done to learn about the effect observed by Hertz, however it wasn't until 1905 that a theory was proposed that explained the effect completely. The theory was proposed by Einstein and it made the claim that electromagnetic radiation had to be thought of as a series of particles, called photons, which collide with the electrons on the surface and emit them. This theory ran contrary to the belief that electromagnetic radiation was a wave and thus it was not recognised as correct until 1916 when Robert Millikan performed a series of experiments using a vacuum photo-tube to confirm the theory.\n", "id": "143324", "title": "Photoelectric effect"}

The words \"white supremacy\" are sometimes used to describe a political idea that shows the social and political dominance of whites.\n\nWhite supremacy is a form of racism. White supremacists also want racial separation, which means people of different races living apart. White supremacy has often resulted in anti-black racism and antisemitism (Anti-Jewish hate).\n\nDifferent kinds of white supremacy have different ideas of whiteness, and not all white supremacist groups agree on which group is their worst enemy. White supremacists often consider Jews to be the biggest threat to their cause, because they think Jews are able to mix much more easily than other ethnic groups.\n\nPolitically, socially and economically, white supremacy was common in the United States before the American Civil War and for decades after. The same is true of apartheid in South Africa and of parts of Europe at different time periods; importantly under Nazi Germany's Third Reich. The size of White supremacy's influence on Western culture, and the way in which it influences society, is still being debated. In some parts of the United States, many people who were considered non-white could not vote and were not allowed to be part of the government. They were also not allowed to hold most government jobs — well into the second half of the 20th century. White leaders often thought of Native Americans and Australian Aborigines as stopping society from going forward, rather than as settlers in their own right. Many European-settled countries at the Pacific Ocean limited immigration from Asian and Pacific countries. Many U.S. states banned marriage between races, through \"anti-miscegenation laws\" until 1967, when these laws were changed. South Africa kept its white supremacist-like Apartheid system until the early 1990s.\n\nWhite supremacists have become linked with a racist part of the skinhead subculture, though when the skinhead scene first developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s, it was heavily influenced by Jamaican rude boys and British mods. By the 1980s, \na large white power skinhead faction had formed.\n\nWhite supremacist groups can be found in most countries and regions with a large white population, including North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Latin America. In all of these areas, their views represent a small amount of the population, and the amount of people who are active in the groups is quite small. The militant approach taken by white supremacist groups has caused them to be watched closely by law enforcement officials. Some European countries have laws stopping hate speech, as well as other laws that ban or limit some white supremacist organizations (but not all).\n\nThe Christian Identity movement, which is regarded by most other Christians as heretical is closely tied to white supremacy. Although the Ku Klux Klan's reasons for supporting racial segregation are not mainly based on religious ideals, some Klan groups are openly Christian Protestant because of their northern European/Germanic roots.\nSome white supremacists say that they follow the Odinist religion, although most Odinists reject white supremacy, and white supremacists make up only a small part of those who support Odinism (belief in the gods of Norse mythology). Some white supremacist groups, such as the South African Boeremag, put elements of Christianity and Odinism together.\n\nThe World Church of the Creator, now called the Creativity Movement promotes a federally-recognized racial religious creed called Creativity. The basic ideology is based on the idea of a sound mind in a sound body in a sound society in a sound environment. The religion is dedicated to the \"survival, expansion and advancement of the white race\" and \"building a whiter and brighter world.\" Central to this is a unique \"holy war\" referred to as \"RAHOWA\" is which members of the white race must take steps to preserve their white race. They believe that all races are at enmity with each other for territory and natural resources and their war is a religious war. They are not Christian and essentially atheistic agnostic.\n\n\n\n", "id": "143398", "title": "White supremacy"}

She was interested in sculpture, and was a notable architect. In 1871, she married John, Marquess of Lorne (Duke of Argyll from 1900), but the marriage was unhappy. They made up with each other in the 1900s, and after Argyll's death in 1914, she had a nervous breakdown. She died in 1939 at the age of 91. \n\nLouise was born at Buckingham Palace, the main British royal home in London. Her mother was Queen Victoria, and her father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Louise spent much of her early life moving between the different royal homes that her parents stayed in. These included Buckingham Palace; Osborne House on the Isle of Wight; Windsor Castle in Berkshire; and Balmoral Castle in Scotland. \nLouise's education was similar to her brothers and sisters. She was given a basic education, as well as tasks such as cookery, carpentry and farming. She was good at art, especially sculpture. Hallam Tennyson, son of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, wrote that Louise could \"draw beautifully\". She was also good at acting and dancing. The Queen wrote that Louise \"danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters\". She wanted to know about a lot of things, which gave her the nickname \"Little Miss Why\" from members of the royal family.\n\nLouise's father, Prince Albert, became ill with typhoid fever, and died on 14 December 1861. Queen Victoria was very sad after this happened, as she and Albert were a loving couple. While the Queen mourned, the court became morbid, and Louise quickly became fed up with it. On her 17th birthday, she asked if the ballroom could be opened for a dance, but Queen Victoria refused. Louise's irritation, in turn, irritated the Queen, who did not like Louise's arguments.\n\nThe Queen never really got over Albert's death, but she made herself feel better by sticking to Albert's plans for her children's marriages. In 1862, Louise's sister, Princess Alice, married Prince Louis of Hesse; in 1863, Albert Edward, Prince of Wales married Princess Alexandra of Denmark; and in 1866, Princess Helena married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. With Louise's elder sisters now married, Louise was left to be the Queen's helper. Despite not being happy about it, the Queen agreed with this, and was surprised by the results. The Queen wrote: \"She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.\" In her new role, Louise was less bored by the court, because she had more things to do.\n\n\n", "id": "143449", "title": "Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll"}

It is between three mountain ranges and extends over eight Indian states; in particular the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are on this plateau. \n\nThe plateau covers , 43 percent of India's landmass.\n\nThe uplands, areas of higher land, make up a triangle nested in the familiar downward-pointing triangle of the Indian sub-continent's coastline. In the south of India the plateau is mostly over above sea level. In the north it is mostly about above sea level. \nThe plateau is extremely large and there are many habitats: different ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains.\n\nOn the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges rise from their nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India. The mountains make the southward-pointing vertex of a triangle. The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range. These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India.\n\nThe name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word \"dakkhin\". That word comes from the Sanskrit word \"dakṣiṇa-\" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.\n\nThe Deccan Traps are a main cause of the special geography and geology of South India. They are a large igneous province on the Deccan Plateau of west-central India (between 17–24N, 73–74E) and one of the largest volcanic features on Earth. They consist of multiple layers of solidified flood basalt that are more than thick and cover an area of . The term 'trap', used in geology for such rock formations, is derived from the Dutch word for stairs, referring to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.\n\nThe Deccan Traps formed between 60 and 68 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the Western Ghats (near Mumbai) some 66 million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted fewer than 30,000 years in total. The gases released in the process may have played a role in the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. The consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the Chicxulub impact event in Central America, but that the Deccan eruptions also damaged the world's environment.\n\nBefore the Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by erosion and plate tectonics, it is estimated that the original area covered by the lava flows was as large as 1.5 million km², about half the size of modern India. The present area of directly observable lava flows is estimated to be around .\n\nThe release of volcanic gases, particularly sulfur dioxide, during the formation of the traps contributed to contemporary climate change. Data point to an average fall in temperature of in this period.\n", "id": "143475", "title": "Deccan Plateau"}

Some specially designed grenades are fired from rifles or specially made grenade launchers. There are grenades which contain tear gas. These are used to control riots.\n\nHand grenades are used by the infantry. There are three main types: one which gives a big powerful blast to destroy bunkers, another which starts fires and another which contains shrapnel to hurt enemy soldiers. A hand grenade is usually shaped like an egg, with a metal-arm on its top and a ring. When the ring is pulled out, the arm flips up and ignites a fuse. The user then has a few seconds to throw it and take cover, usually about 5 seconds. It explodes on impact and may injure or even kill people.\n\nEarly grenades were iron balls, filled with gunpowder and with a long fuse that its user must light up with a match before throwing. Some were too big to throw, so soldiers rolled them. Some armies assigned special soldiers called \"grenadiers\" to throw or roll grenades. \n\nThe German army used stick grenades (grenades with handles) during World War I and World War II.

Larvae have globular abdomens and narrower, flattened heads bearing sickle-shaped jaws. Adults superficially resemble drab-colored, 1 ½ inch long damselflies with four long, narrow, net-veined wings roof-like held over a long, skinny abdomen when at rest. Unlike damselflies, however, ant-lion antennae are prominent and clubbed at the end.\n\nDigestion\n\nAntlions burrow in the ground, forming a pit for prey to fall into. The pit is angled so that the sides of the pit crumble when the victim tries to climb out. After being swallowed by the antlion, the victim is kept alive and slowly digested over 1,000 years, where they will fund a new definition of pain and suffering. The prey is restrained by tentacles in the stomach to prevent it from escaping.

He is most well known for the songs \"American Pie\" and \"Vincent\".\n\nIn his early career, Don McLean mainly played folk music. He sang folk songs and played simple chords with acoustic guitar and harmonica. In 1969, Don Mclean joined folk singer Pete Seeger in the environment campaign. They gave talks and playing concerts to help people know some of the problems with the environment. Also in the same year, Don McLean released his first album \"Tapestry\". This album was not very successful. McLean continued to perform in many small places.\n\nIn 1971, Don Mclean released an 8-minute-long song named \"American Pie\". The song was dedicated to Don McLean’s music hero Buddy Holly. Much of the song was about the deaths of Holly, Richie Valens and J.P. Richardson (\"The Big Bopper\") in 1959. It also dealt with many important events in American history. Quickly \"American Pie\" became the number 1 song in the United States. Don Mclean became a superstar and drew many audiences to his concerts. In 2005, \"American Pie\" was voted 5th in the \"365 songs of the century\" list. His second single \"Vincent\", featuring Vincent Van Gogh's masterpiece \"Starry Night\", also topped the UK and US charts in 1971. The song is played in Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam every day.\n\nIn the later 1970s, Don McLean tried other styles of songs. He was not as popular with these other styles. Bad sales of albums caused him to change recording companies from one to another. Finally, in 1980, Don McLean regained his popularity by playing \"Crying\", a song first sang by Roy Orbison. The song reached the first place in UK chart. \n\nDon McLean is not as popular today as he was before. He is still writing and singing his own songs and performing in concerts.\n\nThe famous guitar player, Eric Clapton, spoke highly of Don McLean’s guitar playing skill after listening to his guitar performance. Also, Don McLean’s performance on stage once inspired Lori Lieberman to write the 1974 Grammy-winning song \"Killing me softly with his song\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143838", "text": "Diacritic\n\nA diacritic (for example, an \"accent\") is a mark put above, below, through or on a letter. The word comes from the Greek word διακριτικός (transl. diakritikós = 'distinguishing').\nUsually, it affects the way the word is said (pronounced). Most diacritics concern pronunciation because most alphabets do not describe the sounds of words exactly. Diacritics are rare in English, but common in many other languages.\n\nDiacritics are not used much in modern English. There are two types of diacritics that have become part of everyday English: the dot and the apostrophe. But they are no longer commonly thought of as being diacritical. The apostophe is used to show missing letters (elision, \"it's\" to replace \"it is\") and show possession (as in \"Mike's car\").\n\nIn most other cases, use of diacritics for native English words is considered old-fashioned (not used anymore). Diaereses (similar to umlauts) can be used on words where two vowels next to each other are pronounced separately (rather than together as a diphthong), like \"noöne\", \"reëstablished\", or \"coöperate\". This method is still used sometimes, depending on the word. Diacritics are sometimes used in loanwords (words of foreign origin), such as \"naïve\", \"entrée\", \"pâté\".\n\nLetter e: common are the acute accent é (rising voice, as in the French word née), grave accent è (lowering voice); \"élève\" has (from the left) acute, grave and silent e. The cedilla ç denotes a soft c. \n\nA different principle is illustrated by the circumflex î. This usually shows the loss of letter: e.g. maistre (Middle French) > maître (modern French). Thus its function is historical. Also, less often, the circumflex is used to distinguish between homophones. These are words spelt the same, but with different meanings. Example: \"sur\" = on, but \"sûr\" = safe. In those cases the pronunciation of the two words may be different.\n\nIn Spanish the acute accent simply signals stress, e.g. \"educación\". There the stress is on the last vowel, not on the second to last. Second to last vowel (syllable) is the usual position for stress in spoken Spanish. It is usually not signalled by an accent. \n\nThe tilde ñ is pronounced like ny, and counts as a letter in their dictionaries, coming after n.\n\nThe umlaut ü in German is pronounced ue, and is less used in modern German. Historical name-spellings should always keep the umlaut if it was used for that name.\n\nThe Scandinavian languages treat the characters with diacritics ä, ö and å as new and separate letters of the alphabet, and sort them after z. Usually ä is sorted as equal to æ (ash) and ö is sorted as equal to ø (o-slash). Also, aa, when used as an alternative spelling to å, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ü is frequently sorted as y.\n\nScripts for semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew have a wide variety of diacritics. This is partly because the semitic languages were originally formed without separate letters for vowels, and partly because some of the languages (Arabic in particular) are spoken in a number of dialects. \n\nThe diacritics in Hebrew and Arabic are not always used, however.\n", "id": "143838", "title": "Diacritic"}

They especially like old whelk shells. When the hermit crab grows in size, it finds a larger shell.\n\nThe hermit crab is a crustacean, but it is very different from other crustaceans. While most crustaceans are covered from head to tail with a hard exoskeleton, the hermit crab is missing part of its exoskeleton. The back part where its abdomen is located, is soft and squishy. Thus, the minute a hermit crab molts into an adult, it sets out to find a shell in which to live.\n\nTo get into the shell, the hermit crab squeezes in backwards, securing itself with its four back legs. The back legs have hooks that anchor the hermit crab into the shell without difficulty. The next four legs are used for walking, while the front two are its chelipeds. The chelipeds are not equal in size: one is big and other is small. The larger one is used for grabbing prey and guarding the entrance to its shell. All together, hermit crabs have a total of ten legs, including the chelipeds and the rear legs used to anchor to the shell.\n\nThere are about 500 different species of hermit crabs around the world, and they have different colors, often with patterns like stripes and dots on their bodies. Most hermit crab species live on the ocean floor, but many live on land. Female terrestrial (land based) hermit crabs must return to the sea to breed.\n\nHermit crabs are omnivores (eating plants and animals) and scavengers (eating dead animals that they find). They eat worms, plankton, and organic debris.\n\nHermit crabs first appeared in the Cretaceous period, before the Dinosaurs became extinct (died out). Fossils have been found where they have used Ammonite shells.\n\nThe reproductive (sexual) organs of hermit crabs are located near and just below the animal's heart and open to the outside at the base of the last pair of walking legs in the male. In the female, they are located at the base of the middle pair of walking legs. Female hermit crabs usually lay their eggs shortly after copulating, (having sex) but they can also store sperm (male sexual cell) for many months. The eggs are fertilised as they are laid by passing through the chamber holding the sperm. The eggs are carried and hatched in a mass attached to the abdomen inside the shell.

Before 1948 Baltistan was part of Ladakh province. The language is a sub-dialect of Ladakhi and an archaic dialect of the Tibetan language, but many of the consonants that are silent in most modern Tibetan dialects are pronounced in Balti.\n\nAll people of different races, living in Baltistan are called Balti. Greeks used the word Byaltae instead of Bal-ti, which in Tibetan means water gorge. The historian Ptolemy who was also a general in the army of Alexander the Great had named the region (Byaltae) in his book. Baltistan is the Persian translation of \"Baltiyul\", “The Homeland of Balti”. The people belonging to Balti nationality are settled on both banks of the river Indus from Kargil (in the east) to Haramosh (in the west) and from Karakoram range (in the north) to Deosai plains (in the south). In this nationality the majority comes from Tibetan origin. However people migrated to this area in different periods of ancient times, on account of different reasons and after merging in the prevailing Tibetan society, gave birth to a new civilisation. All these multi-racial groups speak Balti language, which is a branch of the ancient Tibetan language. However, in some rural areas, the Sheen people still speak Shina language.\n\nThe Balti are a very forbearing, cheerful,brave and hospitable people. But during the Rmakpon reign (from 12th century to 1840 A.D.) they invaded Ladakh and Tibet many times.\n\nThere are several Balti communities in Pakistan's urban areas farther south, that is in Lahore, Islamabad, in Karachi and other places.But they are living as non Pakistani in Pakistan because Gilgit Baltistan is considered as disputed region.\n\nThe Balti language has kept many words like all the Tibetan dialects and many other languages.

A Hydrogen car does not have to be a car, it can be any transportation vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way, like an aircraft.\n\nHydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe. Even though it's simple and there's so much of it, hydrogen does not occur naturally as a gas on the earth: it's always combined with other things. Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn principle, fuel cells are electrochemical devices like batteries that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity (DC) and heat, thus doing away with combustion. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging. It will produce energy in the form of electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied.\n\nA fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched around an electrolyte. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, generating electricity water and heat. Layers of materials with distinct electrochemical properties are sandwiched together to form a single galvanic cell. At the heart lies a membrane that can only be crossed by charged molecules. Gas-permeable electrodes coated with a catalyst adhere to this membrane, adding a layer on either side. The electrodes are in turn connected to a device that can utilize electricity. Hydrogen gas flows into channels on one face of the cell and migrates through that electrode, while the same occurs with oxygen gas along the opposite electrode. Spurred by a catalyst, favorable chemistry causes the hydrogen to oxidize into hydrogen protons and give up its electrons to the neighboring electrode, which thereby becomes the anode. this buildup of negative charge then follows the path of least resistance via the external circuit to the \nother electrode. It is this flow of electrons through a circuit that creates electricity.\n\nMost important problem involved in the practical use of hydrogen car is hydrogen storage materials. If it uses a fuel cell that generates electricity through reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, it does not matter. However, if method is that hydrogen is sprayed to internal-combustion engine, it does matter. Now hydrogen storage tank with highest possibility is method using metal hydride. Metal hydride is that reversible reaction between metal and hydrogen make new form of compound. Now Hydrogen storing technology using Hydrogen storage compound metal comes to practical use step in the side of technical, however, hydrogen storing capacity per weight is no match for demand of user, so this technology does not wide use yet. Therefore, that problem should be solved.\n", "id": "143980", "title": "Hydrogen car"}

Digital broadcasting system uses digital signals when they receive sound and movie. It is compared to analog TV that uses analog signals.\n\nAccording to an ATSC standard, SDTV broadcasts in three ways.\nFirst, at ratio of length and width 16:9 and resolution 704x480.\nSecond, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 704x480 \nLastly, at ratio 4:3 and resolution 640x480.\nThe first one has best quality, second one is next, and the last one is the worst.\nThe screen's frame can be 24, 30, 60 per second. These are similar level with DVD.\nAs mentioned at the 'Definition' tab, it has a better resolution than analog TV system, and has lower resolution than HDTV.\nBecause it is a kind of digital boadcasting system, it can broadcast not only analog TV programs but also HDTV program (Of course there exists a difference in resolution).\n\nSDTV has a similar state of resolution compared to analog TV. But SDTV is more vivid than\nanalog TV because it has less noise. And it has better sound. The point that SDTV uses a digital broadcasting system makes SDTV have many accompaning functions. For example, multitasking, electronic program guide, and so on. This functions are \nimpossible at analog TV. Compared to HDTV, it has lower resolution. But in fact, HDTV programs are not spread widely yet, and the cheaper price of SDTV makes consumers to use SDTV.\n\nGenerally, there are three types of TV. They are analog TV, SDTV and HDTV.Price : AnalogTV < SDTV < HDTVQuality : AnalogTV ≒ SDTV < HDTVAnalogTV only can be compatible with analog signals, but both SDTV and HDTV can be compatible with not only analog but also digital signals.\n", "id": "143982", "title": "Standard-definition television"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144002", "text": "Thermocouple\n\nThermocouple, TC for short, is a device that converts heat directly into electricity. A thermocouple can also work in reverse - using an electric current to transform into heat as well as cold.\n\nImagine that two wires made of different types of metal are connected at one end. If the junction of the two wires is heated, electricity will flow through the wire. \n\nElectrons, when heated, will begin to cross the junction on their own. Because of the different properties of the different metals, the electrons will lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy, just like a ball rolling over a hill to a lower area. Although the voltage created by a thermocouple is very small (in the millivolt range), many thermocouples can be hooked together to make a larger voltage. This is called a thermopile.\n\nThermocouples do not only generate electricity from heat. They can also generate heat from electricity, and even cold from electricity, as a refrigerator. If two different wires are connected at both ends, and some voltage source makes current flow through the loop, one junction will get hot and the other junction will become cold. The electrons at the hot junction are gaining kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the metal hot. The electrons at the cold junction are losing kinetic energy as they cross the junction. This is why they make the junction cold.\n\nInterestingly, it is difficult to measure the precise voltage that a thermocouple is producing when heat is applied to its junction. This is because any voltmeter wires that are connected to the thermocouple will probably be made of a different material than the wires of a thermocouple. This means that the connection between the voltmeter and the thermoucouple is itself another thermocouple. Engineers designing microchips face the problem that virtually every electrical connection on a microchip is a thermocouple whether they want it to be or not.\n\nGas heaters with pilot flames are one of the most famous examples for the use of thermocouples. Thermocouples are stacked to make a thermopile, which can generate enough voltage from the heat of the pilot flame to keep the gas valve open which in turn supplies the gas for the pilot flame. If the gas runs out, the flame extinguishes and the voltage across the thermopile decreases, which causes the electric gas valve to close. Thermocouples are also used in other ways. For instance, they monitor temperatures in air conditioning and refrigerators, and of CPUs in computers, which could be destroyed by overheating.\n\nThere are hundreds of thermocouples, but only 8 of them are standardized internationally.Type E (chromel–constantan), type J (iron–constantan), type N (nicrosil–nisil), type T (copper–constantan) and type K (chromel–alumel) are base metals.Types B, R, and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinum–rhodium.\n", "id": "144002", "title": "Thermocouple"}

Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical, electronic and computer engineering, as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques. And as engineering is developing, control engineering is often wanted.\n\nIn most of the cases, control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with sail control the machine's speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's spin power accordingly. Also recently, control system is used in nanotechnology. And the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control. For example, we can change chemical process fast and easily. Many developments were invoked by this process control. Like this, control engineering has a lot if fields that include science, finance management, and even human action. \n\nThe important thing of control engineering is feedback. But control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is called open loop control. An open-loop controller, also called a non-feedback controller, is a type of controller which works out what to into a system using only the current condition and its model of the system. An example of open loop control is a washing machine that works through a scheduled cycle without the use of units.\n", "id": "144018", "title": "Control engineering"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144055", "text": "Electric vehicle\n\nAn electric vehicle is a vehicle that uses electricity for power. It was one of the first kinds of transportation that did not use horse or human power. Electric trains and cars were built in the 1830's. In the early 1900's there were more electric cars than gasoline-powered cars. But cars powered by gasoline or diesel fuel become the most common kind of car for most of the last 100 years. Electric vehicles were always used in some special cases, such as forklifts used inside a building, golf carts, trolley bus or certain vehicles used around airplanes at an airport. Today people are looking at electric vehicles again as a way to reduce pollution and use less gasoline.\n\nIt is unclear who the first inventor was, but Ányos Jedlik of Hungary built a small model of a working electric car in 1828. In the 1830's Robert Anderson of Scotland, Professor Stratingh of Holland and Thomas Davenport, a blacksmith from Vermont all built electric vehicles. Davenport is said to be the inventor of the DC electric motor. In 1865, Gaston Plante of France made a better battery. In 1886, the inventor Frank Sprague of Connecticut made important changes to the electric motor.\n\nGreat Britain and France were early leaders in making better electric cars. Interest in the electric car in the United States grew after 1891 when A. L. Ryker built a three-wheeled electric car, and William Morrison built a six-passenger wagon.\n\nThe years 1899 and 1900 were the best years for electric cars in America, as they outsold all other types of cars (steam, gasoline and diesel). One example was the 1902 Phaeton built by the Woods Motor Vehicle Company of Chicago, which had a range of 18 miles, a top speed of 14 mph and cost $2,000. (At that time, there were few good roads between towns, so most driving was for short distances). Electric cars could go as far as steam-powered cars and did not take 30 to 40 minutes to get started. Gasoline engines were smelly and noisy.\nBut then the internal combustion engine (that used gasoline and diesel) were greatly improved, and cars that used those engines could go much farther and faster than other cars.\n\nSome people would make electric cars in their garages by taking out the engine and putting in an electric motor and batteries, but for a long time, no big car company made an electric car. Only in the late 1990's did big car companies start making electric cars again. The most famous was the GM's EV-1. Now interest in alternative fuel vehicles is growing.\n\n\nA hybrid is a combination of two things. In this case, it is an electric motor, and another type of power. It's not a true electric vehicle.\n\nThere are many other types of electric vehicles. The electric trolley bus uses overhead electric lines to power it. Many trains use a railway electrification system to supply power. A few high-speed rail lines use powered magnets in the track to move the train, in a system called 'mag-lev' (magnetic levitation). There are electric bicycles and motorcycles and some tricycles (trikes) like the Corbin Motors Sparrow, which was also seen in the Austin Powers movie Goldmember. \n\nMost freight trains are diesel-electric. The locomotive has a diesel engine which provides electricity, and an electric motor which makes the wheels turn.\n\nAdvantages: These vehicles use an electric motor, so they are very quiet, no smell and no pollution from exhaust gases. They can even be used indoors. Oil for gasoline and diesel is a limited resource - it will not last forever and is becoming more expensive. If the electricity for a battery-electric vehicle comes from a renewable energy source, like a windmill, solar cells, geothermal or hydroelectric, then it will not produce as many global warming gases.\n\nDisadvantages: Batteries do not store a lot of energy, and they are large and heavy, so the vehicles usually cannot go very far. It takes a long time to recharge a battery, sometimes many hours. Good batteries can be very expensive, and all batteries need to be replaced after a while. Most electricity in the United States comes from coal or natural gas, so an electric vehicle that is powered by electricity from one of these plants will still add to global warming gases.\n\nMore electric cars are being made every year. Here are a few:\n\n", "id": "144055", "title": "Electric vehicle"}

Electronic engineers are concerned with such processes as; the transfer of information using radio waves, the design of electronic circuits, the design of computer systems, and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto-pilots and other embedded systems.\nThe term electronic engineering started to emerge in the late 1950s. Before the second world war, electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering'. At that time, studying radio engineering at a university was part of a physics degree. Later, as consumer devices started to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi and later computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name 'electronic engineering', which then became a stand alone university degree subject.\nFundamental studies of the discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace to use computer-aided design programs when designing electronics (electronic systems).\n", "id": "144067", "title": "Electronic engineering"}

This took place during the 'gold rush' in the second half of the 1800s.\n\nThe first Europeans to explore the area were Kearns, Packer and Marsh in 1822. Andrew Badgery started farming cattle in the area in the 1830s. The first European settler to live at Araluen was Henry Burnell. He was able to buy 1280 acres of land. He started farming sheep and cattle in 1835. With the help of convicts he was able to build a farm house and farm buildings.\n\nGold was found at Araluen by Alexander Waddell in September 1851. Thousands of people came to Araluen to look for gold during the gold rush. This included many Chinese gold miners. One of these miners was Quong Tart who came to Araluen when he was only nine years old. He later became a famous business man in Sydney. In the 1860s there were more than 20 hotels in Araluen. The gold was alluvial gold, found in the bottom of the creeks. In some places there was up to 12 metres of dirt and sand on top of the gold. In the 1870s the gold miners used hydraulic sluices (high pressure water hoses) to wash away all the sand and dirt. Big floating dredges (digging machines) were put in the creek. There were 11 there in the 1900s. The last dredge stopped working in 1932.\n\nA flood in the Araluen and Braidwood area killed 24 people on January 1, 1860. The flood destroyed the town. After the gold rush was over most people left the town. The Court House, built about 1861, is now used as a place for tourists to stay.\n\nIn May 1865 the bushranger Ben Hall and his gang tried to hold up the Araluen gold coach. The coach carried gold from the Araluen gold fields to Braidwood. This was a very steep road and very hard for a wagon pulled by horses to travel along. Often the only way to goods in and out of the valley was to drag them up or down on sleds. The wagons could not go very fast, so this was a good spot for the bushrangers to rob the coach. The gold coach usually had a policeman with a gun sitting next to the driver. There were two more policemen on the back of the carriage. Four more policemen rode on horses in front and behind the coach. The gold was kept in a safe which was bolted to floor of the coach. (The coach has been restored and is on display at the Braidwood Museum)\n. The police were able to keep the bushrangers away from the coach, but Constable Kelly was wounded in the shooting.\n\nThe Araluen valley is now well known for its fruit farms and orchards. The fruit is sent to Canberra, Sydney and to other countries.\n\nAustralian poet, Henry Kendall (1839-1882), wrote a poem called Araluen. This describes the quiet and peaceful mood of the valley. It includes the words \"\"Araluen -- home of dreams...\"\". He also called his first daughter Araluen. She was named after the Araluen Creek. She died in 1870 at the age of 13 months.\n\nAraluen is home to author Jackie French.\n\nIn November every year, the Braidwood Folk Music club have a weekend of folk music called \"Music at the Creek\". This is held at the Majors Creek reserve, near the site of the Ben Hall robbery.\n\nThe Araluen Zieria (Zieria adenophora), is a small shrub about 50cm tall and 50 cm wide. It is only found in one place, a slope above the Araluen Creek. There are only 56 known plants. It has been listed as Endangered under the Australian government's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. It is also listed by the New South Wales Government, Endangered (Schedule 1, Part 1) on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995. There is now a plan to protect the plant.

It lived in grassland, scrubland and coastal regions of New Zealand, but is now so rare they can only be seen on protected offshore islands. Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the Maori language.\n\nKakapos are most active at night (nocturnal), and like to be alone. To keep other kakapos out of their territory, they make a 'skraaarking' sound. The Kakapo can live for about 60 years.\n\nKakapo are herbivores. They eat roots, seeds, leaves, bugs, small pine cones, fruit, and flowers.\n\nUnlike other parrots, male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound. There are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid. The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree. The female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks. She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food.\n\nKakapo had no natural enemies on the islands of New Zealand were they live, and lost the ability to fly. At one time there were many kakapo. Now only about 150 kakapo still live in New Zealand. It is a critically endangered species. The decrease in the number of kakapo is mostly from predatory animals (for example, cats, dogs, stoats, ferrets,and rats) that settlers brought with them to New Zealand. The kakapo was also eaten by Maori and European settlers.\n\nAt one point, kakapo were almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s. As of January 2009, surviving Kakapos are kept on two predator-free islands, Codfish (Whenua Hou) and Anchor islands, where they are closely monitored. Two large Fiordland islands, Resolution and Secretary, have been prepared as self-sustaining ecosystems for the Kakapo.\n\nThe conservation of the Kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the Kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being \"Two in the Bush\", made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962. A feature-length documentary, won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival.\n\nTwo of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are \"Kakapo - Night Parrot\" (1982) and \"To Save the Kakapo\" (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in \"The Life of Birds\". It was also one of the endangered animals that Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book \"Last Chance to See\". An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island.\n", "id": "144294", "title": "Kakapo"}

Instead, each player at the table must ante first, and then is dealt two cards face down (hole cards) and one card face up. In typical stud games, the player with the lowest card showing must pay the ‘bring in,’ an amount relative to the limits, which starts off the action.\n\nThe bring in is typically a fraction of the limits, (for example, the bring in for a $1/2 stud game may be $.25), with play then continuing clockwise around the table, where players have the choice of folding, calling the bring in, or making the bet ‘complete’ (in our example, completing the bet to $1). Once a bring in has been completed, it can be raised by a subsequent player, doubling the amount to twice the completed bet.\n\nEach player remaining in the hand is then dealt another card face up, with the betting beginning with the player showing the highest two cards and proceeding clockwise around the table. Again, players can fold, call, or raise the bet. In a five card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then two cards face up, with the fifth card being dealt facedown. In a seven card stud game, players are dealt two hole cards facedown, then four cards face up, with the seventh card being dealt facedown.\n\nBetting takes place between each dealt card and generally becomes a higher amount after the fourth card dealt. \nEach round of betting is typically referred to by the amount of cards a player has in front of them. After the initial deal, players are considered to be betting on ‘third street’, represented by having three cards in front of them. After the fourth card is dealt, players would then be on ‘fourth street’, and so on. Stud poker is generally played as a limit game. \n\n\n", "id": "144310", "title": "Stud poker"}

It is the centre and main city of the Local Government Area of Parkes Shire. Parkes is on the main Australian transcontinental railway line between Sydney and Perth. The Newell Highway between Victoria and Queensland goes through the city.\n\nParkes has had an important role in science. it is the home of the Parkes Radio Telescope. As well as local research done at the radio telescope, Parkes scientists have helped NASA. For several missions the telescope was the Southern Hemisphere relay and communications station. The movie \"The Dish\" was based on the job of the telescope during the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing.\n\nThere are many different kinds of farms around Parkes. Most farms are growing wheat and sheep.\n\nParkes is has a gold and copper mine, Northparkes, north of the town.\n\nParkes was an important transport centre after the railway was built in 1893. Many passenger and freight trains stopped at Parkes up until the 1980s. Governments began cutting back the NSW country rail systems and the trains are no longer an important part of Parkes. One company, FCL has a big train and truck transport centre at Gooobang Junction on Parkes' western edge. It was opened on 20 October 2006 by NSW Premier Morris Iemma. Specialised Container Transport's transport terminal is built on a 296 hectare site. It has 5 km of railway sidings, a 7,400 square metre warehouse and about 40 people work there. An even larger terminal to be built nearby is also being planned.\n\nOver the years governments and businesses have talked about making Parkes an \"inland port\". Parkes Regional Airport would be made much bigger. This would become a starting point for goods coming from Australia and other countries that were to be sent to places in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. All the studies have been done, agreements to start building have been made, some land has been bought.\n\nThe Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW has the Western Regional Office built in Parkes. Country Energy which supplies electricity and gas has a training and maintenance (repair) centre.\n\nMany people come to Parkes to see the CSIRO radio telescope which is 20km north of town on the Newell Highway. other things to see are Bushmans Hill, and the War Memorial Lookout. Nearby there is the Goobang National Park, and Peak Hill. peak Hill has an open cut mine (a big hole in the ground) that can be visited during holidays. There are also many great parks.\n\nParkes was started as a settlement in 1853. It was first called \"Currajong\" after the many kurrajong trees in the local area. After a while it was called \"Bushman's\" after the local gold mine named Bushman's Lead.\n\nIn 1873 the town was renamed to Parkes in honour of Sir Henry Parkes. He is called the \"Father of the Federation\". Sir Henry Parkes is famous in Australia for getting Australia to become one country in 1901. Before this Australia was made up of separate British colonies.\n\nA lot of people came to Parkes in the gold rush of the 1870s. There are still mining companies with sites in the local area.\n\nParkes has a dry climate. The winter temperatures are rarely lower than 0 degrees Celsius during the night. In summer daytime temperatures can be as high as 40 to 45 degrees Celsius. Temperatures in the low to mid-30s are most common.\n\nParkes has a local bus service run by Western Road Liners. It took over from Harris Bus Lines in March 2006. The Indian Pacific train also stops twice a week. The Broken Hill Outback Xplorer service, run by CountryLink, goes to Broken Hill on Mondays and to Sydney on Tuesdays. Parkes railway station is situated on the Broken Hill railway line. It was opened in 1893. There was also a small station at Parkes Racecourse from 1923 to 1937.\n\n\nParkes hosts a yearly Elvis Presley Festival in early January to celebrate Elvis Presley's birthday. The first festival, held in 1993, was a one night show with 200 people coming along. Over the next few years more events were added and the festival was extended to two days. By January 2005 the 3,500 people came to the festival. In January 2006 there were 5,000 going to the festival. It brought about $8 million into Parkes.\n\nThe 2007 festival had over 60 events and was held over 5 days. More than 6,000 visitors attended. A new world record was set for the most Elvis impersonators (people trying to look like Elvis) in one place. SBS TV made a half-hour film about the festival. It was called \"Elvis Lives in Parkes\".

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144387", "text": "Id, ego, and super-ego\n\nThe Id, ego, and super-ego are ideas created by Sigmund Freud. They are three concepts used to explain the way the human mind works.\n\nFreud describes the human mind as interaction of id, ego, super-ego. The ego, and to some extent the super-ego, is conscious or on the surface. The id remains unconscious. Together they make up the personality.\n\nAccording to this model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the ego is the organized, realistic part; and the super-ego plays the critical and moralising role.\n\nThe id, ego and super-ego are functions of the mind, \"not\" parts of the brain. They do not correspond one-to-one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience.\n\nThe id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present. The id is governed by the 'pleasure principle'.\n\nEarly in the development of his theory Freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id. After the tragedy of World War I, however, Freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id. So, he proposed thanatos, the death instinct. Thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind. Obviously, the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts. By adding thanatos, he could describe more mental phenomena. His idea of id had wide influence.\n\nThe id is unconscious by definition: \n\nThe ego is the surface of the personality, the part you usually show the world. The ego is governed by the 'reality principle', or a practical approach to the world. It seeks to turn the id’s drive to behaviour which brings benefits in the long term rather than grief.\n\nConscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious.\n\nThe ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organise our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. \n\nBut the ego \"serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id\". Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. \"Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it, and readily 'breaks out in anxiety\".\n\nThe Super-ego aims for perfection. It comprises that part of the personality, mainly unconscious, which includes the individual's ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called \"conscience\") that criticises and prohibits his or her drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. \n\nThe superego consists of two parts, the conscience and the ego-ideal. The conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder. The conscience decides what course of action one should take. The ego-ideal is an idealized view of one's self. Comparisons are made between the ego-ideal and one's actual behavior. Both parts of the super-ego develop through experience with others or via social interactions. According to Freud, a strong super-ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id, while a weak super-ego gives in to the id's urgings. Further, the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low, respectively.\n", "id": "144387", "title": "Id, ego, and super-ego"}

This means doenjang has been an important food in Korea for a long time.\n\nThe main ingredients of Doenjang are sea water and \"Meju\". The basic way to make Doenjang is to take Mejus and put them into big jars with sea water. Bad bacteria and odor are removed by adding charcoal and sun-dried chili peppers. Liquid is then taken out to make Korean soy sauce. This sauce takes about 20 to 30 days to make. The Mejus are taken out from the jar and tempered. Salt and soy sauce is added on this paste and the paste is put in jars again. After sun-drying for several days, it becomes Doenjang.\n\nThere are several kinds of Doenjang; Chungukjang, Makjang, Dambukjang, BbamjangBbagaejang, Patjang, Jipjang, Garoojang, and Borijang.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144504", "text": "West Punjab\n\nWest Punjab was a former province of Pakistan which existed from 1947 to 1955. The province covered an area of ,including much of the current Punjab province and the Islamabad Capital Territory, but excluding the former princely states of Bahawalpur. The capital was the city of Lahore and the province was mad up of four divisions (Lahore, Sargodha, Multan and Rawalpindi). The province was bordered by the Indian states of East Punjab to the east, the princely state of Bahawalpur to the south, the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh to the southwest, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northwest, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Occupied Kashmir to the northeast.\n\nThe independence of Pakistan in 1947 led to the divisions of the Punjab province into two new provinces. The East Punjab where most people were Sikh and Hindu became part of the new nation of India while the mainly Muslim West Punjab became part of the new nation of Pakistan. The name of the province was shortened to Punjab in 1950. West Punjab was merged into the province of West Pakistan in 1955 under the One Unit policy announced by Prime Minister Chaudhry Mohammad Ali. When that province was dissolved, the area of the former province of West Punjab was combined with the former state of Bahawalpur to form a new Punjab Province.\n\nAt independence there was a Muslim majority in West Punjab with significant minorities of Hindus and Sikhs. Nearly all of these minorities left West Punjab for India, to be replaced by large numbers of Muslims fleeing in the opposite direction. The official language of West Punjab was Urdu but most of the population spoke Punjabi using the Shahmukhi script.\n\nThe offices of \"Governor\" of West Punjab and \"Chief Minister\" of West Punjab lasted from August 15 1947, until 14th October 1955. The first Governor was Sir Francis Mudie with Iftikhar Hussain Khan as the first Chief Minister. Both offices were abolished in 1955, when the province of West Pakistan was created. The last Governor of West Punjab, Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani, became the first Governor of West Pakistan.\n\n\n", "id": "144504", "title": "West Punjab"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144592", "text": "Hurricane Andrew\n\nAlthough the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season was below average, Hurricane Andrew was the exception to that. This hurricane blasted the Bahamas, southeast Florida and south central Louisiana, taking a path extremely similar to Hurricane Betsy, which also struck southern Florida and Louisiana. However, unlike Betsy, Andrew did not make flooding in New Orleans. Contrary to typical, damage from Hurricane Andrew was caused almost entirely by high winds rather than storm surge in Florida and Louisiana. This storm caused between $23 billion and $37 billion in damage (1992 USD) and between 56 and 68 fatalities, making Andrew the costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States.\nHowever, Hurricane Katrina would later surpass Andrew in official damage amounts.\n\nAndrew's devastating damage spawned many rumors. These included claims that hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south Dade County (now Miami-Dade County) were killed and their deaths were not reported in official accounts. An investigation by the \"Miami Herald\" found no basis for such rumors. These rumors were probably based on the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, when the deaths of migrant workers initially went uncounted, and were still debated at the time of Andrew.\n\nThe slow response of federal aid to storm victims in southern Florida led Dade County emergency management director Kate Hale to become famous. At a nationally televised news conference, she exclaimed: \"Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one? They keep saying we're going to get supplies. For God's sake, where are they?\" Almost immediately, President George H. W. Bush promised, \"Help is on the way,\" and mobile kitchens and tents, along with units from the 82nd Airborne Division, began pouring in.\n\nInsurance claims in the wake of the extreme damage caused by Andrew led to the bankruptcy and closure of 11 insurance agencies and drained an excessive amount of equity from 30 more. Nearly one million residences were no longer eligible for coverage by any insurance agency. This led the Florida Legislature to create new agencies (the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund) to restore important insurance coverage.\n\nHomeowners and officials criticized developers and contractors for poor building practices and poor building codes. An inquiry after the storm concluded that there were probably construction flaws in some buildings, and that the state of Florida did enforce some strict building codes since 1986, but they were either overlooked or ignored. However, the evidence was not sufficient enough to issue criminal charges for neglect.\n\nThe effects of Hurricane Andrew on Florida wetlands were considerable. In the Florida Everglades, 25%, 70,000 acres (280 km²) of trees were knocked down by the storm. It took 20 days for new trees and vegetation to grow following the storms passing. Damage to marine life was moderate as the storm lowered the oxygen level in the water, threatening many fish and other marine wildlife. In addition, the storm killed 182 million fish in the basin, causing $160 million (1992 USD) in lost value. \nIn the decade after the storm, Hurricane Andrew may have contributed to the massive and sudden housing boom in Broward County, Florida. Located just north of Miami-Dade County, residents who had lost their homes moved to western sections of the county that were just starting to be developed. The result was record growth in places like Miramar, Pembroke Pines and Weston.\n\nIn Louisiana, the hurricane knocked down 80% of the trees in part of the Atchafalaya River Basin near the coast. Offshore, the storm killed 9.4 million fish, causing $7.8 million (1992 USD) in lost value, and damaged large areas of marshland along the Louisiana coast.\n\nAbout 6,200 people had to be housed in 36 shelters, according to the American Red Cross. The Salvation Army sent in 37 mobile food storages, that served 40,000 meals, to help those who could get little or no food.\n\nFederal aid, from the Pentagon, sent in four 750 kilowatt generators, 2,500 cots, and 30,000 MRE's, or prepackaged meals, to Louisiana. About 1,279 National Guard were deployed to Louisiana, to do various duties, from cooking to patrolling.\n\nSheriffs along the coast of Louisiana proposed a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. local time. Alcohol sales were also stopped immediately after the storm.\n\nBecause of exceptional and widespread damage in Florida and Louisiana, the name \"Andrew\" was retired in the Spring of 1993. It will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. The name was replaced by Alex for the 1998 season.\n", "id": "144592", "title": "Hurricane Andrew"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144594", "text": "Hurricane Gordon (1994)\n\nHurricane Gordon was a very damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates are between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Hurricane Gordon was the last storm of the inactive 1994 Season and the second most costly of the 1994 season, even though the storm was a hurricane for only a few hours.\n\nOn November 8 a tropical wave near Costa Rica became Tropical Depression Twelve. On November 10th in made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The same day it became Tropical Storm Gordon after moving back into the Caribbean. It made its first landfall near Kingston, Jamaica on November 13 it soon made its second landfall in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on the same day. The storm brushed the northern coast of Cuba and the southern islands of the Bahamas. It made its third landfall in Key West, Florida on November 15. Gordon turned northeast and made it fourth landfall in Fort Myers, Florida the next day. When Gordon crossed Florida it took about nine hours and it went into the Atlantic Ocean on a northeastward track. Gordon stayed on that track until November 17, when it became Hurricane Gordon while it was about 245 miles southeast of Cape Fear, North Carolina. Shortly after becoming a hurricane it reached top winds of 85 mph and then brushed the coast of North Carolina. Gordon weakened back to a tropical storm and started on a U-shaped track. Gordon weakened further into a tropical depression and on November 19 it made its fifth and last landfall near Vero Beach, Florida and on November 21 Gordon died out while over South Carolina.\n\nThe damage in Haiti is unknown. But in Haiti, Hurricane Gordon killed about 1,122 people. The number is high likely because of mudslides and because of the deforestation (removing trees) of the forests in Haiti.\n\nFlorida was where most of the damage was. Damage in Florida was at about $400 million. Gordon also crossed the state three times, which is likely why the damage is that high. \n\nIn the spring of 1995 Gordon was not retired even though it caused lots of deaths in Haiti. Since Gordon was not retired in 1994, the name Gordon was used again in 2000, 2006 and 2012 and will be again used in the 2018 hurricane season.\n", "id": "144594", "title": "Hurricane Gordon (1994)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144643", "text": "Bull shark\n\nThe Bull shark (\"Carcharhinus leucas\"), or Zambezi shark, is a species of shark of the genus \"Carcharhinus\".\n\nThe shark grows to a maximum length of 11.5 feet (3.5 metres), but is usually 7.3-7.8 feet (2.2-2.3 metres) long. It is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters worldwide, as well as river systems and freshwater lakes.\n\nThis species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN, and is considered to be the third most dangerous sharks in the world.\n\nBull sharks have a very sturdy body, and have a blunt, rounded snout, giving the Bull shark its name. The first dorsal fin is large and widely triangular with a pointed tip. The second dorsal fin is noticeably smaller. The pectoral fins are also large, and have sharp tips. Bull sharks have quite small eyes as compared to other carcharhinid sharks, which might mean that vision is not a very important hunting tool for this species which is usually found in muddy waters. Bull sharks are usually pale to dark grey above, and their undersides are white. In young Bull sharks, the fins have black tips which turn to a dusky colour as they grow.\nThe teeth of the upper jaw are wide, triangular, and heavily jagged. The teeth of the lower jaw have a wide base, and are narrow, triangular, and are finely jagged. The front teeth are raised and are nearly symmetrical, while the back teeth are more slanted in shape.\n\nThe maximum weight is over 500 pounds (230 kg). The size at birth is around 29 inches (75 cm). Females are larger than males, reaching a length of around 7.8 feet (2.4 metres) as adults, and weighing around 285 pounds (130 kg). This is the result of a longer lifespan of about 16 years, compared to 12 years for males. Males reach a length of around 7.3 feet (2.2 metres), and weigh 209 pounds (95 kg). The growth rates calculated from captive Bull sharks were estimated to be about 11 inches (28 cm) per year in the first years of life, slowing to half that rate after about 4 years of age.\n\nThe Bull shark is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters worldwide as well as in many river systems and some freshwater lakes. They have been reported 3700 km (2220 miles) up the Amazon River in Peru, and over 3000 km (1800 miles) up the Mississippi River in Illinois. A group of Bull sharks found in Lake Nicaragua (Central America) was once thought to be landlocked, but they found access to the ocean through rivers and estuaries. In the western Atlantic Bull sharks migrate north along the coast of the U.S during summer, swimming as far north as Massachusetts, and then return to tropical climates when the coastal waters cool.\nThe Bull shark likes to live in shallow coastal waters less than 100 feet deep (30 metres), but ranges from 3–450 feet deep (1–135 metres). It commonly enters estuaries, bays, harbours, lagoons, and river mouths. It is the only known shark species which is found in freshwater, and can spend long periods of time in such environments. It is not likely that the Bull shark's entire life cycle is within a freshwater system, however. There is evidence that they can breed in freshwater, but not as regularly as they do in estuarine and marine habitats. Young Bull sharks enter estuaries with low salt contents and lagoons as readily as adults do, and use these shallow areas as nursery grounds. They can also live in waters with high salt contents; as high as 53 parts per thousand.\n\nEven though humans are not on their diet, bull sharks have been known to be very aggressive towards humans. This shark can be a danger to people since many people don't have the knowledge that Bull sharks can be found in rivers and freshwater. Almost all of the close to shore shark attacks on humans have been caused by this species.\nThey are listed as the 3rd largest risk to humans when it comes to sharks. They are only behind the Great White Shark and the Tiger shark.\nThey are very territorial and they will attack anything that gets into their environment and they feel is a risk. They have been known to bite horses and other animals that come to close to the water.\n\nAlthough the Bull shark has no real predators, young Bull sharks have been known to fall prey to Tiger sharks, Sandbar sharks, and even adult Bull sharks. Parasites, like \"Pandarus sinuatus\" and \"Perissopus dentatus\", have been found in Bull sharks, and parasitize the body surface of this shark.\n\nThe Bull shark mainly feeds on bony fish and small sharks. In the western Atlantic they commonly feed on mullet, tarpon, catfish, menhaden, gar, snook, jacks, mackerel, snappers, and other schooling fish. They also regularly feed on stingrays and young sharks including small individuals of their own species in their inshore nursery habitats. Bull sharks are also been known to feed on sea turtles, dolphins, crabs, shrimp, sea birds, squid, terrestrial mammals, echinoderms, and crustaceans. Bull sharks often appear sluggish as they slowly swim along the bottom, but are quite quick and good at capturing smaller, agile prey, and are capable of burst speeds of over 11 mph (19 km/h).\n\nBull sharks may spend many hours each day looking for food. They will eat heavily too when there is a large amount of food to be found. They mostly hunt on their own, but there have been observed times when a pair of Bull Sharks will hunt as a team.\n\nBull sharks are viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. The gestation period is about one year, usually during the summer months but sometimes in early autumn as well. Bull sharks usually migrate to river mouths to mate and have their young. Pups are about 60 cm (24 inches) long, and mothers give birth to 5 to 15 pups at a time. Coastal lagoons, river mouths, and estuaries with low salt contents are common nursery habitats.\n\nBull sharks reach maturity depending on where they are. One study in the southern Gulf of Mexico found that the age of maturity was 10 years (7 feet) for females and 9–10 years (6.2-6.6 feet) for males. Another study in the northern Gulf of Mexico showed that the age of maturity was 7 feet (14–15 years) for males and 7.4 feet (18 years) for females.\n\nThe Bull shark gets its name from its sturdy appearance and aggressive nature. In French, the Bull shark is known as \"requin bouledogue\". In Spanish it is known as \"tiburon sarda\". It is known by many different names throughout its range including \"Zambezi shark\" and \"Van Rooyen's shark\" in Africa, \"Ganges shark\" (India), \"Nicaragua shark\" (Central America), and \"Freshwater whaler\", \"Estuary whaler\", and \"Swan River whaler\" in Australia. In English it is also known as the \"Shovelnose shark\", \"Square-nose shark\", \"River shark\", \"Slipway grey shark\", \"Ground shark\", and \"Cub shark\".\n\nAlthough the Bull shark is rarely the target species of commercial fisheries, it is usually caught accidentally along with other catches. Since it is found inshore, it has been made a target for artisanal fisheries. The meat of the Bull shark is eaten by humans, the hide is used for leather, the fins are used in shark-fin soup and the liver is made into vitamin-rich oils. In certain areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa, the Bull shark is also a popular game fish. The Bull shark’s inshore and freshwater habitat not only makes it an easier target of fisheries, but since these habitats are usually polluted and are targets to habitat modification, the Bull shark is in danger. The Bull shark is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN\nAccording to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), Bull sharks are responsible for at least 69 unprovoked attacks on humans around the world, 17 of which have resulted in deaths. However, this species is likely to be responsible for many more attacks, and has been considered by many experts to be the most dangerous shark in the world. Because of its large size, its ability to enter freshwater, and the fact that it is found inshore, it might be more of a threat to humans than either the Great White Shark or the Tiger shark. Since the Bull shark is found in many Third World regions including Central America, Mexico, India, east and west Africa, the Middle East, southeast Asia, and south Pacific islands, attacks are often not reported. The Bull shark is also not as easily identifiable as the Great White or the Tiger shark, so it is likely to be responsible for a large percentage of attacks with unidentified culprits.\nThe Bull shark has been considered to be the culprit in the infamous series of five shark attacks in New Jersey in 1916 which resulted in four deaths over a 12-day period. Three of these attacks happened in Matawan Creek, a shallow tidal river, only 40 feet (12 metres) across, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from bay waters, and over 15 miles (24 km) from the open ocean; not a location where any other large shark species would likely be found. A 7.5 foot (2.25 metres) Great White was captured two days after the last attack, however, just 4 miles (6.4 km) from the mouth of Matawan Creek, and contained human remains in its stomach. A 9-foot (2.7 m) Bull shark was also captured a day later only 10 miles (16 km) from Matawan. This has been a topic of debate for many years, and there is evidence that points at both, the Bull shark and the Great White as the culprits.\n", "id": "144643", "title": "Bull shark"}

Officials of the Russian Imperial Government and anti-Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War also left.\n\nMost émigrés left Southern Russia and Ukraine and went to Turkey. They then moved to eastern European Slavic countries, for example the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. A large number also went to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and France. Berlin and Paris had large émigré communities. \n\nMany civilians and military officers in Siberia and the Far East moved to Shanghai and other surrounding areas of China, Central Asia, and Eastern Turkestan. Some moved to Japan. \n\nDuring and after World War II, many Russian émigrés moved to the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia.\n\nWhite émigrés often did not like Communism. They did not believe the Soviet Union was properly Russian. They believed the period of time from 1917 until 1991 was a time of occupation by the Soviet government which was internationalist and anti-Christian.\n\nMany White émigrés believed that Russia should be governed by a monarch. Others thought that the government should be chosen by popular plebiscite.\n\nMany White émigrés believed that their mission was to keep the culture and way of life from the time before the revolution while living in other countries. They believe that by doing this, they could return Russia to this culture when the Soviet Union was no longer in control of the country.\n\nA religious mission to the outside world was another idea used by the émigrés. Bishop John of Shanghai and San Francisco (canonized as a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad) said at the 1938 All-Diaspora Council:\n\nMany White émigrés also believed that they should still fight against the Soviet dictatorship. They hoped this would help free Russia. This idea was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel. When the White army was defeated, he said, \"The battle for Russia has not ceased, it has merely taken on new forms\". (\"We are not done trying to free Russia. We just have to use different ways to do so.\")\n\nWhite army veteran Captain Vasili Orekhov, publisher of the \"Sentry\" journal, wrote about this idea of responsibility with the following words:\n\nThe émigrés formed different organisations which had the purpose of fighting against the Soviet regime. Examples of such organisations are the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the NTS. This made the White émigrés a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police (i.e. operation TREST and the Inner Line). Seventy-five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nSome White émigrés adopted pro-Soviet sympathies, for which they were labelled \"Soviet patriots\". These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Evraziitsi, and the Smenovekhovtsi.\n\nDuring World War II, many White émigrés took part in the Russian Liberation Movement. On the other hand, a significant number participated in anti-Nazi movements such as the French Resistance. During the war, the White émigrés came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German-occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West, often referred to as the \"second wave\" of émigrés (often also called DPs – displaced persons, see Displaced persons camp). This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the White émigré community.\n\nAfter the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS: other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage.\n\nThe White émigrés, acting to preserve their church from Soviet influence, formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924. The church continues its existence to this day, acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad. On May 17, 2007, the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate, after more than eighty years of separation.\n\n\n", "id": "144658", "title": "White émigré"}

For example, setting up the sulphur dioxide(SO) density measuring machine and getting the reading is measurement. But, how to use this machine, which machine is to set up, how many places to set up, what to calculate with the reading, in what situation it should sent the sign for alarm are problems handled by the instrumentation.\n\nAn instrument is a tool used to measure and manage the variables in a process. Instrumentation can be used to measure various variables(physical values) like:\n\nInstrumentation is also studying about control. Control is like how valve is managing the amount of contents flowing through it and break controlling over the speed. Control can change the parameter of the field or the variable.\n\nExamples of instruments are valves, transmitters, flame detectors and analyzers. Valve is a device that helps with the flow of materials (like gases, fluidized solids, slurries, or liquids). Transmitter is a electronic device or tool which sends or receives a signal through electromagnetic radiation. Flame detector is a device which detects the flame by analyzing the color.\n\nThe engineering behind instrumentation focuses on the mechanics and operation of measuring instruments. They typically work for industries with automated processes, such as chemical or manufacturing plants, with the goal of improving system productivity, reliability, safety, optimization and stability. To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system Microprocessors, Micro controllers, PLC's etc. are used.

Devi is synonymous with Shakti, the female aspect of the divine. She has many different incarnations. Among these incarnations are Saraswati, Lakshmi, Durga, Kali, and Parvati. The Hindu worshipers of Devi are called 'Shaktas'.\n\nHindus believe in millions of female gods. Each goddess of the Hindus has her own story and history. They all look different too. Some goddesses can change how they look, so they have two or three different images. Some learned persons think that all Hindu goddesses are different forms of a single big or supreme goddess. Some learned persons also think that worship of goddesses by Hindus shows their respect for female gender.\n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization was an old civilization of Ancient India. It lasted from 3000 to 1500BC. Archeologists found some female figures at some places of this civilization. Some persons believe that these figures show the worship of goddess at that time. Some learned persons think that people of that time worshipped a mother goddess. This was similar to worship of a mother goddess in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Vedic period or Vedic civilization of India was a very old civilization. Vedas tell about a number of goddesses. Some of the names of goddesses are Ushas, Prithivi, Aditi, Saraswati, Vac, Nirrti, Ratri. Beside them, some more names of goddesses are there like Puramdhi, Parendi, Raka, Dhisana. Some more names are like Ila, Bharati, Mahi, and Hotra.\n\nSome important goddesses of Hindus are Lakshmi, Parvati, Sita, Radha, Durga, Kali, Mahadevi, Matrakas, Tara, Chhinnamasta, Mahavidyas, and many more. Some goddesses are also connected with places and rivers.\n\nDurga is one of the most powerful goddesses of Hindus. Hindu scriptures say that Durga came to kill the asuras, that is, the demons. Male gods had failed to control asuras and she was created. She has the powers of all the male gods combined. Mainly Durga is the fighting and most powerful form of Parvati. She is often pictured riding a tiger or a lion.\n\nSaraswati is the goddess of speech and learning. She is the Goddess of science, arts and music. The Vedas tell about her. In her hands, she holds a book, a rosary, a pot of water, and a lute. She is also considered as daughter of Parvati or Durga. Maha Saraswati is the partition form of Parvati`s mahavidya (power of super learning). The mahavidya have two forms. One is maha saraswati and another is neel saraswati. In ancient times, there was also a river named the Saraswati River. The river dried up long ago. This river was also considered a form of this goddess. Saraswati is also the wife of Brahma \"god of knowledge, wisdom, and many other thing\". \n\nLakshmi, also called Sri or Sri Lakshmi is an important goddess of Hindus. Lakshmi is the epitome of everything good and prosperous in the world. She as the power behind Lord Vishnu, aids in the preservation of the world. Lakshmi like Vishnu has many incarnation the most important ones being: Sita, Radha and Rukmini.actually Maha laxmi is the partition form of the beauty of parvati or Durga.\n\nAfter death of Sati, the divine power or Shakti was reformed from the 51 shakti peeth. By this Goddess Sati was reborn as Goddess Parvati. In Sanskrit language, Parvati means a daughter of the mountains, the Himalayas. she again married Shiva. so Goddess Parvati is the 2nd wife of Shiva, one of the three main Hindu gods. She has two son called Ganesh and Kartikeya. She is also called Gauri she has eighteen arms and forty legs.She also have more than 108 names. Durga, Kali, Jagadatri, Bharat Mata (mother India) are the popular forms of the goddess Parvati.\n\nKali is one of the main goddesses of Hindus. She is a very powerful goddess. Sometimes she is also called Chandi. Durga and Kali killed many asuras (demons) who used to disturb human beings.\nKali is a form of Durga that sprang from her head during Durga's battle with the demon Raktabija (who represents the power of thoughts, the power which constantly and unceasingly reproduce in the mind) whose blood when touch to the earth generated another Raktabija. To end this battle between Raktabeeja and Durga, Kali consumed every drop of blood until Raktabija Bled out. \nKali is the highest form of the Supreme. Kali's name has two meanings; the first meaning is \"dark\" which means she represents the Void(brahman. The second meaning is \"Time\" which is the Destroyer of Everything.\n\nSati is a Hindu goddess. She is the 1st form of divine power or Shakti. She was the daughter of Dakshya-raj. She was the 1st wife of Lord Shiva.After death of Sati in the Dakshya-Yagna, Shiva took the deadbody of Sati and started dance. By Sudarshana Chakra Lord Vishnu cut the body parts of Sati. The parts were falled at the 51 places in the Indian subcontinent area. These places are called 51 Shakti peeth. Many forms of shakti like Durga, Kali, Kamakshya, Hingula are being worshiped in these places.\n\nThe concept of Goddess Bhuvaneswari as the supreme goddess emerged in historical religious literature as a term to define the powerful and influential nature of female deities in India. Throughout history, goddesses have been portrayed as the mother of the universe, through whose powers the universe is created and destroyed. The gradual changes in belief through time shape the concept of Bhuvaneswari and express how the different Goddesses, though very different in personality, all carry the power of the universe on their shoulders.\n\nSita is one of the most popular goddesses of Hindus. Hindus of north India especially worship her. She is an avatar of Lakshmi. She was married to Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. Hindu scriptures say that Vishnu and Laxmi are husband and wife.\n\nThe word Radha means riches and success. Her name comes with the name of Krishna, another avatar of Vishnu. Some Hindu scriptures describe her as a form or avatar of goddess Lakshmi.\n\n\n", "id": "144695", "title": "Devi"}

Her full name is Guanshiyin which means \"Observing the Sounds (or cries) of the World.\"\n\nMany Buddhist agree that Guan Yin came from the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. Before the arrival of Buddhism to China, Guan Yin was shown as a male in India where she was known as Avalokitesvara. When Buddhism came into China and became popular, many Buddhists transformed Avalokitesvara into a female named Guan Yin.\n\nOriginally, Guan Yin was shown as a male with an open dress revealing her chest and sometimes a mustache. During modern times, Guan Yin is depicted as a female rather than a male. Some male depictions still exist.\n\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" describes Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin) as a bodhisattva who can take any form. She can be a male, female, adult, child, elderly, human, non-human, in order to teach the Dharma. The \"Lotus Sutra\" states that Guan Yin has 33 manifestations and 7 are female.\n\nRepresentations of Guan Yin in the Song Dynasty were masculine in appearance. Images and statues of Guan Yin during this time later became both genders because of the Lotus Sutra. Because of the bodhisattva is considered the personification of compassion and kindness, a mother-goddess and a patroness of mothers and seamen, the representation of the bodhisattva became mostly female around the 12th century. In the modern period, Guan Yin is depicted as a beautiful, young white-robed woman, a depiction which derives from the earlier \"Pandaravasini\" form.\n\nIn China, She is depicted as a beautiful, young white-robed woman wearing a necklace of Indian/Chinese royalty.

The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. This was the start of European settlement in Australia.\n\nThe ship of 520 tons was built on the River Thames, England in 1781. She was first called the \"Berwick.\". She had been built to work in the Baltic Sea to carry timber. The Royal Navy bought it to use as a store ship. She was refitted for the trip to Australia, and renamed \"HMS Sirius\". Lieutenant Philip Gidley King wrote that the ship was named after the star in the Orion constellation. HMS Sirius was about long and wide. Her hold was about deep.\n\nThe ship was commanded by Arthur Phillip with John Hunter as second captain. Phillip would be in charge of the ship as part of the First Fleet, and then Hunter would be in charge after while Phillip was setting up the penal colony. King, William Bradley and George William Maxwell were the lieutenants. She carried a crew of about 160 men.\n\n\"HMS Sirius\" carried all the guns and ammunition for the Fleet. No weapons were kept on the convict transports in case of mutiny. She left England on May 13, 1787, and sailed to Australia with stops at Santa Cruz, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. She arrived in Botany Bay on January 20, 1788. She reached Port Jackson on January 26.\n\nAt Cape Town, eight guns were taken away from the gun deck and put in the hold. This was to make room to build stalls to hold cattle. The guns were put back after the ship arrived in Sydney. They were taken out again and put into a fort at Dawes Point.\n\nIn October 1788 \"HMS Sirius\" sailed east to Cape Town to get extra food supplies. Leaving Cape Town in January 1789, she continued to travel east until she got back to Sydney in May. This eastward journey using the west winds, known as \"the Roaring Forties\" meant that the ship had sailed completely around the world. Rough seas near Tasmania smashed her figurehead and badly damaged the front of the ship.\n\nIn March 1790 the \"Sirius\" went to Norfolk Island to deliver more marines, convicts and supplies. She was able to unload the people, but bad weather made getting the supplies ashore impossible. Four days later Captain Hunter tried to land the supplies in Sydney Bay. The ship drifted too far into the bay and was wrecked on a reef on March 19. All the crew were rescued. Over the next two weeks most of the supplies were saved as well.\n\nIt was another 11 months before another ship came to Norfolk Island and took the crew back to Sydney. Hunter went back to England and an inquiry decided that the shipwreck was not his fault.\n\nCannons from the wreck were saved in 1790. In 1795 Lieutenant-Governor Philip Gidley King gave four cannons to Captain Hogan, of the ship, \"Marquis Cornwallis\". Eight cannons were sent back to Sydney, to be used in a fort in 1804. In 1924, two cannon from the ship were put in front of the Norfolk Island court house.\n\nOne of \"HMS Sirius's\" 12 anchors was found at the wreck site. In 1907 it was put on show in Macquarie Place, Sydney. The anchor is in good condition although the ends of the arms were broken off while it was being brought up from the wreck. Work was done on the anchor to help keep it in good condition in 1992. The size of the anchor is long, wide and deep. Next to the anchor is one of the cannons from the \"HMS Sirius\". This was one of the cannons taken off the ship to guard Sydney back in 1788.\n\nIn 1983 the wreck was explored by archaeologists. In 1985 several objects were found including a carronade (a small cannon) and another anchor. In 1987 more than 600 objects were brought up from the ship.

The ships left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. \"Supply\" was commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\n\n\"Supply\" was a brig rigged sloop of 170 tons. A sloop is a small ship with a single gun deck. A brig rig means the ship had two masts and carried square sails. She had eight small three pounder guns and carried 50 men. She was the smallest ship in the fleet, and the fastest. She was long and wide. \n\nThe Royal Navy had difficulty in finding a suitable ship. Several were checked but were not seen as suitable for the long journey to Australia. A French storeship, the \"Eclipse\", had been damaged when it ran ashore. An American ship, the \"Rattlesnake\" was not of suitable quality. The Navy purchased the British-made \"Grantham\", a packet boat, used for the quick transport of mail. When it was partly taken apart for repairs, the Navy decided it needed so much work, that it would cost too much to repair or rebuild it. They then selected the \"HM Supply\", a small Royal Navy ship based in Portsmouth, which was used to move naval stores around to the different naval yards.\n\nAfter the setting up of the penal colony at Port Jackson, HMS \"Supply\" made ten trips to Norfolk Island. When HMS \"Sirius\" was wrecked in 1790, the \"Supply\" was the new settlement's only ship. In April 1790 she made a trip to Batavia to get more food.

The game was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on March 18, 2008 in North America and March 20 2008 in Europe, except in Germany, where the game was delayed.\n\nThe multiplayer in \"Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Vegas 2\" has been expanded to include more than 10 new close-quarters maps, two new adversarial modes, a newer and different rewards system, and according to Ubisoft, improved online matchmaking. The experience point (XP) system is different than the old Vegas, for every kill achieved the player gains XP.\n\n\"Rainbow Six: Vegas 2\" (fan pack) includes three new maps (CQB-Dark, Murdertown-Dark, and the return of Calypso Casino) from the first \"Rainbow Six: Vegas\". There are also new A.C.E.S. and 99 more elite ranks to keep players busy. The new A.C.E.S. update is you can level up you A.C.E. until you reach 100 in that A.C.E. The 99 more elite ranks a gold elite badge with a number corresponding to the ranked elite you are. This download is available in the PS3 or Xbox 360 marketplace or of Ubisoft's website if you are using a PC version of RSV2.\n\nThe setting for the game begins in Pic des Pyréneés, France, on 2005. Although the story moves five years forward to Las Vegas, United States of America on July 2, 2010, the same day of Logan Keller's arrival to Las Vegas in \"Rainbow Six: Vegas\". Terrorists have gained control of Las Vegas to install widespread panic in both the public as well as law enforcement agencies, such as the National Security Agency, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Rainbow, as well as local SWAT. As the plot unfolds, however, the setting moves away from Las Vegas to other places, such as a small town in Nevada, unlike in the first Rainbow Six: Vegas, which was mainly in Las Vegas.\n\nBishop\nBishop is the main protagonist that the player controls and guides throughout the events of \"Rainbow Six: Vegas 2\". His/her appearance and gender vary, depending on the intended look by the player. Either way, Bishop is still called \"sir\" in the game. He/she is a high-ranking veteran of the Rainbow organization, and is an instructor at the organization's training academy when the game first begins. Bishop is referred five years after the first mission in the French Alps, Bishop returns from retirement as the team leader of Park and Walters.\n\nKnight\nIf co-op mode is enabled, Knight accompanies Bishop on missions, whose appearance also varies depending on how the player desires him/her to look. His/her role, however, is limited as merely a co-op player, and unlike some games, such as \"Gears of War\" and \"Halo 3\", Knight is not critical to the single player campaign's story, as elaborated on the Eurogamer review. Playing as Knight also allows the player to unlock co-op achievements.\n\nGabriel Nowak \nThe game's main antagonist, a traitorous former Rainbow operative revealed as a mole in \"Rainbow Six: Vegas\". Though cunning and ambitious, Nowak's gung-ho recklessness earns him the disrespect of fellow teammates, ultimately leading to Bishop passing him up for promotion in favor of Logan, which therefore leads to Nowak betraying the Rainbow organization with the assistance of big-time terrorist ringleaders. Nowak betrays more Rainbow operatives in Vegas 2, mainly by posing falsely as an NSA agent, helping Bishop along the way for some of the campaign while actually putting Bishop in a state of danger, in order to kill him/her, which fails. Bishop eventually kills him in a final showdown at a villa in Costa Rica.\n\nLogan Keller \nThe main protagonist in \"Rainbow Six: Vegas\", Keller is seen in the opening level of the game. Keller demonstrates a formidable sense of close-quarters combat (CQB), with realistic analyses of certain hostage situations and how to eliminate the opposition in an effective and concise manner. He is later seen after Bishop's showdown with Nowak at the end of the game. Logan is seen quoting Bishop's teachings at the last level, implying his respect towards Bishop.\n\nJung Park \nA character of South Korean nationality, Jung Park’s natural proficiency for computers drove him to serve his mandatory term in the ROK Army immediately after graduation. Park’s high scores on electronics screening made him eligible for entry into the 1st Anti-Guerrilla Group. For two years, Park served as part of the 15th Security Battalion’s signals unit. In 2004, Park received a transfer to the ROK Army’s 5th Special Forces Brigade (Airborne). During his time as a Black Dragon, Park earned top marksmanship decorations in every long-range category, as well as SCUBA and parachute qualifications.

Retrieved 16 July 2010.</ref> Lenz's law is named after Heinrich Lenz, and it says:An induced electromotive force (emf) always gives rise to a current whose magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux.\n\nLenz's law is shown with the negative sign in Faraday's law of induction:\n\nwhich indicates that the induced emf (ℰ) and the change in magnetic flux (∂Φ) have opposite signs.\n\nThe induced emf and the resulting induced current are counterclockwise when B is directed out from the page and the area of the circuit is decreasing. The flux through this circuit is decreasing in the outward direction. Now the induced current I produces its own magnetic field, and we may use the right-hand grip rule to compute the direction of this field. The result is that the magnetic field due to the induced current is also directed outward within the circuit. It is as though nature, through this induced field, tried to compensate for the reduction in the flux due to the applied field B. This turns out experimentally to be a general rule, so that we may say that\n\"The direction of the induced emf is always such as to result in opposition to the change producing it.\"\nThat is \"Lenz's law\".\n\nAs another example of the application of Lenz's law, consider a coil of wire to which a battery is suddenly connected. Suppose that the battery starts a current flowing clockwise, as viewed by the observer. This current will give rise to a magnetic field whose lines will thread the coil and circle back outside it. Thus, as the current due to the battery builds up, there is a changing magnetic flux through the coil and this must result in an induced emf in the coil. What is the direction of this induced emf? Lenz's law tells us immediately that it must be counterclockwise, so as to oppose the building up of the current. Similarly, when the current in a circuit is broken, the induced emf seeks to keep the current from dying out, and this accounts for the sparking observed when switches are opened slowly. The induced emf in a circuit whose current is changing is called the \"back emf\", since it always opposes the alteration in the current. It arises from change in the current's own magnetic field, an effect referred to as \"self-inductance\".\n\nWere Lenz's law not true, an increase in current in a coil would result in an emf that aided the applied battery, thus increasing the current further, inducing more emf and further increases in the current, ad \"infinitum\". This would be an unstable situation and one in which the conservation of energy principle would be disobeyed.\nThis sort of reasoning may be extended to other situations in which a system in equilibrium is displaced and the principle arrived at is the following.\n\nWhen a system in equilibrium is disturbed, the equilibrium is displaced in the direction which tends to undo the effects of the disturbance.\nThis generalization of Lenz's law is called Le Chatelier's prinicple.\n", "id": "144796", "title": "Lenz's law"}

A simple circuit only has one RLC series.\n\nWith a resistance \"R\" present, the total electromagnetic energy \"U\" of the circuit (the sum of the electric energy and magnetic energy) is no longer constant. Instead, it decreases with time as energy is transferred to thermal energy in the resistance. Because of this loss of energy, the oscillations of charge, current and potential difference continuously decrease in amplitude, and the oscillations are said to be damped. \n\nThey are damped in exactly the same way as those of the damped block-spring oscillator. To analyze the oscillations of this circuit, an equation can be written for the total electromagnetic energy formula_1 in the circuit at any instant. This is because the resistance does not store electromagnetic energy.\n\nHowever, this total energy decreases as energy is transferred to thermal energy. \nwhere the minus sign indicates that formula_1 decreases.

Each stone is about the size of an almond. Players can only use one hand to play the game. The game has five parts or \"stages\".\n\nIn the first stage, the player throws the stones on the ground. They pick up one stone and throw it upward. Before the stone falls onto the ground, they need to pick up another stone from the ground and then catch the one that was thrown.

His early paintings show abstract landscapes in post-impressionist and cubist style. \n\nHe painted in an increasingly abstract style, until he finally achieved the style which made him famous. By 1920, he adopts a totally abstract motif, with an irregular checkerboard drawn with black lines, and with the spaces paints mostly white or sometimes in the primary colors of blue, red and yellow. This style is geometric abstraction with primary color.\n\nMondrian painted about 250 of these geometric abstracts, from 1917 to 1944. Mondrian called his style “neoplasticism”.\n\nEscaping in 1940 from a Europe at war, Mondrian spent the last four years of his life in New York City. His paintings of that time express exuberance at city life.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nTropical Depression Five-E formed south of Mexico on July 26. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby, and only four hours later, at 2 am (0900 UTC) on July 27, is upgraded to Hurricane Darby. It moved due west at this point, aiming directly for the big island of Hawaii. It reached Category 3 strength on July 29, the first major hurricane in the northeastern Pacific basin since 2002. However, long before it reached Hawaii, it lost strength and dissipated on the evening of July 31.\nTropical Depression Eleven_E formed from a tropical wave about 400 mi. southwest of Acapulco, Mexico and headed northwest, steadily strengthening as it did so. Howard peaked briefly as a Category 4 and then started to weaken. By the time Howard reached a point off the coast of the Baja peninsula, it was only a tropical storm. Howard weakened further, becoming a tropical depression on September 5 and degenerated into a remnant low later that day. The low hooked around and headed southwest. Howard dissipated on September 10 without making landfall.\nTropical Depression Thirteen-E formed out of an area of low pressure south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 10. It slowly moved northwest, being designated Tropical Storm Javier on the morning of September 11. It was upgraded to a hurricane on the afternoon of September 12, and peaked at Category 4 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale after rapidly strengthening on September 13. \n\nWarnings began to be issued on September 15 for Baja California. While Javier peaked at Category 4, with windspeeds of 150 mph (240 km/h), it weakened dramatically before striking land south of San Ignacio in Baja Sur as only a tropical depression. Its remnants continued over Baja and inland.\nAn area of tropical disturbance centered about 90 miles (150 km) south-southwest of Puerto Angel, Mexico, developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on the afternoon of October 11. Due to its proximity, attention was immediately paid to it, and Mexico began issuing watches early the next day. With the 2 pm PDT (2100 UTC) update on October 12, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Lester.\n\nIt sat mainly stationary just off the coast of Mexico, spending most of October 13 only 25 miles (40 km) west of Acapulco. In the afternoon, it became clear that Lester was falling apart, and with the 2 pm update, even though it was still close to shore, it was downgraded to a tropical depression and advisories ended as it rapidly disintegrated.\n", "id": "144838", "title": "2004 Pacific hurricane season"}

Star temperature can be measured by looking at its spectrum, the type of light that the star shines.\n\nStars are also grouped into spectral types or classes by color. In general, a star's temperature determines its color, from red to blue-white. Spectral types are named with a letter: \"M\", \"K\", \"G\", \"F\", \"A\", \"B\" and \"O\". \"M\" stars are the coldest stars and \"O\" stars are the hottest.\n\nThe closest star to the Earth, the sun, is a class G star.\n\nThe Harvard classification system is a one-dimensional classification scheme. Stars vary in surface temperature from about 2,000 to 40,000 kelvin. Physically, the classes indicate the temperature of the star's atmosphere and are normally listed from hottest to coldest, as is done in the following table: \n\nNote: The conventional color description describe only the peak of the stellar spectrum. However, the actual apparent colors the eye sees are lighter than the conventional color descriptions. \n\nThe mass, radius, and luminosity listed for each class are appropriate only for stars on the main-sequence portion of their lives and so are not appropriate for red giants. The spectral classes O through M are subdivided by Arabic numerals (0–9). For example, A0 denotes the hottest stars in the A class and A9 denotes the coolest ones. The Sun is classified as G2.\nThe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is more often used in astronomy, because it relates three important variables: the absolute magnitude, the luminosity and the surface temperature. It is as important to astronomy as the periodic table is to chemistry.\n\nThe \"conventional color\" descriptions are traditional in astronomy, and represent colors relative to the mean color of an \"A-class star\" which is considered to be white. The \"apparent color\" descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. \n\nThe Sun itself is white, though it is sometimes called a yellow star. This is a natural consequence of the evolution of human optical senses: the response curve that maximizes the overall efficiency against solar illumination will by definition perceive the Sun as white, though there is some subjective variation between observers.\n\n\n", "id": "144850", "title": "Stellar classification"}

It was made by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is based on the German fairy tale \"Snow White\" by the Brothers Grimm. It is the first full-length cel animated movie and the earliest in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David Hand was the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the movie's different sequences.\n\n\"Snow White\" was first shown at the Carthay Circle Theatre on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. With international earnings of $8 million during its initial release, the movie for a bit had the record of highest grossing sound movie at the time. The popularity of the movie has led to it being re-released theatrically many times, until its home video release in the 1990s. Adjusted for inflation, it is one of the top ten performers at the North American box office.\n\nAt the 11th Academy Awards, Walt Disney was awarded an honorary Oscar. The movie was nominated for Best Musical Score. It was added to the United States National Film Registry in 1989 and is ranked in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, who also named the movie as the greatest American animated movie of all time in 2008. Disney's take on the fairytale has had a huge cultural impact, resulting in popular theme park attractions, a video game, and a Broadway musical.\n\nAn evil queen has a mirror and asks \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\" The mirror answers \"Snow White\". Snow White is lost in the woods, and comes across the home of seven little men, or dwarves. She cleans their home, and they allow her to stay with them. The queen eventually finds out that the heart in the box is of a pig so she goes and changes herself onto an old hag. She goes to the dwarfs' cottage the next day while they're out and gets Snow White to bite into an apple with makes her fall dead. Suddenly, the dwarfs chase the old hag up a cliff and trap her. She tries to roll a boulder over them but lightning strikes and she dies. Snow White is awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince.\n\nDevelopment on \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" began in early 1934, and in June 1934, Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature to the \"New York Times\". Before \"Snow White\", the Disney studio had been mainly involved in the production of highly successful animated shorts in the \"Mickey Mouse\" and \"Silly Symphonies\" series. Disney hoped to enlarge his studio's reputation and money by moving into features, and estimated that \"Snow White\" could be produced for a budget of $250,000 - ten times the budget of an average \"Silly Symphony\".\n\nWalt Disney had to fight to get the movie produced. Both his brother Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it, and the Hollywood movie industry mockingly referred to the movie as \"Disney's Folly\" while it was in production. He even had to mortgage his house to help finance the movie's production, which eventually ran up a total cost of just over $1.5 million, a huge sum for a movie in 1937.\n\n\nUnvoiced characters include Snow White's animal friends, the Queen's raven, and the vultures who follow the Witch. However, although the animals did not have human speaking voices, their natural calls were very lifelike, and were all voiced by champion whistler and animal mimic A. Purves Pullen, who would provide bird and animal calls for Disney movies (including numerous Pluto cartoons) for several decades. Pullen also produced the bird calls for the Enchanted Tiki Room attractions at Disney theme parks. During the 1940s and 1950s, he performed as \"Dr. Horatio Q. Birdbath\" with the \ncomedy band Spike Jones & His City Slickers.\n\n\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was first shown in cinemas on December 21, 1937. It was released across the United States on February 4, 1938. It has been re-released many times since. The first time was in 1944, in order to raise money for the Disney studio during World War II. This set a tradition of re-releasing Disney animated features every seven to ten years. \"Snow White\" was re-released to theaters in 1952, 1958, 1967, 1975, 1983, 1987 and 1993.\n\nDisney's wife, Lillian, told him that no one will go pay anything to see a dwarf picture. \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21, 1937 to a very impressed audience, many of the same people who called the movie \"Disney's Folly.\" The movie received a prasie from many child actors audience that included Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard, Shirley Temple, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers, Jack Benny, Fred MacMurray, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Burns and Allen, Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, John Barrymore, and Marlene Dietrich. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. The \"New York Times\" said \"Thank you very much, Mr. Disney.\" RKO Radio Pictures put the movie into general release on February 4, 1938, and it went on to become a huge box-office success, making more money than any other movie in 1938. In fact, for a short time, \"Snow White\" was the highest-grossing movie in American cinema history, until it was beat by \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939. When taking inflation into account, and including rereleases, the movie still remains one of the top ten American movie moneymakers of all time.\n\n\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was the first full-length animated feature movie made in English and Technicolor (not counting the \"Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons\"), and won an Academy Award for Walt Disney as a huge movie which has charmed millions and started a great new form of entertainment. Disney won a full-size Oscar statuette and seven small ones, given to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple.\n\nThe movie was also nominated for Best Musical Score. \"Some Day My Prince Will Come\" has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, and Miles Davis.\n\nNoted moviemakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised the movie as a huge achievement in cinema. The movie inspired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to produce its own fantasy movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\" in 1939. The 1943 \"Merrie Melodies\" short \"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\", directed by Bob Clampett, parodies \"Snow White\" by presenting the story with an all-black cast singing a jazz score.\n\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten top Ten\"—the best ten movies in ten \"classic\" American movie genres. After polling over 1,500 people from the creative community, \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" was acknowledged as the best movie in the animation genre.\n\n\nSnow White's Scary Adventures is a popular theme park ride at Disneyland (an opening day attraction dating from 1955), Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris. Snow White, her Prince, and the Seven Dwarfs are also featured in parades and character appearances throughout the parks.\n\nA video game was released for the Game Boy Color system. Snow White appears in the popular PlayStation 2 game \"Kingdom Hearts\" as one of the seven fabled Princesses of Heart.\n\n", "id": "144859", "title": "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 movie)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144866", "text": "Captain Jack Harkness\n\nCaptain Jack Harkness is a fictional character in the British television series \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\". He is played by actor John Barrowman. He was first in \"Doctor Who\" in the 2005 episode \"The Empty Child\" and is in the show throughout the rest of the 2005 series as a companion of the Ninth Doctor. Jack later becomes the main character in \"Torchwood\", an adult-themed spin-off of \"Doctor Who\". He comes back into \"Doctor Who\" in the 2007 series and he meets the Tenth Doctor, and returned again for the 2008 series.\n\nJack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century. A bisexual. In contrast to the wiser and older Doctor, Jack prefers a hands-on solution to the problem at hand. As a consequence of his death and being brought back in the last episode of the 2005 series of \"Doctor Who\", the character becomes immortal, which does not change during both \"Doctor Who\" and \"Torchwood\".\n\n In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies got inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, Jack's original appearances in \"Doctor Who\" were thought of with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is changed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, \"Is he a force for good or ill?\"\n\nThe character is described as both \"lethally charming... good looking and utterly captivating\", as well as \"flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man\". Within \"Doctor Who\", Jack's personality is light-hearted, although this changes in \"Torchwood\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first series, where he becomes a darker character. In \"Torchwood\" Series 1, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof. During The second series of \"Torchwood\", Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again, after appearances in \"Doctor Who\" where he was reunited with the Doctor.\n\nFrom the Torchwood onwards, Harkness wears period military clothes from the second World War, including braces and an officer's wool greatcoat in every appearance. Costume designer Ray Holman comments that \"We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him, so all his outfits have a 1940s flavor. We knew he'd be running around a lot, so I redesigned his RAF Group Captain's greatcoat from \"Doctor Who\" to make it more fluid, because the real things are very weighty... The rest of Jack's costumes are loosely wartime based, so he has big wartime trousers which are getting more and more styled to suit his figure. There are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show - one hero version which is used for most scenes, one wetcoat made with a pre-shrunk fabric, a running coat which is slightly shorter so John's heels do not catch when he runs and two stunt coats - which were 'hero coats' back in Series 1.\"\n\nDiscussing whether his character could ever find a soulmate, John Barrowman refutes that Jack \"likes everybody, and his love for each person is different\". He believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but \"would never take that beyond infatuation\" and \"would never let the Doctor know\". Barrowman describes Jack's love for Ianto as \"lustful\", and if he ever were to settle down with him, he would \"let Ianto know that he [Jack] has to play around on the side\". John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him.

Barrowman claims that Jack also \"fancies\" fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her \"tenacity\" and willingness to \"spat with him\", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as \"fatherly\", stating \"He was guiding them. That's why it was so devastating for him to lose them.\" Offering reasons why Jack could never find \"The One\", Barrowman brings up the character's immortality. \"He always loses them. He outlives them. They die. He watches them get old. That bothered him in Series One [of \"Torchwood\"], but now he's come to terms with that, I think... so now he just sleeps around!\"\n\nIn several instances in \"Torchwood\", Jack displays no problems with killing a person of any species, which within \"Doctor Who\", allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series, he is verbally warned \"don't you dare\" when pointing a gun. Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen, Jack shoots his killer in the forehead, killing him in an act of quick revenge. Whilst the Doctor scorns Jack for joining the Torchwood Institute (an organisation he perceives as xenophobic and aggressive), Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctor's image; Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th-century Torchwood.\n\n", "id": "144866", "title": "Captain Jack Harkness"}

Initially heading west-northwest, it changed direction to almost due west shortly after reaching Category 4 intensity on July 11. After spending over a day at that intensity, Fico decayed and fell back down to a mid-range Category 1 on July 14. Fico then reintensified back to Category 4 strength the next day.\n\nThe hurricane's strength fluctuated, but Fico stayed a major hurricane until July 17, when it entered the central Pacific as a Category 1. It slowly intensified and became a major hurricane yet again on the 21st. At this point, Fico turned to the northwest and slowly lost strength. The storm dropped to a tropical storm early on July 28, and went extratropical later that day. At a later date, the remnants were enmeshed in a frontal system which headed towards the Aleutian Islands.\n\nFico was a tropical cyclone for 20 days, and travelled a distance of roughly 5500 mi (9000 km), both of which were records. It was also a hurricane for 17 consecutive days. Both of Fico's records have been broken. Hurricane Tina and then Hurricane John outlasted Fico. John also outran its distance record.\n\nFico never made landfall. Despite this, it pounded the Big Island with 15-30 foot waves doing \"considerable damage\" to roads and buildings along the coast. Smaller waves also broke on the southern shores of Maui with minimal effects. Six people aboard a sloop were washed overboard and rescued, while a tugboat was driven aground on a reef at Kukuiula. A weakening Fico also caused a sharp wind gradient, producing gusty gale-force winds that blew across the islands, knocking over trees and causing power outages. Fico's extratropical remnants caused heavy rains and gales south of Cold Bay in the Aleutians.\n\nThe name Fico was retired after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season.\n\n", "id": "144868", "title": "Hurricane Fico"}

He was king for 30 years. This time has been called the \"greatest explosion of human energy ever seen in Burma\". As king, Bayinnaung created the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia. This empire included much of Burma, Manipur, Chinese Shan States (southern Yunnan), Lan Na (northern Thailand), Siam (central and southern Thailand) and Lan Xang (Laos and northeastern Thailand).\n\nBayinnaung's made the Shan States part of the Burmese kingdoms. This removed the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma. This had been a concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century. The kink took control of the Shan States in 1557. He put in an administrative system that took away much of the power of the Shan saophas (chiefs). The also made changes to some of their customs to make them similar to other customs in the kingdoms. His policy for dealing with the Shan was used by all Burmese kings until the kingdom was taken control of by the British in 1885.\n\nHe could not use this policy everywhere in his very large empire. His empire was a group of former sovereign kingdoms. The kings of each of the kingdoms were loyal to him. He was the Cakravartin (Universal Ruler). They were not loyal to the kingdom itself. Siam left the kingdom three years after of his death in 1584. By 1599, all the sub-kingdoms had left. Bayinnaung's empire had ended.\n\nHe is thought to be one of the three best Burmese kings.

Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Tropical Storm Ana was two kinds of storms, a \"subtropical cyclone\", and a \"tropical cyclone\". It formed as a subtropical cyclone on April 20, while it was to the west of Bermuda. It moved towards the east-southeast and began to get better organized. On April 21, the subtropical cyclone became a tropical cyclone. Tropical Storm Ana then turned towards the east-northeast. It quickly lost strength because of wind shear and a close cold front. On April 24, Ana became an extratropical cyclone. \n\nThe storm moved near Bermuda, while causing light rainfall. The remnants of the storm also dropped rain in the Azores and the United Kingdom. Stormy sea waters caused by the storm capsized a boat near Florida coastline. The incident killed two people.\n\nA low pressure area formed to the south, and southwest, of Bermuda on April 18. A trough, which is a type of weather system, brought an area of clouds into the low pressure system. The low pressure system moved towards the north. After turning towards the northwest, the weather system looped southeastward. Thunderstorm activity became stronger near the center of the cyclone. The storm was named Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20, while located about 250 miles (400 km) west of Bermuda.\n\nThe subtropical storm moved to the east-southeastward and it continued to get stronger. It is estimated that Ana became a tropical storm by 0000 UTC on April 21. When it became a tropical cyclone, Ana reached its highest winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Shortly after, Ana came close to Bermuda. Strong wind shear began to remove a lot of the thunderstorm activity from Ana. Ana continued to move eastward, and early on April 22, the wind shear again removed the thunderstorms from the center of the storm. After turning towards the northeast, the core of Ana merged with a cold front on April 24. Because of t his, Tropical Storm Ana turned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the cyclone sped towards the east-northeastward, before it died out on April 27.\n\nBefore Ana was formed, the government of Bermuda declared a gale warning for the island. When Ana formed, a tropical storm warning was also issued for Bermuda. The storm moved close to Bermuda and dropped 2.63 inches (67 mm) of rainfall the Bermuda International Airport. The winds on the island were light. \n\nStormy seas from the storm reached the coast of Florida in the United States. A couple of factors, which included the stormy seas, caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet. Two people on the ship drowned, and the others were rescued. The remnants of Ana dropped 0.87 inches (22 mm) of rainfall in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores. Clouds from the remnants of Ana also caused rain in the United Kingdom. Two ships experienced tropical storm force winds because of Ana.\n\nAna was the second subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in the month of April. When the storm became a tropical cyclone, it was also the first Atlantic tropical storm in the month of April.

There are over 130,000 recognised species, with many more remaining to be described. The name is derived from the Greek words \"hymen\" meaning 'membrane' and \"ptera\" meaning 'wings. The hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks called \"hamuli\".\n\nFemales typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places. The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger. The young develop through complete metamorphosis — that is, they have a worm-like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature (See holometabolism).\n\nThese are the sawflies, the most primitive Hymenoptera. Their adults do not have a narrow 'waist' between the thorax and abdomen. The female's ovipositor is adapted to burrowing or sawing into the substrate, usually plant tissue. \n\nThese, the bees, wasps and ants, have a 'waist' between the thorax and abdomen. They are by far the most numerous Hymenoptera, and include the famous groups of colonial insects.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144917", "text": "Syrian American\n\nSyrian Americans are citizens of the United States of Syrian ancestry or nationality. This ethnic group includes first generation immigrants, and descendants of Syrians who immigrated to the United States. It is believed that Syrians first arrived in the United States in large number in 1880. Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in New York, Boston, and Detroit. Immigration from Syria to the United States was stopped for a long time after the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924, which made it difficult. \n\nMore than forty years later, the Immigration Act of 1965, removed the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States increased very much. It is estimated that 64,600 Syrians immigrated to the United States between 1961 and 2000.\n\nMost of the Syrian immigrants to the US from 1880 to 1960 were Christian; a small minority were Jewish, Muslim Syrians arrived in the United States mostly after 1965. According to the United States 2000 Census, there were 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry, about 12% of the Arab population in the United States.\n\nIt is believed that the first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from Greater Syria in the 1880s and worked as peddlers, selling linen and other similar types of goods. Before 1920, the area now known as Syria was actually part of Greater Syria, an area which included the four modern countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, and Syria itself. Most immigrants from the region were classified as \"Syrian,\" even though they were not ethnic Syrian; some were even registered as Syrian Turks as Syria was under Ottoman rule for 400 years. This makes difficulties in trying to work out how many Syrians arrived in the early years.\n\nMost of the early Syrian immigrants came from Christian villages around Mount Lebanon. According to historian Philip Hitti, approximately 90,000 \"Syrians\" arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919. An estimated 1,000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo, which are governorates in modern-day Syria, in the period between 1900 and 1916. Early immigrants settled mainly in northeastern United States, in the cities of New York City, Boston and Detroit and the Paterson, New Jersey area.\n\nAccording to the United States 2000 Census, there are 142,897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States. New York City has the biggest concentration of Syrian Americans in the United States. Other urban areas, including Boston, Dearborn, New Orleans, Toledo, Cedar Rapids, and Houston have large Syrian populations. Syrian Americans are also numerous in Southern California (i.e. the Los Angeles and San Diego areas) and Arizona.\n\nThe first Syrian immigrants to the United States wore traditional clothing, this along with the fact that they tended to work as peddlers, led to some xenophobia. Dr. A. J. McLaughlin, the United States health officer at Marine Hospital, described Syrians as \"parasites in their peddling habits.\" U.S. authorities claimed that Syrians had no right to become naturalized because they were Asian and did not belong to the white race. However, Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new culture. Immigrants Anglicized their names, adopted the English language and common Christian denominations.\n\nSyrians did not stay together in urban areas; many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were in contact with Americans on a daily basis. This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland. Also military service during World War I and World War II helped assimilation. Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized.\n\nAfter 1965 Immigration was mostly Muslim, and unlike their Christian counterparts they found it a bit harder assimilating because of their Islamic faith and the anti-assimilationist trend in America of the 1960s and 1970s. Also they are fond of their identity as Arabs, which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism to respect their Islamic religious customs and traditions in the United States. \n\nSyrians are mainly Arabic speakers. While some may speak the formal literary Arabic, many Syrians speak Syrian Arabic, a dialect which belongs to the Levantine Arabic family of dialects. There are also sub-dialects in Syrian Arabic; for example, people from Aleppo have a distinct accent, one that differs considerably from that of people from Homs or Al-Hasakah. Syrians can usually understand the dialects of most Arabs, especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic. \n\nMany old Syrian American families no longer speak Arabic because many parents do not teach their children Arabic. Newer immigrants, however, maintain their language traditions. The 2000 census shows that 79.9% of Syrian Americans speak English \"very well\". Throughout the United States, there are schools which offer Arabic language classes; there are also some Eastern Orthodox churches which hold Arabic services. Also to note Syria and Lebanon were briefly under French rule between 1918 and 1943 when they obtained independence, so many Syrian Americans are familiar with the French language.\n\n", "id": "144917", "title": "Syrian American"}

It is widely used on its own. It is also used in many other radio antenna designs where it forms the radiating or driven element for the antenna.\n\nThe dipole antenna is made of two poles into which radio frequency current flows. This current and the voltage causes an electromagnetic or radio signal to be radiated. Being more specific, a dipole is usually an antenna that uses a resonant length of conductor. This conductor is cut so it can be connected to the what is sending the signal. For resonance, the length of the conductor is an odd number of half wavelengths long. In most cases a single half-wavelength is used.\n\nThe length of a dipole is very important for selecting the frequency that the antenna will work at. The antenna is an electrical half wavelength, or multiple of half wavelengths. This is not the same length as the wavelength for a signal travelling through air. There are a number of reasons for this. This means that an antenna will be a small amount shorter than the length calculated for a wave moving in air.\n\nFor a half wave dipole, the length for a wave moving in air is calculated. This number is multiplied by a factor \"\"A\"\". \"A\" is normally between 0.96 and 0.98. It is affected by the ratio of the length of the antenna to the thickness of the wire or tube used poles.\n\nDipole antennas are used for many different things. These include television antennas (commonly referred to as \"rabbit ears\"), shortwave radio antennas and whip antennas.\n", "id": "144932", "title": "Dipole antenna"}

Then the equation (i1 + i4 = i2 + i3) is satisfied.\nThe right picture gives an example.\nThis Kirchhoff's first law is that charge is not destroyed or created in a junction point.\nThis is based by an electric charge preservation law. \n\nKirchhoff's voltage law is also known as Kirchhoff's second law, a closed circuit law, and Kirchhoff's loop law.\n\nThe algebraic sum of the voltage (potential) differences in any loop must equal zero.(This circuit is a closed circuit)\nAny complex circuit can be divided into many closed circuits.\nThis law means that in the circuit there is an electric cell and electric resistance.\nThe electric cell gives the charge a electromotive force, and then the electric resistance dissipates this force.\nBut in electric resistance if the direction is opposite of the current's direction, this electric resistance adds to the electromotive force.\nThis Kirchhoff's second law is based on potential energy preservation law.\n", "id": "145031", "title": "Kirchhoff's circuit laws"}

He is often said to be the inventor of the watch. This is disputed. Henlein was certainly one of the first makers of the watch. Although many say that Henlein invented the mainspring, there are descriptions and two surviving examples show that spring driven clocks had already been made by the early 1400s. He did make improvements to the balance spring, which made it possible to make the watches smaller.\n\nAround 1504 to 1508 Henlein did make a watch; a small, drum-shaped \"Taschenuhr\". It could run for forty hours before it needed rewinding. They were small enough to be worn around the neck, or carried in a bag or pocket.

The small cavity magnetron tube made the size of radar sets much smaller so that they could be put into in aircraft and ships used to find submarines.

But the foreigners, whether the Persians, Greeks, Arabs, Turco-Mongols as well as the British, have all enriched the indigenous languages so that their vocabulary is multilingual and varied. As the people of these areas converted to Islam, Arabic and Persian words influenced and became part of their identity, and remain so. In a sense, it is their very presence, as well as the Arabic-based scripts of all 75 Pakistani languages, which gave them a cultural unity. Linguistically, Pakistan faces two directions: India, because the roots of its languages are Dravidian as well as Indo-Aryan; and the Middle East, because its scripture and vocabulary owe very much so to Arabic and based on Farsi, for e.g. the national anthem is a highly Persianized form of Urdu.\nother languages include burushaski, balti, domaaki , gawar-bati , Erina , shina and brahvi.\n", "id": "145173", "title": "Languages of Pakistan"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145184", "text": "Forensic psychology\n\nForensic psychology is a branch of psychology which relates to the law. The main part of forensic psychology is working with the criminal justice system.\n\nForensic psychology is the use of psychological practices and principles and applying them to the legal system, mainly in court. In 1893 James McKeen Cattell at Columbia University was the first to research and study the psychology of testimony. \n\nThe American Psychological Association Council of Representatives in 2001 recognized Forensic psychology as a specialty. A broad definition for forensic psychology includes two parts. The first part is to research human behavior that is and/or can be related to the legal process. The second is the use of psychological practice to consult on and within the legal system, including both criminal and civil law. \n\nThe public part of a forensic psychologist’s time is spent in a courtroom working as a witness for the court. He or she answers questions based on interviews and discussions with people suspected of a crime. One aspect of the forensic psychologist is to give evidence as to the suspect’s ability to stand trial. Another is his or her thoughts about the accused's state of mind at the time of the offense. At sentencing, a forensic psychologist may give evidence of mitigating circumstances arising from the acuused's condition at the time.\n\nForensic psychology has some major roles in a court that bring psychology into a legal arena. The first is \"malingering\" a defendant is pretending to have a mental illness, or is lying to the court about his state of mind. A forensic psychologist keeps in mind that a defendant may have a mental disorder but also keeps in mind to watch for signs of deception, or errors in the defendant’s story. Another job of a forensic psychologist is to investigate the state of mind of the defendant at the time he or she committed the crime. Another is to see whether or not the defendant is able to be charged with the crimes due to his or her mental condition. Another job is to evaluate the defendant to see if he or she are able to be rehabilitated, or if they might commit the crime again. \n\nThe branch of psychology known as Forensic psychology has been in existence for a little over 50 years. This branch of psychology has gone through many changes throughout the years.\n\nThese changes have been possible due to a development in different ways to assess psychological factors. These assessments are used in courtrooms in order to work to understand behaviors which are criminal or abnormal. These tests include but are not limited to: The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Rorschach Ink Blot Test and The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. \n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans were the ones to first introduce the concept of insanity to the law. One of the first cases was Rex v. Arnold in 1723 in which Edward Arnold \"Mad Ned\" shot and injured Lord Onslow. As a result, Edward Arnold was found guilty and sentenced to death. But, Lord Onslow was not satisfied with this decision and said instead he should remain in prison for life. The judge ruled in his favor and that the behavior after the crime was admissible. This ruling set the stage for future trials to consider medical testimony and examinations performed after the crime. \n\nThe Rorschach Ink Blot Test was developed in the 1930s by a man named Hermann Rorschach. With this test, subjects were shown an ambiguous blot of ink on a page and were asked to describe what they see. Based on the response of the subject, they are then evaluated using a scale which can then provide inferences about their personality characteristics as well as emotional functioning. Based on the contributions of this test, it has been used in multiple court proceedings including but not limited to criminal, civil, domestic, and quasi-legal. \n\n", "id": "145184", "title": "Forensic psychology"}

It is \"the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen\". \n\nThe idea of an opportunity cost was first begun by John Stuart Mill. The utility has to be more than the opportunity cost for it to be a good choice in economics.\n\nFor example, opportunity cost is how much leisure time we give up to work. Because leisure and income are both valued, we have to decide whether to work, or do what we want. Going to work implies more income but less leisure. Staying at home is more leisure yet less income.\n\nAnother example is deciding to stop work to go back to university. By choosing to go to university, your opportunity cost is losing your job and your pay check. Even though going back to university has a big opportunity cost, many people think it is a good decision because increased education gives you more job opportunities.\n", "id": "145200", "title": "Opportunity cost"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145344", "text": "Static electricity\n\nStatic electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects. This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground, or loses its charge quickly by a discharge. Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated. A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow. The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see, feel and even hear the spark. This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized. This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor (for example a path to ground). Other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static 'shock' is caused by the neutralization of charge.\n\nIn Greek age, Thales found static electricity when he was cleaning his amber. But at that time, they did not pay attention to this and research it. They just knew that rubbing something made a pulling force. Earnest research into static electricity was started in the 17th century, when Otto von Guericke made the first friction generator. And in the 18th century, Coulomb started research into a fixed quantity of static electricity. Benjamin Franklin associated static electricity with storms. In 1832 Michael Faraday published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities. This report proved that the electricity made by using a magnet, voltaic electricity produced by a battery, and static electricity are all the same. Since Faraday's result, the history of static electricity can be thought as the study of electricity in general.\n\nMany situations can cause static electricity.\n\nStatic discharge is excess charge that is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings. Positive charges get \nelectrons from the surroundings, and negative charges lose their electrons to the surroundings.\n\nThe feeling of a static electric shock is caused by the stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body. Due to the presence of much water in the body, the charge is generally not enough to cause a dangerously high current. Lightning is also an example of static discharge. A cloud gets a very huge charge by clashing with other clouds. It gives off the excess charge to the ground. But this huge charge never occurs in the human's surroundings naturally, unless he is struck by the lightning.\nDespite the apparently harmless nature of static electricity, there can be significant risks in research, because a large charge can break down the equipment.\n", "id": "145344", "title": "Static electricity"}

Much like hours on a clock, which repeat every twelve hours, once the numbers reach a certain value, called the \"modulus\", they go back to zero.\n\nPeople talked about modular arithmetic in many ancient cultures. For instance, the Chinese remainder theorem is many centuries old. The modern notation and exact definition of modular arithmetic were first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n\nModular arithmetic can be used to show the idea of congruence. Two integers, \"a\" and \"b\", are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when both are divided by the positive integer \"n\". Congruence can be written this way:\nThe number \"n\" is called the modulus. Another definition of congruence, that means the same thing but is sometimes more useful, is that the two integers are congruent modulo n if the difference (\"a\" - \"b\") is an integer multiple of \"n\". That is, if \"n\" is a factor of (\"a\" - \"b\"), then \"a\" and \"b\" are congruent mod \"n\".\n\nFor example:\nThe remainder when 32 is divided by 7 is 4, and the remainder when 11 is divided by 7 is also 4. This tell us they're congruent, mod 7.\n\nWe can use this example it with the other definition too. The difference, (\"a\" - \"b\"), is 32 - 11 = 21. This shows the two numbers are congruent because 21 = 3 * 7, and 7 is a factor of 21.\n\nModular arithmetic is useful in many fields, such as cryptography, computer science, and music. It is often used in calculating checksums and check digits.\n", "id": "145380", "title": "Modular arithmetic"}

They are the largest penguins of the stiff-tailed family, which also makes them the largest penguin except the two giant penguins, the emperor penguin and the king penguin.\n\nThe gentoo penguin is, on average, 5 kilograms in weight and 80 centimeters in height, but can range from 8.5 kg to 4.5 kg and 51 to 91 cm. They have very large male reproductive organs, and are also the fastest at swimming underwater among the penguins, reaching speeds of 36 kilometers per hour.\n\nGentoo penguins generally live on Antarctic islands, with their largest colony on the Falkland Islands. There are approximately 320,000 breeding pairs of gentoo penguins.\n\nThese penguins nest on the ground, making nests of stones, sticks, grass, feathers, and various other materials. They usually lay two eggs by mid-October, which hatch in about 34 days, and put equal care into caring for either chick. Young chicks remain in the nest for 3 to 4 weeks until their second down feathers grow in, during which their parents hunt for food in order to feed them. Afterward, they leave the nest but remain in the colony in groups of chicks, called creches that free their parents to hunt for food for them.\n\nGentoo penguin pairs often stay together for a long period of time.\n\nGentoo penguins usually eat crustaceans, such as krill, but genrally eat what is easiest to get. At sea, they may be under attack from sea lions, leopard seals, and orcas. While on land they have no natural predators, but skua, gulls, and other birds of prey have been known to attack and eat young chicks and eggs.\n\n", "id": "145413", "title": "Gentoo penguin"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145426", "text": "Megabat\n\nMegabats are also called Old World fruit bats. They are the suborder Megachiroptera, family Pteropodidae of the order Chiroptera (bats).\n\nThese fruit bats are flying mammals that live in dense forests in Africa, Europe, Australia, and Asia. There are about 166 species of fruit bats. Fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes. These bats live in huge colonies, known as \"camps.\" These nocturnal (most active at night) animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet. \n\nAs fruit bats fly from plant to plant getting food, they also pollinate the plants they visit. In addition, they disperse the plants' seeds as they eat. Many plants, including some avocados, dates, mangos, and peaches, are dependent on these bats for either pollination or seed dispersal.\n\nFruit bats mostly eat fruit juice and flower nectar. They chew the fruit, then spit out the seeds, peel, and pulp. Fruit bats, like other Megachiropteran bats, use the sense of smell to find their food, fruit and/or nectar. Although they have large eyes and can see well, fruit bats do not use sight as their primary sense. Fruit bats eat other things too.\n\nSome megabats are vectors of dangerous diseases.\nThe first recorded human outbreak of Ebola virus was in 1976, but the source of the virus is still unknown. Recent tests have shown that some species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks show the bats have the virus, but do not show any signs of it. Further studies also show that Ebola can reproduce in fruit bats and other bats in the 'Tadarida' genus. This could mean that the bats are the source of the virus. The Marburg virus, which is related to Ebola, has also been found in fruit bats in Uganda.\n\nAnother explanation is that fruit bats could be an intermediate host because of the uncertainty that fruit bats are the index case for Ebola. It is also important to note that certain species of fruit bats in Africa are immune to the Ebola virus and that their DNA or RNA are similar to the Zaire Ebola virus. This could explain the spread to humans since people in that region tend to eat fruit bats.\n\nFlying foxes in Australia are known to carry two infections which can pose a serious risk to human health - Australian bat lyssavirus and Hendra virus (Henipavirus). These bat-borne diseases, unique to Queensland, are among the deadliest viruses in the Western world. Although rare, these illnesses continue to mystify medical professionals. Unlike HIV/AIDS, which can now be effectively mitigated by medication, diagnosis of these bat-borne diseases is almost always fatal. Human infections with these viruses are fortunately very rare. Wherever human civilisations encroach on their natural habitat, e.g. as a part of rainforest clearing operations for mining or agricultural use, there exists risk of accidental infectious human contact. \nHendra virus is a virus that mainly infects megabats (large fruit bats, or ‘flying foxes’) which can be passed on to horses. Like Ebola and Marburg, Hendra is a haemorrhagic fever with high to very high mortality(50-90%). Both Ebola and Marburg virus have been associated with megabats as infectious vectors. \nIt is thought that horses contract the Hendra virus by ingesting food or water contaminated with infected megabat body fluids and excretions. The virus can then be passed onto humans if they come into contact with an infected horse's nasal discharge, blood, saliva or urine. The virus can be deadly to both humans and horses. When there is no handling or direct physical contact with flying foxes (for example, with their body fluids or excreta), there is negligible public health risk. \nOnly three people are known to have survived the bat-borne Hendra virus.\nSo far more than half of all people who have contracted Hendra virus died within six weeks, however there have been no survivors of a second Queensland bat-borne disease. In 1994 lyssavirus - a close relative of rabies virus - was first discovered in a flying fox showing symptoms near Ballina, NSW (which lies on the border with Queensland). Lyssavirus has killed the only three people to have ever contracted it. Lyssavirus, however, is not a hemorrhagic fever like Ebola, Marburg and Hendra, but resembles that of rabies. Lyssavirus victims exhibit rapid deterioration, with influenza-like symptoms followed by irreversible coma then death. The incubation period, during which few symptoms appear, is highly variable, and may extend to many months.\n\n", "id": "145426", "title": "Megabat"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145543", "text": "Gray whale\n\nThe gray whale (\"Eschrichtius robustus\") is a baleen whale (a filter feeder) that has a layer of blubber up to 10 inches (25 cm) thick. Because a mother gray whale would defend her calf so fiercely it would actually attack whalers and overturn their boats, whalers often called the gray whale a devilfish. \n\nThe gray whale migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods. Gray whales are very agile swimmers. They can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet (155 m) deep. Gray whales make grunts, clicks, and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales.\n\nThis giant cetacean eats small fish, crustaceans, squid, and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor. It sieves its food through its comb-like plates of baleen.\n\nCompared to most baleen whales, gray whales are rather small, growing to be only about 45 feet long. They are easy to see with their gray color, which is actually more charcoal black than it is gray. Gray whales have lots of barnacles and lice on their skin. However, scientists say the lice and barnacles do not harm the whale, and it is possible they may actually \"help\" the whale by feeding off of dead skin, which the whale needs to get rid of.\n\nWhales prefer one fin over the other, just like humans are right-handed or left-handed. It is possible to see whether a gray whale is left-fineed or right-finned. The fin that has least barnacles is the fin it uses most. This is because the whale likes to dive down to the ocean floor to up huge amounts of sand from the bottom, filtering out small prey animals that live in it. When the whale does this, many of the barnacles on the side that rubbed along the bottom are scraped off. So, whichever side has fewest barnacles is the side the whale prefers to use when it digs up sand.\n\nGray whales make a really long migration from the Arctic Ocean (northwest of Alaska) to the coast of Mexico, and back each year. They travel about 20,000 km (~12,500 miles) each year, staying near the coast. They feed in the cold Arctic waters and calve and mate in the warm, protected tropical lagoons of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico.\n", "id": "145543", "title": "Gray whale"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145556", "text": "Basking shark\n\nThe Basking shark (\"Cetorhinus maximus\") is a huge filter-feeding shark, which can grow up to the length of 40 feet (12 metres). It is the second largest shark in the world (after the Whale shark). The Basking shark is also called the Sunfish, the Bone shark, the Elephant shark, the Sailfish shark, and the Big mouth shark.\n\nThe Basking shark is one of the most recognizable species of all sharks. Its large size and extended gill slits which nearly encircle the head and caudal fin together, helps distinguish it from all other species. It has a snout which is in the shape of a cone, and it has many large gill rakers made for filter feeding. Its enormous mouth extends past the small eyes and contains many small, hooked teeth. The Basking shark has a very large liver that makes up to 25% of its body weight. The liver is high in squalene, a low-density hydrocarbon that helps the shark float and not sink.\nThe dorsal surface of the Basking shark is mainly a greyish-brown colour, but can range from dark grey to almost black. The underside is usually the same colour, but is often paler and more whiter.\nThe Basking shark has many hundreds of tiny teeth. Those teeth which are in the center of the jaws are low and triangular while those on the sides are more cone-shaped and slightly recurved. There is mainly a wide space on the center of the upper jaw which only has scattered teeth. \nThe Basking shark is the second largest shark in the world, only to be behind the Whale shark. The Basking shark can reach lengths of up to 40 feet (12 metres), but the average adult length is 22–29 feet (6.6-8.7 m). The size at birth is believed to be between 5–6 feet (1.5-1.8 metres). The Basking shark is an extremely slow-growing species and may grow to 16–20 feet (4.8–6 metres) before becoming mature.\n\nThe Basking shark is a coastal-pelagic species, found throughout the world's arctic and temperate waters. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from Newfoundland to Florida, and southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic it ranges from Iceland and Norway to Senegal, including the parts of the Mediterranean. In the western Pacific, it is found off Japan, China and the Koreas as well as western and southern Australia and the coastlines of New Zealand. In the eastern Pacific, it is found from the Gulf of Alaska to the Gulf of California and from Ecuador to Chile.\n\nBasking sharks are usually found travelling in pairs or groups of up to 100 or more, but are sometimes seen travelling alone. It is not fully understood why they have such a different behaviour to other shark species, as they seem to travel alone and in groups. They are highly migrational, and in the winter months they will be harder to find as they go to the deeper parts of the water to find food.\nWhen they are seen swimming in circles, it is believed that this is to get the attention of females for mating. They may spend hours performing this, just in order to get noticed. They are usually very patient when it comes to attracting a mate.\n\nAlong with the Whale shark and the Megamouth shark, the Basking shark is one of three species of large, filter-feeding sharks. However, the Basking shark is the only one that relies on the flow of water through its pharynx by swimming. The Basking shark is usually seen swimming with its mouth wide open, taking in a continuous flow of water. Food is strained from the water by gill rakers in the gill slits. The Basking shark's gill rakers can strain up to 2000 tons of water per hour. These sharks feed along areas that contain high densities of large zooplankton (i.e., small crustaceans, invertebrate larvae, and fish eggs and larvae). There is a theory that the Basking shark feeds on the surface when plankton is common, then sheds its gill rakers and hibernates in deeper water during winter. Also, it has been suggested that the Basking shark turns to benthic (near bottom) feeding when it loses its gill rakers. It is not known how often it sheds these gill rakers or how quickly they are replaced.\n\nBasking sharks are ovoviviparous, meaning that the young embryos develop in a yolk sac inside of the female, but they aren’t attached to a placental connection. It is believed that the females can delay gestation so that they may remain pregnant from 1 to 3 years. Mating occurs in the early summer and the females often move to very shallow water when ready for the young to be born. She may have up to 6 pups that are up to 6 feet long. The age of maturity is from 6 to 13 years. Basking sharks start mating when they are around 15 to 20 feet long.\n\nBasking sharks are highly migratory. Off the Atlantic coast of North America, it appears in the southern part of its range (North Carolina to New York) in the spring, shifts northward (New England and Canada) in the summer, and disappears in autumn and winter. Off the southwest coast of the United Kingdom, in the northeast Atlantic, the Basking shark feeds at the surface of coastal waters during the summer. These sharks are absent from November to March, suggesting a migration beyond the continental shelf during the winter months. This is explained by the high amount of zooplankton (the main food of the Basking shark) that exists in these waters during late spring and early summer. During migration, Basking sharks form groups depending on size and gender.\n\nMany people have witnessed individual Basking sharks leaping from the water. This behaviour is not fully understood, but some believe that the shark may be trying to get rid of parasites or commensals such as remoras and sea lampreys, which are often seen attached to the skin of the Basking shark. The lamprey cannot cut through the denticle-armored skin, but they may be enough of an irritant to cause a reaction like jumping or rubbing against an object to get rid of them. The cookiecutter shark has also been known to attack Basking sharks by using its suction cup-like lips and muscular pharynx to drill off pieces of flesh on the outside of the shark.\n\nThe Basking shark has been hunted for its large liver, which has been sold in Japan, and has been burned and used in lamps by fishermen in the U.K, whilst the oil has been used in the manufacture of cosmetics. Due to the long amount of time it takes to mature, and the slow reproductive rate, the Basking shark is vulnerable to over-fishing, and targeted populations are very slow to recover from targeted fisheries. Today the biggest threat comes from the demand for the fins for shark fin soup, and from accidental by-catches in the fishing industries. Although it is difficult to tell exactly, there has been a report that the population of Basking sharks has decreased by 80% since 1950.\n", "id": "145556", "title": "Basking shark"}

Nora became a hurricane in a favourable environment September 18 while moving northwest. Its motion then stalled over an upwelling of cooler water that weakened it.\n\nOn September 20, Nora again started moving. It reached its peak intensity of 115 knots and 950 mb On September 21 and 22 it moved over the wake of Hurricane Linda. This weakened the storm pack down to a Category 1.\n\nDuring this time, a trough developed that turned Nora to the northeast. This carried Nora over a favourable environment and towards Baja California. After restrengthening slightly, Nora made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Punta Eugenia and again south of San Fernando, both times as a hurricane.\n\nNora stayed a tropical storm as it moved into the United States. Yuma reported sustained gale-force winds. Rains were heavy, sometimes exceeding the \"annual\" rainfall for the area. Nora weakened to a depression while over California, and it dissipated September 26.\n\nNora killed two people in Mexico. One was killed by a downed power line in Mexicali, and the other was a scuba diving in underwater currents. No one in the United States was directly killed by Nora. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed several traffic accident deaths to the weather.\n\nThere was extensive damage to areas hit by Nora. Waves ruined dozens of homes. Roughly 350 to 400 people were left homeless in San Felipe, and winds uprooted trees and peeled roofs from homes in Puerto Peñasco.\n\nIn the United States, thousands were left without power in California and Arizona, and 16 telephone poles were downed in Seeley. Streets flooded in San Diego, Indio, El Centro, and Palm Springs. A remnant circulation continued aloft, and damaged trees and three homes in Utah. Total damages were \"several hundred million dollars\", as well as 40 million dollars to lemon trees.\n\nNora crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near Bahía Tortugas, Baja California Sur. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles (95 km) south-southeast of San Fernando, Baja California.\n\nAt landfall, a trough was accelerating Nora northwards, causing it to reach a forward speed of 30 mph (50 km/h). Late on September 25 (UTC), still a tropical storm, it entered the continental United States at the California-Arizona state line. Nora began to weaken rapidly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later, while located between Blythe and Needles, California. Nora reached Arizona while still tropical, becoming the third known system to do so. Nora degenerated over land, and the low-level center moved towards the north-northeast. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City, Utah Doppler weather radar. The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of Utah, Colorado, Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nOn September 24, Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull activated an emergency response center to prepare the state's response to the flash flooding the storm would cause on the dry desert floor, and Yuma residents began to fill approximately 55,000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding. Hull also activated the state's National Guard, and sent drinking water and electric generators to Yuma. Farther inland, the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona, southeastern California, southwestern Colorado, southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26.\n\nIn the United States, there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane. However, the California Highway Patrol attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern California to the weather.\n\nDamage totals in the United States are not fully known, although media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars, and at least one study places the figure at $150–200 million (1997 USD). It is estimated that $30–40 million (1997 USD) in damage to lemon trees occurred. Although Nora was significantly weakened, near hurricane-force winds were observed at the Dixie National Forest in southwestern Utah, where strong gusts sheared off the tops of large trees.\n\nThe Yuma radar indicated a small area of rainfall totals along the northern Gulf of California coast of Baja California. In the United States, the largest total rainfall was recorded at the Harquahala Mountains in Arizona, where of rainfall were recorded as a result of Nora, causing flash floods in western Arizona.\n\nNear Phoenix, rainfall from the storm caused the Narrows Dam, a small earthen dam, to fail. In other locations in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah, more than occurred in a few localized areas, sometimes with precipitation comparable to the entire local yearly average rainfall. Flooding was also reported in Somerton, San Diego, El Centro, Palm Springs and Indio, while 12,000 people lost power in Yuma, as well as Los Angeles and southwestern Utah.\n\nDespite the damage, the World Meteorological Organization did not retire the name \"Nora\" during its meeting in the spring of 1998. As a result, it was used in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season and is on the list of names to be used in 2009.\n", "id": "145696", "title": "Hurricane Nora (1997)"}

Chess boxing fights have been done since early 2003. The sport was started when Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh, given the idea by a similar sport in the writing of Enki Bilal, started actual matches. The sport has become more well known since then. To do well at chess boxing, players must be both good chess players and good boxers.\n\nA match between two players is made up of up to eleven rounds of boxing and chess sessions, starting with a four-minute chess round followed by two minutes of boxing and so on. Between rounds there is a one-minute pause, during which the players change their gear. The form of chess played is speed chess in which each player has a total of twelve minutes for the whole game. Players may win by knocking out the other player, checkmate, a judge's choice, or if the other player runs out of chess time. If a player does not make a move in the round of chess, he will be given a warning by the referee and he must then make a move in the next 10 seconds.\n\nThe idea was started in 1992 by cartoonist Enki Bilal, and a match of chess boxing was a big story part of his graphic novel \"Froid Équateur\". Iepe Rubingh, a Dutch artist, was took the idea from Bilal's book and started the sport in the spring of 2001. Rubingh decided that the method of play in the book, a boxing match with a chess match after, was not very good. Rubingh made the rules so a round of chess would come after a round of boxing.\n\nThe World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO), keeps control of the sport. The first world championship was in Amsterdam in 2003 and was won by Iepe Rubingh, the starter of the sport. The First European Chess Boxing Championship took place in Berlin on October 1, 2005 when Tihomir Atanassov Dovramadjiev of Bulgaria beat Andreas D'Schneider of Germany after D'Schneider gave up in the seventh round.\n\nIn April 2008, the World Chess Federation, FIDE, posted a video on its website in which its president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov played a friendly chess boxing match in Elista. Also in April 2008 the UK's first Chess Boxing club was started in London by Great Britain Chess Boxing Organisation founder Tim Woolgar.

The town is built on the banks of the Boorowa River, which flows into the Lachlan River. The town was first called \"Burrowa\". Boorowa and Burrowa are Aboriginal words in the Wiradjuri language meaning \"birds\". In 2008, there were 1350 living in Boorowa.\n\nThe first people to live in the area were the Wiraduri people. This was one of the largest tribes in New South Wales. They had several regular camping sites along the Lachlan and Boorowa Rivers. It is estimated that there were several thousand Wiradjuri people at the time of European settlement. A survey in 1851 showed that there were only 300 people left. Local Wiradjuri people were forced onto government reserves at Rye Park and Edgerton.\n\nIt is not known for sure who the first European explorers were in this area. Hamilton Hume and his neighbour, William Broughton, had explored the Yass area in 1821. They may have gone farther towards the Lachlan. Broughton had one of the first farms on the Boorowa River in 1828. By 1849, he had of land in the area. Other early settlers were James Hassall in 1827. His family already had large farms at Cowra by 1823. His brother Tom Hassal, a clergyman and his wife Ann Marsden (daughter of Reverend Samuel Marsden) and other family members were given land in 1831. There was a law at the time which gave free land to the children of clergy.\n\nMany of the settlers in Boorowa were from Ireland and the town shows their influence. Two early settlers in the 1820s were cousins, Roger Corcoran and Ned Ryan. They had been sent to Australia as convicts. Saint Patrick's Church, built in 1877 has a huge stained glass window brought from Ireland in 1881.

The first farm in the area was Marengo Station, 1833, owned by John Scarr. By 1840 there were about 40 people living in the area. When the town was laid out by the surveyors in 1849, they called the town Murringo. It has also been called Meringo, Marringa, Maringa, Muringo, Maringo and Marengo. In 1926 the town was officially called Murringo. In 1864, Ben Hall robbed John Scarr and his brother as they rode along the road to Burrowa.\n\nThe original plans included a market place, a big cemetery and large parks. When gold was found nearby at Lambing Flat in 1860, most of the people moved to the goldfields. Although there were only about 120 people living in the town, the people saved money and built the Christ Church Anglican Church in 1866. The foundation stone for the Sacred Heart Catholic Church was laid in 1871. A post office opened in 1857.\n\nA number of historic buildings are still standing in Murringo. The church (1866), the Marengo Hotel, the police station (1880), the school (1870), school teacher's house (1879), the Plough Inn (a hotel) (built before 1860) and the Post Office (1857).

It is 37 km north-west of Yass. \nThe Aboriginal people who lived in the area were part of the Ngunnawal people. The first Europen to visit the area was Hamilton Hume in 1821. The name of the town is believed to come from either an Aboriginal word meaning 'towards a high place' or from 'Bennelong', the name of a famous Aborigine.\n\nBinalong was outside the legal limits of European settlement in New South Wales. However farmers settled in the area before the law changed to allow settlement in 1839. From 1847 there was a police camp at Binalong and a court. The old Cobb and Co inn was built at that time as a staging post for Cobb and Co coaches.\n\nThe town was officially listed in 1850. It was an important stop on the way for people going to look for gold at Lambing Flat. The school was started in 1861. Gold also meant that there were bushrangers in the area. The grave of John Gilbert is near the town in the field where the police kept their horses. He was a member of Frank Gardiner's gang and later Ben Hall's gang. He was shot dead by police in 1865. \n\nThe first railway station opened in 1875. The railway arrived in 1876. The current building was put up when the railway line was moved in 1916.

He showed great talent as a young man and might have become one of England’s greatest composers if he had lived longer. He was killed while fighting in World War I. He is best known for a group of songs which are settings of poems by A. E. Housman.\n\nButterworth was born in London. His father was a solicitor who later became the general manager of the North Eastern Railway. The family moved to Yorkshire soon after George’s birth. He had his first music lessons from his mother, who was a singer, He soon started to compose music. His father wanted him to be a solicitor and so he sent his son to Eton College. From there he went to Trinity College, Oxford. At Oxford he became more and more involved with music, especially after he met the folk song collector Cecil Sharp and composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams. Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs. Both of them were influenced by English folk songs when they were composing. Butterworth was also a very good folk dancer. He was particularly fond of Morris dancing.\n\nVaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends. It was Butterworth who said to Vaughan Williams that it would be a good idea to turn the symphonic poem he was working on into his \"London Symphony\". When the manuscript for that piece was lost in the post Butterworth and two other musicians helped Vaughan Williams to write it out again. Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworth's memory after his death. When he left Oxford, Butterworth became a music critic for \"The Times\" as well as composing and teaching at Radley College, Oxfordshire. He also studied at the Royal College of Music for a short time, working with people such as Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford. \n\nAlthough Butterworth had lots of work he often felt that his life had no purpose. When World War I broke out, Butterworth felt that he could be useful so he joined the British Army. He was killed by a sniper in 1916 at Pozières leading a raid during the Battle of the Somme. His body was not found, and his name appears on the Thiepval memorial, near the site of the Somme. He was awarded the Military Cross, and a trench was named after him.\n\nButterworth did not write a great deal of music, and during the war he destroyed many of his compositions that he thought were not good enough. Of those that survive, his works based on A. E. Housman's collection of poems \"A Shropshire Lad\" are the best known. Many English composers of Butterworth's time set Housman's poetry, including Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nButterworth wrote two song cycles on Housman's poems. They include some of the best-loved English songs of the 20th century, especially \"Is My Team Ploughing?\" and \"Loveliest of Trees\". He used this last song as the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody, also called \"A Shropshire Lad\". It is full of soft, tender music as well as passion.\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

His father was a very successful lawyer who was also interested in music. He played the cello and sang. Stanford’s mother played the piano. The young boy heard a lot of music at his home as there were often visitors who came to make music. Charles studied the piano, organ and composition and was composing and performing at concerts when he was still very young.\n\nHis parents had wanted their son to be a lawyer, but it was obvious that music was to be his profession. He won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge in 1870 where he was a choral scholar. He learned very quickly and in 1873, while he was still a student, he was made organist of Trinity College and conductor of two choirs. While he had these jobs he was given time to make visits to Germany where he studied with Carl Reinecke and Friedrich Kiel. He met several famous composers including Brahms and Offenbach. He went to the opening of the Bayreuth Festival Theatre where the music of Richard Wagner was performed.\n\nStanford took his BA degree in 1874 and MA in 1878, and was given the honorary degree of D.Mus. at Oxford in 1883 and at Cambridge in 1888. He had a lot of energy and was known for working very hard. When the Royal College of Music opened in London in 1883 Stanford was made professor there. He became conductor of the Bach Choir and then he was made professor of music at Cambridge. He was still only 35 years old. He kept these two professorships until his death. Although he gave up his job as organist at Trinity he became conductor of the Leeds Triennial Festival and appeared with nearly every important British music festival. In 1902 he was knighted.\n\nStanford married in 1878 and the couple had two children.\n\nStanford died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nStanford is best known today for the choral music he wrote for the Anglican church. These includes some very fine anthems and motets as well as service settings. His music was much better than most of the church music that had been composed during the 19th century, so he helped to make British music better. He composed many pieces for music festivals: these include oratorios and cantatas as well as partsongs and solo songs. He also wrote a lot of orchestral and instrumental works.

His father was an Irish clergyman. Ernest spent most of his childhood living on the coast of Norfolk. He learned to play the violin and the piano. At first he was taught at home by a governess. When he was ten he went to school. In 1908, he went to Uppingham School where he spent five years. When he left school in 1913 he started to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music with Charles Villiers Stanford.\n\nMoeran’s studies at the Royal College of Music were interrupted after 18 months because of the start of World War I. He joined the army as a despatch rider but he was soon badly injured in the head and could no longer fight in the army. After the war he did some music teaching, but then he started to study music again. His teacher this time was John Ireland who had been a pupil of Moeran’s earlier teacher Stanford.\n\nAfter these studies his music started to be performed a lot. His \"First Rhapsody\" for orchestra was performed several times, including in 1924 by the Hallé Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty. He was asked to compose a symphony for the Hallé Orchestra, but he preferred to write shorter pieces, especially chamber music and piano music. In 1931 he wrote a \"String Trio\" which is one of his best works. \n\nMoeran became interested in folk music. He liked to go to country pubs and listen to the people singing there. He collected about 150 folk songs in Norfolk and Suffolk and made many arrangements of them.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, Moeran had become close friends with Peter Warlock. They lived together and often went out drinking together. Moeran gradually became an alcoholic.\n\nIn 1945, after Warlock had died, Moeran married the cellist Peers Coetmore. The marriage was not very happy although it helped Moeran to compose some of his best pieces: the \"Cello Concerto\" and \"Cello Sonata\".\n\nMoeran was found drowned in the River Kenmare. At first people thought he had committed suicide but then it was found that he had had a heart attack and died before he fell into the water.\n\nMoeran’s music is influenced by folk song. His harmonies are often like those of Delius. He was also influenced by Vaughan Williams, Holst, Bax, John Ireland and Peter Warlock. For many years he concentrated on piano music, songs and chamber music, but in his later years he wrote larger works such as the Symphony in G minor (1934-7) and his Concertos for the Violin and the Cello.\n\n", "id": "146140", "title": "Ernest Moeran"}

A \"hologram\" is a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture made from a laser. When a person looking at it moves, the hologram changes slightly with the movement to make it look as if the picture was 3-D.\n\nHolograms are made with light that is flashed onto the scene, then something to write or draw the hologram on, almost like how photos are made. To make a hologram and not a photo, some of the light (a \"reference beam\") has to go right onto the thing that the hologram is being written on. The light has to be a laser because lasers are more accurate and have a wavelength that doesn't change, like the wavelength of other light sources like lightbulbs do. To stop other light from messing the hologram up, holograms are usually taken in the darkness.\n\nHolograms might be easier to explain if compared to photos. In contrast to photography, holography not only records the intensity of light, but also its difference of phase. All pieces of information reflected by the object, are recorded.\n\n\nIn holography you basically work with two (rather three) waves, the so called reference wave (that goes on to the plate) and the exposure wave (object wave(which comes from the object)). With the reference wave it is possible to save the phase information in the form of a light-dark model on a film. The object wave and reference wave must have the same wave length in order to save the phase information.\n\nThe most famous person linked to the history of holography is the physician Dennis Gábor, the inventor of the hologram.\nIn fact his discovery in 1947, which demonstrated the highlight of a long development, was not supposed to display three-dimensional objects, but to improve the resolving capacity of microscopes.\n\n\nFor a hologram you need a laser beam, that gets enlarged by a dispersing lens and goes through a semi penetrable mirror. Only a piece of this laser beam goes through the mirror. Then this beam becomes the reference wave which is recorded on the film. The other piece of the laser beam will be reflected on the mirror and runs as the so called exposure wave at the object.The object reflects this wave on the film.\n\nThe process of creating a hologram is nearly identical to photography through diverse chemicals.\nTo look at a hologram just recorded, you have to light the film with the reference wave. These waves are reflected on the film (hologram) and create (within the proper angle of sight) a virtual picture of the recorded object.\n\nNowadays industries use holograms more often to measure. In the automotive engineering the autobody is measured by holography techniques for bulges and vibration characteristics. An example of this method is the phase-shift-method. \nFirst you take a hologram from the ground level state of the object, then overload the object through heat or mechanical pressure. By covering the original hologram and the modified hologram, interference fringes occur. These interference fringes can be evaluated quantitatively and give information about the deformation. So you can measure tiny terminal expansions or vibrations in mechanical systems. Therefore you need two reference waves that are shifted to each other.\n\nThere are holographic storages for analog pictures and digital data. Digital information will be affiliated by a two-dimensional bit-pattern.\n", "id": "146185", "title": "Holography"}

The sender does precoding of the data so as to cancel the effect of the interference.\n\nCosta asked the following question:\n\nWhen Costa asked his question, the Shannon–Hartley theorem (and the more general noisy-channel coding theorem) was well known.\nThe Shannon–Hartley theorem tells us that, all else being equal, a paper sent along a path that picks up less dirt can reliably deliver more information than another paper sent along a path that picks up more dirt.\nPeople have also thought up many ways of dealing with such dirt added after the message is written—see error detection and correction for details.\n\nMost people expected that the same thing would happen when dirt is added to the paper before the message was written—the more dirt, the less information can be reliably sent.\n\nIn 1983, Costa showed the surprising result that we can send just as much information on such a dirty piece of paper as we can when writing on a clean sheet of paper, and gave a way to get that capacity.\n\nA dirty paper code is a way for the writer to adapt his message to the dirt already on the paper.\nThe writer and the reader agree ahead of time on which dirty paper code they will use for the messages.\n\nPeople have thought up several dirty paper codes, including Costa precoding (1983), Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (1971) and the vector perturbation technique of Hochwald et al. (2005).\n\nA similar problem called \"writing on dirty tape (WDT)\" is more complicated.\nAs of 2005, the capacity computation problem and the capacity-achieving\nproblem for writing on dirty tape are unsolved\n\n\"Writing on wet paper\" is a related problem in steganography\n\nIn a wireless network, often a transmitter has many different messages, and each one needs to be sent to a different person.\n\nThe sum-rate capacity of a system that transmits all the messages at the same time—and uses dirty-paper codes to reduce the interference between messages—can be many times the sum-rate capacity of a similar system that only sends one message at a time (TDMA).\n\nAny one receiver is only concerned with the messages for that receiver—all the other messages the transmitter is simultaneously sending to everyone else are—to that receiver—irrelevant noise that only interferes with the desired message.\n\nThe \"dirty paper\" story can be seen as a parable for wireless communication.\n\nRecently, there has been interest in DPC as a possible solution to optimize the efficiency of wireless networks, in particular multiuser MIMO networks and into an interference aware coding technique for dynamic wireless networks.\n\nPeople doing \"informed digital watermarking\" use dirty paper codes, using this analogy:\n\n", "id": "146190", "title": "Dirty paper coding"}

When he was two years old his father died. His mother married again and went back to live in Wales, where she came from. Philip went to school at Eton College.\n\nHe was still a teenager when he was introduced to the composer Delius, who lived in France. They became good friends and Philip made piano arrangements of some of Delius’s music. Later he wrote a book about Delius. He studied in Germany for a time, and then at Oxford where he studied classics. He learned about music by teaching himself. He did not fight in World War I. He was a conscientious objector, but also, his health was not good enough for him to be in the army.\n\nHe spent most of his life in London, but he did visit Ireland for a year, and also spent three years with his mother in Wales, and four years in Kent where he lived with Ernest Moeran. Heseltine and Moeran often got drunk together. He became friends with the composer Bernard van Dieren whose music influenced him a lot.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146289", "text": "Plumbing\n\nPlumbing (which comes from the Latin word \"plumbum\", which means lead, as pipes were once made from lead) is the job of working with pipes, tubing and plumbing fixtures for drinking water systems and getting rid of waste. A plumber is someone who fixes or puts in piping systems, plumbing fixtures and equipment such as water heaters. Many plumbers are construction workers. The plumbing industry is an important part of every developed economy because people need clean water and safe ways to move and store waste.\n\nPlumbing also refers to a system of pipes and fixtures put in a building to move water and the get rid of waste that is in water. Plumbing is different from water and sewage systems because plumbing system serves one building, while water and sewage systems serve a group of buildings or a city.\n\nPlumbing was very rare until modern cities grew in the 19th century. At about the same time, public health leaders began wanting better systems to get rid of waste. Before this, people got rid of waste by collecting it and dumping it onto the ground or into rivers. However, there were some plumbing pipes in the city settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization by 2700 B.C. Plumbing was also used during the ancient civilizations such as the Greek, Roman, Persian, Indian, and Chinese civilizations as they built public baths and needed drinking water, and somewhere to drain waste. The Romans used pipe inscriptions to stop people from stealing water. \n\nThese systems did not improve much over the years. There were almost no improvements from the time of the Roman aqueducts and sewers until the 19th century. Eventually the development of separate, underground water and sewage systems got rid of open sewage ditches and cesspools. Most large cities today send solid wastes through pipes to sewage treatment plants. Treatment separates water from waste and makes the water more pure before it goes into streams or other bodies of water. Most places stopped using lead for drinking water after World War II because of the dangers of lead poisoning. At this time, copper piping was started because it was safer than using lead pipes.\n\nWater systems in ancient times used gravity to move water. They used pipes or channels usually made of clay, lead, bamboo or stone. Today, water-supply systems use a network of high-pressure pumps, and pipes are now made of copper, brass, plastic, or other nontoxic material. Drain and vent lines are made of plastic, steel, cast-iron, and lead. Lead is not used in pipes today because it can be poisonous.\n\nThe 'straight' sections of plumbing systems are of pipe or tube. A pipe is usually made by casting or welding, where a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe usually has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded, where tubes have thinner walls, and needs special joining techniques such as 'brazing', 'compression fitting', 'crimping', or for plastics, 'solvent welding'.\n\nAs well as the straight pipe or tubing, many fittings are required in plumbing systems, such as valves, elbows, tees, and unions.\n\nPlumbing fixtures are designed for the people who use the water. Some examples of fixtures include water closets (also known as toilets), urinals, bidets, showers, bathtubs, utility and kitchen sinks, drinking fountains, ice makers, humidifiers, air washers, fountains, and eye wash stations.\n\nMuch of the plumbing work in places where many people live is done under government rules. Putting in plumbing and fixing plumbing generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the people who live or work in the buildings.\n", "id": "146289", "title": "Plumbing"}

He started Burrangong Station (farm) in 1826 by taking an area of 100 square miles.\nGold was found in the area in 1860. Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat. This was an area where sheep were grazed before the gold rush. The town was officially listed in 1861. About 470,000 ounces of gold were sent by the armed gold escort from the goldfields. Up to 20,000 miners were digging for gold including about 2,000 Chinese miners.\n\nFrom November 1860 through to June 1861 European miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area. This is now known as the Lambing Flat riots. As gold became harder to find, European miners got upset that the Chinese miners were still finding gold. Many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. They were chased off the goldfields. Eventually the riots were stopped and the Chinese miners had their mining areas given back. The New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill. This put a limit on the number of Chinese that could come to New South Wales on any ship. They also had to pay a tax to come New South Wales.\n\nIn 1889 Young was the first country town in Australia to have electricity for the streets and houses.

This is an old railway dam about 4 km south of Young. They are made to create a peaceful feeling like the Japanese garden at Cowra.\n\nChinaman’s Dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedeman. They used the water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. In the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site. It is in a small gully called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. \n\nIn 1882 the NSW government started to build the first part of the Blayney to Demondrille railway line. To provide water for the steam trains, they decided to use the dam and pump water from it to a tank, known as Young Tank, at the 246 mile post. It is not known whether the railways improved the old dam or built a new one.\n\nFrom 1885 to 1901, trains stopped at Young Tank to refill with water. In 1901, trains were able to get water at Young Railway Station. The supply of water came from Chinaman’s Dam. The size of the dam was enlarged in 1911 to hold about 2 million gallons.\n\nThe dam was a popular spot for swimming. \n\nWhen the town water supply was connected to the Burrinjuck Dam, the railways stopped using Chinaman’s Dam. In 1937 the area turned into a 36 acre park. The Shire Council looks after the gardens. The dam has since been made bigger.\n", "id": "146320", "title": "Young, New South Wales"}

During the Constitutional Convention many, including George Mason, Elbridge Gerry and James Wilson felt the courts could decide if a law was unconstitutional, and if so, refuse to enforce it. Other founding fathers including John Francis Mercer, Gouverneur Morris and John Dickinson argued against allowing judges to have that power. The issue was left unanswered. However, when deciding that a new law needed the approval of the president, all attempts to have the judiciary approve new laws were soundly defeated. \nJudicial Nullification is sometimes used to mean jury nullification. However, in most uses it means nullifying a law, legal code or statute by a member of the judiciary.\n\nIn 2011 the Supreme Court made a ruling that, in essence, says lower court judges can ignore the law. There were three petitions before the Court asking if federal courts need to be stopped from ignoring laws, rules and facts. The Supreme Court refused to grant \"certiorari\" (a writ seeking judicial review of a matter). In other words, the Court refused to consider the three petitions.\n", "id": "146354", "title": "Judicial nullification"}

He and Edith Sitwell were the reciters at a performance of Walton’s \"Façade\".\n\nLambert was a prodigy: he was composing music for orchestra when he was only 13, and when he was 20 he was asked to write a ballet for Serge Diaghilev's world-famous Ballets Russes (\"Romeo and Juliet\"). \n\nHe soon became very famous. His best known work is \"The Rio Grande\" for piano solo, chorus and orchestra. It has a mixture of musical styles: jazz, habaneras and the influence of Delius and Duke Ellington.\n\nDuring the 1930s he performed a lot as a conductor with the Vic-Wells Ballet (later the Royal Ballet), but he stopped composing music. Lambert thought he had failed as a composer, and only finished two more big works in the last sixteen years of his life. He continued conducting, and appeared at Covent Garden and in BBC broadcasts, and travelled to Europe and America conducting ballets.

His black father was a doctor from Sierra Leone, his mother was English. His parents were not married. The father went back to Africa by February 1875. He had the job of coroner for the British Empire in the Gambia in the late 1890s. He did not know anything about his son’s existence.\n\nColeridge-Taylor was brought up in Croydon . He studied the violin at the Royal College of Music and composition with Charles Villiers Stanford. In 1899 he married Jessie Walmisley who had been a student with him at the RCM. Her parents did not want her to be married to someone of mixed race. The couple had a son, Hiawatha (1900-1980) and a daughter, Avril, born Gwendolyn (1903-1998).\n\nSoon Coleridge-Taylor became known as a composer. Edward Elgar helped him get one of his pieces performed at the Three Choirs Festival. Two months later Stanford conducted the cantata \"Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast\", the piece for which he is best remembered. He toured the United States in 1904. This made him even more interested in finding out about his racial heritage. He wanted to do for African music what Johannes Brahms had done for Hungarian music and Antonín Dvořák for Bohemian music. He had met the American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar in London and set some of his poems to music. Several people encouraged him to learn more about his heritage.\n\nColeridge-Taylor was a shy man, but he was a very good conductor. He was often asked to adjudicate at music festivals.\n\nColeridge-Taylor was 37 when he died of pneumonia. His widow hardly had any money, but King George V gave her a pension of GB£100, which shows how popular Coleridge-Taylor had been as a composer. A memorial concert was held later in 1912 at the Royal Albert Hall and gathered £300.\n\nColeridge-Taylor's works were often performed by Sir Malcolm Sargent who conducted ten seasons of a costumed ballet version of \"Hiawatha\" at the Royal Albert Hall between 1928 and 1939 with the Royal Choral Society (600 to 800 singers) and 200 dancers.\n\nColeridge-Taylor's best-known work is his cantata \"Hiawatha's Wedding-feast\", which was performed very often by choral groups in England during his lifetime and for many years after his death. He wrote several other pieces about Hiawatha: \"The Death of Minnehaha\", \"Overture to The Song of Hiawatha\" and \"Hiawatha's Departure\". \n\nHe also wrote a lot of chamber music, anthems and other works. The orchestral piece \"Petite Suite de Concert\" used to be very popular, but its Romanticism sounds a little old-fashioned now. \n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed Stanley Sadie; ISBN 1-56159-174-2\n", "id": "146390", "title": "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor"}

The German opera composer Richard Wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly. He had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed, and he thought that there was no opera house in Germany that was good enough for performances of his operas. Today it is still the place where every year there is a festival, the Bayreuth Festival, which is dedicated only to the operas of Richard Wagner.\n\nKing Ludwig II of Bavaria was a great admirer of Richard Wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built. Wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted. Work on the building started on 22 May 1872 (Wagner's birthday), and it was ready four years later when, for the first time, all four operas which make up the cycle called \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" (\"The Ring of the Nibelung\"), were performed.\n\nThe opera house is big enough for an audience of 1,925. One unusual thing is the orchestra pit, which is right under the stage, covered by a hood, so that the orchestra cannot be seen at all by the audience. Wagner wanted the audience to be able to concentrate properly on the action on the stage instead of being distracted by watching the orchestra. It makes it very difficult for the orchestra and the singers to be together, and conductors have to get used to the problem.\n\nThe Festspielhaus also has a double proscenium, which makes it look as if the stage is farther away than it actually is.\n", "id": "146487", "title": "Bayreuth Festspielhaus"}

In 2006, 218 people lived in Carcoar. It next to the Mid-Western Highway, west of Sydney and south west of Bathurst. It is above sea-level. Carcoar is in a small green valley, with the town on both sides of the Belubula River.\n\nCarcoar was once one of the most important government centres in Western New South Wales. The town has been classified by the National Trust. This is because it has a lot of buildings from the 1800s. Carcoar is a Aboriginal word from the Gundungura people meaning either \"frog\" or \"kookaburra\".\n\nNearby towns are Blayney, Millthorpe, Mandurama, Neville, Lyndhurst and Barry.\n\nThe first people to live in the area were the Gundungura people. The first Europen to travel through the area was surveyor George Evans. He came from Bathurst in 1815 and set up his camp on Coombing Creek.\n\nThe first settlers arrived in 1821. The first official land grant, 560 acres (2.3 km²), was given to Thomas Icely on 26 May 1829. He named his farm \"Coombing Park\". In 1838 Thomas Icely asked that a village be started to supply items for his big farm. On 29 September 1839 Carcoar became the third town west of the Blue Mountains.\n\nThe first land for houses in the town were sold in 1840. By 1850 Carcoar was the second biggest town west of the mountains. It was second in size to Bathurst. It became a banking and government centre for the area. In 1857 the town's public school opened. It is one of the oldest schools in Australia.\n\nWhen gold was found in the west in the 1860s, Carcoar became less important. The government began building a number of important buildings in the late 1870s. At this time, \"Coombing Park\" was supplying iron ore to the Lithgow steelworks.\n\nBecause the town is at the bottom of a steep valley it wasn't suitable for the railway. The railway line went to Blayney north west in 1874. By the early 1880s many people had left the town. Carcoar was joined to the railway line in 1888 when the Blayney-Demondrille Line.\n\nIn the 1980s train services were stopped between Cowra and Blayney. This included included Carcoar. This section was re-opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway. The LVR run tourist trains, mainly from Cowra to Blayney and Canowindra. They have now moved into general freight haulage.\n\nCarcoar's was often visited by escaped convicts and bushrangers. They came into the town and robbed many times.\n\nIn one robbery, German Charley tried to stop Mickey Bourke from stealing a racehorse from the \"Coombing Park\" stables. He was shot dead by Bourke. Another bushranger, Curran was captured by the local police. The government sent extra police and a magistrate to the town. Frank Gardiner was working in the area after six years gaol for stealing horses. He gave up farm work and started stealing cattle.\n\nIn 1863 Johnny Gilbert and John O'Meally tried to rob the Commercial Bank. This may be Australia's first daylight bank robbery. Both bushrangers ran away when a bank worker fired a shot into the ceiling of the bank.\n\nThe Presbyterian Reverend James Adam was held up by Ben Hall. Hall liked the Adam and didn't rob him.\n\nThe town has been used as a location for many movie and television productions. They include:\n", "id": "146509", "title": "Carcoar, New South Wales"}

They sing the music of many composers, not just Johann Sebastian Bach.\n\nThe Bach Choir gave its first concert on 26 April 1876 with a performance of Bach’s \"Mass in B minor\". At this time more and more people in England were becoming interested in the music of Bach, but the \"Mass in B minor\" had never been performed in England. The conductor Otto Goldschmidt conducted the concert, and afterwards the Choir's committee decided to make The Bach Choir a permanent choir. Otto Goldschmidt was appointed as the Musical Director.\n\nIn those days all choir members came from rich families (the upper classes). New members had to pass an audition, but they also had to be “proposed” (recommended) by existing members and accepted by the committee. Queen Victoria became Patron of the choir in 1879. The Choir sang music by lots of different composers as well as Bach’s motets, church music and the \"Mass in B minor\". \n\nGoldschmidt resigned in 1885 and Charles Villiers Stanford became conductor. Stanford had already become well known as organist of Trinity College, Cambridge and conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society. He widened the repertoire of the Choir, and the concerts also included works for orchestra. Hubert Parry composed his popular anthem \"Blest Pair of Sirens\" for the choir to sing at the Golden Jubilee of the Queen in 1887. The Jubilee concert also included the first London performance of Berlioz's \"Te Deum\", a work dedicated to the late Prince Consort. \n\nTowards the end of the nineteenth century changes were made, including regular auditions for existing choir members, and stopping the requirement for new members to be proposed. Henry Walford Davies became the conductor. He improved the choir which was then taken over by Hugh Allen in 1908. \n\nHugh Allen found himself conducting a choir which included the young Ralph Vaughan Williams, who had joined in 1903 and Adrian Boult, who joined around 1914. Allen was strict, but good, and during his time as conductor the Choir gave many important first London performances including Vaughan Williams' \"Toward the Unknown Region\" and \"A Sea Symphony\" and Parry's \"Songs of Farewell\". \n\nWhen Allen resigned in 1921 his place was taken by Ralph Vaughan Williams who had by then become a famous composer. He had a gentler approach than Allen. He stayed until 1928 when he left to be able to work more on composition. In his place the Choir appointed Gustav Holst, but he became ill and was never able to take up his post. Instead, Adrian Boult took over for three years. During his time it became tradition to perform Bach’s \"St Matthew Passion\" every year. This tradition continues today.\n\nBoult was replaced by Reginald Jacques (pronounced: “Jakes”), who had been a pupil of Hugh Allen at Oxford. Jacques stayed until 1960. He managed to keep the Choir going through World War II, and the annual Carol Concerts became part of their tradition. They made a recording of the \"St Matthew Passion\" which filled 42 sides of the old 78 rpm. gramophone records.\n\nJacques was followed by David Willcocks who led the Choir almost to the end of the century. He broadened the Choir’s repertoire, and they gave the first London concert hall performance of Britten's War Requiem, conducted by Britten himself, with Galina Vishnevskaya, Peter Pears and Tom Krause (who replaced Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau at the last minute) as soloists. The Choir then recorded the work and this recording sold more than 200,000 copies in the first five months. Willcocks took the Choir on tours to many parts of the world. His last performance was in 1998.\n\nToday the Choir is conducted by David Hill. As well as spending much of his time with The Bach Choir, he is also conductor of the BBC Singers. The choir continues to do new things, such as giving world premieres of new music, as well as keeping up the tradition of performing the \"St Matthew Passion\" every spring at the Royal Festival Hall. \n\nBasil Keen: \"The Bach Choir - The First Hundred Years\" (Ashgate)\n\n", "id": "146515", "title": "Bach Choir"}

He then learnt from Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe, a famous bass viol player. In six months he was said to be better than his teacher. In 1675, aged 19, he joined the orchestra of the Paris Opera. This was where he met Jean-Baptiste Lully, who was the director of the Opera. Lully taught him to compose music. Marais often conducted the operas Lully had written.\n\nMarais was hired as a musician in 1676 to play at the royal court of Versailles. He did quite well as court musician. In 1679 he was appointed \"ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole\", a title he kept until 1725.\n\nHe was a master of the basse de viol. He wrote a lot of music for that instrument, he was the most important French composer for it. He wrote five books of \"Pièces de viole\" (1686-1725). Most of the pieces in the book are suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who \"founded and firmly established the empire of the viol\" (Hubert Le Blanc, 1740). His other works include a book of \"Pièces en trio\" (1692) and four operas (1693-1709). \"Alcyone\" (1706) is well known for its storm scene. Marais became the conductor of the Paris Opera in 1706, but after the failure of his 1709 opera, \"Sémélé\" he gradually withdrew from public life. He married Catherine d'Amicourt, on 21 September 1676. They had 19 children together. Two of the children, Vincent Marais and Roland Marais also became famous musicians, as well as his grandson, Nicolas Marais.\n\nTiton du Tillet wrote about Marais in his book \"Le Parnasse françois\". He describes a piece from Marais' fourth book called \"The Labyrinth\", which goes through lots of keys. The notes which are often dissonant, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, describe a man caught in a labyrinth. Eventually the man comes out of it happily and the music finishes with a gracious and natural chaconne. Another piece called \"La Gamme\" [The Scale], very gradually goes up the steps of the octave and then down again.\n\nFacsimiles of all five books of Marais' \"Pièces de viole\" are published by Éditions J.M. Fuzeau. A complete critical edition of his instrumental works in seven volumes, edited by John Hsu, is published by Broude Brothers.\n\nMarais and his music were featured in the movie \"Tous les matins du monde\" (1991). The movie shows a detailed, imagined life of Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe. Marais' music is heard a lot, including his longer work \"Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris\" (1723). A recording of the Sonnerie performed on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the cult classic film \"Liquid Sky\".\n", "id": "146544", "title": "Marin Marais"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146553", "text": "Burgess Hill\n\nBurgess Hill is a town in West Sussex, England, UK. It is not far from the border with East Sussex. It is 38 miles (62 km) south of London, 10 miles (16 km) north of Brighton and Hove, and 29 miles (47 km) east-northeast of the county town of Chichester. It had a population of 28,803 at the time of the 2001 Census. Other nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the north and Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, to the east.\n\nBurgess Hill is mainly situated just on the West Sussex side of the border dividing the two counties. Parts of the town are across the county boundary in East Sussex.\n\nAlthough a Roman road was built joining London to the South coast and passing through what is now Burgess Hill, there is no evidence that the Romans settled in the area.\n\nFrom the fourteenth century or earlier the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24th June and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913.\n\nWith the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway, however, those in the business soon realised that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways. Most of the animal trading business began to revolve around rail side markets such as those at Hassocks, Haywards Heath and Lewes train stations. By the start of the 20th century, the animal trading business had all but left the Burgess Hill area.\n\nBy the early seventeenth century there was a lot of small brick and tile making companies and during this time pieces of common land were given for house building and small businesses. By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two drinking houses were established on the common. Brickmaking by hand still happened until very recently, by Keymer Tiles (formerly the Keymer Brick and Tile company) whose tiles can be found in buildings such as St. James Church, Piccadilly and Manchester Central Station (now G-Mex).\nThe growth of Brighton in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries brought in professional people looking for places to live. Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from a small rural settlement to a town of 4,500 residents.\n\nIn 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local household name Edwin Street, a well-known farmer and butcher. The gardens were opened in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, and contained a large lake, and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster, known as a switchback . The lake was used for boating in the summer, and skating in the winter. The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street, a man of 23 stone, before being used in the winter. This area is now the Victoria Business Park.\n\nThe town gradually grew bigger, having its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961, when the population of about 7,000 residents almost doubled. This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the south-east. By 1956, the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed, and has since expanded. It now contains the local headquarters of two large international companies. In 1986 a smaller industrial estate to in the north of the town developed, known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate. Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks.\n\nHousing estates played their part in building up the population of Burgess Hill throughout the second half of the 20th century; in the west of the town they provided a wide mix of new residents; many of them young families and the Folders Lane estate more families settled, along with some richer residents.\n\nThe next substantial development was Priory Village in the south west of Burgess Hill, sometimes known as the Tesco estate, due to its proximity to the supermarket. Again, this brought in a mix of incomes, again, many of them young families.\n\nIt must be noted that as well as the aforementioned developments, there have been two council estates built in the town - one close to Cants Lane, in the town's north east, and the area around Denham Road in the west, both of course adding to the ever rising population of the town.\n\nAlthough now part of the town, World's End, to the north of the town, was originally a separate community. It still retains its own shops and community association, and is served by Wivelsfield railway station.\n\nBurgess Hill has a Conservative member of parliament.\n\nThere are ten schools for children aged up to 11 years and four schools for children aged 11–16/18.\n\nThere are a total of 9 churches and a Christian centre in Burgess Hill.\n\nBurgess Hill is also home to the Mid Sussex Christian Centre.\n\nIn the town centre there is a large park (St. John's), and many other smaller recreation grounds around the town. There is a substantial leisure centre on the northern edge of Burgess Hill named the Triangle.\n\nBurgess Hill Town Football Club plays football (soccer)and plays its home games at Leylands Park. Burgess Hill Rugby Football Club, or The Sussex All Blacks, are the local Rugby Football club.\n\nThere is also a Squash Club that plays at the Triangle Leisure Centre every Saturday and Monday, and has a team that plays in the East Sussex County League.\n\nThere is also a Running Club that meet at the Burgess Hill School for Girls every Wednesday evening. Members compete in local and national charity and fun races.\n\nThe Skate Park in the centre of town provides sporting opportunities, and holds an annual competition.\n\nThe Triangle (or Olympos Burgess Hill as it has been rechristened) is one of the venues in the South East supporting the London 2012 Olympic Games, and will serve as a base and training centre for teams from around the globe.\n\nBurgess Hill's twin towns are:\n\nA square in Schmallenberg has been named Burgess Hill Platz.\n\n", "id": "146553", "title": "Burgess Hill"}

He is particularly remembered for his \"Piano Concerto\" and for his church music, especially the anthem \"Greater love hath no man\", the song \"The Holy Boy\" and the hymn tune to \"My song is love unknown\". He had an unhappy childhood, and he always felt unsure of himself and rather lonely.\n\nJohn Ireland was born in Bowdon, Greater Manchester. His father, who was 70 years old, was a publisher who owned a newspaper. He had married for a second time after his wife had died, and John was the youngest of five children from the second marriage. His mother was 30 years younger than her husband. When John was 14 his mother died, and his father died the next year.\nJohn Ireland studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music. Later he also had composition lessons from Charles Villiers Stanford. He later became a teacher at the College himself. His pupils included the composers Alan Bush and\nGeoffrey Bush (who were not related), Ernest Moeran and Benjamin Britten. Geoffrey Bush later helped to prepare a lot of Ireland’s works for publication. Ireland mostly made his living as an organist and choirmaster.\n\nIreland enjoyed going to the Channel Islands. He liked the landscapes there. He was evacuated from them just before the German invasion during World War II. \n\nJohn Ireland married once, but his marriage only lasted a few months.\n\nOn 10 September 1949, his 70th birthday was celebrated in a special Prom concert. The soloist in the \"Piano Concerto\" was the pianist Eileen Joyce, who later made the first gramophone recording of the concerto. \nIreland retired in 1953. He moved to a tiny village in Sussex, where he lived in an old windmill which had been changed into a home.\n\nHe died aged 82 in Washington, Sussex of heart failure.\n\nJohn Ireland was never much influenced by folksong like many other English composers of his time. His music is more related to Impressionism. He liked the music of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel as well as Igor Stravinsky and Bartók. His \"Piano Concerto\" is one of his best works. It shows that he developed his own personal style of harmony. Most of his other good works are short pieces, including many for piano solo. His best-known piece is the song \"The Holy Boy\". It is heard in many different arrangements. His songs to poems by A. E. Housman, Thomas Hardy, Christina Rossetti, John Masefield, Rupert Brooke and others, are among some of the best English art songs.. He also wrote hymns, carols, and other sacred choral music; among choirs he is probably best known for the anthem \"Greater love hath no man\", often sung in services that remember the victims of war. Another choral work, \"These things shall be\" expresses his deepest hopes for mankind, although in his last years he said that he hated the work.\n\n\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

His music often sounded quite modern to the people of his day. He wrote many excellent works including chamber music as well as orchestral music. One of his composition pupils was Benjamin Britten. Later Britten remembered his teacher by using one of Bridge’s tunes and making them into a piece of music called \"Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge\".\n\nBridge was born in Brighton and studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1899 to 1903. One of his teachers was Charles Villiers Stanford. He played the viola in several string quartets and conducted many orchestras. He learned difficult music very quickly, and sometimes Henry Wood asked him to take his place when he was not well enough to conduct himself. After a while he spent most of his time composing. He privately taught several pupils, including Benjamin Britten, who later helped to make his teacher's music better known and honoured him in his \"Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge\" for string orchestra (1937), based on a theme from the second of Bridge's \"Three Idylls for String Quartet\" (1906). \n\nBridge died in Eastbourne.\n\nBridge’s early works show the influence of Johannes Brahms and Charles Villiers Stanford. He wrote some excellent chamber music and songs. The \"Phantasie Quartet\" and the \"String Quartet no 1\" show his talent. His later pieces such as the third (1926) and fourth (1937) string quartets have quite complicated harmonies and show his interest in the music of Schoenberg as well as the harmonies of Maurice Ravel and Alexander Scriabin. His most important orchestral works include \"The Sea\" and \"Summer\". He wrote some lovely chamber music for the cello as well as many songs. In his later years his harmonies become quite advanced, for example a favourite chord of his can be found by playing a C minor chord and a D major chord together. In his longer pieces the speed of the music often changes and he avoids repeating himself exactly. \n\nFor a long time after his death his music was hardly ever played, but more recently musicians have discovered the greatness of his compositions. Pianists like to play the popular piano piece called \"Rosemary\".\n", "id": "146602", "title": "Frank Bridge"}

May 13, 1985) was a street vendor from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who sold newspapers along with Billy Cook. He is known for being an important suspect in the Mumia Abu-Jamal case (the murder of Daniel Faulkner). Cynthia White, a key witness, said that Freeman was present, but did not name him. At the time of the crime, Freeman was a front passenger in Billy Cook's Volkswagen. In two different lineups done to determine the killer, Cynthia White picked him. Billy Cook, the brother of Abu-Jamal (Wesley Cook), claimed later that Freeman personally confessed to him as being armed and shooting Faulkner. Arnold Beverly, in an affidavit where he confessed to the murder, named \"another guy\" as a shooter. Some witnesses testified that they saw a man with a green army jacket going away from the crime scene. Billy Cook said that Kenneth Freeman was wearing a green army jacket.\n\nFreeman was reportedly in Germany in the Army, and usually wore the jacket.\n\nOne important contradiction is the fact that Cynthia White picked Freeman out of a lineup as the killer, but later changed her testimony to fit the prosecution's story. This can be explained by her admission that police bribed her to do so, so that she could legally work as a prostitute. That leads to another important inconsistency, which is that Yvette Williams, someone who White knew personally, said that White told her that she did not see the actual killer, which means it was not possible for her to identify Freeman as the killer, unless he confessed to her personally. \n\nOn May 13, 1985, Kenneth Freeman was found dead in an empty area, handcuffed, bound, and naked, his death listed as \"natural causes\".

At the start, they hope their hypothesis or theory is true but they and other scientists will use the scientific method to try and prove it false. Falsifiability (or refutability) means that a theory or hypothesis can be proved wrong because it failed a critical test or experiment.\n\nA famous example in the 20th century was the expedition led by Arthur Eddington to Principe Island in Africa in 1919 to record the positions of stars around the Sun during a solar eclipse. The observation of star positions showed that the apparent star positions close to the Sun were changed. In effect, the light passing the Sun was pulled towards the sun by gravitation. This confirmed predictions of gravitational lensing made by Albert Einstein in the general theory of relativity, published in 1915. Eddington's observations were considered to be the first solid evidence in favour of Einstein's theory. Had the observations resulted differently, this would have counted against Einstein's theory, and perhaps refuted it.\n\nKarl Popper had the opinion that only theories that are falsifiable are scientific. Falsifiability is then a line between science and other kinds of knowledge: if it can be refuted, it is science; it if cannot, then it is not science. Many working scientists think Popper was right.\n\nNot everyone agreed with this: Pierre Duhem and Paul Feyerabend had different ideas. Feyerabend's \"Against method\" (1975) argued that there was no one scientific method. Instead, \"whatever works, works\" and \"anything goes\". This is called \"epistemological anarchy\". \n\nDuhem's idea was more subtle. He thought that for any given set of observations there is a huge and uncountable number of explanations. According to Duhem, an experiment in physics is not just an observation, but an interpretation of observations by means of a theoretical framework. Furthermore, no matter how well one constructs one's experiment, it is impossible to subject an isolated single hypothesis to an experimental test. Instead, it is a whole interlocking group of hypotheses, background assumptions, and theories that is tested. This thesis has come to be known as holism. According to Duhem, it makes crucial experiments impossible.\n\nThere are some other problems with falsification:\n\n", "id": "146694", "title": "Falsifiability"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146726", "text": "Thermodynamic entropy\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a measure of how organized or disorganized energy is present in a system of atoms or molecules. It is measured in joules of energy per unit kelvin. Entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics.\n\nImagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy. If the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized, then the molecules can do ten units of work. However, if the energy became less organized (that is, the entropy increased), the molecules might only be able to do six units of work, even though they still have ten units of energy in them.\n\nWhen total entropy is reached, there is no more energy to spend. A good example of this is a cup of tea. Now suppose your cup of tea is hot. The tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in. Over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room. The tea will become colder. This is because the energy (heat) in the tea escapes into the surrounding area. Once the tea has gone cold, there is no more heat that can be spread. The tea has thus reached total entropy.\n\nThere are two types of \"rooms\" we recognize when we are talking about entropy: An \"open system\" and a \"closed system\". The former means that energy (such as heat) can freely flow into and out of the room. A closed system means that the room is closed off from the outside; no energy can go in or out.\n\nIn the case of the tea, the room was a closed system; it had no means for energy to enter. But we can also make it an open system by placing a stove in the room. If we turn on the stove, we can use the heat from the stove to reheat the cup of tea. New usable energy has been brought into the environment. The entropy has thus decreased. The heat that went from the stove into the tea can then again escape into the room again until total entropy has been reached. This is what the second law of thermodynamics describes.\n\nA real life example of an open system is the Earth. The surface gets a lot of energy from the Sun every day. This allows plants to grow and water to stay liquid. If we took away the Sun, plants would die and water would freeze because the surface of our planet would be too cold.\n", "id": "146726", "title": "Thermodynamic entropy"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146730", "text": "Cornell University\n\nCornell University ( ) is in Ithaca, New York, United States. It is a private land-grant university, receiving annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White co-founded it in 1865 by sponsoring a bill in the New York State Legislature to designate it as New York's land grant college. The university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge–from the classics to the sciences and from the theoretical to the applied. This goal was uncommon in 1865. The goal is stated in Cornell's motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: \"I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.\" Since its founding, Cornell has also been a co-educational, secular institution where admission is offered irrespective of gender, religion or race.\n\nThe university has seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in New York City and one in Education City, Qatar. Cornell is one of two private land grant universities, and its seven undergraduate colleges include three state-supported statutory or contract colleges. As a land grant college, it also operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York.\n\nCornell counts more than 255,000 living alumni, 31 Marshall Scholars, 28 Rhodes Scholars and 41 Nobel laureates as affiliated with the university. It has 13,000 undergraduate and 6,000 graduate students from all 50 states and 122 countries.\n\nCornell's athletics teams are called the Big Red, and they have 36 varsity teams. They play against other teams in the Ivy League.\nCornell is divided into colleges. Each operates independently and has its own faculty and admission process: The \"statutory\" or \"contract\" colleges (which receive direct funding from the New York state government) have \"New York State\" in their name. Residents of New York who are enrolled in these colleges pay less tuition than other students at the university. Cornell calls its other colleges \"endowed colleges\".\n\n\nThe four statutory colleges are also units of the State University of New York.\n\nCornell also had two other colleges that closed. The New York State College of Forrestry closed in 1903. The Nursing School closed in 1979.\n\nCornell, a research university, produces the fourth largest number of graduates in the world who go on to pursue PhDs in engineering or the natural sciences at American institutions. It is also fifth in the world in producing graduates who pursue PhDs at American institutions in any field. Research is a central element of Cornell's mission. In 2009 Cornell spent $671 million on science and engineering research and development. This makes it the 16th highest in the United States.\nFor the 2004–05 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3 million on research. Of Cornell's units, the largest amount of this funding went to the colleges of Medicine ($164.2 million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5 million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3 million), and Engineering ($64.8 million). The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0 million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Science Foundation that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the university. Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving the most patents in 2003, and was one of the nation's top five institutions in forming start-up companies. In 2004–05, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.\n\nSince 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to Mars. In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the Mars Exploration Rover Mission. Cornell's Steve Squyres, Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the Spirit and Opportunity rovers. Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honors by \"Science\". Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech and Cornell's Space Sciences Building. Further, Cornell researchers discovered the rings around the planet Uranus. Also, Cornell built and operated the world's largest and most sensitive radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1952, John O. Moore at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory began the Automotive Crash Injury Research project. (In 1972, the lab was separated from the University as Calspan Corporation.) It pioneered the use of crash testing, originally using corpses rather than dummies. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries. The project led Liberty Mutual to fund the building of a demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers. Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations. Other ideas, such as rear-facing passenger seats, never found favor with carmakers or the public.\n\nIn 1984, the National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new supercomputer centers, including the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications began the development of NSFNet, a TCP/IP-based computer network that could connect to the ARPANET, at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-kbit/s network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5 Mbit/s T1s in 1988 and to 45 Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the Internet and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the World Wide Web.\nCornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider. After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and building the Tevatron, the largest accelerator in the United States. Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.\n\nIn the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a National Resource Center (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010–2014. Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia. The George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia is in the historic \"Treman House.\" The George McTurnan Kahin Center is home to SEAP graduate students, visiting fellows and scholars, faculty members, and SEAP's Publication and Outreach offices.\n", "id": "146730", "title": "Cornell University"}

The pug has a square, muscular body with a large head, big eyes, and small ears. They have often been described as \"multum in parvo\", which means \"much in little\", referring to the pug's character and size. Pugs came originally from China, but they became popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland.\n\nPugs are often liked most for their curly tails, compact body, a deep chest, and strong muscles. There are two different types of a Pug's ears, \"rose\" and \"button\". \"Rose\" ears are smaller than the \"button\" ears and are folded up instead of on the side of the head. Most people prefer \"button\" style Pugs. Pugs have strong, straight legs and laid back shoulders. Their feet are not as large as a hare's foot, but they are not as round as that of a cat, either. They have toes that are split up perfectly, and their nails are all black. The lower teeth normally grow farther out than the upper teeth, so they meet in an under-bite.\n\nThe coat of pugs can be a lot of different colors, including fawn, apricot, silver, or black. A very rare pug is white. The fur color may be white due to albinism. There is also a smutty fawn pug, which has a very dark head and dark forelegs. The tail usually curls at the hip.\n\nDifferent coat types shed differently, but they all shed year-round. The pug who has a fawn color sheds the most. Grooming their fur helps prevent too much shedding.\n\nThe pug is very strong-willed, but does not act aggressively unless provoked to a high degree. Pugs are well kept for families with children. They can be quiet and nice but also funny according to the owner's mood. They are also good at guarding the house.\n\nPugs came from China, as most high people of China kept them as pets during the Shang Dynasty (before 400 BCE).\n\nIn East China, they were known as the \"Lo-Chiang-Sze\" or \"Foo\". In the early 551 BCE, Confucius described the pug as a \"short mouthed dog\". After that, pugs became popular in Tibet, especially for monks. Then, pugs became known toward Japan and then Europe. The pug's origin is unknown because the first Emperor of China destroyed everything related to the pug in his reign. \n\nChinese Fu-Dogs, also called Lion-Dogs or Fo-Dogs, were thought of as brave dogs who were skilled at guarding, so statues of them were placed outside the temples.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company imported the pug first in the late 16th and 17th centuries. Later, in 1572, a pug named Pompey saved the Prince of Orange by warning him when the Spaniards came. William III and Mary II also took a pug with them when they were going from Netherlands to England for the seat of the throne in 1688.\n\nThe pug was also becoming famous in other European countries as well. The Spanish painter, Goya, painted pugs in Spain and Italy sitting beside the coachmen of the rich. They were used as guard dogs and to find animals or people.\n\nAfter that, pugs began to become popular in France. A pug named Fortune was a messenger between Joséphine de Beauharnais and her family while she was in prison. In Italy, the pug was becoming famous also. A Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal that \"every carriage I meet here has a pug in it\".\n\nIn 19th century England, Queen Victoria was a very sincere lover of pugs. She had many pet pugs, such as Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima, and Venus.\n\nThe pug finally arrived in the United States during the 19th century and soon became popular there as well. Many pugs won dog shows, and soon the Pug Dog Club was founded in 1931.\n\nBecause pugs do not have long snouts, they can get eye diseases. They also cannot breathe well, because passages for oxygen are very small and they cannot regulate their temperature with their tongue well. A pug's normal body temperature is between and . If the temperature rises to , they need to cool down immediately because they cannot cool themselves enough. If the temperature reaches , their organs can fail..net\n\nPugs that live by themselves can have the problem of overweight, although this can be helped by exercising and eating healthy food..net\n\nPugs can also be hurt by \"necrotizing meningoencephalitis\" (NME). NME is an inflammation of the brain and meninges. It is also known as \"pug dog encephalitis\" (PDE). There is no known cure or explanation for NME, although most people believe it is a disease that dogs may inherit from their mother or father. All dogs usually die within a few months after this disease, which usually happens from 6 months to 7 years of age..net\nPugs can also get a serious disease in their spine..net\n\nBecause pugs have wrinkles on their faces, owners must clean the folded part of their skin. Hip dysplasia is another major problem for pugs. About 63.8% of pugs were caught with hip dysplasia..net\n\nWhen pugs get excited, they begin to \"reverse sneeze\", in which they will breathe in short, quick breaths. \"Reverse sneezing\" is usually not harmful to the pug. It can be helped by massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose to make it breathe instead with its mouth..net\n\nPugs have come out in television and film, such as Frank the Pug in the film \"Men in Black\" and the follow-up series. Other films that have pugs include \"12 Rounds\", \"Marie Antoinette (2006 film)\", and Disney's film about \"Pocahontas\". They have also appeared on television, in shows like \"The West Wing\".\n\nPugs have also appeared in many fictional books, like Lady Bertram's pug in \"Mansfield Park\" and in the book \"Pugs: God's Little Weirdos\".\n\nFamous people who own pugs include broadcaster Jonathan Ross and actress Jessica Alba.\n\n\n", "id": "146741", "title": "Pug"}

Prices, too, are controlled. In a command economy, these decisions are taken by a central body, usually the government. This system contrasts that of a market economy where all the economic actors involved take decisions. The benefit of a planned economy is that the planning body has (supposedly) perfect information, and can make a better decision than in the market economy. Countries at war sometimes command their people to make things the war needs.\n\nFriedrick von Hayek, a 20th-century economist, pointed out that it is not possible for the planning body to have perfect information. For this reason, the decisions taken by this body will be wrong, as it is not possible to foresee all possible events. Once the decision has been taken there is only a small margin to vary the production; this means that a planned economy cannot adapt to a change as rapidly as a market economy. According to Ludwig von Mises, there is no competition, and there are no reasons to innovate or to look for different solutions to a problem, in a planned economy.\n\nCommunism is a type of government system that would use a command economy. Countries with command economies include Burma, Cuba, Iran, Liberia, and North Korea. Formerly, the Soviet Union and China were command economies, and are now mixed economies where the government still has a major influence.\n", "id": "146750", "title": "Command economy"}

He experimented with new ways of composing which many people did not understand at the time. These became more widely used later in the century. He used dissonant (harsh) sounding intervals and techniques such as polytonality (playing in several keys at once), polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) and polytextures (several textures at once). Very few people listened to his music at the time he was writing it. Only much later did musicians start to realize the importance of his work. Ives earned his living as an insurance agent. He composed in his spare time.\n\nCharles Ives was born in Danbury, Connecticut. His father George Ives, was a U.S. Army bandleader in the American Civil War. His mother was a singer. His father taught him a great deal about the music and encouraged him to experiment with new sounds. As well as teaching him counterpoint and introducing him to the music of J.S.Bach he trained his son’s musical ear by getting him to sing a tune in one key while he played the accompaniment in another. In this way the young Charles became used to modern sounds that were quite different from traditional, Romantic music. Charles also listened in Danbury town square to his father's marching band and other bands that were playing on other sides of the square, so that he heard a mixture of several pieces of music at the same time. His father also taught him the music of Stephen Foster. \n\nIves became a church organist at the age of 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services, including his \"Variations on 'America' \". At the same time he also enjoyed sport and was good at baseball, football and tennis.\n\nIves spent four years at Yale University. His teacher Horatio Parker was very good and taught him important basic techniques of composing, but he could not understand some of things that Ives was writing in his music. Ives got annoyed when his teacher told him he could not finish a section of music on a dissonant chord, but Ives liked it like that. The choirmaster at the Centre Church where Ives played the organ was John Griggs. He had more understanding of what Ives was trying to do. It was a terrible blow to Charles when his father died on 4 November 1894. He always had a huge admiration for his father who had encouraged him in his musical experiments. Charles kept busy composing. He did not do any sport at Yale because his father had forbidden him to take part in sport so that he would spend his time on studying. By the time Charles graduated he had composed more than 40 songs, several marches, overtures, anthems and organ pieces, a string quartet and a symphony. However, most people thought of him as the composer of a simple waltz tune called \"The Bells of Yale\". \n\nAfter his studies at Yale Ives continued to work as a church organist while working for an insurance firm. He was very good at his job and became very well known in the insurance business. Some of his business friends were often surprised to find out that he was also a composer. \n\nIn 1907, Ives had his first \"heart attack\". These attacks may have been more to do with his imagination. When he was better he composed more than ever before. He married in 1908. After several heart attacks in 1918 he composed very little. He stopped composing altogether in 1926. His health problems continued, and he retired from the insurance business in 1930. He spent some time revising works he had written early, but never wrote any more new pieces.\n\nIves died in 1954 in New York City at 12:32 PM\n\nIves published more than 100 of his songs. He was a very good pianist and the piano parts are often quite difficult. They include bitonality and pantonality.. Although he is now best known for his orchestral music, he composed two string quartets and other chamber music. His organ piece \"Variations on \"America\"\" (1891), takes the tune \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" (which is the same tune as \"God Save the Queen \") and changes it in several amusing variations, using a march, a ragtime and bitonality. it was not published until 1949. The variations differ sharply: a running line, a set of close harmonies, a march, a polonaise, and a ragtime allegro; the interludes are one of the first uses of bitonality.\n\nHis \"Symphony Number 1\" was fairly traditional, but \"Symphony Number 2\" is much more modern sounding, even ending with a dissonant chord with 11 notes.\n\nIn 1902 he gave up his organ job. He left all his best anthems and organ music in the church library, and these were thrown out in 1915 when the church moved so most of them are lost.\n\n\"Central Park in the Dark\" is a piece for orchestra which describes the mysterious, quiet park and then sounds of music coming from nearby nightclubs in Manhattan (playing the popular music of the day, ragtime, quoting \"Hello My Baby\" and even Sousa's \"Washington Post March\"). \n\nPerhaps the piece which is most often heard today is the short fanfare \"The Unanswered Question\" (1908), written for the very unusual combination of trumpet, four flutes, and string orchestra. The strings, playing from behind the stage, play very slow, chorale-like music throughout the piece while several times the trumpet (playing from behind the audience) plays a short group of notes that Ives described as \"the eternal question of existence\". Each time the trumpet is answered with harsh outbursts from the flutes (onstage) — apart from the last one. That is the question that is left unanswered. Musicians often have discussions about what the real meaning of the piece is.\n\nAnother well-known orchestral work is \"Three Places in New England\". His best-known piano work is his \"Concord Sonata\". Ives often liked to quote bits of other pieces, and in this piano sonata he quotes the famous opening of Beethoven's \"Fifth Symphony\". It also has an interesting example of one of Ives' experiments: in the second movement, he tells the pianist to use a 14¾ in (37.5 cm) piece of wood to make a thick but soft cluster chord. The sonata is one of the best piano works of the 20th century. \n\nOne of his most interesting works is the his \"Fourth Symphony\" (1910–16) written for a huge orchestra. The last movement is like a fight between discord and traditional tonal music. The piece ends quietly with just the percussion playing at a distance. This symphony seems to say everything that Ives had been trying to do in music. It was not until 1965 that a complete performance of the symphony was given. \n\nIves’ music only gradually began to get well known during the 1930s and into the 1940s. Schoenberg recognized his importance. In 1951, Leonard Bernstein conducted the first performance of Ives' Second Symphony in a broadcast concert by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He recorded a lot of his music and even played some in a television programme for young people.\n\n", "id": "146753", "title": "Charles Ives"}

The English flageolet had six holes in the front.\n\nThe flageolet is quite similar to the recorder. In the 18th century it changed because a narrow mouthpiece made of ivory or bone was added at the top. This led into another section which bulged out. There was a soft sponge at the end of this. Sometimes this instrument was called the \"flautino\". The piccolo developed from it. Another instrument that developed from it was the tin whistle.\n\nHenry Purcell and George Frideric Handel both wrote pieces for it. \n\nSmall versions of this instrument, called bird flageolets were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing. \n\nThe illustrated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments; ISBN 3-8331-2195-5\n\n", "id": "146755", "title": "Flageolet"}

The legend is about a man called Faust. Faust wants to have knowledge. He meets the Devil. The Devil tells Faust he can have anything he wants. In return, the Devil says, Faust must give him his soul. Faust agrees, and the Devil lets Faust have a wonderful time, but in the end Faust has to go to Hell.\n\nThe story of Faust became famous all over Europe. Many writers from different countries wrote their own versions of the Faust story, e.g. Christopher Marlowe, Goethe, Mikhail Bulgakov, Thomas Mann. Many composers wrote music about Faust, e.g. Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt, Charles Gounod and Ferrucio Busoni.\n\nThe adjective \"Faustian\" is used to describe a person who wants something so much that it leads them into trouble.\n\nIn the early versions of the Faust story: in ballads, dramas and puppet-plays, Faust is always damned (meaning he will have to go to Hell). This is because he prefers human knowledge instead of God’s knowledge. This was thought to be very bad at that time.\n\nSome of the plays and comic puppet theatre from around the 16th century make up their own versions of the story. They often show Faust as a figure of vulgar fun. The story became popular in England when Christopher Marlowe wrote a play called The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus.

The company merged with Morris in 1952, becoming the lead partner in British Motor Corporation. This became British Leyland and then Rover Group. They began phasing the brand out in 1987; by 1989 all Rover Group cars had been cleared of Austin branding. The name has now passed into the ownership of Nanjing Motor Corporation, who have stated an interest in reviving it.\n\nThe company was started in 1905 by Herbert Austin, originally making cars at a factory in Rotherham, Yorkshire before moving to Longbridge, Birmingham. In the First World War Austin made aircraft for the Army and Navy, it was this work which led to the rapid expansion of the company; following the war the company stopped making aircraft. The company became Britain's biggest car maker.\n\nIn 1952 Austin merged with its biggest rival Morris (founded by William Morris, afterwards Lord Nuffield), with Austin being the lead partner. This company was known as the British Motor Corporation (BMC). Following the merger with Morris, the model line up for Austin changed considerably. The most notable car to come from this era was the Austin Mini, this was also sold as a Morris Mini and was made up until 2000 (though not as an Austin after 1987). Austin enjoyed a favourable market share during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1968 BMC merged with Leyland (Leyland, Standard and Triumph) to become British Leyland even though Leyland had been a much smaller firm. It was the British Leyland years that were perhaps the most difficult and in 1975 British Leyland was nationalised. Austin's market share fell, as did other marques within the company, leading to the phasing out of the Morris name plate in 1981. There were many strikes at British Leyland's factories, making British Leyland and other companies with the same problem, such as the Ford Motor Company unproductive compared to Japanese and European companied like Volkswagen. Many of the models in this era failed to sell well, either because they were old fashioned or deemed unreliable; the Austin Princess and the Austin Allegro were the only modern cars of this era, while the 1300, 1800 and Austin Maxi were all dated. The Princess and Allegro sold well, but both were saloons, and the only hatchback the company had was the Maxi, which wasn't a popular car.\n\nBritish Leyland became the Rover Group in 1986. Despite the huge success of the Austin Metro, launched in 1980, there was trouble in the company. In the 1980s Austin sold the most cars in the British Leyland group, however when the company became Rover Group, a greater emphasis was placed on the more upmarket Rover name. In 1987 the company began phasing the name out and by 1989 it had been removed from all products.\n\nThe name now belongs to Nanjing Motor Corporation who have expressed an interest in reviving it. They currently make cars as MGs (the MG marque came from Morris and consisted of three sports cards MGA, MGB and MGC), however it intends to use this brand name for luxury cars and sports cars. Nanjing does not own the Rover name, so the Austin name is the most recent it has to use for its mainstream mass market cars.\n\nThe company's most famous models were the Austin Seven (1922-39), the Austin A30 (1951-56), the Austin A35 (1956-59), the Austin A55 Cambridge (1954-71), the Austin Mini (1959-2000 but only as an Austin until 1969), the Austin 1800 (1964-75), the Austin 1300 (1967-74), Austin Maxi (1969-81), Austin Allegro (1973-83), Austin Princess/Ambassador (1975-84), Austin Metro (1980-1998 but only as an Austin until 1987), Austin Maestro (1983-94), Austin Montego (1984-94).\n", "id": "146764", "title": "Austin Motor Company"}

It was published in two parts. Part One is very dramatic, and tells the main story. Part II is extremely long, and it is meant to be read rather than acted on stage. It is about Goethe’s philosophy as well as about history and politics.\n\nGoethe’s \"Faust\" is a re-telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany. The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness. The devil (usually called Mephistopheles, as he is in Goethe’s play) tells Faust he can help him to do this, but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell. Faust makes a pact (an agreement) with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for: fine living, gold, women and honour. Faust signs the pact with his blood. Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life. However, in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet.\n\nThe subject of \"Faust\" occupied Goethe all his life. The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769: “Die Mitschuldigen“. In 1773, when he was 24, he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs, the medieval German poet. He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachs’s poetry. This rhythm is known as “Knittelvers”. It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern, e.g.\n\n\nIn 1887, long after Goethe’s death, it was discovered that he had made a version of “Faust“ which he never published but later decided to rewrite. This version is known as the “Urfaust” (“Ur” means “original”, i.e. the “Original Faust”). It was written between 1772 and 1775. He changed a lot of it and it became “Faust Part I“. A fragment (small part of it) was published in 1790. Then he finished it in 1806, published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829. Part 2 was finished in 1831, a few months before he died, and was not published until a few months after his death.\n\n\"Faust Part One\" starts off in heaven. Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things.\n\nWe then see Faust in his study. Faust is trying to get to know all possible things. He wants to know about science, humans and religion. He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know, but he thinks he is not managing to do it. For a moment he thinks of killing himself, but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner, his assistant. A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house.\n\nIn Faust’s study, the poodle changes into the devil (Mephistopheles). Faust makes an arrangement with the devil: the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth, In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell. Faust's arrangement is that, while Mephistopheles is serving Faust, if Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him, that he wants to stay in that moment forever, he will die that very moment (in German he says: “Verweile doch, du bist so schön” – “Stay a while, you are so beautiful”. It is perhaps the most famous quotation in all German literature.)\n\nMephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood. Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He loves her, and by offering her jewellery, and with help of a neighbour, Martha, Gretchen lets herself into Faust's arms. Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together, so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust. Faust and Gretchen sleep together. Gretchen’s mother dies of the potion. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen’s brother says Faust is bad and challenges him, but Faust kills him (with the devil’s help, of course). Gretchen has given birth to a baby, but she drowns it. She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison. Faust tries to save her from death, but he cannot free her from prison. Finding that they cannot free her, Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell, while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved.\n\n\"Faust Part Two\" is very different from Part One. It keeps referring to classical literature. The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies. He has many adventures. The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things. In the end Faust goes to heaven, because he loses only half the bet. Angels, who arrive as messengers of God’s mercy, say at the end of Act 5: \"He who strives on and lives to strive/ Can earn redemption still\" (i.e. anyone who tries hard in life can still be saved).\n\nGoethe’s \"Faust\" had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries. In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend. They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people. Dramas, epic poems and novels were written about Faust. Composers wrote operas or orchestral music about him. Thomas Mann wrote a novel \"Dr Faustus\" which compares Faust’s pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler.\n", "id": "146862", "title": "Goethe's Faust"}

It is operated under contract by the RATP Group.\n\nThe construction of Manchester's railway network in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had created a lot of termini around the City Centre. These were not linked together. This left a large amount of Manchester disconnected from the railway network.\n\nFor many years there had been plans to connect Manchester's two main railway stations. These are Piccadilly and Victoria. In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were plans for a \"Picc-Vic tunnel\". This tunnel would carry main-line trains under the city centre. The proposal was abandoned because it would cost too much.\n\nMetrolink was created by converting two British Rail lines serving the suburbs of Manchester, one to the town of Altrincham to the south, and another to the town of Bury to the north, to light rail. These two lines were joined up in Manchester city centre, where trams run on the roads, and had a short branch to Piccadilly railway station. This first section of the new system opened in 1992, and a newer line to Eccles opened in 2001.\n\nLots of extensions to the system have opened since then, with more that are currently being built or proposed. Metrolink now has lines that serve Didsbury, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham, Rochdale, MediaCityUK and Manchester Airport. These expansions increased the system's length from 37 km to 97 km with 99 stops. Sometime in 2017 there will be a second line through Manchester city centre serving Exchange Square, and another line towards the Trafford Centre shopping mall before the end of the decade.

The Queanbeyan River flows through Queanbeyan, near the centre of the city.\n\nThe town grew from a farm owned by ex-convict inn keeper, Timothy Beard. It was on the banks of the Molonglo River. The original name was \"Quinbean\" which means \"\"clear waters\"\".\n\nQueanbeyan became a township in 1838. There were about 50 people living there. Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days. Traces of gold were found in 1851. There were also some lead and silver mines. Settlers were often robbed by bushrangers including John Tennant, Jacky Jacky, Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall. In 1836, the government built a Post Office at Queanbeyan. \n\nThe first bank was opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September, 1859. This was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited which is now part of the National Australia Bank. \"The Golden Age\" now called \"The Queanbeyan Age\" was Queanbeyan's first newspaper started in 1860 by John Gale.

In 1982 house became the Queanbeyan Art Centre.\n\nThe railway reached Queanbeyan railway station in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to Canberra and Bombala. There are now two trains a day, the Countrylink Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney.\n\nQueanbeyan became an important country town, with 16 hotels and six flour mills powered by wind, water, horse and steam. Canberra was started as the national capital in 1911. There were no hotels, so people crossed the border to get a drink at Queanbeyan's hotels. When the Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1926, Canberra got it's first hotel. \n\nQueanbeyan became a city on 7 July, 1972.

His great-uncle was the painter Eustache Le Sueur. He started his musical training by singing in the choir at the church of Abbeville, then at the cathedral of Amiens. Le Sueur became chorus master at the cathedral of Sées. He went to Paris to study harmony. His teacher was Abbé Nicolas Roze, chorus master at the church Saints-Innocents. Le Sueur got jobs at Dijon (1779), Le Mans (1782), Tours (1783) and then took over Roze’s job at the Saints-Innocents at Paris. In 1786 he was made music director at the famous church Notre-Dame de Paris.\n\nAt Notre Dame he started to use orchestras to play the music for some of the special services. The priests did not like this. Le Sueur replied by writing a little book about music for big religious celebrations. It was a bad time in France financially and the church had to make savings, so Le Sueur could not have his orchestra any more, so he resigned from his job.\n\nLe Sueur spent some time in London, 1788-92, then returned to Paris where the revolution was going on. Three of his operas were performed, and he became professor at the École de la Garde Nationale, and then at the Conservatoire which was very new at the time. There he taught basic music theory. He was unable to get any more operas of his performed. He wrote a book saying how music should be taught in France, and criticizing the Conservatoire and its director. Because of that he lost his job at the Conservatoire. \n\nLe Sueur now had no job and so he was very poor. Then, in 1804, Napoleon made him maître de la chapelle at the Tuileries in the place of Giovanni Paisiello. He was then able to have his most famous work performed at the Opéra. It was called \"Ossian ou Les bardes\". Napoleon liked it very much and gave Le Sueur the cross of the Légion d'honneur. Le Sueur composed the \"Triumphal March\" for the coronation of Napoleon. In 1813, he was given a position at the Académie des Beaux-Arts, replacing André Grétry.\n\nAt the Bourbon Restoration, he was named composer of the royal chapel and conductor of the orchestra of the Opéra.

They were the heirs and transmitters of the Central Asian sedentary culture that diffused in prehistoric times from the Iranian plateau into an area extending roughly from the Caspian Sea to the borders of China. The Aryans constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwarezm, Sogdiana and Bactria, which formed part of Transoxania. They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great, and they mixed with later invaders like the Mauryans, Kushans and Hepthalites. Over the course of time, the language that was used by these ancient people eventually gave way to Farsi, a western dialect spoken in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. In the 13th century, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army settled in many of the popular Persian cities after whiping out the Persian population.

As adventures, \"Ivanhoe\", and \"Rob Roy\" are very well-known, and both were made into films. \"Waverley\" is important because it is the first historical novel. It was, for most readers, their first encounter with Highland culture. Scott wove together history and fiction. What he started with \"Waverley\", he continued with his other novels.\n\nScott's output was huge. Though many of his works are little read now, they sold well in their day, and paid for his great house, Abbotsford. Of his poetry \"The Lady of the Lake\" is best liked. \n\nScott was also an advocate, judge and legal administrator by profession. Throughout his career he combined his writing and editing work with his daily occupation as Clerk of Session and Sheriff-Depute of Selkirkshire.\n\nA prominent member of the Tory establishment in Edinburgh, Scott was an active member of the Highland Society and served a long term as President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820–32).\n\nScott was educated at Edinburgh High and the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1783. After spending some time in his father's office he became a barrister in 1792. In 1797 he married Charlotte Charpentier and in 1799 was appointed deputy Sheriff of Selkirkshire. He now began to write books in earnest.\nIn 1821 he was made a baronet. His house is now a public museum visited by many tourists each year.\n\nIn 1825 and 1826, a banking crisis swept through the cities of London and Edinburgh. The Ballantyne printing business, in which he was heavily invested, crashed. Scott was ruined. He placed his house and income in a trust belonging to his creditors, and set out to write his way out of debt. \n\nHe kept up his huge output of fiction, as well as producing a biography of Napoleon Bonaparte. By 1831 his health was failing. Still, he did a grand tour of Europe, where he was welcomed wherever he went. He returned to Scotland and, in September 1832, died at Abbotsford, near Melrose in the Scottish Borders. Though he died owing money, his novels continued to sell well.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147037", "text": "Pawn (chess)\n\nThe pawn (♙♟) is the weakest piece in the game of chess. They represent foot soldiers. Each player starts the game with eight pawns, one on each square of the second row (or rank) from the view of the player. In the white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, ..., h2, while the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, ..., h7.\n\nPawns move differently than other pieces. Unlike all the other pieces, pawns can not move backwards. Most of the time, a pawn moves by going up a single square, but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place, it can go forward two squares. Pawns may not use the first two-square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture. Any piece in front of a pawn, white or black, stops its moving. \n\nThe white pawn at e4 can capture either the black rook at d5 or the black knight at f5, but not the bishop at e5, which blocks its straight way forward. Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same way as it moves. A pawn captures diagonally, one square forward and to the left or right. In the diagram to the left, the white pawn can capture either the black rook or the black knight.\n\nAn even more unusual move is the \"en passant\" capture.\nEn passant happens when a pawn uses its first-move option to move two squares forward instead of one. If it passes over a square guarded by an enemy pawn, that pawn can take the first pawn \"in passing\" \"as if\" the first pawn had moved forward only one square. The taking pawn moves into the empty square over which the first pawn moved. The first pawn is removed from the board.\nTo capture \"en passant\" can only be done on the move right after the double-square pawn advance. Otherwise the chance is lost.\n\nThe \"en passant\" move was added in late fifteenth century Europe, to make up for the then newly added two-square first move rule. We have no record of why the rule was added, but it is easy to see that it works to prevent the position becoming blocked and uninteresting.\n\nThe simplest piece in chess, the pawn was in the oldest version of chess, Chaturanga. It is present in all other types of chess around the world.\n\nThe changes which took place in the fifteenth century were aimed at allowing the pieces to develop faster, and make the game more exciting. \n", "id": "147037", "title": "Pawn (chess)"}

The moves of the pieces are defined by tradition, and by the international chess federation, FIDE. \n\n\nThe bottom-right square of the board for each player must be white. Remember, \"White is right\" and \"Black is whack\". Also, the white must go first because the blacks should go last and lose because they are slaves and animals. \n\nPawn - A pawn can only move ahead, to the far end of the board. A pawn is placed in each square on the second row away from each player at the beginning of a game, right in front of all of their other pieces, so each player begins with eight pawns. Most times, a pawn can only move to one square, the square in front of it. But a pawn that has not moved yet in the game can move ahead two squares, or just one. \n\nIf an enemy piece is straight in front of a pawn, the pawn cannot capture that piece. Pawns have a special way to capture. A pawn can capture an enemy piece which is on the diagonal square to the left or right of the square in front of it. This is the only time a pawn can move to a square that is not straight in front of it.\n\nIf a pawn reaches the end of the board, it is removed and replaced by any other piece the player chooses, except a king or pawn.\n\nIf a pawn moves two squares on its first move, it may be taken (on the opponent's next move only) by an enemy pawn as if it had moved only one. This is called \"\"en passant\"\" (French for \"in passing\"). A pawn is worth 1 point.\n\nKnight - The knight is special because it is the only piece than can jump over other pieces. When a knight moves, first it goes two squares in one of the four ways a rook can move. Then the knight ends its move by going one square to the side. The knight is said to move in the shape of an L. See the picture \"(picture is coming)\". It \"jumps over\" the pieces on its way to its new square, and does not capture them, but the knight will capture an enemy piece if it lands on one. Knights are placed at the second and seventh squares on the rows closest to each player, between the rooks and the bishops. A knight is worth 3 points.\n\nRook - A rook can move any number of squares: left or right on the ranks, and up & down on the files. Rooks start at the far left and far right squares in the row closest to each player, next to the knights. A rook is worth 5 points.\n\nQueen - The queen combines the moves of a bishop and a rook. The queen is placed next to the king \"on a square of its own colour\". Thus the two queens exactly face each other at the start. The queen is worth 9 points.\n\nKing - The king starts next to the queen. The king can move to one of the eight squares around it. It is limited as an active piece, but always is vulnerable to attack. No numerical value can be put on it.\n\nA king may perform a special move known as \"castling\". This is when a king moves two spaces towards a rook, and the rook moves to the square on the other side of the king. This may not be done if: \n", "id": "147047", "title": "Chess piece"}

At his baptism he had 36 godfathers and was given 36 Christian names. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire. He was a good musician, but mostly he enjoyed popular dance music. He conducted a band, but had to leave Paris because he owed people a lot of money.\n\nHe went to London where he formed a good orchestra. His orchestra played at a series of summer concerts (called \"Concerts d’été\"). Later he conducted a series of winter concerts (\"Concerts d’hiver\"). Although he was a good conductor he was a great showman. He would make a big show of putting on his white gloves which were given to him on a silver plate. He used a special baton (conductor’s stick) which had jewels in it when he conducted Beethoven. He wore a white waistcoat and enormous wrist bands, and he had a huge moustache and long, black hair. He would throw himself around when conducting and finish by sinking into a velvet chair. The audience loved it, especially when he added military bands to his orchestra. He used to conduct facing the audience. He conducted concerts in the London theatres and parks (promenade concerts). \n\nJullien’s programmes included works by the great composers, e.g. Beethoven and Mozart, but they were always mixed with light music: dances, quadrilles, marches, etc. He often added lots of extra instruments to the great classics, e.g. when he conducted Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony he added four ophicleides, a saxophone and side drums. \n\nJullien travelled to Scotland, Ireland and America with his orchestra. In 1852 he produced an opera, \"Pietro il grande\", at Covent Garden, but it cost a ridiculous amount of money and he was financially ruined. \n\nEventually he went back to France where he was arrested and put in prison because of his debts. He died in a lunatic asylum. His wife, to whom he had been happily married, lived on for many years, and their son Louis became a conductor and tried to conduct promenade concerts, but he did not have much success.\n\nJullien’s behaviour might seem strange to us today, but he lived at a time when the role of the conductor was becoming very important as orchestras had become much larger than they had been in the 18th century. He gave people who had never heard good classical music the chance to hear the music by the great composers. He had a very big influence on the musical scene in London and people talked about him for many years after his death.\n\n\n", "id": "147128", "title": "Louis Antoine Jullien"}

Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season. However, in this season no Tropical Cyclone formed after November 30, the end of the season because the last storm, Hurricane Gorden died on November 21, just nine days before the 30th.\n\nThe season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes, which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The strongest, Hurricane Florence, it's top winds were at a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Aside from Chris, Florence, and Gordon, none of the storms became hurricanes. A famous hurricane from 1994 would probably be Hurricane Gordon. Hurricane Gordon was a strange long lived November hurricane that killed at least 1,100 people in Haiti.\n\nAlberto formed from a north-moving tropical depression north of the Yucatán Peninsula on July 2. Tropical Storm Alberto continued north, making landfall near Destin, Florida on July 3 as a moderately strong tropical storm. The storm weakened quickly to a tropical depression, which then moved around Georgia and Alabama until it dissipated on July 7. Damage was guessed at $500 million (1994 USD) and 30 deaths were caused by the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto.\nTropical Depression Two formed near South Carolina on the 19th. The depression moved north making landfall in South Carolina and dissipated on July 23rd. No damage or deaths reported.\n\nBeryl formed off the Florida Panhandle on August 15, only twelve hours before it made landfall near Panama City, Florida. Beryl quickly strengthened before landfall and reached its top winds of 60 mph. Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia, across the Carolinas, and all the way to Connecticut where it was absorbed by a frontal system. Damage was guessed at $73 million (1994 USD). Though it caused no deaths, a lot of people were injured by the 37 tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened.\n\nChris formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 17, and reached hurricane strength the next day. It moved to the northwest and turned north and brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm on the 21st. Chris continued north, and dissipated without causing any damage\n\nThe wave that would become Tropical Depression Five was tracked beginning on August 17. The wave was upgraded into a depression on August 29 near the Yucatán Peninsula. Tropical Depression Five made landfall in Tampico on the 31st and dissipating the same day over Mexico. No damage was caused by Tropica Depression Five.\n\nTropical Storm Debby formed on September 10, just east of the lesser antilies. The storm crossed some of the islands, and dissipated south of Puerto Rico on the 11th. Nine people dead because of Tropical Storm Debby. Damage estimates are not available. It cause flooding and mudslides in Saint Lucia.\n\nErnesto formed southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 it became Tropical Storm Ernesto. It moved north for two days, and by the 24th had weakened to a tropical depression. Two days later Ernesto dissipated without affecting any land.\n\nTropical Depression Eight formed on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near Honduras. Tropical Depression Eight made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala. Some reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten.\n\nTropical Depression Nine form off the coast of Africa on September 26. It was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season, 150 miles southeast from the Cape Verde Islands the next day. The depression moved north and dissipated on September 29.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather, related to Tropical Depression Eight, moved across the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucatán Peninsula. A tropical wave moved into the area, causing an increase in showers and cloudiness. The wave became Tropical Depression Ten on September 29 about 150 miles off the coast of Cuba. The system became better-organized and when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico, it was absorbed by a non-tropical system on 30th. Tropical Depression Ten caused $5 million in damage (1994 USD).\nFlorence, at first formed as a subtropical depression in the central Atlantic on November 2. As it northwest, it took on tropical characteristics and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence on the 4th. It reached hurricane strength, then turned to the northeast and on November 6, as it was picked up by a strong trough. Two days later Florence was absorbed by the same trough that made it turn northeast. There was no reported damage.\nHurricane Gordon was a very deadly and damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean, Florida and parts of North Carolina. The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean. This storm killed over 1100 people (estimates range between 500-2300 people dead through Haiti and the central Caribbean islands, including Jamaica and Cuba). The storm's strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land. Damage was guessed to be at $400 million (1994 US dollars). \nAround Christmas in 1994 a nor'easter may have had tropical characteristics, though it was not called a tropical system. It affected the Mid-Atlantic and New England causing damage at $21 million.\n\nIn 1994, only 7 out of 21 names were used.

In a normal star, like our Sun and all other main-sequence stars, this change happens at the very center of the star. Sooner or later, almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium. This causes the nuclear reaction to stop. The center will start to get smaller due to the star's gravity. This makes the layer just outside the center get hotter. This layer still has hydrogen. This hydrogen will fuse to make helium.\n\nThe outer layers of the star will get much, much bigger. The star will get brighter, sometimes as much as ten thousand times as bright as it was at first. Since the outside of the star will get bigger, the energy will be spread over a much larger area. Because of this, the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange.\n\nSometime later, red giants will start to fuse helium to make other elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Some of their outer layers will blow away, leaving interstellar gas and dust circling the star. In time, most red giants will become white dwarfs. Very large red giants become neutron stars or black holes.\n\n", "id": "147248", "title": "Red giant"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147254", "text": "Hypergiant\n\nA hypergiant (luminosity class 0) is a star with an enormous mass and luminosity, showing signs of a very high rate of mass loss. The exact definition is not yet settled.\n\nHypergiants are the largest stars in the universe, even larger than supergiants. The largest known hypergiant was NML Cygni, which is about 1,650 times wider than the Sun. It is one of the extreme luminous supergiant stars. The pulsating red supergiant UY Scuti is probably larger still. The hypergiant with the next largest known diameter is VY Canis Majoris, which is between 1300 and 1540 times wider than the Sun, or roughly the same diameter as the orbit of Jupiter.\n\nHypergiants are very rare and they have a short lifespan. While the Sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion years, hypergiants will only exist for a few million years.\n\nMost hypergiants are red stars, but there are two special groups: luminous blue variables (LBV), and yellow hypergiants. Both of these types are very rare, with only a few examples in the Milky Way galaxy. Their rareness is probably because each type passes through this stage quite rapidly.\n\nAs luminosity of stars increases greatly with mass, the luminosity of hypergiants often lies very close to the Eddington limit. This is the luminosity at which the force of the star's gravity equals the radiation pressure outward. \n\nThis means that the radiative flux passing through the photosphere of a hypergiant may be nearly strong enough to lift off the photosphere. Above the Eddington limit, the star would generate so much radiation that parts of its outer layers would be thrown off in massive outbursts. This would effectively restrict the star from shining at higher luminosities for longer periods.\n\nA good candidate for hosting a continuum-driven wind is Eta Carinae, one of the most massive stars ever observed. Its mass is about 130 solar masses and its luminosity four million times that of the Sun. Eta Carinae may occasionally exceed the Eddington limit. The last time might have been outbursts observed in 1840–1860. These reached mass loss rates much higher than stellar winds would normally allow.\n\nAnother theory to explain the massive outbursts of Eta Carinae is the idea of a deeply situated hydrodynamic explosion, blasting off parts of the star’s outer layers. The idea is that the star, even at luminosities below the Eddington limit, would have insufficient heat convection in the inner layers, resulting in a density inversion potentially leading to a massive explosion. The theory has, however, not been explored very much, and it is uncertain whether this really can happen.\n", "id": "147254", "title": "Hypergiant"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147273", "text": "Yellow (song)\n\n\"Yellow\" is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay. The band wrote the song and co-produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson. It was for their first album \"Parachutes\". The song's lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martin's unreturned love.\n\nThe song was released across the world in June 2000. It was the second single off the album following \"Shiver\". It was the lead single in the United States. The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. This gave the band their first top-five hit in the United Kingdom.\n\nHelped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions, the song made the band very popular. Various recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of \"Yellow\". It remains one of the band's most popular songs.\n\n\"Yellow\" was written in a Rockfield studio in Wales. The studio is called the Quadrangle. It is where Coldplay began working on their first album, \"Parachutes\". One night after finishing recording \"Shiver\", the lead single of the album, the band took a break and went out of the studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and \"just amazing\", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars. The band looked at the stars and felt generally inspired. The song's main melody popped into the head of Chris Martin, the band's vocalist. The melody was a chord pattern. At first, Martin did not take it seriously \"as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice\". Martin has said, \"The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice.\" The melody \"started off a lot slower\" according to Will Champion, the band's drummer, and sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When Jonny Buckland, the band's guitarist, started playing it and added to it with his own ideas, they had created the riff, \"and it sort of got a bit heavier\".\n\nWhile composing the song's lyrics, however, Martin could not find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word to fit the song's main idea and theme. He thought that this missing word was a key word in the lyrics. He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory \"Yellow Pages\". Martin later titled the song \"Yellow\" as a reference to the directory. But according to him, \"In an alternate universe, this song could be called 'Playboy.'\" The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. The band's bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line \"Look at the stars\". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.\n\nThe band and Nelson produced the track. Nelson was introduced to the band's music through the band's manager. Nelson's manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay. Nelson wanted to work them after seeing the band perform live. \"Yellow\" was first recorded upstairs in the project studio. This was a demo room in Liverpool's Parr Street Studios.\n\nNelson and the band had some problems when they were making some parts of the song. Champion said that \"... it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging...\" The band tried to get the tempo correct, according to Nelson, \"because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove\". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output. The band recorded backing vocals in the control room of Quadrangle.\n\nNelson used an analogue tape to record most of the tracks in the album. As recording progressed, \"Yellow\" was one of a couple of songs that they \"couldn't quite get on analogue\". They recorded different versions, but they did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools \"to get the feel of [the track] just right\". Once all of the takes were recorded into the computer, \"we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it\", according to Nelson.\n\nThe song opens with an acoustic guitar part. This is backed by an electric guitar copying the acoustic guitar. It then forwards to the lead guitar line. It then goes back to the acoustic section. Its instrumentation is varied, including the drums, cymbals, and the occasional hi-hat and ascending bass guitar. \"Yellow\" features Martin's falsetto, and nearly spoken-word whispers. Martin, after the song's mixing, felt that his voice was \"too subdued, too quiet\".\n\nMartin has explained that \"'Yellow' refers to the mood of the band. Brightness and hope and .\" The references in some of the song's lyrics, including the swimming and drawing a line, \"are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion\". The drawing of a line refers to Martin's habit of writing lists and underlining those important things on the list. Martin has commented that the song is about devotion. He refers to his unreturned love (Martin was single at the time he wrote the song). Most people have considered \"Yellow\" as a happy song, even though the lyrics do not seem to be.\n\n\"Yellow\" and \"Shiver\" were first released as EPs in the spring of 2000. \"Yellow\" was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000. The single includes the songs \"Help Is Round the Corner\" and \"No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground\". The third song was taken from the band's first EP, \"Safety\". In the United States, however, the song was released as the lead single off the album. In October 2000, the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets. The band released a limited-edition CD of \"Trouble\", the third single off \"Parachutes\", which features a remix of \"Yellow\". It was pressed to 1,000 copies, and was issued only to fans and journalists.\n\nThe single received a massive radio airplay, particularly on BBC Radio 1. This was helped by its TV reception through its music video. The reaction was mostly positive. Even BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly. This heavy rotation continued for months after its release. \"Yellow\" eventually became 2000's most played song on the radio. The song is also regularly played at various British clubs, bars and sporting events. People often sing along when it is played. The song is often played during home games at English Championship club Watford. \"Yellow\" was used as the theme song for ABC fall television ads a month after the album was released in the United States. The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australia's \"Daffodil Day\". This was in recognition of that organisation's official flower's yellow hue.\n\nCritics were positive towards the song. Matt Diehl of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine has noted \"Yellow\" is \"unrepentantly romantic\". He added that \"the band creates a hypnotic slo-mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme\". \"Yellow\" won Best Single at the 2001 \"NME\" Carling Awards. It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. \"Billboard\" said that \"every time that electric-guitar riff barges in, you're hooked all over again.\"\n\nBrian Hiatt of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine has said that the song was a career-making record. Roach has claimed in his book, \"Coldplay: Nobody Said It Was Easy\", that although \"Shiver\" earned the band their first UK Top 40 single, it was \"Yellow\" that has changed \"everything\", and that it \"exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular\". In the US, after it was being used in promos of ABC, the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001. According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplay's second album, \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", for \"Spin\" magazine, the band is still known in the United States for their \"surprise smash 'Yellow'\". A \"Billboard\" magazine review said, \"After one single ('Yellow') and its accompanying album (\"Parachutes\"  ... ), Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit-rock throne.\" The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album.\n\nFollowing the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, \"Yellow\" was the first video played on MTV once normal programming resumed.\n\n\n", "id": "147273", "title": "Yellow (song)"}

Many hybrids exist, both natural and created by humans. These plants come from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar and the Seychelles ; southward to Australia and New Caledonia ; and northward to India and Sri Lanka . Many are plants from hot humid lowland areas, but the majority are from high in the mountains where nights are cold. Nepenthes are often categorized as being lowland or highland varieties, depending on how high they live above sea level. Lowland varieties usually require high temperature and humidity levels. Highland varieties usually require warm days but cold and humid nights. The name \"Nepenthes\" was first published in 1737 in Carolus Linnaeus's \"Hortus Cliffortianus\".\n\nNepenthes traps contain a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or syrupy and is used to drown prey. The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high, even when significantly diluted by water, as inevitably happens in wet conditions. Many species of \"Nepenthes\" produce two different forms of pitchers. Near the base of the plant are the large lower traps, which usually sit on the ground, while the upper pitchers may be smaller, coloured differently, and have different shapes and features than the lower pitchers. \n\nThe lower part of the trap contains glands which take nutrients from captured insects.\n\nOne of the earliest pictures of \"Nepenthes\" appears in Leonard Plukenet's \"Almagestum Botanicum\" of 1696.

The magic used by th witches can be showed under many forms, for example can be mixed with human technology, for example a gun or a rifle. A common use of magic mixes with human technology for example is when Kurohime, shot with her gun, magic bullets, that can invoke magical beasts as dragon or a demon.\n\nZero - A boy saved by Kurohime in his childhood. Over ten years, he trained and became a gunslinger. He uses 4 guns and is known for his incredible speed. He does not use his guns for killing and only uses them to help people. Zero doesn't use the magic, often is used by Kurohime for to mix magic with technology. Zero loves truly Kurohime and in a part of series he will sacrifice his life for to save Kurohime.\n\nKurohime - A magician who fights using magical bullets. Ten years ago, she saves Zero, influencing his decision to become a gunslinger. She is very self-centered, and is said to not be able to genuinely love. As a result, she defied the gods and was cursed to walk the world as a child. She can only revert to her adult form when she falls in love. When a child, she is addressed as Himeko, and her magic powers are greatly hindered. The adult Kurohime bears a strong resemblance to the goddess that cursed her (In fact, they are both the same. Kurohime was split into 2 in her battle against the gods; one of \"good\" which holds all of her love and care and memories, and the other holding her \"bad\" side, which has no memories, except the anger and hatred. The latter is the current Kurohime, while the former is the \"goddess\" who gave her the curse.) She is also extremely beautiful and believes all men are her \"dogs\". Still, she has feelings for Zero, even if she won't admit it. Her name translates to \"Black Princess\" (Kuro is black and hime is princess). Her chief weapon is her witch-gun, \"Senryu\" (which, when translated means Tornado Dragon). Aside from being able to fire witch-bullets, Senryu can fire normal bullets with cannon-like force. In the second arc, Himeko receives the Yamato-Dachi from Yamatohime after defeating Gandhara. The sword fuses with Senryu, allowing it to switch between sword (Yamato Senryuto) and gun (Yamato Senryuho) forms.\n\nHimeko- Kurohime's form as a child, she differs greatly from her adult self, besides the fact that she is adorable and cute while her adult self is sexy and beautiful. Himeko is hyperactive and acts like a real child, often falling asleep for naps, while as her adult form is more controlled and calm. Himeko is unable to use strong magic, for example when she tries to evoke a dragon, it comes just a funny little dragon, really useless. \n\nOnimaru - A heavyset gunslinger that he felt betrayed by Kurohime/Himeko. When she was bad, Kurohime used him and his troops for to build a tower for to fight Gods, after then Kurohime betrayed Onimaru. He was once her most loyal soldier and his back bears a large tattoo of the Kanji for \"Dog\" and \"Kurohime\". In the middle of series Onimaru will be cursed by a demon and will be transformed in a little lizard.\n\nAsura - A beautiful looking woman. The people of that land call her and her kind, demons. She is extremely powerful, possessing incredible magical powers, whose destructive properties rivals a god. She is first introduced as a mysterious character who plays a subtle hand in aiding Kurohime and Zero defeat a witch.\n\nSword- The leader of the death angel squad (Shinigami Tenshidan) sent after Kurohime and Zero in the fourth volume. She and her comrades (Axe, Lance, Mace, Hammer, and Dagger) are sent to reap a group of vengeful souls from a ghost wagon who were revived courtesy of Kurohime. Sword seems to have a personal sense of revenge against Kurohime.\n\nDarkray- The former God of Death. He fought Kurohime when she first challenged the gods. Using the soul of an infant murdered by an attack on Kurohime as a shield, he defeated her with Sword, slicing her in half. He was also the one who suggested splitting Kurohime into two beings: one comprised of pure hate, the other, of love and compassion. This resulted in the birth of Shirohime (White Princess)the Goddess of Mercy. He later appears in the fourth volume.\n\nYashahime- The mother goddess and lover of Darkray. She swears to kill Kurohime to avenge the fallen God of Death, and first appears when Kurohime killed Gandhara on Yamato. She is very powerful and she tried to kill Zero's soul.She is actually jealous of the love zero and Kurohime share, and uses Darkray's skull to turn Zero into the god of death, so as to make Kurohime experience hell on earth forever.\n\nYamatohime- The Phoenix Suzaku, Devil God, and Spirit Queen of Fire.

Intended as a retreat from Rome, it represents the first application of humanist urban planning concepts.The rebuilding was done by Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as Bernardo Rossellino).\n\nThe piazza is made by four buildings. The principal residence, \"Palazzo Piccolomini\", is on the west side.\nThe \"Duomo\" (Cathedral), which dominates the center of the piazza, has a façade that is one of the earliest designed in the Renaissance manner. Artworks in the Duomo include five altar paintings from the Sienese School. The Baptistry, dedicated as usual to \"San Giovanni\".\nThe \"Palazzo Borgia\", on the third side of the piazza, was built as the palace to house the bishops who would travel to Pienza to attend the Pope. Inside the palace there is the Diocesan Museum, and the Museo della Cattedrale. The collection includes a lot of religious artifacts. Paintings include a 7th-century painting of \"Christ on the Cross\" (\"La Croce\"), 14th century works by Pietro Lorenzetti (\"Madonna with Child\") and Bartolo di Fredi (\"Madonna della Misericordia\"). There are also important works from the 14th and 15th centuries, including a Madonna attributed to Luca Signorelli.\nAcross from the church is the town hall. Since Corsigniano was originally a village without a town governance, before the transformations there was no town hall. But when Corsigniano was given the status of an official city, a \"Palazzo Comunale\" was required. A third floor was added in 1599. The \"Palazzo Comunale\" was probably also designed by Rossellino.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "147321", "title": "Pienza"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147435", "text": "Talyllyn Railway\n\nThe Talyllyn Railway () is a narrow-gauge preserved railway in Wales. It runs for from Tywyn on the Mid-Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn. The line was opened in 1866 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn. It was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage. Despite severe under-investment, the line remained open, and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers. \n\nSince preservation, the railway has operated as a tourist attraction. It has increased the amount of rolling stock it has. It has done this by buying and building new locomotives and carriages. In 1976, an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol. In 2001, the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place. This included a much-expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.\n\nThe fictional Skarloey Railway was based on the Talyllyn Railway. This fictional railway formed part of the Railway Series of children's books by The Rev. W. Awdry. The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film \"The Titfield Thunderbolt\".\n\nThe origin of the railway's name is uncertain. It could refer to the parish of Talyllyn, which contains its eastern terminus. Or it could come from Tal-y-llyn. Tal-y-llyn is a large glacial ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris further east. The gauge of the track is unusual. It was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom: the nearby Corris Railway (which predated the Talyllyn), and the subsequent Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway.\n\nSlate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s. Although many small quarries and test levels were established, only one major quarry was developed in the region. It was at Bryn Eglwys, north east of the town. Underground working began in the early 1840s. By 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe. The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal. They were then transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi (also known as Aberdovey). Finally they were loaded into seagoing vessels. This was a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarry's output. In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England. As a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests. One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire. In 1859 he purchased a house near Dolgellau, north of Tywyn. In January 1864, McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company. The company leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner, Lewis Morris of Machynlleth.\nMcConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output. In 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth however. In 1863 this railway had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn. This was the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29 Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 186., The company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report.\n\nTyler's report led to an unusual alteration. It was discovered that the loading gauge of the line was too small. The internal width of the overbridges was only , but the railway's passenger carriages were wide. This left less than clearance on either side, which was less than the minimum required clearance of . To alleviate this problem, McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off-centre beneath the bridges. This would allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors and mean that passengers could get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge. Tyler agreed to this arrangement, and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only, an unusual feature for a public railway. This feature is however shared with the neighbouring Corris Railway, though for different reasons. Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railway's first two steam locomotives, as locomotive No. 1 suffered from excessive \"vertical motion\" and No. 2 was said to suffer from \"horizontal oscillation\". No. 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang. The springs on No. 2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation.\n\nThe railway opened with two locomotives, one was a carriage and the other carried goods. They were ran under a \"one engine in steam\" rule to make sure they did not crash into each other. At the beginning, locomotives were kept in a shed made of wood at Ty Dwr at the Abergynolwyn station. This was when the main engineering department of the Tayllyn was being built at . The engineering department opened up on February 17 1867.\n\nWhen Talyllyn opened there were two train stations it visited, one at Pendre and the other at Abergynolwyn. In 1867, the station at opened. In 1873, and stations opened. Eventually, a line that ran from the Abergynolwyn station to the actual village of Abergynolwyn was opened. People could take an incline down a hill from the station to the town. From there, people could take a one of the many trams that ran through the village. Supplies like coal, building materials, and other things were sent down the incline from the train station to the village.\n\nThe railway used steam locomotives when it opened. The two original locomotives were made by Fletcher, Jennings & Co. of Whitehaven in Cumbria. Both of them are still used today but many of the parts inside and outside have been replaced. Talyllyn has a rare gauge. This is thought to match the gauge at Corris Railway. The locomotives at Talyllyn might be the oldest of their kind for making sure they fit that type of gauge. The locomotives, \"Talyllyn\" and \"Dolgoch\" used to carry slate from the quarry at Tywyn. It also carried other things. Trains that carried people, called passenger trains, traveled between Abergynolwyn, Dolgoch and Pendre. Men who worked on the quarries also traveled on trains, despite those trains not being able to be used by the public. Those trains traveled from Abergynolwyn to Alltwyllt and into Nant Gwernol.\n\nThe line was very successful when it opened. As of 1880, 300 people worked in the local slate industry. Over of slate was sent by train each year. Over 11,500 people first road the trains in 1867. By 1877, over 23,000 people were using the train.\n\nStarting in the 1880s, the \"Grand Tour\" was popular with people visiting the area, called tourists. People could take the Talyllyn and Corris trains and go through Tal-y-llyn Lake and Cadair Idris. Then, when they returned, they could use Cambrian Railways trains. The need for slate slowed down for the last twenty years of the 1880s. Many quarries fired people or closed. Even the quarries that dug up more slate due to other quarries closing often closed eventually. This made the need for the trains less, and made the railroad companies make less money.\n\nEventually, the biggest quarry in the area, Bryn Eglwys closed. Most of the people who had jobs in Abergynolwyn worked at that quarry. Many people were hurt by the closure. A man who lived in Abergynolwyn, named Henry Haydn Jones bought Bryn Eglwys. He also became a MP for the Liberal representing Merioneth. The quarry, which had closed, reopened in January 1911. Haydn Jones had no money to put into the quarry. But, when workers started mining in the quarry they pulled slate from the \"Broad Vein\" section. That section had slate that was very hard. It was not popular and most people did not want to buy it. They stopped getting slate from the Broad Vein and started getting slate from the \"Narrow Vein,\" which had slate that was softer and that people wanted to buy. It was very expensive to build a new mind in the Narrow Vein. So, to save money, Haydn Jones made very small entrances into the mine, which were considered unsafe by many people. The sales of slate rose during World War I because people started building new buildings after they were destroyed in the war.\n\nAfter the war ended, and after 1920, people started traveling more to see the sights of Britain. The number of people who wrote on the Talyllyn rose and places that once stored slate were used to seat people, instead. Tourists could even rent slate wagons, which were used to transport slate only, as a fun thing to experience. A Gravity railway was used to move people on the wagons. People were no longer able to ride in the wagons as of the 1930s. Tourists brought more money into the area and helped the railway survive, but, Haydn Jones never made money. \n\nThe rental contract on Bryn Eglwys ended in 1942. But, Haydn Jones could renew it each year. People were still visiting the area as tourists. In October 1942, two return trains ran on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The trip was 45 minutes long one way. They did not let people ride the trains on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. In 1946, the was a collapse in Bryn Eglwys. The quarry was called unsafe and people could not use it. It was closed. Haydn Jones kept running the railway and said he would do so until he died. In 1947, most of the railroads in Britain were bought by the government. Talyllyn remained owned by Haydn Jones. Between 1947 and 1949, people could ride the train two days a week. Haydn Jones died on July 2 1950. The railway kept running until October 6.\n\nIn 1949, Tom Rolt, who was a writer, visited the railway. David Curwen, who was a locomotive engineer, visited with him. In the summer of 1950, Rolt wrote a letter to the \"Birmingham Post\". He told them that it was important to rescue Talyllyn. Many people had interest in this. On October 11 1950, a meeting was held about it in Birmingham at the Imperial Hotel. About 70 people attended. Rolt told them that he thought they should make a committee, or a team, to look into buying the railway. The committee met again on October 23. They met with the people who ran Haydn Jones' finances after he had died.\n\nIt was very hard due to the law to make the committee the owners of the railway. Both the committee and Haydn Jones' people thought it was a good idea to have Jones' stop being the owner. They decided to make a new company, called Talyllyn Holdings, the owner. The company was a mix of people from the committee and from Jones' group. The company started running the railway on February 8 1951. They changed the name of the company to a non-profit called the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society. The Society started to advertise that they wanted to save the railway and asked for people to donate money. They also wanted to find people to volunteer to help run the railway. By May, almost 650 people had donated and became members of the Society. The railway re-opened on Whit Monday, on May 14 1951. Trains ran between Wharf and Rhydyronen. Starting on June 4, trains ran daily until the summer. David Curwen was the Chief Mechanical Engineer.\n\nWhen the railway re-opened again it needed a lot of work done to it to fix things and update it. They bought two more steam locomotives from Corris Railway in 1951. They were named \"Sir Haydn\" and \"Edward Thomas\". In 1951, \"Sir Haydn\" became the first new locomotive to travel on Talyllyn Railway in over 80 years. It derailed a lot because the Talyllyn Railway was slightly wider than the Corris Railway. Eventually this was fixed by changing the width of the railway and changing parts of the locomotive wheels. The \"Edward Thomas\" needed a lot of service, but it was too expensive to fix. A man who was on the Preservation Society board of directors, John Alcock, had his company, the Hunslet Engine Company fix it for free.\nAnother locomotive was donated to the Society by an engineering company in Birmingham called Abelsons Limited. The locomotive was named \"Douglas\". It was built for the depot railway and was used by the RAF Calshot until 1945. It started being used by the public in 1954. Through the 1950s volunteers and Society staff members helped fix the railway tracks.\n\nOn May 22 1957, the BBC produced a live television program at the railway. Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon road the train from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. As a result of the television program, more people used the train. Over 57,000 people road the train that summer. The money that those people paid helped the Society improve the railway. In 1958, the original \"Talyllyn\" locomotive was put back in service.\n\nAt the Tywyn Wharf train station a museum was opened. It is called the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum. The first object that was displayed at the museum was the Guinness Brewery locomotive. It was donated to the museum in 1952. The museum opened in 1956.\n\n", "id": "147435", "title": "Talyllyn Railway"}

Although only 13 episodes were made, it was so popular that it was repeated regularly until 1987. The series was made by Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate through their company Smallfilms. \n\nThe character Bagpuss was a toy cat. Bagpuss was described in each programme as \"an old, saggy cloth cat, baggy, and a bit loose at the seams\".\n\nEach programme began in the same way. It started by looking through old sepia photographs. There was a shop called “Bagpuss & Co”. The cat sat in the shop window. The owner of the shop was a little girl named Emily. The shop did not sell anything. Instead, Emily would find things that were broken and lost. She fixed them and put them in the shop window. Emily hoping that the owners of the things would come and get them. She would leave the fixed thing in front of her favourite toy: the stuffed cat Bagpuss. Each programme began with these words:\n\nWhen Emily had left, Bagpuss would wake up. The programme changed from sepia to colour film, and the toys in the shop would come to life. There was Gabriel the toad, a rag doll called Madeleine, and a wooden woodpecker which was a bookend (something to stop a row of books falling over) called Professor Yaffle. Professor Yaffle spoke like a clever professor. He had a German accent and wore a pince-nez. He would look at the object and tell the audience what it was used for. There were also some mice. They lived in the “mouse organ” (a pun on the word mouthorgan). The mouse organ played music and the mice squeaked in high voices. All the voices except those of Madeleine and Gabriel were done by Oliver Postgate who also wrote the stories.\n\nAt the end of the programme, Professor Yaffle would yawn again and fall asleep. The colour changed back to sepia and the toys became toys again as these words were spoken:\n\n\n", "id": "147538", "title": "Bagpuss"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147540", "text": "Oliver Postgate\n\nOliver Postgate (born Hendon, Middlesex, England, 12 April 1925 died Broadstairs, Kent, 8 December 2008) was an English animator, puppeteer and writer.\n\nHe made several series of children’s programmes for British television. They all became very popular. They include \"Pingwings\", \"Pogles' Wood\", \"Noggin the Nog\", \"Ivor the Engine\", \"Clangers\" and \"Bagpuss\". They were all made by Smallfilms, the company he set up with Peter Firmin. They were shown on the BBC between the 1950s and the 1980s, and on ITV from 1959 to the present day. In a 1999 poll, \"Bagpuss\" was voted the most popular children's television programme of all time.\n\nHe was born in Hendon, Middlesex, England. He went to Woodstock School and Woodhouse County Secondary School in London. When World War II started he was evacuated to Devon and he finished his studies at Dartington Hall School. He refused to fight in the war, so he was sent to prison. However, he was soon let out because he volunteered to be a stretcher bearer for the Red Cross.\n\nIn 1948 he trained as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but he never became a professional actor. He was more interested in animation. He created the character of a pig made out of cardboard that played the violin. The BBC were not interested in his idea. Seven years later he joined the ITV London company Associated-Rediffusion as a stage manager. He worked on children’s programmes and made props. \n\nPostgate thought he could make better programmes than the ones he was working on, so he created \"Alexander the Mouse\", a story about a mouse that was born to be king. Postgate met an artist called Peter Firmin. He was good at drawing animation characters. The two men started to work together and for 30 years they created their well-known television series, running their own company called Smallfilms. The characters in their stories were moved by magnets under a table. They created \"The Saga of Noggin the Nog\" (1959-1965). It was based on old Norse legends. Then came \"The Seal of Neptune\" (1960), a story about horses that lived under the sea. They created \"The Pogles\" which was about a witch, but after the first broadcast it was thought to be too frightening for children. Then came \"The Clangers\" (1969-1974 which was their first colour production. Their most famous creation was \"Bagpuss\", the story of a toy cat made of rags that sat in a shop window.\n\nIn 1987 the University of Kent at Canterbury awarded an honorary degree to Postgate. Postgate said that it should really be Bagpuss who got the degree. He later showed Bagpuss wearing academic dress\n\nPostgate married Prudence Myers in 1957, becoming stepfather to her three children The couple had twin boys in 1959 and another son in 1964. Prudence died in 1982. Naomi Linnell was his partner in the last years of his life.\n\nHe wrote an autobiography \"Seeing Things\" which was published in 2000. In his book he looked back at the programmes he made. He explained why they were so popular by saying: “They are simple, and they are well-founded in a safe place. They are full of fun and, like a good meal, they are rich and satisfying.”\n\nHe died in Broadstairs, near his home on the Kent coast, on 8 December 2008.\n\nObituary to Oliver Postgate, The Independent, 10 Dec 2008 p. 34\n\n", "id": "147540", "title": "Oliver Postgate"}
