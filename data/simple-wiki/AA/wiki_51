This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry.\n\nOne important change in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was invented. Gas lighting was important too. Streetlights became common first, followed by lights in public buildings and at home. In the 1880s people began making power stations and distribution systems to feed the new electric lightbulbs.\n\nIndustrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories.\n\nIn the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of \"privacy\" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists.\n\nMore theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century.\n\n", "id": "183833", "title": "Victorian era"}

Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A.\n\nTay-Sachs is a genetic disease. It happens when Chromosome 15 has a genetic problem. The problem is caused by a defective HEXA gene. It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In 1800’s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5.\n\nInfants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay–Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the \"startle response\". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease.\n\nThe disease is named after Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs who first described the disease in the late 19th century. After the discovery, he noticed a red spot on the retina of a one year old child. The child was experiencing the same symptoms of the disease. Bernard Sachs was a neurologist from the United States. He was the first person to describe the cellular changes from the disease. In 1969, researchers discovered that Tay-Sachs is caused by a lack of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A. \n", "id": "184033", "title": "Tay-Sachs disease"}

Such cards are often used to store images or data in digital cameras. As of 2008, different capacities between 4 Megabytes and 32 gigabytes have been made. The card has a rectangular design, but one edge is \"chipped off\". This means that the cards cannot be inserted into the cameras (or other devices) the wrong way.\n\nThere are different kinds of cards:\n\n\nSD and SDHC are not compatible, but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards. The interface of SDHC and SDXC cards is the same, but SDXC uses a different file system. Some devices (for example the Wii) that originally shipped only with support for SD can be made to support SDHC with a firmware update.\n\nThere are also different \"classes\". These refer to the read and write speeds. Currently in use are \"Class 2\" - which means 2 MBytes/second, \"Class 4\" - 4 MB/sec and \"Class 6\" at 6 MB/sec. The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions.\n\nStill another measurement is called \"rating\". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x.\n\nmicroSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller. \n", "id": "184308", "title": "Secure Digital card"}

It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN, telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. This phone call is analogue. With ISDN, this view changes. As the signal is now digital ISDN can be used to offer a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes.\n\nISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels carry the actual service data. The two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax through one channel , while doing a phone call over the other channel, for example. If the main focus is on a high quality voice connection, the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically. \n\nFor larger companies it is possible to extend the number of data channels to 30 with still one signalling channel.\n", "id": "184361", "title": "Integrated Services Digital Network"}

He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism. \n\nSome of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings \"Lunch on the Grass\" and \"Olympia\" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called \"Impressionism\".\n\nÉdouard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre. \n\nWhile he was a student he visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Velázquez and Goya. \n\nIn 1856, Manet opened his own studio. One of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red\n\nIn 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings.\n\nEvery year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the \"Salon de Paris\". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called \"Lunch on the Grass\" (\"Le déjeuner sur l'herbe\"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). \n\nAt this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the \"Salon des Refuses\" which showed all the pictures that had been \"refused\". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new \"movement\" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. \n\nIn 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called \"Impressionists\" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are \"figurative\" (they are pictures of people). \n\nManet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad. \n\nManet died of syphilis in Paris.\n", "id": "184370", "title": "Édouard Manet"}

It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Oman, Yemen and Ethiopia.\n\nKhat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m. \n\nKhat is used as a stimulant in Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia, the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee. \n\nThere are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. \nIt is illegal to use in many countries.\n\nMany farmers in Yemen now produce Khat, instead of other crops, because they get more money for it.\n\nKhat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources go towards it. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. Water use in producing khat is so high that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea. \n\nKhat is a major cash crop in Yemen and the price brings in a high income for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares.\n", "id": "184372", "title": "Khat"}

The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, though they are common in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass. \n\nMost bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year. They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a \"pile\".\n\nMost of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a \"queen\", and there are \"workers\" and \"drones\". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies. \n\nBumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual Müllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps.\nFertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera. \n\nOnly fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. Queens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. \n\nThus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens and males leave the colony when they are mature; they mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle.\n\nAbout ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives.\n\nAll bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened. \n\nThey have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone.\n\nThe BBC has made a number of field reports for its regular Naturewatch and Spring watch programs.

It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association.\n\nThe HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\n\nMany of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland.\n\nThe league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate.\n\nIn 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009–10 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected.\nOn February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club.\n\nResults from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997–98 season.\n\nThe Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous.\n\n\nThe HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs.

He is conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Philharmonia Orchestra in London. He and his family live in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSalonen was born in Helsinki, Finland. He studied at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, learning the French horn, composition and conducting. Later he studied composition with several composers including Einojuhani Rautavaara. \n\nHe started conducting in 1979 with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, mainly in order to conduct his own compositions. In 1983 he was asked at short notice to conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra when Michael Tilson-Thomas was ill. This concert made him well known as a conductor. \n\nSalonen was principal conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1984-1995. \n\nHe first conducted in the United States in 1984 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In 1989 he became Principal Guest Conductor of the orchestra and soon became Music Director. He has had this title ever since.\nIn 1992 he took the orchestra to the Salzburg Festival where they gave concert performances and well as playing in the opera house for the opera \"Saint-François d'Assise\" by Olivier Messiaen. They toured throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia, and performed at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland, the BBC Proms in London, in Cologne for a festival of Salonen's own compositions, and in 1996 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris for a Stravinsky festival conducted by Salonen and Pierre Boulez. The orchestra sounded very good in the Paris concert hall, and it made people realize that they needed a better concert hall in Los Angeles. Soon the Walt Disney Concert Hall was built there.\n\nIn 2008 Salonen became the main conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra. He will leave his job with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 2009. He wants to have more time to compose.\n\nSalonen married Jane Price who used to play with the Philharmonia Orchestra. They have three children.\n\n", "id": "184691", "title": "Esa-Pekka Salonen"}

Lifting the receiver, or pushing a button will make the call. Very often emergency telephones will also tell the other side where they are. This is because people may not know where they are or they may be in shock because of an accident that just happened.\n\nThere are many special rules that apply to emergency telephones. They need to be in special colors, because color-blind people may not be able to tell the difference between certain colors. They also need to be easy to use.

He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius. \n\nHe often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.\n\nBeecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham’s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician. \n\nThomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hallé Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success.\n\nIn 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers such as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes when they first came to England.\n\nDuring World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people the chance to hear music they had never heard before.\n\nFor several years he had money problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner’s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia.\n\nIn 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth.\n\nBeecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England.\n\nHe was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvořák. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published.\n\nThere are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.\n\nA lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because “they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them”.\n\nBeecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: “My God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!”\n\nBeecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: “The same again, gentlemen, please”.\n\nBeecham once met a lady he knew, but could not remember who she was. He asked her whether she was well.\n\n", "id": "185050", "title": "Thomas Beecham"}

He was crowned emperor in 1908 at the age of three. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs. \n\nAt the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. Although he was forced to give up all political power, he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City, but in turn he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and he was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City. \n\nIn the year 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses. \n\nAfter Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to keep the treasury from getting robbed anymore. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning up the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft, and he also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace. \n\nIn 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British Embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese Embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him over to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria n 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, though, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. \n\nAfter the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China, and for the next ten years, the former emperor was thrown in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards declared that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing, where he would spend the rest of his life as a common citizen. He would work as a gardener and then an editor, in which he would earn 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home. \n", "id": "185063", "title": "Puyi"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185094", "text": "Endocrinology\n\nEndocrinology studies the working of the endocrine system and hormones. \n\nIt is the science of the endocrine system and hormones in a wide range of animals. Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in. \n\nThe endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.\n\nHormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology.\n\nMedical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone.\n\nAn endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:\nThese are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.\n\nAn endocrinologist can find out if a person has one of these diseases by doing tests. They can test a person's blood to find out if they have too much or too little of a hormone. An example of this is Type 1 diabetes. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not have enough of a hormone called insulin. Endocrinologists usually do not treat patients directly, but give advice to physicians about what how patients might be helped.\n\nEndocrine disorders fall into three groups: \n\nMost medical applications concern the lack of balance between hormones, and sometimes the complete lack of a necessary hormone. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone.\n\nEndocrinologists can advise on hormone treatment for transgender persons. A transgender person might want their body to look different so that they look more like their chosen gender. For example, a transgender woman might want less facial hair so that she looks less like a man to other people. \n", "id": "185094", "title": "Endocrinology"}

The series ran from 1986 to 1991, and was produced by Camme Animation Studios, DiC Entertainment and Coca-Cola Telecommunications. \"The Real\" was added to the title over a dispute with Filmation and its Ghost Busters properties. The series continues the adventures of paranormal investigators Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore, Dr. Ray Stantz, their secretary Janine Melnitz and their mascot ghost Slimer.\n\n\nThe show originally aired on ABC for its full run, except for the third season which ran on syndication at the same time as the second season ran on ABC. Later, reruns of the show appeared on USA Network, Fox Family before moving to Nickelodeon from 1996 to 1999 and on Cartoon Network in 2002. Teletoon aired episodes of the series in the month of October beginning in 1998, but has not done so in recent years.\nAt the start of the third season in 1988, with the series renaming, it was given an hour long time slot. In addition to the regular thirty-minute \"Real Ghostbusters\" episode, a half-hour \"Slimer\" sub-series was added that included 2-3 short animated segments focusing on the character Slimer. At the end of its six season run, 147 episodes had aired, including the syndicated episodes and 13 episodes of \"Slimer\", with multiple episodes airing out of production order. The segments added several characters as friends of Slimer, including the character Professor Norman Dweeb—mad scientist accompanied by a poodle named Elizabeth who wanted to capture Slimer to experiment on him. The Professor Dweeb also made infrequent appearances in the main series. One of the ghosts from the \"Slimer\" cartoons, the Sleaze, also reappeared in \"The Real Ghostbusters\" to be captured a second time.\n\nIn 1997, a sequel cartoon entitled \"Extreme Ghostbusters\", was created by Columbia TriStar Television and Adelaide Productions. It premiered on September 1, 1997 and ran for forty episodes until its conclusion on December 8, 1997.

Only Egon remains in the firehouse, along with Slimer, to care for the containment system and teaching classes at a local university. When supernatural events begin occurring in New York, Egon recruits four of his university students as a new team of Ghostbusters, and Janine, also one of Egon's students, returns to manage the office.

He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public.\n\nSargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham.\n\nAfter conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition \"Impressions on a Windy Day\" with Henry Wood’s Queen’s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children’s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death.\n\nIn 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera \"Louise\" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's \"Troilus and Cressida\".\n\nAs an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure “job for life” but should give their “lifeblood with every bar they played”. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this.\n\nHe was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hallé Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 7\" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's \"Dream of Gerontius\" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen’s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb.\n\nIn 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music.\n\nSargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.\n\nSargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music.\n\nDuring his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras.\n\nWhen the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again.\n\nBy the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone’s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later.\n\nSargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was “Flash Harry” because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as “Britain’s ambassador of music”, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders\n\n", "id": "185193", "title": "Malcolm Sargent"}

His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be \"English in anyway\". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a \"foreign guy that lives in Camden\". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called \"Dappy hats\". He normally turns up one side of the hat.\n\nDino was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was \"rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights\". Dino showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard \"Fazer\" Rawson and Tula \"Tulisa\" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the \"Lickle Rinsers Crew\". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the \"inspiration behind the band\". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote \"Papa (Can You Hear Me?)\" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dino later had the words \"RIP Dad\" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as \"B\" or \"Uncle B\".\n\nHe is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).\n\nN-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it \"was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear.\"\n\nIn 2007 Dappy released \"Love For My Slum\" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a \"rich kid\" who is trying to look like a gangster. \"The Independent\" wrote \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement...\", they then went on to put \"Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?\". Other newspapers put that he was \"idolising thuggery\". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said \"these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got\".\n\nIn December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay £50 to the girl and her friend, and £300 costs.\n\nOn 29 January 2009, Contostavlos was arrested after he someone said he was saying he would kill someone while he had a gun. He said this is not true. The police searched his Camden home looking for a gun. Three days later (Saturday 31 January) he was taken off a British Airways flight from Edinburgh to London by police after it landed, with fellow N-Dubz performer Fazer, after appearing to be acting disorderly. A source said: \"They were swearing at kids on the plane, being foul and threatening passengers. Cabin crew called ahead to the police, who were waiting when the plane landed. They were taken away by armed officers.\"\n\nDappy has also had many problems in the media with celebrities such as Alexandra Burke, Elly Jackson of La Roux, and Flo Rida. \n\nHis 2008 drunkenness has caused problems in January 2010 when he applied for a visa to the United States. He has since been allowed a visa.\n\nDappy hit a man in Chelmsford in February 2014, for which in June 2014 he was convicted of common assault and fined.\n", "id": "185229", "title": "Dino Contostavlos"}

The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines.\n\nSchools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.\n\nPower Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider.\n\nPower Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies.

It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. Vancouver, Washington, includes the old Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington state.\n\nThe Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area \"land of the mud turtles\" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver.\n\nAmericans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway.\n\nColumbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon.\n\nVancouver is located at 45°38′1″ North, 122°36′11″ West (45.633743, −122.603011). \n\nVancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185435", "text": "Radiant heating\n\nRadiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas. \n\nThe Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them. \n\nIn Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means \"warm stone,\" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems.\n\nThe most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems. \n\nHot air systems use hot air to heat the floor, similar to the Romans' systems. However, air does not hold heat very well, and these systems aren't recommended for residential use. \n\nHot water systems are the most popular and cost-effective systems for cold climates. In this type of system, water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor. Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, which can then be used in the underfloor heating system. \n\nHot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building. However, this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor, which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall.\n\nElectric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor. Electricity is then used to heat the cables, and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system. However, these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity, especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy. The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non-peak hours, such as late at night, and is left turned off during the day. Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions.\n\nUnderfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems. Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them. Concrete floors hold heat very well, but can take a long time to absorb the heat. Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor, but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too. However, dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks. \n\nAny kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating, but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well. Materials like wood, carpet, or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used.\n\nWall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling. Like underfloor radiant heating, these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity. However, panels heated by hot water often leak, so electric panels are the most common. These panels can't heat as much area as an underfloor system, but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room. Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms.\n\nUsing radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside. Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices, and usually portable, although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio.\n\n", "id": "185435", "title": "Radiant heating"}

It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, and the KDE.\n\nVoters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst).\n\nNext, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted.\n\nMore calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength \"t\" if \"t\" voters prefer A to B, \"t\" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and \"t\" voters prefer J to K.

The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court.\n\nThe overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices.

When \"binary\" and \"form\" join together, you will get a basic definition of \"An outline in two parts\". A musical piece in binary form is a musical piece with two sections.\nBinary form was popular in the Baroque period and often used to structure movements from sonatas for keyboard instruments. \n\nGenerally, a piece in binary form will compose of two parts, which are roughly the same in duration and tones. There are only a few differences between the first part(A) and the second part (B). The second section is longer than the first section and both often repeat.\n\nBinary form was most commonly used in the Baroque era for short dances called minuets. The minuet's two parts are usually labeled as \"A\" and \"B.\" In the A section of a minuet, the exposition is stated. This section almost always is repeated a couple times. The beginning part of the B section develops a slightly new musical idea, usually going to the dominant key, to add variation. Then it returns to the home key for the finish.

The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA.\n\nBubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.\n\nMost bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added.

Some Chinese legends people started binding women's feet during the Shang dynasty (1700–1027 BCE). However, writing says that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty (960–1279 CE). It lasted until the early 20th century, when it was banned by the People's Republic of China. \n\nFoot binding was a sign of social status. If a woman's feet were bound, it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work. However, foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status. By the 17th century, Chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound. \n\nSome people think that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure. Some people also see foot binding as insulting to women. But other people argue that this view is biased against the Chinese culture in favor of modern Western standards.\n\nFoot binding usually tried to make the feet about long, at most. Some drastic things were done at times to try to do this. Because of this, women who had their feet bound would usually be impaired, or damaged, for the rest of their lives. The physical consequences (or results) of foot binding stayed in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women in their 70s and 80s (according to a study published by the University of San Francisco}.\n\nWhen the Manchuria created the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote many laws banning foot binding. However, the laws did not work very well. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee (meeting of people) was held in Shanghai by a British priest. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the republican government kept trying to stop foot binding. They gave fines (orders to pay money) to women who still had their feet bound after 1915. During the early 20th century, western fashion was affecting China more and more. The People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding, although this was not very successful in actually ending the practice. According to Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women stopped making those shoes in 1998, in Harbin, China.\n\n\n", "id": "185867", "title": "Foot binding"}

Over his career, Young wrote 45 books, including novels and non-fiction for adult and youth audiences.\n\nBorn in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro, Manitoba, where his father, Percy Andrew Young, owned a drug store. His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg, but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler.\n\nYoung began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the Winnipeg Free Press and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow \"Rassy\" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940.\n\nUnable to get a raise at the \"Free Press\", Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Navy, where he served until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined \"Maclean's\" magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945.\n\nYoung began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Collier's\". He quit his job at \"Maclean's\" in 1948 to write short stories full-time.\n\nIn 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from \"Sports Illustrated.\" His first novel \"The Flood\" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining \"The Globe and Mail\" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962.\n\nHe was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.\n\nIn 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the \"Globe\"'s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the \"Toronto Telegram\", but the \"Globe\" wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the \"Globe\" and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the \"Telegram\", moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the \"Telegram\" until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the \"Globe and Mail\". Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow \"Globe\" writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the \"Globe\" over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe's autobiography, which would be published after Smythe's death in November 1980.\n\nIn 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, \"A Writer's Life\", was published in 1994.\n\nHe and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at the age of 87.\n\n", "id": "185919", "title": "Scott Young (writer)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185978", "text": "Waxing\n\nWaxing is a method of removing hair from the body. Waxing removes the whole hair including the root. Both men and women engage in waxing, as do female children as young as eight. Any area of the body can be waxed but the more common areas are the legs, underarms, genitals, torso and face. There are health concerns about waxing such as pain, inflammation, infection and physical damage to the skin. At least two women have been hospitalized due to bikini waxing. The waxing of young girls has been criticized and concerns over emotional problems have been raised by parents and by doctors and psychologists. Although it is known as \"waxing\" not all treatments of this kind use wax. Some waxing treatments use a sugar mixture in the same manner as wax. \n\nAny area of the body where hair grows can be waxed. The most commonly waxed areas are;\n\n\nWomen in Ancient Egypt removed unwanted hair with a sticky mixture of honey and oil. Women in the Middle East have used a sugaring mixture which is made up of a paste of warm sugar, lemon juice, and water. In 1922 Sears started selling razors to women and the ability for them to remove unwanted hair began. Pubic hair removal began during World War II when the US government ordered less material to be used in making women's bathing suits and the bikini was invented causing some women to have hair stick out the sides of the bikini bottom. In the 1960s waxing products became available.\n\nWaxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain. The pain increases in areas such as the genitals, especially for people who haven't waxed before or don't wax often. Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site. Waxing is itself a safe thing, but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed. When skin is sunburned it is not good to get a wax treatment. Allegic reactions can also happen with waxing. People with medical problems such as diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all. At least one woman, with diabetes, almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area. In 2007 the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns. There is also concern about the trend to remove all or most of the pubic hair from a person's genitals. Dr. Linda K. Franks, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says \"Pubic hair is there for a reason—to protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region, getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection.\" Waxing can pull small pieces of skin off the body. This is usually minor and is not usual. Skin infections can also occur such as staph, folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles). Ingrown hairs are also quite common and can become infected.\n\nYoung children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows, legs and genital waxing. Such genital waxing on young girls has been called \"virgin bikini\" waxes, and is aimed at either reducing the girl's need for pubic hair removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before. The increase demand for preteen waxing is being met by spas, with some 10,000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the United States of America alone. The International Spa Association has reported that 16% of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done. The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is illegal to survey them. \n\nBoth parents, and children say that young girls feel pressure from television shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that peer pressure, magazines, pop stars like Britney Spears and TV shows like Miley Cyrus' Hannah Montana increase children's demands to have spa treatments such as waxing, microdermabrasion and chemical peels. Such pressure has been reported to cause intense stress and emotional problems in young girls. The opinions of boys about girl's beauty is also a pressure to look their best with reports of boys rating girls on a scale of 1 to 10 at school.\n\nDr. Diane Levin, professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and co-author of the book \"So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids\" (a book critical of the sexualization of children), believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to “keep your bodies like little girls’ because that’s what men like.” This is backed up with surveys that show that 93% of men want women to, at least, remove some hair from their pubic area. Dr. Doris Pastor, a pediatrician, feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour. Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors. Dr. Janice Hillman, of the Penn Health System, a specialist in adolescent medicine, when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of development has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common.\n\nConcern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments, making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents, leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for beauty and so being made fun off by those who can afford them.\n\n", "id": "185978", "title": "Waxing"}

First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia. \n\nAccording to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi.\n\nMembers of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is \"Atiriri, wimwega?\" which means \"Hello, are you okay?\". The Kikuyu language is similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though tribalism is dying down, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride.\n\nFamous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)\n\nThe proper Kikuyu spelling of the greeting should be: \"Atiriri, wi Mwega\", meaning \"by the way, are you fine\".

The main ingredient is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word \"yaki\" means \"sautee\" or \"grill\" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet.\n\nIn Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This is a commandment of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly. \n\nThe first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called “Sukiyaki”, in the east it is called “Gyunabe”. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki’s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment. \n\nEach Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between \"Kansai\" (western Japan) and \"Kanto\" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on \"Gyunabe\" that was in fashion in \"Meiji\" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, \"sake\" and \"mirin\") together. They then stew beef in it.\n\nIn the \"Kansai\" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the\" Kansai\" style of cooking sukiyaki.\nThe border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear.\n", "id": "186011", "title": "Sukiyaki"}

After you pay, usually in coins, a computer-based screen and often a recorded voice will tell you when the picture will be taken, how many shots will be taken and when the photo is developed.\n\nAnatol Josepho invented the first self-automated photo booth in 1925. Photo booths began as black and white, film-based machines to fully coloured, digitalised machines.\n\nThere are many types of photo booths today that offer different sizes and kinds of photos such as passport photos and photos for identification. Also, some photo booths give you a number of tools you can use to create different features for your photos. Sticker photos are a good example. Sticker photos are instant photos printed on sticker-based material. After you take your picture, you can change backgrounds the tone or the color of the photo and insert letters and symbols. Invented in Japan, photo sticker booths are especially popular in Asian countries among teens and grown-ups alike.\n\nNowadays, the term \"photo booth\" also refers to Apple's photography program that features editing tool such as black-and-white, pencil and comic book.\n\n", "id": "186257", "title": "Photo booth"}

Barbirolli was particularly remembered as the conductor of the Hallé Orchestra, Manchester, which he conducted for nearly thirty years, turning it into a world famous orchestra. He was conductor of other great orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Houston Symphony, and also conducted orchestras including the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Vienna Philharmonic. He often played the music of English composers such as Edward Elgar and Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nBarbirolli was born into a musical family. His father and grandfather had come from Italy and moved to London. His mother was French. His father and uncle were violinists.\n\nBarbirolli won a scholarship to study at Trinity College of Music, and later studied at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1916 he joined the Queen’s Hall Orchestra where he was the youngest member. The next year he gave his first solo recital. He spent two years in the army where he got conducting experience with a voluntary orchestra. In 1919 he was again playing in orchestras and twice appeared as soloist with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra. \n\nBetween 1929 and 1933 he conducted opera at Covent Garden. From 1933 to 1936 he conducted the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1927 he took over a concert that Thomas Beecham would have conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra. He conducted other English orchestras including the Hallé Orchestra and was becoming very well known. He could learn music very quickly. In the 1930s he made many recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic, accompanying concertos with famous soloists such as Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein.\n\nIn 1937 Barbirolli was invited to take over from Arturo Toscanini as conductor of the New York Philharmonic. To follow such a great conductor was a very great honour. He conducted there for five years with great success, although there were some critics who supported Toscanini and were always criticizing Barbirolli. It was a difficult time for him as a new orchestra had just been formed in New York, the NBC Symphony Orchestra which was conducted by Toscanini and they paid their musicians more money. When he was invited, in 1942, to stay on with the New York Philharmonic he decided not to, partly because he would have to become a US citizen.\n\nThe Hallé Orchestra, based in Manchester, England, had been famous under the conductor Hamilton Harty. However, in recent years they had been sharing half their players with the BBC. This had saved the orchestra in the difficult years when the economy was bad and during the early war years, but the orchestra was not as good as it had been. Barbirolli was invited to become the conductor of the orchestra, so he moved back to England in 1943.\n\nThe first thing he had to do was to rebuild the orchestra. It had not had a permanent conductor since 1933 when Hamilton Harty left. Only four of the shared players with the BBC chose to join the Hallé in Manchester, so Barbirolli auditioned many musicians. The “new Hallé” made several recordings including symphonies by Arnold Bax and Vaughan Williams.\n\nBarbirolli conducted the orchestra for 25 years. In 1958 he became “conductor-in-chief”, so that he could share the work with others. In 1968 he was given the title “conductor laureate” for the rest of his life.\n\nAs well as his work with the Hallé he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and other London orchestras, and made many recordings. From 1961 to 1967 he was also principal conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra in Texas. He was also made guest conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nDuring his last years he had serious health problems His last two concerts were held in the St Nicholas Chapel, King's Lynn, as part of its 1970 Festival. Although he collapsed during the Friday afternoon, he managed to conduct Elgar's \"Symphony No 1\" and \"Sea Pictures\". The last piece he conducted was Beethoven's \"Symphony No 7\" on the Saturday before his death.\n\nBarbirolli is remembered for his great interpretations of Romantic music and of early 20th century English music. He was not interested in very modern music although he did conduct Benjamin Britten’s \"Violin Concerto\" and \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" in New York. He is remembered for his performances of Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Mahler, as well as Franz Schubert, Beethoven, Jean Sibelius, Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini. Vaughan Williams gave him the nickname “Glorious John”. He was a great supporter and friend of the great cellist Jacqueline du Pré.\n\nHe was knighted in 1949 and made a Companion of Honour in 1969.\n\nHis first marriage was to singer Marjorie Parry. His second marriage from 1939 to his death was to the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell who died at the age of 97 in January 2008.\n", "id": "186275", "title": "John Barbirolli"}

Readers have considered Sasuke as one of the highly popular character as can be shown on several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Sasuke has also been released, ranging widely from action figures to plush dolls and even to his ninja equipment. Sasuke has also appeared in Naruto related video games and OVAs.\n\nSasuke is a member of the Uchiha Clan, one of the strongest clans of the village of Konoha. When Sasuke was a little boy, he saw his older brother kill their parents. Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke’s older brother, told Sasuke that he had also killed all of the other clan members to see if he was a strong ninja but that he will save Sasuke’s life because it was not even worth killing. From then on, Sasuke lived a lonely life full of hatred and destined to walk a path of an “Avatar of Revenge” and kill his brother. However, these feelings seemed to be alleviated when he befriended Naruto Uzumaki after graduating Ninja Academy. As they were working together in a team as “Genin\" (which means rookie ninja), Naruto showed him what friendship and companionship were.\n\nThis ended with Sasuke's encounter with his brother. After battling Itachi, Sasuke realized that he lacked both the strength and intelligence to kill him. Later Sasuke leaves Naruto and Konoha to go to Orochimaru, one of the main antagonists of the series, to learn advanced ninja techniques and to be trained as a stronger ninja. Through mastering “Level Two of the Cursed Seal,” a restricted ninja technique, Sasuke obtains extraordinary power, thanks to is former master. Eventually, Sasuke defeats and kills his older brother only to find out that the order to massacre the Uchiha Clan was made by the elders of Konoha because the clan was destroying the peace of the entire village. However, Itachi could not kill his little brother because he loved Sasuke too much. In order for Sasuke to become able to protect himself, Itachi told Sasuke to live a life of anger and revenge which would stimulate Sasuke’s progress and allow him to become a strong ninja. After hearing about his brother, Sasuke turns his anger toward Konoha and decides to destroy the village.\n\nNaruto is a weekly cartoon and has not ended even to this day.

Changdeokgung was built as the secondary palace next to Gyeongbokgung. The construction began by King Taejong, the Third King of the Joseon Dynasty, in 1405. Taking 7 years to complete, it was finished in the year 1412.\n\nIn the word Changdeokgung, Changdeok means 'Prospering Virtue', and gung means 'palace'. So the word Changdeokgung means 'the palace of prospering virtue'. Because of the meaning of the name of the palace, the kings of Joseon Dynasty chose mostly Changdeokgung to live in.\n\nThe palace had been the home of 14 kings of Joseon Dynasty until it was totally destroyed by the Japanese army in the year 1592. After the Japanese were driven back by the combined forces of Korea and China, Changdeokgung was rebuilt in 1612. After the reconstruction, the palace had suffered little damage and became the primary royal court of the Joseon Dynasty. This was because Gyeongbokgung was also destroyed by the Japanese but the Joseon Dynasty did not rebuild it for some reason and the Changdeokgung became the biggest palace in Korea.\n\nHowever, Changdeokgung had suffered some damage for 350 years after the reconstruction. As a result, a large scale restoration took palace from 1990 to 1999. This restoration shows how much the Korean people loved Changdeokgung. Apparently, the UNESCO saw its value as well. Seeing Changdeokgung as a vital global asset, UNESCO listed it as a World Cultural Heritage. The UNESCO said that Changdukgung 'was outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design'.\n\nChangdeokgung is in a park in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea.

While ballerinas try to be light on their feet, modern dancers use body weight to increase movement. \n\nAlso modern dancing does not require specific costumes. So modern dancers often dance barefoot and choose whatever they want to wear. Modern dancers try to show their innermost emotions through dancing, often trying to get closer to their inner-selves. This is why many modern dancers choose a subject that is close to their hearts and attempts to express the subject to the audience. \n\nModern Dance was developed in the 20th century, mainly in the United States and Germany.

The young men jump from the top of a 30 meter high tree to demonstrate their courage as an adult. They tied jungle vines around their ankles so that they would not hit the ground.\n\nModern bungee jumping began when four British men jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In 1987 A.J.Hackett became world famous when he jumped from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Later he set up the Kawarau Bridge in New Zealand, with a height of 47 meters, as a commercial bungee jumping area. People could pay money for the fun of jumping. The idea quickly spread around the world.\n\nBungee jumping has several dangers. The rope has to be the right size for your weight, or it may break. The safety harness has to fit properly or the force of the drop could cause a person's bones to break. The rope has to be the right length or a person could hit the ground before being stopped by the rope. \n\n", "id": "186429", "title": "Bungee jumping"}

It is one of the most important annual events in Japan. \"Osechi\" food is packed in colorful lacquer boxes called \"jubako\". Each dish and ingredient in \"osechi\" has a meaning, such as good health, fertility, good harvest, happiness, long life, and so on. The kind of \"osechi\" foods eaten in Japanese homes varies from area to area. It is a Japanese tradition to eat \"osechi\" dishes during the New Year's holidays which go from January 1 to January 3.\n\nOne year there was not much food. People did not have enough rice to cook in their rice cooker. Emperor Nintoku knew about this and it worried him a lot. He said that he would lower the taxes in years when people did not have enough rice for New Years Day. After that the taxes were lowered but the House of Emperor Nintoku became poor. Japanese people celebrated this custom on New Years Day. \"Osechi-ryori\" is a dish that is cooked before New Year's Eve to eat on New Years Day.\n\nOn New Years Day, the God of the Year, named \"Toshigami\" comes to the world and the world starts a new year. The god came through a special gate, a \"Kadomatsu\", into our world. He is god of agriculture. In Japan when agriculture was the main activity of life, people welcomed \"Toshigami\" and hoped for a rich harvest. A special decoration, a \"shimekazari\" was put up to welcome the god. Another decoration, a \"wakazari\", was put up to make sure that nothing would go wrong during the next year. \"Osechi\" is a meal to give to \"Toshigami\". In Japan people gave the first part of the crop to god. The rest of the celebration was a feast, called \"naorai\".\n\nThe beginning of \"osechi\" starts in the \"Yayoi\" period. This went from 1000 BC to 300 AD. People at that time were starting to grow rice. As part of a harvest festival, called \"Sekku\", people made food gifts to please the gods. \"Sekku\" foods are eaten to thank the gods for the blessing of nature, a good harvest and big catch. This is the beginning of \"osechi\". This idea came from China.\n\nIn the \"Heian\" period, from 710 to 1185, this event became more common in Japan as the influence of China became more important. There were five seasonal festival days or \"sekku\", January 7 (\"Jinjitsu\" or \"Nanakusa no sekku\"), March 3 (\"Joshi\" or \"Momo no sekku\"), 5 May (\"Tango\" or \"Shobu no sekku\"), 7 July (T\"anabata no sekku\") and 9 September (\"Choyo\" or \"Kiku no sekku\"). An offering table was set up for the gods. The foods offered to the gods were dry foods, not processed for people to eat. Modern \"osechi\" comes from the Edo period (1603—1867). These days many Japanese people buy their \"osechi\" in shops instead of making it at home.\n\nThere are many different \"osechi\" foods, and each has a special meaning. The shape, the color, and the name of each food has a meaning which might bring good luck, happiness or long life. One type of \"osechi\" is made from black soybean and herring roe. Black is a color which brings youth and long life. The name of the black soybean means that people can live a long life without sickness. Herring roe symbolizes the prosperity of descendants, because there is a lot of roe in each piece.\n\nChestnuts are rolled into an omelet mixed with fish paste and steamed fish paste Chestnut means a mass of gold and it represents the wish that people get ahead in business and become rich person. A rolled mixed with fish paste mean the culture and diligence because it is a symbol or a scroll from the meaning of dressing up. And red steamed fish paste means removing evil and white means a pure mind. Kelp is a symbol of congratulation and longevity and is auspicious food endowed happiness.\n", "id": "186470", "title": "Osechi"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186471", "text": "Enma\n\nEnma is the god of hell in the Buddhist religion. He is often called Yama. He is the god who judges whether the souls of people go to heaven or hell. \n\nEnma is the god of hell who judges right and wrong after a human dies and falls into hell. Enma gives many kinds of dreadful punishments. The word \"Enma\" comes from \"Yama\" in Sanskrit and Pali, a language for Buddhist writings in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. He is said to be a human ancestor in the \"Rigveda\" (an ancient Indian sacred book). He is a god of the Indian Veda myth and he is said to be the incarnation of the \"Jizo Bosatsu\", the stone statue which is the god of help in Japanese Buddhism. \n\nBelievers in Buddhism think Enma comes from the start of the world. He was linked with death at first. People thought he was king of paradise for the dead, the god who ruled people when they lived in heaven. People thought he tied up souls of the people with the rope that he held in the hand. He became a feared god. Then he was treated as just the god of death. Because he is also an incarnation of the god of help, it is said that he can come and go freely between heaven and hell.\n\nThe appearance of Enma usually frightening in nature. Enma is always shown wearing Chinese traditional clothes from the Sung era (AD 960–1279). Why he wears Chinese traditional clothes is unknown. Usually, his dress and face are both red. He has a square crown on his head and a mace in his right hand. His eyes are open wide and angry, and are slanted up awards. \n\nHowever in other countries and at different times in history, Enma is pictured differently. For example, in old pictures from India, Enma has a crown and is riding a water buffalo. He has a club and a big rope. Another Enma from ancient India has a flag and steps on water buffalo with one leg. Enma is well built, with thick arms and a very big chest.\n\nEnma was the first person in the world to die. He went to paradise, called \"Gokuraku Jyoudo\" (極楽浄土). He lived in paradise and his job was looking after the dead. People believed Enma was the god of paradise. Over time people became scared of Enma. His job was changed from looking after the dead to judging them. Enma used a club and a big rope to tie up the souls of dead people. He ruled the lower world and judged the dead. He decided if a dead person went to heaven or hell. He made his judgment on what they had done in their lives. People who had behaved well went to heaven. People who had behaved badly go to hell.\n\nThe stories about Enma are very mysterious. The most famous story is how Enma will pull someone’s tongue out if they did a bad thing. Japanese parents teach their children to be honest by using this story. Enma can also bring dead people back to life. \"Abe-no-seimei\", a famous person in Japanese history, died and was revived by Enma. He also can decide when life should end. This is the strangest story; an actor died and met Enma. The actor went to hell because he plays other people – it means \"lying\". He told Enma all about himself his life and Enma started to be interested in his acting. He said “I would like to see you act.” The actor agreed and said \"I need a costume, so please give me yours.\" Enma gave it to him and the actor played as Enma, saying \"Ogres! Ogres! Take this bad man away!\" Enma was taken away and punished. The actor became a new Enma instead of the real Enma.\n\nThere are a number of books and movies about Enma in Japan and even in other countries. Enma has been written about by many Japanese novelists. \"The First Love of Enma, Bungeisya\", by Hideo Watanabe, is about escaping from hell and falling in love with a beautiful dead woman along the way. Another side of Enma is shown in \"Enma’s sword, Syodensya and Hiraiwa\" by Koshihiro Igawa and \"The Worship of Enma\" by Yumie. Enma is not fearful or strong at all. In comic books, like \"Dragon Ball Z\", Enma is shown as kind and calm. Enma in \"Ojarumaru\" is funny. In the American movie called \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1943), a dead man talked with Enma about his whole life before his death. This Enma is not kind but strict. This movie was nominated for best picture. Some writers write about his power and the fear he causes and others write about his opposite side, kind, and calm.\n\nEnma. Yahoo encyclopedia.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186473", "text": "Futon\n\nFutons are traditional Japanese bedding. A futon is a padded mattress, called a \"shikibuton\", a quilt, called a \"kakebuton\", and a pillow filled with beans, called a \"makura\". The futon was put on the floor at night for sleeping. They could be easily rolled up during the day when they were not needed. The word \"futon\" has come to mean a lot more than this. Although many Japanese people sleep in a bed, they say \"I sleep on futon\"; it means to go to bed. Futon now means things that Japanese people sleep on, including beds.\n\nMany companies make futons, and there are many kinds of futons. Futons are made from chemical fibers like polyester, natural fibers like cotton, feather, down and wool. Japanese quilts usually contain feathers and Japanese mattress usually contain wool.\n\nThe Japanese quilt can keep in heat and moisture, depending on what it is made from. Usually, a futon that includes over 50% hemp or cotton is called a \"Menfuton\". This is popular all over the world. Futons made from down are called quilt down. This retains heat, so this is a high-class futon. Futons made from feathers are called comforters. This is cheap and is common around the world. Futons made from chemical fibers are called chemical fiber futons. This is cheap so this is popular. Futons made from wool are called \"Yomo futon\". These are warm.\n\nIn winter, people generally use \"Hadafuton\" like a blanket to keep warm. In summer, people generally use \"Towelket\" like a big towel or Seer quilt which are cooler.\n\nFutons are generally used with a futon cover, because these make it easy to keep the futon clean. People generally use futons so they can sleep comfortably, stay warm and support their bodies while asleep. People usually sweat during sleep, so futons absorb sweat and collect moisture. Futons have to be hung out in sunlight to keep them dry, this is called \"futon-hoshi\". If this is not done, ticks and mold could grow on the futon and it will become dirty and insanitary. Futons need to be looked after properly.\n\nIn the 13th century, most people slept on straw mats, but the nobles slept on \"tatami\". These were not as soft as futons are now. It was said that they were hard and uncomfortable. For a very long time, people covered themselves with their clothes to keep warm. Most people slept nude. Rich people never did such things.\n\nIn the 17th century, bedclothes were made. People made it by stuffing cloth with cotton and wool. These bedclothes are the original form of the futon.\n\nIn the 18th century, futon production started because there was more domestic cotton available. At that time, futons were too expensive to buy for average people. They could cost 1,200,000 yen. Futons were important gifts and many men gave them to women in order to seduce them. Prostitutes were sometimes presented with futons by rich men. Prostitutes could be ranked by counting the futons; the higher ranks of prostitutes received more futons.\n\nIn those days, futon meant a mattress, not a quilt. Bedclothes were common. In the Kansai area, they used a square thing like a blanket, a \"fusuma\". The quilt is said to have evolved long before it.\n\nIn the 19th century, most people were able to buy futons. The import of the raw cotton began, and many factories were built. Because of industrial development, making futons was easier and more efficient than before. This made the price become down and people were able to afford them.\n\nThe manufacturer \"Nishikawa\" is the most famous. This company is in Kyoto and Tokyo. They make everything for the futons, for example, pillows, sheets, and quilts. This brand has history of 440 years.\n\nIn old days, people thought any futon was good as long as they could sleep. But now people want better futons. Today, people like a futon which they can relax on and recover from fatigue. Futon makers have developed futons that can adjust to the human body. This is called \"Seiatsu Futon\" in Japan. There is some advantages to this new type of futon. Since ventilation is good, they are cool in summer and warm in winter. Since it can adjust to ideal posture when you sleep, it improves blood circulation while sleeping. And they are easy to look after. Also a futon of \"low repulsion\" is popular among Japanese people. This is said to fit the body of the user. Some users who are troubled by bedbugs on futon like \"tick guard\" futons.\n\n", "id": "186473", "title": "Futon"}

She is most famous for performing the song \"Izlel je Delyo hajdutin\", which was sent to space on board the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes in 1977.\n\nValya Balkanska was born in a hamlet consisting of seven houses near the village of Arda in the Rhodope Mountains. Since her childhood years she has been singing Rhodopean folk songs, which she learned from her mother and grandmother, as well as at work-bee parties. In 1960 she became the main soloist of the \"Rhodopa\" State Ensemble for Folk Songs and Dances. She was only 18 years old at that time. Up to this day Balkanska has performed more than 300 folk songs, having been accompanied by the bagpipe player Petar Yanev for the last 14 years.\n\nThe most important moment in Balkanska's career came with the folk song \"Izlel je Delyo hajdutin\", which she recorded together with the bagpiper Dimitar Petkovski. In 1972 it became part of the Voyager Golden Record, a collection of songs, sounds and images from our planet, which also contains works of famous composers such as Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Stravinsky. NASA put copies of the record in the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" space probes and launched them on August 20, 1977. According to Carl Sagan, one of the creators of the Voyager Golden Record, only advanced alien civilizations would be able to play it. \n\nIn 2004 Balkanska released an album called \"Glas ot vechnostta (Voice from the Eternity)\", comprising some of her most popular songs such as \"A bre yunache ludo i mlado, Goro le goro zelena\", and \"Maychinko stara maychinko\".\n\nBalkanska received numerous awards throughout her career as a folk music singer. One of her favourite recognitions is a golden statuette from the Art Olympiad in Los Angeles in 1997. In 2002 the Bulgarian president honoured her with a \"Stara Planina\" medal, considered the highest national award. In the same year she also received the \"Golden Lyre\" award by the Union of Bulgarian Musicians and Dancers. Balkanska became an awardee of the \"Golden Phenomenon\" prize for helping the popularization of Bulgarian folk music and culture and for the same reason she was the first Bulgarian to be honoured by UNESCO as a \"citizen of the planet\".\nAccording to \"Time Magazine\" she is one of the people symbolizing the future of Europe, stating that apart from being \"a legend in her own country, Valya Balkanska is very much a legend in space, too\". Since December 2005 she has her own star plate on the Bulgarian Walk of Fame. In 2005 Balkanska was also one of the nominees for the \"St. Paisiy Hilendarski\" national award for notable artists and performers. In May 2009 the Bulgarian Association of Regional Media chose her as \"The Most Exceptional Bulgarian Woman\". \n\nIn 2008 \"Standard\", a Bulgarian daily newspaper, conducted a survey on what Bulgarians consider as their most important symbol of national pride. Nearly 22 thousand readers of \"Standard\"'s online edition from more than 10 countries around the world took part in the poll. Among the 23 possible choices, Valya Balkanska came in first with 9.46% of the votes.

The biggest changes were made to comply with rules made by the International Monetary Fund. These changes were made during South Korea's foreign currency crisis in 1998. They were commentated to support corporate restructuring and improving accountability and transparency of management through efficient monitoring.\n\nThe concept of directors' fiduciary duty of loyalty was introduced into the statute in the Commercial Act and was imposed as a statutory obligation of directors of stock companies. The Commercial Act also newly included the concept of \"de facto\" directors liable for damages under certain circumstances. This enabled the Commercial Act to enhance managerial accountability by holding \"owners\", who do not hold any official corporate directorship, liable for mis-management and misconduct.

His international following has continued after his death. Rajneesh was born Chandra Mohan Jain; he was known as the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh during the 1970s and 1980s, and finally as Osho in the last year of his life.\n\nHe was born in a small village in the Narsinghpur District of Madhya Pradesh state in north India. He spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandparents, which he later mentioned as \"the blessing in his life\" for its carefree environment.\n\nHe entered college at his age of nineteen. Asked by the principal to leave the college, he transferred to D.N. Jain College and completed his B.A. in philosophy in 1955. After obtaining his M.A. in philosophy in University of Sagar in 1957, he started teaching at Raipur Sanskrit College and became a professor at Jabalpur University in 1960. While teaching at colleges, he became known as a public speaker.\n\nAs a professor of philosophy, he traveled throughout India in the 1960s as a public speaker. He was a critic of socialism, Mahatma Gandhi, and other stalwarts of Indian politics, including institutionalised religions. He advocated a more open attitude towards sexuality: so the press called him a \"sex guru\". In 1970, he settled for a time in Bombay initiating disciples, known as neo-sannyasins, and expanded his spiritual teaching and work. In his discourses, he reinterpreted writings of religious traditions, mystics, and philosophers from around the world. Moving to Poona in 1974, he established an ashram that attracted increasing numbers of Westerners.\n\nThe Poona ashram was by all accounts an exciting and intense place to be, with an emotionally charged, madhouse-carnival atmosphere. The day began at 6:00 a.m. with Dynamic Meditation. From 8:00 a.m., Rajneesh gave a 60- to 90-minute spontaneous lecture in the ashram's \"Buddha Hall\" auditorium, commenting on religious writings or answering questions from visitors and disciples. Until 1981, lecture series held in Hindi alternated with series held in English. During the day, various meditations and therapies took place, whose intensity was ascribed to the spiritual energy of Rajneesh's \"buddhafield\". In evening \"darshans\", Osho conversed with individual disciples or visitors and initiated disciples (\"gave sannyas\").\n\nThe ashram offered therapies derived from the Human Potential Movement to its Western audience and made news in India and abroad, chiefly because of its permissive climate and Osho's provocative lectures. By the end of the 1970s, there were mounting tensions with the Indian government and the surrounding society.\n\nA situation rose when Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence on 10 April 1981. He occupied himself with \"satsangs\"—silent sitting with music and readings from spiritual works, and gave no discourses. Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh's secretary.\n\nLater in 1981 Rajneesh moved to the United States, and his followers established a community, later known as Rajneeshpuram, in the state of Oregon. Within a year, the leadership of the commune became embroiled in a conflict with local residents, primarily over land use, which was marked by hostility on both sides. Rajneesh lived in a trailer next to a covered swimming pool and other amenities. He did not lecture and only saw most of the residents when, daily, he would slowly drive past them as they stood by the road. He gained public notoriety for the many Rolls-Royces bought for his use, eventually numbering 93 vehicles. This made him the largest single owner of the cars in the world.\n\nMa Anand Sheela (born Sheela Ambatal Patel, 28 December 1949) was Rajneesh's personal secretary from 1981 to 1985. On 10 July 1981, she purchased the Big Muddy Ranch to create the Rajneeshpuram, Oregon commune. She was the main manager and spokesperson. She carried a .357 Magnum handgun, and created a Rajneeshpuram police force armed with Uzi submachine guns and a Jeep-mounted .30-calibre machinegun. It was under Sheela's influence that Rajneesh decided to travel to the United States and begin an ashram there.\n\nWhile at Rajneeshpuram, Rajneesh depended on Sheela to manage the organisation. She was seen as Rajneesh's principal aide, and as second-in-command of the organisation. She was also president of Rajneesh Foundation International. The two of them met each day in private to go over significant matters for the group.\n\nSheela ran the operations of virtually all of the sub-groups under Rajneesh's movement, as well as Rajneeshpuram itself. Rancho Rajneesh was administered through the inner circle of followers managed by Sheela. She made decisions for the organisation in meetings with followers in her own private living space. In addition, Sheela would make decisions for the organisation by herself or after meeting with Rajneesh. Those followers of Rajneesh that did not abide by her rulings risked being kicked out of Rajneeshpuram. According to \"Bioterrorism and Biocrimes\", \"This peculiar decision-making style had a significant impact on the group's move to employ biological agents\".\n\nThe Oregon commune collapsed in 1985 when Rajneesh revealed that the commune leadership had committed a number of serious crimes, including a 1984 bioterror attack (food contamination) on the citizens of The Dalles, Oregon. He was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with immigration violations, and was deported from the United States in accordance with a plea bargain.\n\nMa Anand Sheela was sentenced to three concurrent 20-year prison sentences, for assault, attempted murder, telephone tapping, immigration fraud and product tampering. She served 29 months before being released on parole. Upon release, she left immediately for Switzerland, where she now manages two nursing homes.\n\nTwenty-one countries denied him entry, causing Osho to travel the world before returning to Poona, where he died in 1990. His ashram is today known as the Osho International Meditation Resort. His teachings emphasised the importance of meditation, awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity and humour—qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition and socialisation. Osho's teachings have had an impact on Western New Age thought, and their popularity has increased since his death.\n\nOne of his strong hopes was creating what he called \"new man\", who embodies characteristics of Gautama Buddha and Zorba the Greek at the same time. Through this concept, Rajneesh tried to reject neither science nor spirituality, but embrace them both. According to him, “New man” is not subject to one’s sex and does not belong to institutions such as family, political ideologies, or religions.\n\nMany books of his teachings were published. They followed a pattern: he would give talks, they would be recorded. The tapes would be worked up into a typed manuscript by some of his followers. The manuscripts would be published, at first in India, and without ISBN numbers, so they were at first bought by his admirers. Later some of the best were reprinted in the West. His talks covered a wide range of religions and philosophies. The total number of books is not known, but it was certainly more than 30.\n\n\nlisted without dates:\n\n\n", "id": "186543", "title": "Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh"}

They once lived in the area of Rhineland and France and after the crusades they moved to Poland, Lithuania and Russia. In the 17th century, avoiding persecution, many Jews moved to and settled in Western Europe. \n\nScientists believe that Ashkenazi Jews originally came from the Land of Israel and initially went to Italy, France, and Germany. Later, during pogroms in the middle ages, mainly in Germany, they fled to Poland and Lithuania, and from there they spread over the rest of Eastern Europe. They then adopted the Yiddish language. \nAfter that, two terms, Ashkenazi and Sephardi, became commonly used: The former indicates the Jews who worshiped in the German way and spoke Yiddish, the latter indicates the Jews who worshiped in the Spanish way and spoke the Ladino language. They differ in language (pronunciation), cultural tradition and worship style.\n\nDuring World War II, about 6 million Jews, 5 million of whom were Ashkenazi, were killed in the Holocaust. The Holocaust destroyed or greatly reduced the large Jewish communities and the Yiddish language in Europe. Many of the surviving Ashkenazi Jews emigrated to countries such as Israel, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and the United States after the war.\n\nToday Ashkenazim are 80% of Jews of the world.

It may be used as a method of abortion when a woman is in her second trimester (between 12–32 weeks pregnant). This procedure also may be used after a woman has a miscarriage, to make sure that the uterus is emptied out completely. If tissue is left behind in a woman's uterus after a miscarriage, she can get an infection.\n\nA dilation and evacuation involves two major steps. First, the cervix (the bottom part of the uterus) is dilated, or made bigger. This is often done about a day before the actual procedure. To dilate the cervix, a doctor may put special tools into the cervix. The cervix needs to be made larger so that medical tools, like forceps (surgical tongs) or a curette (a tool that is used to scrape away the lining of the uterus) can be put into the cervix.\n\nThe second step of the D&E procedure is to evacuate, or remove, everything inside of the uterus. The woman is given a local anesthetic to numb part of her body or a general anesthetic to put her to sleep. The doctor will then put a cannula (a medical tube) into the uterus, through the vagina. The cannula is attached to a bottle and a pump that create a vacuum. The cannula is used to vacuum (or suction) out everything that is in the uterus, including the fetus. The doctor may use forceps to take out any tissue that is still in the uterus. The doctor may also use a curette to scrape out the lining of the uterus. The vacuum can then be used again to make sure that the uterus is completely empty. This is to prevent infection from tissue left behind by accident.\n\nIf a woman is earlier on in her pregnancy, this procedure can sometimes be done without dilating the cervix first. This is called a \"vacuum aspiration\". It can be used for women who are in the first trimester (the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) or for women who are in the early stages of the second trimester. However, sometime during the second trimester, it becomes very difficult to do this procedure without dilating the cervix first. At this point, a full dilation and extraction is needed.\n\nA complete D&E usually takes 10 to 20 minutes. Often, women are able to go home on the same day as the procedure, without staying overnight in a hospital.\n\nMost abortions are done much earlier on in the pregnancy, so a full dilation and extraction is usually not needed.\n\n", "id": "186551", "title": "Dilation and evacuation"}

It is the UK's oldest symphony orchestra and the fourth oldest in the world. Since 1996 its home is in the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester.\n\nThe orchestra gave its first concert on 30 January 1858. It had been started by Hallé the year before to play at an exhibition. The orchestra gave its concerts in the Free Trade Hall.\n\nOne of the most famous conductors the orchestra had was Hans Richter who was music director from 1899 to 1911. During this time the orchestra gave the first performance of \"Symphony No. 1\" by Sir Edward Elgar.\n\nThe orchestra suffered during the economic crisis of the 1930s and when World War II started. At that time it was sharing many of its players with the BBC. There were only 30 players left. A new conductor was appointed in 1943: John Barbirolli. He was the musical director for 27 years. During this time the orchestra rose to international fame. \n\nKent Nagano was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999. The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996. Nagano was criticized for putting on concerts that cost a lot of money, and charging high fees for himself. The orchestra started to be in financial problems and nearly went bankrupt. Then changes were made and the orchestra were more secure financially.\n\nIn September 2000, Mark Elder took over as musical director. He has made the orchestra into an excellent orchestra again.\n\nIn 2006 a new job of guest conductor was given to Cristian Mandeal. From 2009 the guest conductor will be Markus Stenz. The leader of the orchestra is Lyn Fletcher.\n\nThe Hallé also has a choir which was started in 1858 by Sir Charles Hallé. They give about twenty concerts a year. Their conductor is James Burton who also conducts the Hallé Youth Choir. There is a Hallé Youth Orchestra which is conducted by Ewa Strusinska. There is now also a Hallé Children’s Choir, conducted by Shirley Court. The Hallé also have their own CD label since 2008.\n\n\n", "id": "186675", "title": "The Hallé"}

It is distributed across northern Asia, from southern Siberia through Mongolia and northeastern China to northern North Korea.\nORIGIN\nThe Chinese Hamster originates in North-Eastern China. They were first domesticated around 1919, and were used originally as a laboratory animal. In the latter half of last century interest increased in the Chinese Hamster as a pet and show animal. It is, however, still not as common as other hamster species in pet shops.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Chinese Hamster looks very like a mouse without the long tail. They are long and slender, with a short prehensile tail, large dark eyes, and tulip shaped ears. It is part of a group of 6 species classified as “rat-like” hamsters. An adult Chinese Hamster is about 4 inches (10-12cm) long and weighs up to about 45-50g.\n\nCOLOURS\n\nThere are only two colours that are regularly seen in Chinese Hamsters, the Normal and the Dominant Spot. A third colour, Black-eyed White, occurs randomly and very rarely within litters with two Dominant Spot parents.\n\nThe Normal is the wild coloration and is a rich mahogany brown with black ticking on the upper two thirds of the body. From under the cheekbone in a straight line from the cheek to the tail, and under the stomach and legs the Normal is white with a grey undercoat. The Normal has a black stripe running from the forehead along the spine to the tail.\n\nThe Dominant Spot is a very attractive animal. The base colour is white with patches of the Normal colour scattered (ideally in an even pattern in a show animal) across the upper part of the body. There is often a concentration of brown colour along the spine.

The Red Queen said, \"It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" The Red Queen principle can be stated as follows:\n\nThe hypothesis is used to explain two different phenomena: the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals, and the constant evolutionary arms race between competing species.\n\nThe book takes Van Valen's idea, which is about co-evolution, and extends it into a discussion about sexual selection in humans. It argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven by sexual selection.\n\nSex is an evolutionary puzzle. In most sexual species, males make up half the population, yet they bear no offspring directly and generally contribute little to the survival of offspring. In birds and mammals that idea seems less true. They often help protect females, and help in some way after the young are born. Therefore these males definitely do help in the survival of their offspring. But sexual reproduction is very common in simpler forms of life, where the males have nothing to do with their offspring.\n\nIn human paleolithic populations, males were no doubt vital for hunting and protection. Many bird species rear the young jointly. However, most invertebrate species are not raised by parents at all, with larvae developing amongst the plankton. In addition, males and females in many vertebrate species spend resources to attract and compete for mates. Sexual selection may appear to favor traits that may reduce the fitness of an organism, such as brightly colored plumage in birds of paradise, which makes them more visible to predators. Thus, sexual reproduction appears to be highly inefficient. \n\nThe book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its costs, because a mixed heritage confers to each generation a defensive \"head start\" against parasites and disease. The basic reason for this is the way sexual reproduction increases the genetic variety in a population. This greatly increases the chance of at least some individuals surviving the onslaught of predators, parasites and diseases. This much is common ground amongst evolutionary theorists.\n\nRidley then argues that human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. He argues that human intelligence far outstrips any need for survival (this is not generally agreed). He says our intelligence is like the peacock's tail, a product of sexual selection. Human intelligence, he suggests, is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality. This view of intelligence is also supported by Geoffrey Miller. The history of ideas on sexual selection and the evolution of sex is discussed by Helena Cronin.\n", "id": "186697", "title": "The Red Queen"}

It decides matters like World Championships and changes in rules of the game.\n\nFIDE was founded on 20 July 1924 in Paris, France. However, it had little influence until the end of World War II. The reigning world champion at that time, Alexander Alekhine, did not want to have anything to do with it. He regarded the world title as his personal property. This only changed when he died with the title, in 1946 (no other champion has ever died while holding the title). It was obvious that some method was needed to find a new champion. FIDE stepped in and, with Russian backing, put forward a solution. The strong Soviet Chess Federation only joined FIDE in 1946. It had a great influence, with resources and many young strong players.\n\nIn 1948 a tournament was organized to determine which of the world top players was entitled to call himself World Champion. The death of Alekhine had left a vacuum. Two previous champions, Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca had died in the late 1930s. It was clear that a new champion would come from the younger players.\n\nThe six players chosen by FIDE were:\nIn the end, Reuben Fine dropped out, and the other five contested the event. Mikhail Botvinnik won the tournament and became the new world champion.\n\nIn 1950 the FIDE awarded its first IM (\"International Master\") and GM (\"International Grandmaster\") titles. However it was not until 1957 that FIDE formulated clear criteria to award these titles. In 1970 a new ranking system, the Elo-rating, was introduced.\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union FIDE lost a powerful partner. This resulted in a long period of trouble. In 1993 worldchampion Gary Kasparov and his challenger Nigel Short left FIDE. They founded their own organisation for professional top players, the PCA (\"Professional Chess Association\"). So now there were two worldchampions: one from FIDE and one from the PCA. \n\nIt was not until 2006 that the dust settled down and a re-unification match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov took place. In 1999 FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee.

The term was used for a long time to describe someone who was accepted as an expert player, but it now has an official meaning. \n\nGrandmaster is a chess title for even stronger players. The title comes from the word in Middle French: \"Grand maistre\". It was the title given to the head of an Order of Knights, such as the Knights Templar or the Teutonic Knights. Its first use in chess is a comment in the periodical \"Bell's Life\" (18 February 1838) referring to William Lewis as \"our past grandmaster\".\n\nFIDE titles were first awarded in 1950.<ref name=\"H/W\">Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-866164-9</ref> There are four levels of mastery. There are detailed rules as to the number of games played at a given level, and the full rules are quite lengthy. Some countries go with this system entirely, but others have their own system as well. \n\nOnce awarded a title, the player keeps it for life. \n\nIn order of merit, with official abbreviations, they are:\n\nThere are also women-only titles:\n\nIt can be seen that a woman grandmaster is a lower standard than an international master. The purpose of women-only titles is to encourage female players, because there are few female players in the game.\n\nA Grandmaster is the highest title that a player can get, except becoming a world champion. It is given by the world chess organisation, FIDE.\n\nMeeting the demands is not easy. To become a grandmaster, a player has to play at least 27 games with at least two grandmaster-results. In practice this means achieving at least three grandmaster-results or \"norms\". The tournament rating must be 2600 at least. Besides this, a player's own FIDE rating must be at least 2500. Men and woman can earn the GM-title by meeting the demands.\n\nA chessplayer who is already an IM (international master) will simply become grandmaster, but it is not necessary to get the IM title first.\n\nAs chess became more popular in the second half of the 19th century, the term began to be given out by organizations. For example, in Germany, there arose an annual sponsored tournament, the \"Hauptturnier\", the winners of which were awarded the title of \"Meister\". Emanuel Lasker, who later became World Champion, first earned a master title in one such tournament. The Soviet Union had a system of national candidate masters, masters and grandmasters before World War II, and its satellite countries in eastern Europe followed suit after the war. \nIn the United States, the title of \"National Master\" is awarded for life, regardless of whether his rating goes below 2200 later. In August 2002, the USCF (United States Chess Federation) decided that \"Any USCF member, who has had a normal post-tournament rating of 2200 or higher, has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and thought, and is automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master\".\n\n\n", "id": "186753", "title": "Chess master titles"}

Advanced performers sometimes wear sangmo, which are hats with long ribbons attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns by moving their heads.\n\nDrumming is the most important element of Pungmul. Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing janggu (hourglass drum), buk (barrel drum), and jing (gong). Wind instruments (t'aepyongso and nabal) are sometimes played along with the drummers. Following the drummers are dancers, who often play the sogo (a small drum that makes almost no sound) and tend to have more elaborate choreography.

Feelings, thoughts, desires or emotions appear to come out of nowhere, leaving the person to question where they came from.\n\nThe unconscious mind is a term coined by the 18th century German romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It is, however, an ancient idea which has been noticed in many civilisations and cultures. Also, whether other mammals have similar mental mechanisms to man is also a question with a considerable history.\n\nThe unconscious mind plays a large role in Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. He discussed the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behaviour. \n\nHowever, the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded, \"It is difficult—or perhaps impossible—to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance\". \n\nFreud's advance was not to uncover the unconscious but to devise a method for systematically studying it, but his method is controversial, and so are the rest of his ideas. Freud called dreams the \"royal road to the unconscious\". He developed his idea in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899). The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought; its contents could be accessed with a little effort. A key feature of the unconscious is what he called 'repression'. Freud believed that many people repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind.\n\nThe adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making. It is different from conscious processing: it is faster, effortless, more focused on the present, but less flexible.\n\nIn other theories of the mind, the unconscious is limited to \"low-level\" activity, such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously. In contrast, the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in \"high-level\" cognition such as goal-setting as well.\n\nThe term 'adaptive unconscious' suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past. Indeed, for much of vertebrate evolution, all mental activity was unconscious. No-one supposes that fish have consciousness. Thus our consciousness is added to an already-existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us.\n", "id": "186780", "title": "Unconscious mind"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186876", "text": "Feelin' So Good (DVD)\n\nFeelin' So Good is the first video album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was first released in the United States on DVD and VHS on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. Executively produced by Lopez alongside Cory Rooney and Benny Medina, \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. With a run time of one hour, it contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview segments of \"Feelin' So Good\" were conducted by Lopez's sister Lynda, who interviews not only Lopez, but also her mother, Medina and her future husband Marc Anthony.\n\n\"Feelin' So Good\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, although it was noted that it would be of no interest to those who were not fans of Lopez. It was additionally praised for showing Lopez's transition from her acting career to a music career. In the United States, \"Feelin' So Good\" was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the RIAA for shipments of 50,000 units.\n\nFrom a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in \"My Little Girl\" (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show \"Synchronicity\" in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program \"In Living Color\". She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career.\n\nAfter a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez received her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in \"Selena\", a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice is used for the musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip synching. When asked by an interview if \"Selena\" inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: \"I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album \"On the 6\".\n\nDuring production of the \"On the 6\", Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" Lopez's debut single \"If You Had My Love\" was serviced to radio in the United States on May 4, 1999. The song debuted at 72 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week of May 15, 1999, and entered the top ten two weeks later. A month after the single's release, it moved to number six, earning the \"Greatest Gainer\" title of the week, and reached the top spot on June 12, 1999. The song dethroned Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" as the number-one song in the country; this was the first time a Latin artist followed another Latin artist to the top of the chart since Gloria Estefan's \"Coming Out Of The Dark\" replaced Timmy T's \"One More Try\" in March 1991. Lopez also became the first artist to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with their debut single since Britney Spears did with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. \"If You Had My Love\" stayed atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for a period of a month, and remained in the top ten until September of 1999. \"If You Had My Love\" was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries.\n\n\"No Me Ames\", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony was released as a B-side to \"If You Had My Love\" and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The surprising success of both \"If You Had My Love\" and the album made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". Following the release of \"If You Had My Love\" and \"No Me Ames\", three additional singles were released. By the end of 1999, Lopez had successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.\n\n\"Rather than the usual collection\", \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. It contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as \"very slick and promotional\". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez \"comes through energetically\" and without \"much star-ego\". The video album provides very basic information about the singer's career, rather than going too much into detail. The release has been compared to the DVD releases of Mariah Carey. Cory Rooney and Lopez acted as album executive producers of the DVD, while Lopez acted as a video executive producer, alongside Benny Medina. Jeffrey Norskog acted as a video associate producer.\n\n\"Feelin' So Good\" opens with a intertitle that features a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for \"On the 6\", artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, \"Why Risk a Music Career?\", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, about the risks of starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the \"next natural step\" in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the \"ultimate\" triple threat – \"the actor, singer and dancer\". Lopez then confers, in the chapter \"Press Tours / Promotions\", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more \"personal\" as it is something that is \"closer to your heart\" and something she \"really believes in\". According to Lopez, by the end of the promotional tour for the album she \"lost\" her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of \"If You Had My Love\" at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown. In the fifth chapter, \"Beginning of the Year\", Lopez discusses her hectic schedule in the beginning of 1999; balancing film events and choosing the album's first single and shooting its music video. Lopez then goes into detail about the concept behind the music video of \"If You Had My Love\". Lopez's sister Lynda makes a formal introduction to the music video, as having a \"special place\" in her heart, and it is shown. Lopez then explains how her duet with Marc Anthony on \"No Me Ames\" came about and the concept of the video. Video footage is shown, as Lopez discusses her first ever live performance, with \"No Me Ames\", in April 1999 at Madison Square Garden alongside Marc Anthony. Following this, the official music video to \"No Me Ames\" is shown.\n\nIn the eleventh chapter of \"Feelin' So Good\", appropriately entitled \"First Number One Single\", Lopez reveals the moment when she found out that \"If You Had My Love\" went number one in the United States. She then went on to discuss the events that occoured during the release week of \"On the 6\" in \"Record Release Week\". Lopez then reveals how she came to record \"Let's Get Loud\" and her performance of the song at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is shown. In \"Jennifer's Energy\", Medina discusses Lopez's ability to work at late hours of the night. Her 1999 Billboard Music Awards performance of the Hex Hector remix of \"Waiting for Tonight\" is then shown. Lopez then speaks of filming the music video for \"Waiting for Tonight\" and behind the scenes footage on set of the video is shown. She also explains how the Hex Hector remix of the song came about and the alternative music video that was created for it. A megamix video of the original and Hex Hector remix follows. The twentieth chapter, \"Jennifer's Mom\", is an interview with Lopez's mother discussing what was like to see Lopez on television for the first time. Lopez then discusses her surprise to the amount of fans she had and their dedication in \"Fan Support\". In \"Working on Record\", the twenty-second chapter of \"Feelin' So Good\", Lopez discusses the process of writing and recording the album. Lopez's sister Lynda interviews her choreographer Tina Landon on what it is like to work with her, before her 1999 Blockbuster Awards performance of \"If You Had My Love\" is shown. Footage is then shown of Lopez \"goofing around\" during a photoshoot, before the music video to her song \"Baila\" is shown, for the very first time. In \"Film Energy vs. Music Energy\" Lopez compares the difference between the fans of her movies and of her music. In the final interview footage of \"Feelin' So Good\", Lopez explains the concept behind the music video of \"Feelin' So Good\" and why Big Pun and Fat Joe were chosen to be featured on the song. The music video is then shown and is faded out into the end credits.\n\nDigitally remastered with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, the DVD edition of \"Feelin' So Good\" contains interactive menus and instant chapter access to songs. It also contains song lyrics and a biography of Lopez in both English and Spanish, as well as an exclusive photo gallery. Additionally, the video albums contains the music videos to Lopez's songs: \"If You Had My Love\", \"Waiting for Tonight\", \"No Me Ames\", \"Feelin' So Good\" and \"Baila\". It also contains four live televised performances by Lopez in 1999. First is her Blockbuster Movie Awards performance of \"If You Had My Love\", followed by her VH1 Fashion Awards performance of the Darkchild remix of \"If You Had My Love\". Then, her performance at the Billboard Music Awards of the Hex Hector remix of \"Waiting for Tonight\" and lastly her Woman's World Cup Finale performance of \"Let's Get Loud\".\n\n\"Feelin' So Good\" was released on DVD and VHS formats in the United States on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony Corporation's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. It was then released in Canada the following week by CBS Video on DVD and VHS. In the United Kingdom, the video album received a DVD release on January 30, 2001 and a VHS release on April 30, 2001 by SMV Enterprises. \"Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good\" was released on DVD in Japan on June 20, 2001 by Sony Music Records, and on DVD and VHS in France on April 8, 2002 by Sony BMG. The Region 1 cover features a black and white photo of Lopez during the photoshoot of \"On the 6\", while the Region 2 edition features a golden hue image also taken during the photoshoot of \"On the 6\". \"Feelin' So Good\" and \"Let's Get Loud\" were released as a two disc DVD set in France on October 20, 2003. \"Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good\" was re-released on DVD in Japan on November 21, 2007.\n\n\"Feelin' So Good\" received generally favorable reviews from critics. Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD three out of five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will \"greatly enjoy this disc\", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: \"It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in \"The Cell\". I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although much has been made of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner\". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the \"Waiting for Tonight\" music video. He concluded by stating that: \"Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout.\"\n\n", "id": "186876", "title": "Feelin' So Good (DVD)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186880", "text": "Gravitational lensing\n\nGravitational lensing is caused by a massive body between a distant object and ourselves. It can create the appearance of two or more objects where there is really only one. The light from the object gets bent round the massive body in between.\n\nThe massive body, such as a galaxy or black hole, creates a very strong gravitational field in space. The exact nature of the effect depends on:\n\nAlbert Einstein predicted the possibility of gravitational lensing. The discovery that our Sun bends the light of distant objects when their light passes close to it was evidence that the general theory of relativity was correct.\n\nThere are three types of lensing:\n\nStrong lensing betrays itself by producing multiple images from the same object. A well-known example is \"Einstein's Cross\" (Q2237+0305) at a distance of 8 billion lightyears. Here, the gravitational lens produces four images from the same object (a quasar), although it is only one object. The light of the quasar does not travel in a straight line to earth. Instead, it is bent along the gravitational field of a galaxy in front of it. This galaxy is at a distance of 400 million lightyears.\n\nThe first discovery of this kind (except the Sun) happened in 1979. Two quasars were close to each other. They both had the same spectrum and proved to be two images of the same quasar (Q0957+651). In 1980 scientists found out which group of galaxies functioned as the lens.\n\nWeak lensing does not produce multiple images of the same object. Instead it produces a highly deformed or stretched image from an object far beyond the lens. In 1986 this was discovered in cluster Abell 370. Later it was understood that this was a greatly deformed image of a galaxy far beyond the cluster. \n\nThe object can appear larger or smaller, as is shown in the table. Weak lenses allow us to observe very distant galaxies, which we would be unable to observe without such lens. By bending the light, the amount of light (magnitude) from the source increases. This way a very distant and faint galaxy can become visible, while we normally would not be able to observe it.\n\nIn cases of microlensing, there is no distortion in shape. However, the amount of light visible from an object changes periodically. This can be used to detect exoplanets. Light from a distant star is bent and enhanced by the gravitational field of a closer star. The presence of an exo-planet rotating around that closer star bends the light of the star farther away periodically. Object OGLE-2005-BLG-390-Lb, discovered 25 January 2006, is the first exoplanet detected by using microlensing.\n", "id": "186880", "title": "Gravitational lensing"}

He is also known for starring in the movie \"Once\" and co-writing its Academy Award-winning song, \"Falling Slowly.\"\n\nHansard quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He formed The Frames in 1990, and they have been an important part of the Irish music scene ever since. Their first album, \"Another Love Song\", was released on Island Records in 1991, and their most recent, \"The Cost\", was released in 2006.\n\nHansard first came to international attention as guitar player Outspan Foster in the 1991 Alan Parker movie \"The Commitments\", after attending the New York movie Academy School of Acting. He has often stated that he regretted taking the role, because he felt it distracted from his music career.\n\nIn 2003, he presented the television programme \"\", which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ.\n\nOn 22 April 2006, he released his first album without The Frames, \"The swell season\", on Overcoat Recordings in collaboration with Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, Marja Tuhkanen from Finland on violin and viola, and Bertrand Galen from France on cello. Hansard also spent part of 2006 in front of the cameras for a music-infused Irish movie \"Once\", in which Hansard plays a Dublin busker, and Irglová an immigrant street vendor. The movie had its American premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 and received the Festival's World Cinema Audience Award. During the promotional tour, he and Irglová began dating. Said Hansard about his relationship with Irglova: \"I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid\". One of the songs they wrote together for the movie (\"Falling Slowly\") won an Oscar for Best Song in February 2008. Hansard became the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Hansard and Irglová also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" for the movie \"I'm Not There\" in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now \"good friends.\"\n\nAside from his projects with The Frames and Irglová, Hansard also appeared as part of the band on the 2006 Oxfam charity album, \"The Cake Sale\". In addition, Hansard has recorded a few cover songs, both alone and with band member Colm Mac Con Iomaire, for the Today FM discs \"Even Better than the Real Thing\". Songs that he has recorded include Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\" on \"Vol. 1\" and Britney Spears' \"Everytime\" on \"Vol. 2\".\n\nOutside music, he appeared on a \"Simpsons\" episode as a street musician in Ireland.\n\nHansard has remarked about his musical influences: \"In my house, when I was a kid, there was the holy trinity, which was Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan with Bob sitting center.\"\nHansard and The Frames toured as the support act for Bob Dylan in Australia and New Zealand in August 2007 and Hansard often performs Van Morrison's songs in concert. \"Into the Mystic\" and \"And the Healing Has Begun\" were included on the collector's edition of the soundtrack for the movie \"Once\".\n", "id": "186904", "title": "Glen Hansard"}

Her father was actor Richard Bennett, her mother, actress Adrienne Morrison, and her sisters, actress Constance Bennett and dancer, Barbara Bennett. Joan first acted onstage with her father at age 18 and by 19 had become a movie star courtesy of her roles in such movies as \"Bulldog Drummond\" (1929) and \"Disraeli\" (1929). She moved quickly from movie to movie throughout the 1930s, appearing with John Barrymore in his version of \"Moby Dick\" (1930) and playing Amy to Katharine Hepburn's Jo in \"Little Women\" (1933). Of the three Bennett sisters, Joan would achieve the greatest fame.\n\nContracted to 20th Century Fox, Joan Bennett appeared as a blonde ingenue in several movies including \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" in 1930 and \"Me and My Gal\" in 1932, before leaving this studio to appear in \"Little Women\" (1933). The latter movie brought Bennett to the attention of producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and eventually (in 1940) married her. \n\nWanger managed Bennett's career, and with director Tay Garnett convinced her to change her hair from blonde (her natural color) to brunette. With this change her screen persona evolved into that of a glamorous seductive, femme fatale and she began to attract attention in a series of highly acclaimed movie noirs by director Fritz Lang. During the search to find an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\", Bennett was tested and impressed producer David O. Selznick. She was briefly considered to be a front runner for this part but Selznick eventually turned his attention to Paulette Goddard, who was then rejected in favour of Vivien Leigh.\n\nIn the 1940s Bennett appeared in four movies directed by Fritz Lang with whom she and Wanger had formed their own movie company. Three of these movies, \"Man Hunt\" (1941), \"The Woman in the Window\" (1945), and \"Scarlet Street\" (1945) established her as a movie noir femme fatale and leading Hollywood actress. She also worked with noted directors Jean Renoir in \"The Woman on the Beach\" (1947) and Max Ophüls in \"The Reckless Moment\". Other highlights of the more mature phase of her career include the role of Spencer Tracy's wife and Elizabeth Taylor's mother in both \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and \"Father's Little Dividend\" (1951).\n\nIn 1950, Bennett changed agents. In 1951 Wanger shot and injured Bennett's new MCA agent, Jennings Lang (1915-1996), with whom she had allegedly begun an affair. The resulting scandal hurt her career much more than Wanger's, according to the double standards toward women of the time. Wanger's attorney, Jerry Giesler, mounted a \"temporary insanity\" defense and Wanger served a four-month sentence at the Castaic Honor Farm two hours' drive north of Los Angeles, quickly returning to his movie career to make a string of intelligent hit movies. Bennett, meanwhile was forced to flee to Chicago to appear in theater, and later in television because the scandal was too great a stain on her movie career and the movie studios were already floundering in the 1950s as it was. Though Humphrey Bogart, a longtime friend of Bennett's, pleaded with the studios on her behalf to keep her role in \"We're No Angels\" following the shooting scandal, that movie proved to be one of Bennett's last. Wanger and Bennett remained married until 1965. \n\nBennett continued to work steadily in theatre and television and was a cast member of the television series \"Dark Shadows\" for its entire five year run, from 1966 until 1971, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for her performance therein. Bennett also appeared in a few more movies, most notably the cult horror thriller from Italian director Dario Argento's \"Suspiria\". In the last decades of her life, she was married to David Wilde, a Yale graduate and movie critic. Bennett died from a heart attack in Scarsdale, New York at the age of 80, and was buried in Pleasant View Cemetery, Lyme, Connecticut.\n\nJoan Bennett was survived by 4 daughters (Diana Fox, Melinda Markey, and Shelley and Stephanie Wanger) and 13 grandchildren.\n\nBennett has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for services to Motion Pictures, at 6310 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n\n\n", "id": "186927", "title": "Joan Bennett"}

This happened between July 1918 to September 1918. They caused the ending of the Terauchi Masatake government.\n\nA very big rise in the price of rice caused very bad economic \"(money)\" problems, especially in rural areas \"(outside of cities)\" where rice was the main food of daily life for people. Farmers, became angry at the government (who set the amount of money the farmer's made) and the rice merchants when they learned that they were making much less money for growing the rice than it was being sold for to the public. They blamed the government and the merchants for letting the price of rice rise so high. The rise in the price of rice happened just at the worst point in the rapid rise in prices in many things such as food and rents that was happening just after World War I. This caused problems for the people of Japan. The Siberian Intervention made things worse because the government themselves bought lots of rice to feed their soldiers who were outside of Japan. This made the price of rice rise even more. The government didn't do anything to stop it and it spread to the towns and cities. \n\nThe Rice Riots were the biggest, most violent and wide spread in modern Japanese history. The first protest happened in the small fishing town of Uozu in Toyama Prefecture, on 23 July 1918. Starting with peaceful petitioning, the protest quickly grew into riots, strikes, looting, incendiary bombings of police stations and government offices and into armed fights. By mid-September 1918, over 623 protests and or riots had happened in 38 cities, 153 towns and 177 villages, with over 2 million people taking part in them. 25,000 people were arrested, and 8200 were convicted of crimes. Punishments were given including minor fines and up to the death penalty.\n\nPrime Minister Terauchi said he and his cabinet were to blame for the riots and they all on 29 September 1918.\n\nPeople studying this part of Japanese history think that the riots and so the need for rice in some way may have caused the Japanese to grow their occupation of other countries. Evidence of this is thought to be the increase in rice production in Taiwan and Korea.\n\n", "id": "186930", "title": "Rice Riots of 1918"}

It measured as a Level 6 disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima disaster are the only accidents listed as more serious than this one).\n\nMayak is the name for a number of nuclear facilities, which are about from Ekaterinburg, in Russia. The facilities were also known as \"Chelyabinsk-65\", or \"Chelyabinsk-40\". Mayak was built between 1945 and 1948. It was the first plant that could produce nuclear material in the Soviet Union. At times, up to 25.000 people worked at Mayak. They produced the plutonium fuel that was used for the first Soviet atomic bomb, amongst other things.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1987, a total of ten nuclear reactors were built. Until 1991, all but two were closed. The two remaining produce radioactive isotopes for health care and for research purposes.\n\nDuring different accidents, a large amount of radioactivity was released into the environment. The biggest of these accidents happened in 1957, and is known as \"Kyshtym Disaster\" today. It happened in a plant near Kishtim (Кыштым). There were many accidents in this secret plant. The most serious of them happened on September 29, 1957. The cooling system of the plant failed to work. A (non-nuclear) explosion occurred. This explosion had the force of between 75 and 100 tons of TNT. It threw the lid of the container, which weighted 160 tons, into the air. The accident released about 20 MegaPCi (about 740 Petabecquerel) of radioactivity. At least 200 people died from radiation sickness. About 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes. More than 470,000 people were affected by the radiation, without knowing it.\n\nDuring the next ten to eleven hours, the radioactive cloud moved towards the northeast, reaching between 300 and 350 kilometers from the accident. The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long-term contamination of an area of more than 800 square kilometers, mostly with caesium-137 and strontium-90. Today, the area is known as the East-Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT).\n\nThe existence of Mayak was a secret. Only very few people knew it was there. For this reason, the people living in the areas affected by the accident were not told about the accident. On 6th October, a week after the accident, the authorities started to evacuate about 10,000 people, but they did not tell about the reason for the evacuation. People grew hysterical with fear because unknown 'mysterious' diseases were breaking out. Victims were seen with skin 'sloughing off' their faces, hands and other exposed parts of their bodies.\" It was Zhores Medvedev who revealed the nature and extent of the disaster to the world.\n\nEven though the Soviet government hid information about the figures, it is known that the direct exposure to radiation caused at least 200 cases of death from cancer.\n\nTo reduce the spread of radioactive contamination after the accident, contaminated soil was removed and kept in fenced enclosures that were called \"graveyards of the earth\".\n\nIn 1968, the Soviet government disguised the EURT area by creating the East-Ural Nature Reserve, which prohibited any unauthorised access to the affected area.\n\nRumours of a nuclear mishap somewhere in the vicinity of Chelyabinsk had long been circulating in the West. That there had been a serious nuclear accident west of the Urals was eventually inferred from research on the effects of radioactivity on plants, animals, and ecosystems, published by Professor Leo Tumerman, former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow, and associates.\n\nAccording to Gyorgy, who invoked the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to the relevant Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) files, the CIA knew of the 1957 Mayak accident all along. They kept it secret to prevent adverse consequences for the fledgling American nuclear industry. Only in 1990 did the Soviet government declassify documents pertaining to the disaster.\n\nAccording to different sources, the amount of radioactivity produced by this disaster is between twice and six times that of Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Because the leakage was more limited, this is classified as a Level 6 (of 7) disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Chernobyl is rated at Level 7.\n\nIn 2003, Russian authorities closed down the Mayak plant. Lake Karachay, which is close to the plant is seen as one of the most contaminated spots on the planet.\n\nIn the past 45 years, about half a million people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents. Some of them were exposed to more than twenty times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster effects victims.\n\n\n", "id": "187000", "title": "Kyshtym disaster"}

Suwon is the capital city of Gyeonggi-do, a province in South Korea. The fortress was built by Jeongjo, the 22nd king of the Joseon Dynasty.\n\nJeongjo had several goals in building the fortress. He wanted to show loyalty to his family. He wanted to strengthen his power and protect the southern area of Suwon. He also wanted to reduce conflict between different political parties.\n\nConstruction was started along Mount Paldalsan in January 1794 and finished in September 1796. The project was supervised by Chae Jae-gong, a former minister and the magistrate of Yeongjungchubu County. New tools were created to help with construction of the fortress. For example, the Geojunggi, a type of traditional Korean crane, and potter's wheels were created. They were used to move and put together large stones to make up the wall.\n\nThe fortress was partly damaged twice. First, it was damaged during Japanese colonial rule (when Japan controlled Korea). The fortress was also damaged during the Korean War. Today, most of its original features have been restored. After the original fortress was finished in 1801, a construction archive called the Hwaseong Seongyeokuigwe was published. This archive recorded what the fortress was like when it was first built. This helped construction workers know how to rebuild the fortress after it was damaged, so it would look like the original wall.\n\nThe fortress stretches over both flat and hilly lands. This is uncommon in neighbouring China and Japan.\n\nThe fortress is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n", "id": "187043", "title": "Hwaseong Fortress"}

These days fingernails and toenails are seen by some as important points of beauty.\n\nAlso, it is a type of fashion activity, related to manicuring. There are commercial shops ('nail bars') where nails are worked on to make them attractive. The main product is acrylic nails with ready-made designs which can be stuck on top of natural nails. \n\nNail polish, or nail varnish, is a lacquer applied to human fingernails or toenails to decorate and/or protect the nail. Today’s nail polishes are usually nitrocellulose in a solvent such as butyl acetate or ethyl acetate. They may be clear or coloured with pigments. The coating has a plasticizers (e.g. camphor). This links polymer chains, spacing them to make the film flexible after drying. That way it resists cracking or flaking caused by the natural movement of the nail.\n\nNail polish was used in the ancient world. In China it started off being made from a combination of beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic and rose petals. The Chinese would dip their hands in this mixture until their finger nails turned red or pink. In Ancient Egypt henna was used. The henna stained their fingernails orange, which turned dark red or brown after the stain matured. In 1300 BC, the colour of the nail polish reflected social rank. The colours gold and silver were favoured; later, black and red were the favoured colours. Red is the colour Cleopatra wore. \n\nBy the turn of the 9th century, nails were tinted with scented red oils, and polished or buffed with a chamois cloth, rather than simply polished. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, people pursued a polished rather than painted look by massaging tinted powders and creams into their nails, then buffing them shiny. After the creation of automobile paint, Cutex produced the first modern nail polish in 1917. Synthetic nail polish was introduced in the 1920s in Paris.\n\nThe artificial nails are not a replacement, but an extension for natural nails. There are two main approaches to creating artificial nails–\"tips\" and \"forms\". \n\nThis is a mixture of a powder and a liquid. The mixture starts to harden in 30–40 seconds after application and gets to its final hardness in fifteen minutes. Powder and liquid acrylics can be removed by using a variety of solvents (usually acetone is used). Usually it takes 15 to 20 minutes to remove the nail.\n\nAnother material, commonly called \"UV Top Coat\" (in correct terms a polymer resin), hardens under ultraviolet light. These can show a wider range of properties (flexibility, strength, etc.) but may be more expensive. They cannot be removed by organic solvents, but only by filing (or left to grow out with the natural nail).\n\nAnother popular alternative to acrylic or gel preparations are fiberglass or silk wraps. They are done by cutting pieces of actual fiberglass or silk fabric to fit on the surface of the nail or tip and then it is sealed down with a resin or glue. These are an alternative for those who are allergic to chemicals used in the acrylic or gel process. Other materials can be used, as well as combinations of them. There are also temporary, cheaper flexible tips that can be quickly glued at home without help from a professional.\n\nAcrylic nail powders are available in a variety of colours and can use \"special effects\" such as contours, sparkles and the very popular \"French manicure\" (pink and white appearance).\n\nGuitar players, if they don't use their fingertips, use their nails, or a 'pick' (piece of metal) to play. If they use their nails, the nails must be in perfect condition, and kept to the same length all the time. Alternatively, he/she may use acrylic stick-ons. Every guitarist has their own way.\n\nThe players of many ancient Chinese instruments, like the guqin, pipa, and ruan, also commonly used artificial nails.\n\n", "id": "187062", "title": "Nail art"}

She was the only fashion designer to be named on TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century. She broke free of conventions and became a role model for some. Her behaviour during the German occupation of France in World War II led to criticism.\n\nChanel was born in 1883 in Saumur, France. In her youth, she was a seamstress and a nightclub singer.\n\nIn 1910, she opened a hat shop. In 1919, she opened a house of fashion in Paris, and introduced her perfume, Chanel No. 5, in 1922. She retired in 1939, but returned to fashion with great success in 1954. \n\nShe is famous for the little black dress, Chanel No. 5, the most famous women's perfume in the world, and the knee-long skirt and box jacket suit worn with pearl necklace.\n\nIn 1913, Chanel opened her first shop in Deauville, France. Society women liked her simple wardrobe. In 1915, she opened a second shop in Biarritz.\n\nChanel became one of the first women fashion designers to create simple and practical clothes for the sporty women of the era. She took the color black, which was not used in fashion at the time and showed \"chic\" it could be by wearing it.

She banned corsets and other uncomfortable garments.\n\nChanel was the mistress of several rich men. During her relationship with the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia in 1920, she added a Russian touch to her dresses by embroidering Russian patterns on them.\n\nChanel was with Hugh Grosvenor, the 2nd Duke of Westminster from 1924 to 1931.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187186", "text": "Kabuki\n\nKabuki is the traditional Japanese classical drama which started about 400 years ago. It is known for its very stylized acting and the elaborate makeup worn by the actors. The word kabuki means \"singing and dancing\". It also means strange and different, to be outside what is normal. Kabuki is not meant to look like real life. People from around the world are now interested in Kabuki. It was recognized by UNESCO in 2006 as an important part of Japan's cultural history.\n\nKabuki theater started during the Edo period (1603—1868). It developed into what we now know as kabuki during the \"Genroku\" (1688—1704). Kabuki was started by a woman, Izumo no Okuni, who performed in the dry river bed in Kyoto in 1603. It was very popular, especially because many of the stories and dance moves were about sex. Many of the women performers were probably prostitutes. Women were banned from performing in Kabuki plays in 1629 because it was thought to disturb discipline. They were replaced by beautiful young men to play the female roles, but in 1652 they were banned for the same reasons as the women. Kabuki was allowed to continue with adult men playing all the roles, Yaro kabuki, the style that has became famous.\n\nAfter the \"Genroku\" era, Kabuki became popular in Japanese cities, growing rapidly as proper theater with great authors and actors. \"Ningyo Jyoruri\" (the puppet theater) also influenced the stories, directions, content and style. Ballet and theater music, such as \"Nagauta\", \"Tokiwadubushi\" and \"Kiyomotobushi\" were also influences on the development of kabuki. After the restoration of the Emperor in 1888, kabuki was influenced by foreign culture, stimulated by the rise of new drama. \n\nIn \"Showa\" period, from 1926 to 1989, performances began in other countries. The Empire Theater was reconstructed, and called the National Theater. In 1954, East Side Theater was made, and Kabuki stage shown on TV. In 1965, Kabuki was seen as an important cultural heritage. After World War II, the Japanese came to see that Kabuki as an important part of their culture. Many actors became famous people in Japan.\n\nWoman kabuki actors are rare though there was \"onnakabuki\". The \"onnakabuki\" is woman’s kabuki. Now the men play both male and female roles.\n\nThere are famous kabuki actors in Japan such as Danjuro Ichikawa, Ebizo Ichikawa and Koshiro Matsumoto. Danjuro Ichikawa is an especially famous kabuki actor. He started \"aragoto\" at the age only of 14. The \"aragoto\" is a kabuki genre dealing with a brave warrior, a fierce god, or a demon. He also wrote kabuki plays under the name of Hyogo Mimasuya.\n\nThe name of a kabuki actor usually is passed on from one generation to the next. Therefore the name of an actor is passes to the next generation. Kabuki actors do not perform only kabuki but also act in TV drama and movies. Koshiro Matsumoto often appears on TV.\n\nKabuki theaters are very unique. In the Genroku era, kabuki was influenced by \"nou\" or \"kyougen\" which were the theater styles made before \"kabuki\". In this period there was no roof for audiences, so that if it rained, actors could not perform. In the Edo period, all seats were covered with a roof. \n\n\"Mawari-butai\", a revolving stage, began in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735). Scenes are built on the revolving stage and when a new scene is needed they simply rotate the stage; it makes progress of plays move quickly and easily. Foreign theaters have copied this kabuki invention. \n\nOther unique system is \"hanamichi\" or \"flower path\". This is a walkway which crosses the auditorium at the same height as the stage. Actors can use this walkway to enter or leave the stage. During a play it can become many kinds of places. For example, it can be a river, a road, a corridor and so on.\n\nThe most famous theatre in Japan is the \"Kabuki-za\". It was built in Tokyo in 1889. It was built as western-style theater. The interior decorations were Japanese style but the outside was brick walls and it was a three-storied theater at first. The interior decorations and outside changed many time. Kabuki theaters have long histories and these were so unique.\n\nFamous authors of kabuki plays include Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653—1724), Tsuruya Nanmboku (1755—1829), and Kawatake Mokuami (1816—1893). \n\nKabuki plays can be put into three main groups \"Jidaimono\", \"Sewamono\" and \"Shosagoto\". The \"Jidaimono\" are plays which show the world of samurais or court nobles before the Edo period. The government banned performances that showed the history of the Edo period. \"Sewamono\" are plays about the lives of the town people in the Edo period. \"Shosagoto\" are plays that feature dance.\n\n\"Gidayu kyogen\" or \"Maruhonmono\" are kabuki plays that were first written as puppet plays. They were turned into kabuki plays when they became famous. \"Shin kabuki\" are plays which were written by writers who did not normally write kabuki plays.\n\nKabuki makeup helps audiences understand each character's role. It is special and emphasizes beauty of form. If an actor plays the role of a daughter or a man in love, he must apply makeup. First, he rubs grease, which is made of canola oil and perfume, into his face. Second, he paints out eyebrow with grease. Third, he rubs face powder on chest, neck, long hair and spreads powder with sponge. Next, he rubs face powder on face with sponge. Also, he puts rouge on nose, eyes cheek and the outer corner of the eye. He paints his eyebrow from red to black and he rubs lip with red lip stick and traces the outline clearly. \n\nIf the actor is playing a brave man, called \"Aragoto\", he paints on rouge with red and black lines, \"Kumadori\", to show brave feelings. \"Kumadori\" is a type of kabuki's make up. It was started in 1673 by Danjyurou Ichikawa. It shows the character's role, for example, \"Sujiguma\" is one of the \"kamadori\" showing a super hero.\n\nModern Japanese has a lot of words that came from kabuki words. For example, there are three famous words; the first is an \"ohako\". \"Ohako\" means skillful things. Japanese often say the \"ohako\" is own good tune with karaoke. The \"ohako\" is derived word from Danjuro Ichikawa. He kept the kabuki plays of his good kabuki in a box. The \"ohako\" originated in there.\n\nThe second is a \"nimaime\". The \"nimaime\" means a good-looking man. The \"nimaime\" was written secondarily from the right in the signboard of the kabuki. Therefore it came to be said so.\n\nThe third is a \"sanmaime\". The \"sanmaime\" means a comedian. The origin of this word is the same as \"nimaime\", \"sanmaime\" was written third from the right in the signboard of the kabuki. \n\nNow Kabuki actors often perform for foreign audiences. The group \"Heisei Nakamuraza\" directed by Nakamura Kanzaburou have become famous for their performances in foreign countries. They were the first traditional style kabuki group to perform in New York City in 2004, with actor Nakamura Kankuro V. Using a tent as a playhouse near opera house, with the audience seated on tatami (Japanese mats), they performed \"The Summer Festival: A Mirror of Osaka\" with Japanese actors. In July 2008, \"Heisei Nakamuraza\" again performed in New York and they played in English.

He was one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, especially famous for his conducting of the music of Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss.\n\nBöhm was born in Graz, Austria. He wanted to be a musician, but his father said that he should study law first, because musicians did not make much money, and if he was not successful as a musician he could then always have a job in law. So he studied law at the university of Graz, and got a doctorate on this subject. He also studied music privately in Graz, and then in Vienna with Eusebius Mandyczewski and Guido Adler. Although he learned to play the piano and to compose, he just wanted to be a conductor. He started his career by helping singers at the Graz Opera to learn their roles. Böhm became very interested in the operas of Wagner and Mozart and learned a lot from great conductors like Carl Muck and Bruno Walter who invited him to the Bavarian State Opera in 1921. In 1927 he became Generalmusikdirektor (music director) at Darmstadt. He often conducted modern operas, including Berg’s \"Wozzeck\". In 1931 he moved to Hamburg. In 1933 he conducted the Vienna Philharmonic, both in opera and concert performances. He became conductor at the opera house in Dresden when Fritz Busch lost that job because he said he did not like the Nazis. Böhm worked there for nine years. He became a great friend of the composer Richard Strauss and conducted the first performances of two of his operas there: \"Die schweigsame Frau\" and \"Daphne\". In 1943 got the very important job of conductor at the Vienna State Opera eventually becoming music director. He also conducted the German seasons at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires from 1950 to 1953.\n\nIn his later years Böhm spent his time as guest conductor. He was invited to conduct many of the leading world orchestras. He often performed at Salzburg, Bayreuth, Vienna, Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Milan, Paris and New York.\nIn 1957, he made his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, conducting \"Don Giovanni\". He was very popular there and conducted many operas, especially those by Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss.\n\nLate in life, he was a regular guest conductor with the London Symphony Orchestra. He was given the title of LSO President for the rest of his life.\n\nDuring his last years his sight was not very good. He died in Salzburg in 1981. His son was actor Karl Boehm.\n\nBöhm was praised for his clear, energetic conducting. He did not have exaggerated mannerisms but got his orchestras to play with a warm, romantic sound which was never sentimental. Besides his favourite Mozart, Wagner and Richard Strauss he conducted many works by Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Bruckner, Brahms and Berg.\n\nHe was given many honours, including first Austrian Generalmusikdirektor. On his 80th birthday a big party was held, at which Herbert von Karajan gave him a clock. \n\n", "id": "187210", "title": "Karl Böhm"}

The length of the instrument could be changed by the use of a sliding tube which meant it could play a full chromatic range of notes. The earliest instruments come from the 1500's. The sackbut was popular because it could be played loudly or softly, and it could also be played in tune. They were made in a range of sizes, a descant (rarely used), alto, tenor and bass. They were often played to accompany a church choir.\n", "id": "187218", "title": "Sackbut"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187238", "text": "Boeing 727\n\nThe Boeing 727 is a jet airliner. It is made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It can carry 149 to 189 passengers. It can fly for . The Boeing 727 was made to fly short distances. It can also take off from short runways at smaller airports. It has three Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines. One engine is at the back, and the other two are on the sides of the plane. The 727 is the only plane made by Boeing which has three engines.\n\nThe Boeing 727 was made after the Boeing 707. The 727 and the 707 have some similar features. The 727-100 first flew in February 1963. The first airline to use it was Eastern Air Lines. The 727-200, a longer version of the 727, first flew in July 1967. It was first used by Northeast Airlines in December 1967.\n\nThe 727 was made during the 1970s. The last 727 was made in 1984. In July 2011, 23 727-100s and 227 727-200s were being used by airlines. The 727 is a very noisy aircraft, so some 727s have been given hush kits to make them quieter.\n\nThe Boeing 727 was made to fly from small cities which had airports with shorter runways. It also carried fewer passengers. United Airlines wanted a plane with four engines so that it could fly to airports which were at high altitude. An example of an airport like this is Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado. American Airlines wanted a plane with two engines. Eastern Airways wanted a plane with three engines so that it could fly to the Caribbean. The airlines decided to ask for a trijet, which is a plane with three engines.\n\nIn 1959, Lord Douglas said that Boeing and de Havilland Aircraft Company should work together to make trijets. Boeing made the 727 and de Havilland made the D.H.121 Trident. The two planes were quite similar, but the 727 was a bit bigger. Boeing wanted to use Allison AR963 turbofan engines for the 727. The de Havilland plane also used these engines. Boeing and de Havilland sent engineers to look at each other's designs. However, Boeing decided not to work together with de Havilland and changed the engine.\n\nIn 1960, Pratt & Whitney wanted to sell its new JT8D turbofan engine design. United and Eastern were interested in this engine, so Pratt & Whitney decided to keep designing it. Eddie Rickenbacker, from Eastern, told Boeing that the airline wanted JT8D engines for its 727s. At first, Boeing did not want to use the JT8D for the 727, but it eventually decided to use the JT8D.\n\nThe 727 has special parts on its wings which help it to make more lift. This means that it can take off from shorter runways than most other jets.\n\nLater, some longer 727s were made to carry more passengers. They replaced other jet airliners like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. They also replaced propeller planes like the DC-4, DC-6, DC-7 and the Lockheed Constellation.\n\nBoeing stopped making the 727 in 1984. 1,832 were made. 1,831 of these were given to an airline.\n\nThe 727 was meant for small airports. This meant that it would have to do without some things like stairs. Boeing built airstairs into the 727. At first, the airstairs could be opened while the plane was flying. However, D. B. Cooper, who was a hijacker, jumped out of a 727. This happened while it was flying over the Pacific Northwest. Boeing then changed the design so that the airstairs could not be opened while the plane was flying. The 727 also had an auxiliary power unit (APU). This meant that the 727 could run its systems without any power from the ground. The APU is near the undercarriage. This is quite unusual.\n\nOne thing which allowed the 727 to land on short runways was the design of its wings. The 727 had no engines on its wings, so flaps could be used on the full wing. There were also some other things which made more lift. Together, these things make a lift coefficient of 3.0.\n\nThe 727 is one of the noisiest airliners. The 727's JT8D engines are low-bypass. This makes them much noiser than high-bypass engines. Boeing thought about giving the 727 quieter engines. They said that the JT8D-200 engine could be used.\n\nAll 727s being used today need to be given a hush kit. A hush kit is something which makes a jet engine quieter. FedEx makes one of these kits. Over 60 companies have bought this. Winglets have also been made for the 727 by different companies.\n\n727s (including 727s which have a hush kit) are banned from some airports in Australia because of how much noise they make.\n\nThe 727 could fly to different countries as well as to places in the same country. It is useful in airports where the runway is made of gravel. Since the engines are so high up, there is not much risk that they will be damaged by things on the ground.\n\nThe 727 was also used by the military. Since the airstairs could be opened while the plane was flying, the Central Intelligence Agency used them to put agents and supplies into Vietnam.\n\nThe \"Boeing C-22\" was used by the Air National Guard and National Guard Bureau to airlift people. Three C-22B's were used. All of them belonged to the 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard.\n\nThe replacement for the 727 was the Boeing 757. However, the 757 is much bigger than the 727. Because of this, some airlines replaced the 727 with the 737-800 or the Airbus A320.\n\n\"Source:\" Boeing Aircraft since 1916\"\n\nThere are two types of 727. The first one is called the 727-100. Airlines began to use it in February 1964. Airlines began to use the next type, the 727-200, in December 1967.\n\nThe 727-100 first flew on February 9, 1963. United Airlines got the first plane on October 29, 1963.\n\n571 727-100s were made (407 -100s, 53 -100Cs, and 111 -100QCs). The last one was made in October 1972. Boeing kept one 727-100. This means that the real number is 572.\n\nThis type could be changed into a cargo plane and into a passenger plane.\n\nQC stands for \"Quick Change\". This is a 727-100C which can be changed into a cargo plane much quicker (in 30 minutes).\n\nQF stands for \"Quiet Freighter\". It was made for the United Parcel Service.\n\nThe 727-200 is a longer version of 727-100. The -200 is longer (153 feet, 2 inches, 46.7 m) than the −100 (133 feet, 2 inches, 40.6 m).\n\nThe 727-200 first flew on July 27, 1967. Northeast Airlines got the first 727-200. 310 727-200s were made. The 727-200 Advanced replaced the 727-200 in 1972.\n\nThis type can fly for longer. It also has some improvements in the cabin.\n\nA type of 727-200 Advanced which could carry cargo.\n\nThis type has more speed. This happened because the engines were replaced with more powerful ones. It also had winglets. This type was first made by Valsan Partners, but Quiet Wing Technologies in Redmond, Washington, began to make it later.\n\n, 208 Boeing 727s are still being used. These airlines have five or more 727s:\n\nThe 727 has been used by some governments. The Belgian, Yugoslavian, Mexican, New Zealand, and Panama air forces have used it. The United States military also used the 727; it was called the C-22.\n\n\nAs of 2010, the Boeing 727 has had 325 accidents. It has had 112 hull-loss accidents. 3,783 people have died in these. The 727 has been hijacked 178 times, and 345 people have died in these.\n\nInformation from:\n\nBoeing \n\n\n", "id": "187238", "title": "Boeing 727"}

After the war he graduated from school and went to the Royal Academy of Music (now the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied violin, piano, and composition. Zoltán Kodály was one of his teachers. He soon became interested in conducting, and learned a lot from Bruno Walter, and Otto Klemperer, then the director of the Budapest Opera.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1955, István Kertész conducted at Györ, and the Budapest Opera orchestra. After the 1956 uprising in Hungary he and his family left their country and went to Germany. He settled there and took German nationality.\n\nKertész became conductor at Augsburg (1958-1963) and then at Cologne. He first appeared in Britain in 1960 with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and then with the London Symphony Orchestra. He first conducted in America in 1961, touring with the Hamburg RSO. He conducted at Covent Garden in 1965, and then took over from Pierre Monteux as conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra.\n\nKertész had a very large repertoire and conducted nearly all of the world’s great orchestras. He conducted many operas, and was especially fond of the music of Bartok, Henze, Stravinsky and Britten. He gave the first Vienna performance of Britten’s \"War Requiem\" and the first performance in Germany of his opera \"Billy Budd\". He made many recordings.\n\nOn 16 April 1973, while on a concert tour, István Kertész drowned while swimming off the coast of Israel near Tel Aviv.

It only can be used for data which can be put in order, such as highest to lowest.\n\nThe general formula for formula_2 is formula_4.\n\nFor example, if you have data for how expensive different computers are, and data for how fast the computers are, you could see if they are linked, and how closely they are linked, using formula_2.\n\nTo work out formula_2 you first have to \"rank\" each piece of data. We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed.\n\nSo, the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1. The one higher than that would have 2. Then, it goes up until it is all ranked. You have to do this to both sets of data.\n\nNext, we have to find the \"difference\" between the two ranks. Then, you multiply the difference by itself, which is called squaring. The difference is called formula_7, and the number you get when you square formula_7 is called formula_9.\n\nCount how much data we have. This data has ranks 1 to 5, so we have 5 pieces of data. This number is called formula_10.\n\nFinally, use everything we have worked out so far in this formula: formula_11.\n\nformula_12 means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column formula_9. This is because formula_14 means total.\n\nSo, formula_12 is formula_16 which is 4. The formula says multiply it by 6, which is 24.\n\nformula_17 is formula_18 which is 120.\n\nSo, to find out formula_2, we simply do formula_20.\n\nTherefore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.8 for this set of data.\n\nformula_2 always gives an answer between −1 and 1. The numbers between are like a scale, where −1 is a very strong link, 0 is no link, and 1 is also a very strong link. The difference between 1 and −1 is that 1 is a positive correlation, and −1 is a negative correlation. A graph of data with a formula_2 value of −1 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right.\n\nFor example, for the data that we did above, formula_2 was 0.8. So this means that there is a positive correlation. Because it is close to 1, it means that the link is strong between the two sets of data. So, we can say that those two sets of data are \"linked\", and go \"up\" together. If it was −0.8, we could say it was \"linked\" and as one goes up, the other goes down.\n\nSometimes, when ranking data, there are two or more numbers that are the same. When this happens in formula_2, we take the mean or average of the ranks that are the same. These are called \"tied\" ranks. To do this, we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied. Then, we add up all the ranks that they would have, and divide it by how many there are. For example, say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test.\n\nThese numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks.\n\n", "id": "187866", "title": "Spearman's rank correlation coefficient"}

Once thought to be extinct, it is now only found in small areas of surviving old and mixed age mountain ash forest in the central highlands of Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne. About half this area was burnt out in the disastrous Black Saturday bushfire in 2009. Large areas of the forest around Marysville, Narbethong and Healesville were destroyed. They need food all year, and trees with holes where they can hide during the day. This limits them to mixed-age wet sclerophyll forest with a thick mid-story of \"Acacia\".\n\nIt is the only species in the Gymnobelideus genus. It was named after John Leadbeater, a taxidermist at the Museum of Victoria.\n\nIt is the only mammal that is only found in Victoria, so in 1968, the State of Victoria made Leadbeater's possum its faunal emblem.\n\nThe possum was first discovered by Europeans in 1867. Only five possums were found, the last one in 1909. It was thought the species was extinct, because its habitat around Bass River in south-west Gippsland was cleared for farming in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1961, a group was discovered near Marysville, in the Upper Yarra Valley. Further searching found more groups in the highlands of Victoria. However, type of forest is critical: it can not be too old or too young.\n\nThe possum's survival is believed to be due to the terrible Black Friday fires that burnt through Victoria in 1939. This created a lot of new growth in the forest which provided food. It also left a lot of large dead trees for shelter and nesting. The Leadbeater's possum population grew to about 7500 in the early 1980s. After the 2009 fires it is believed that there are now only about 1000 possums left. Many of the old trees have decayed and there is little new growth. Before European settlement, the possums would simply have moved to new recently burnt areas, but with so much land cleared in the last 100 years, they now have nowhere else to go.\n\nIf a population of about 1000 can survive for another 150 years, natural tree hollows will begin to develop in the trees that started growing after the 1939 fires and which survived the 2009 fires. This should help possum numbers start to increase again.\n\nLeadbeater's possums are rarely seen. They sleep during day and come out at night (nocturnal). They are small, about long and weigh about 120-130 grams. They move very quickly and live at the top of some of the tallest forests in the world. The possum is covered in thick, soft fur. It can be grey through to brown in colour, with a black stripe along their backs. Their fur on the chest and stomach area is pale grey. One of the main features of the possum is its club shaped tail.\n\nThey live in small family groups of up to 12 individuals, usually a breeding pair, their children, and sometimes an extra male or two. They sleep together in a nest made out of shredded bark in a tree hollow. The nests can be anywhere from to above the ground. They have a territory of up to 20,000 square meters, which they will defend from other possums. The oldest female is the most aggressive. She will attack outsiders and chase her own daughters out of her territory when they become adults at about 14 months of age. The average female lifespan in the bush is only about 27 months, but as much as 10 years in captivity.\n\nLeadbeater's possums do not survive by themselves. Young males leave their parents at about 15 months of age and join another group, or live together in large male groups looking for females to start new groups.\n\nAt sunset, Leadbeater's possums leave their nests and go out to find food in the tree tops. They often take huge leaps from tree to tree. They are omnivorous, they eat a range of tree saps, lerps, and arthropods which they find under the loose bark of eucalyptus trees such as spiders, crickets, and beetles. They get their energy from the sap and their proteins from the arthropods.\n\nThey give birth at the beginning of winter (May and June) or late spring (October and November). They have one or two babies, which stay in the pouch for 80 or 90 days. When they come out of the pouch they stay in the nest for another three weeks. Young Leadbeater's possums are often eaten by owls.\n\nBecause of the small area where they live, and the mix of forest trees that they need, the Leadbeater's possums is an endangered species. Logging continues to be a major threat to the possum. In 1993 five hectares of protected habitat east of Powelltown, was logged because of a \"mapping error.\" Author, Peter Preuss, said that the number of possums dropped in 1997 with their current habitat (limited to a 50-square-kilometre area) under threat from logging. He said that there needed to be a new breeding program.\n\nDr. David Lindenmeyer, (Australian National University), has said that the need to make nest boxes showed that logging was removing too many older trees with hollows needed by species like Leadbeater's possum. Studies have shown that logging in the forest between the Yarra Valley National Park and Mount Bullfight Conservation Reserve in February 2006, led to the deaths of most possums in the area. Adult possums are territorial and do not want to move. Many more were killed early in 2007 when VicForests cleared large firebreaks through possum habitat after the Christmas fires. Firebreaks and cleared land stop the possums from being able to travel and breed with other nearby groups.\n\nWith its much of its known habitat destroyed in the bushfires of February 2009 the species status is currently in doubt. The mapped distribution of the Leadbeater's possum exactly matches the area burnt in the fires.\n\nThe last Leadbeater's possum in captivity died at Healesville Sanctuary Victoria in May 2006. There are now no Leadbeater's possums in captivity anywhere in the world and no breeding program to assist this animal's survival. A group, Friends of Leadbeater's possum, has formed to try an protect the possum and to make the government protect the habitat.\n", "id": "187956", "title": "Leadbeater's possum"}

It can be caused by viral infections such as canine distemper, canine adenovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, or canine respiratory coronavirus, or bacterial infections such as \"Bordetella bronchiseptica\". It is called kennel cough because the infection can spread very quickly among dogs, such as in the closeness of a kennel. It may possibly turn your dogs fur green.\n\nBoth viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and coughing. It can also be spread through contact with things that have the bacteria or virus on them. It can still be spread days or weeks after symptoms disappear. Symptoms begin usually 3 to 5 days after exposure. The disease can become pneumonia.\n\nSymptoms can include a , dry coughing, , sneezing, , or vomiting in response to light pressing of the trachea or after excitement or exercise. The symptoms are caused by the inflammation of the airways. It can increase after excitement or exercise because of the quick breathing that takes place which causes the nerves of airway to become more stimulated. A fever is not always present. The disease can last 10–20 days and can come back when the dog is put into a stressful situation which puts stress on the dog's immune system. Medical diagnosis is made by seeing these symptoms, having a history of exposure is also helpful but not always found as kennel cough is easily spread through contact with the ground, toys, sidewalks, dog parks.\n\nAntibiotics are given to treat any bacterial infection present. Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive (nothing is being coughed up). The usual outcome is good. Prevention is by vaccinating for canine adenovirus, distemper, parainfluenza, and \"Bordetella\". In kennels, the best prevention is to keep all the cages clean.

He is remembered for a small number of romantic songs and piano pieces which became extremely popular in the early 20th century.\n\nNevin was born in 1862, at Vineacre, on the river Ohio, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up there. His father was a newspaper editor and he taught the young boy most subjects. His mother played the piano. The family bought a grand piano, which was the first grand piano ever to be taken across the Allegheny Mountains. \n\nEthelbert showed musical promise when he was very young. His brother and cousins were also musical. When he was four he was playing the piano with cushions on the floor so that he could reach the pedals. His father took him to Dresden for two years to study music. He also studied in Pittsburgh and in Boston.\n\nHe started his career giving piano lessons. When he had earned enough money he went to Berlin where he had lessons from Karl Klindworth, who was a good teacher for him. He showed Nevin how important it was to have a good general knowledge, and not just to spend hours and hours practising the piano. This helped Nevin, who had good tastes in literature and he chose some good poems to make into songs.\nIn 1885 he was invited to join a group who had lessons from Hans von Bülow. He played works by of Brahms, Liszt, and Raff. Cosima Wagner and Joseph Joachim often came to the concerts given by this group.\n\nIn 1887 he went back to America and lived in Boston, where he taught and played in some concerts. He asked Richard Strauss to teach him composition but Strauss did not accept him.\n\nIn 1892 he went to Paris, where he taught singing, and helped many American and French opera singers to learn their parts for singing in operas. He worked very hard and his health got bad. He spent his last years in several European places and then he went back to America. He died in 1901.\n\nNevin's music is romantic, and sometimes rather sentimental for modern tastes. His best known piece is \"Narcissus\" from \"Water Scenes\". These pieces were used by the dancer Isadora Duncan to dance to.

The fallen logs continue supporting a rich variety of life for centuries more on the forest floor.\n\nUnusually for a eucalypt, Mountain Ash does not regrow after fire. They grow only from seed which are released from their woody gumnuts by heat. The seedlings need a lot of light, much more than reaches the forest floor normally when there are mature trees blocking the sun. Severe fires can kill all the trees in a forest, which causes a massive release of seed to take advantage of the nutrients in the ash bed. Up to 2.5 million seedlings per have been recorded after a major fire. Competition and natural thinning slowly reduces the number of mature trees to about 30 to 40 per hectare. Because it takes roughly 20 years for seedlings to reach become old enough to make seeds, repeated fires in the same area can cause local extinctions. If, however, there are no fires to release seeds, the trees die off after about 400 years and are replaced by other species.\n\n\"Eucalyptus regnans\" is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living trees can make that claim. The tallest tree, named \"Centurion\", stands 99.6 metres tall in Tasmania. There are 16 living trees in Tasmania that have been measured taller than 90 metres. The tallest tree ever found was the \"Ferguson Tree\", at 132.6 metres, found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1872. It had fallen over and was measured by William Ferguson, the Inspector of State Forests. The top of the tree had broken off, but the trunk was still more than one metre in diameter. Ferguson guessed the tree would have been more than 152 metres in height.\n\n\"Eucalyptus regnans\" is valued for its timber, and large areas of trees have been cut down. The main uses are building timber and woodchipping. It also used for newsprint in the 20th century. Most of the woodchips are sent to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, large areas of new trees exist. It is increasingly grown in plantations where the long, straight, fast growing trunks are more valuable than the old growth timber.\n\nThe timber is rather rough (stringy) in texture. It is easy to work and the grain is straight with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending. It is used for furniture, flooring, woodpanelling, veneer, plywood, window frames and general building.\n", "id": "188039", "title": "Eucalyptus regnans"}

The game was developed or made by Radical Entertainment and published or was put out to be sold by Vivendi Universal. To make the game harder and more fun, the story and dialogue were written by the writers of the TV show. The voices were supplied by the cast of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nThe game follows the Simpson family and the people who live in Springfield, who see many strange things that happen in their town. When the Simpsons themselves decide to find out what is going on, they find out that aliens Kang and Kodos are filming a reality television series about the city. To make the show more interesting, the aliens release Buzz Cola, a soda that makes people go crazy, into Springfield's water supply. With help from Professor Frink, Homer is able to destroy the aliens' spaceship, and Springfield and its people are returned to normal.\n\nThe game received mostly positive, or good reviews from video game critics. Praise was given mostly on how much the game is was like the show and its funny take on the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" video game. The game received the award for Fave Video Game at the 2004 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards. More than three million copies of the game were sold as of June 2007.\n\n\"Hit & Run\" has seven levels, each with missions and a unique plot. The player can only move, or control one certain character in each level. he game's playable characters are Homer Simpson, Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, Marge Simpson, and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.

The famous composer Chopin had also been born in this village. Henryk started to learn the piano from his mother when he was five. When he was seven he changed to the violin. His violin teacher was Maurice Frenkel who had been an assistant to the famous violin teacher Leopold Auer. Four years later he went to Berlin to study with Carl Flesch who was a wonderful teacher for him. Szerynk later said: “Everything I know about the violin I learned from him. After three years he went to Paris to have lessons with Jacques Thibaud at the Paris Conservatory. He got the first prize in 1937. He also studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and continued studying with her until 1939.\n\nHe gave his first solo performance on 6 January 1933 playing the Brahms Violin Concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. Szeryng spoke seven languages fluently, so when World War II broke out he became an official interpreter for the Polish government which was based in exile in London. He went with the prime minister to Mexico to find a home for refugees. During the war he gave more than 300 concerts for Allied troops all over the world. During one of these concerts in Mexico City he was given the job of being head of the string department of the university there.\n\nIn 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of Mexico.\n\nSzeryng spent several years teaching the violin. Then the pianist Artur Rubinstein told him he ought to perform again, so in 1954 he started to give concerts once more. He spent the rest of his life touring all over the world playing the violin. He made many recordings, and also played many works by Mexican composers, helping them to make their music better known. He became Mexico’s special advisor at UNESCO in Paris. He continued to spend some time teaching, especially in Mexico. He owned several wonderful violins, some of which he gave away.\n\nHe died in Kassel. \n\nSzeryng is remembered for the beautiful tone that he made. He had an amazing technique. He always played very precisely in tune, even “bending” notes slightly to make his intonation very expressive.

A system that is in equilibrium does not change. The word has been used for different concepts from different fields of study. \n\n\nChemical equilibrium is an idea which describes the behavior of chemical reactions over time. In reactions that have finished reacting and have attained equlibrium, the concentrations of the reactant and product chemicals do not change. An example of an equilibrium reaction is as follows: \n\nformula_1\n\nIn the example above, the double arrow shows that the reaction is an equilibrium reaction. This means that the forward reaction and the backward reaction can happen, usually due to a small enthalpy change in each reaction. Hence, the amount of product chemicals to reactant chemicals remains a fixed value, and such a ratio is called the equilibrium constant (K). \n\nThe equilibrium constant is a ratio of the concentration of the products raised to the appropriate powers to the concentration of the reactants raised to the appropriate powers. In the above example, the equilibrium constant is as follows: \n\nformula_2\n\nFor some reactions, the equilibrium constant is very large, in which case nearly all of the reactant chemical is turned into products, such as when paper is burned. For other reactions, it is very small, which results in very little products being formed. If the equilibrium constant is close to 1, a mixture of both products and reactants is expected at equilibrium. \n\nWhen chemists talk about equilibrium constants, they call reactions with large K values favorable and reactions with small K values unfavorable. It is important to note, however, these terms are not judgements about the value or usefulness of a particular chemical reaction. In fact, some very important reactions are actually \"unfavorable\"; one such example is the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gas (Haber process), which has a rather small equilibrium constant. \n\nUnderstanding how chemical equilibriums work is important as it helps in understanding how a reaction happens. It allows chemists to calculate how much products will be formed from a reaction. \n\nThe concept of Le Chatelier's principle is important in predicting how an equilibrium will change when different factors are changed in a system. For example, using the Le Chatelier's principle, we are able to predict how the position of equilibrium will change when the concentration of a certain reactant/product has changed, as the system will try to counteract the change by favoring either the forward or the backward reaction.\n\nAn exception to this rule is when an outside energy source forces the reaction to occur in the opposite direction, such as when a battery is recharged. Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction also helps you to understand the flow of energy that occurs during the reaction (thermodynamics).\n", "id": "188222", "title": "Equilibrium"}

Some computers and networks do not use packets to communicate. But most currently do, including nearly all computers on the Internet. Packets allow many computers on a network to communicate more quickly and easily.\n\nA packet consists of two kinds of data: packet information and packet \"data\" (or \"payload\"). If you think of a packet like a letter in the mail, the \"control information\" is like the outside of the envelope. There's an address that says where to send the letter, and a stamp that says how to send it (fast or slow). Similarly, the computer uses the \"control information\" in the packet to decide where, and how, to send the data. People aren't usually interested in the control information.\n\nThe \"user data\" is like the inside of the envelope. It is the actual information the computer is trying to send. This might be the contents of a web page, or a user's name and address, for example. It's generally more for people's use, and less for the computer's use.\n\nDifferent communication protocols put the control information and user information in different places, or make it look different. But they still do the same thing.\n\nSometimes the computers make mistakes while transmitting data, or have trouble \"hearing\" each other. So many packets use a checksum or cyclic redundancy check to make sure they have the right information. This is usually one component of the control information. This helps to make sure the packets themselves have the right information. But then computers also need to get the right packets.\n\nDesigning computer networks can be difficult. Even though today's computers are very advanced, sometimes information doesn't arrive where it's supposed to. Sometimes computers try to fix this and end up sending it twice. And sometimes the information doesn't arrive in the right order. The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, was invented to fix these problems. But since it is complex, some computers use the User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, instead.\n", "id": "188224", "title": "Packet (computing)"}

One can measure the same thing again and again, and collect all the data together. This allows us to do statistics on the data. What is meant by errors and residuals is the difference between the observed or measured value and the real value, which is unknown. \n\nIf there is only one random variable, the difference between statistical errors and residuals is the difference between the mean of the population against the mean of the (observed) sample. In that case the residual is the difference between what the probability distribution says, and what was actually measured.\n\nSuppose there is an experiment to measure the height of 21-year-old men from a certain area. The mean of the distribution is 1.75 m.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188309", "text": "Portal (video game)\n\nPortal is a puzzle video game made by Valve Corporation set inside the \"Half-Life\" series. It was originally sold in \"The Orange Box\", a game collection deal which came with the Valve-made games \"Portal\", \"Half-Life 2\", and \"Team Fortress 2\". It is now sold by itself and is available for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Mac and PC.\n\nThe player plays as a woman named Chell who has to go though tests while being watched by a computer named GLaDOS, an acronym for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System. GLaDOS provides all of the game's dialog and is known for being clever, funny, and sarcastic, promising the player character a cake if all of the tests are finished. GLaDOS and the testing rooms were created by a company called Aperture Science, which competes with Black Mesa. The player must use a gun, called the Portal Gun, that makes two linked holes, called portals, to solve puzzles. The two portals, one blue and one orange, are linked together and let the player get from one place to another. When the player enters the blue portal, they will come out of the orange portal.\n\nPortal has many jokes in it that have become popular on the internet, for example, \"the cake is a lie\". Because the game was very popular, Valve made a sequel in 2011, called \"Portal 2\".\n\nThe game starts with Chell waking up in a small glass room that has only a bed, a toilet, and a radio inside. She is told by GLaDOS that testing will start soon, and an orange portal opens on one of the walls. Once the player goes through, she enters the testing rooms and begins testing. There are 20 testing rooms, called Test Chambers, in all.\n\nThe tests start out simple. Chell has to pick up boxes, called Weighted Storage Cubes (Cubes for short), and put them on buttons, which will open the door to the exit of the chamber. At this point, GLaDOS speaks to Chell as a guide, praises her, and promises her cake when the tests are over. Near the beginning of the game, Chell gets the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, also known as the Portal Gun. At first, her Portal Gun only makes blue portals and the orange portals are made by GLaDOS. Later, Chell gets the full Portal Gun and can make both blue and orange portals.\n\nThe tests become more and more dangerous farther into the game. In some rooms, there is poison on the floor. In others, there are balls of electricity called High Energy Pellets which will kill Chell if she touches them. During these tests, GLaDOS becomes more and more sarcastic, giving Chell useless advice, such as \"The floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it.\" At one point, GLaDOS tells Chell a chamber is broken and she must go through a chamber full of sentry guns, called Turrets, instead. If a Turret sees Chell, it will shoot at her until she dies. In this chamber is a hidden room. In the hidden room are drawings and writing on the walls left by an unknown person. The writing says things like \"the cake is a lie\" and \"she's always watching\" with a picture of a camera. There are more rooms like this in later chambers.\n\nIn another chamber, Chell has to use the Weighted Companion Cube, which looks like a Weighted Storage Cube with hearts on it, to solve the test. During the test, GLaDOS tells Chell several times that the Companion Cube is not alive, but at the end of the test, she tells Chell she has to \"kill\" the Companion Cube to get to the next test. \n\nDuring the last test, Chell has to stand on a moving platform. At the end of the platform's track, it will carry her into a fire pit. GLaDOS thanks Chell for doing the tests. At the last minute, Chell uses her Portal Gun to escape the trap. While trying to escape the building, Chell is led into a room where she finds GLaDOS. Chell breaks a white ball that fell out of GLaDOS. GLaDOS tells her she was stupid to break it because they did not know what it was, but GLaDOS quickly figures out it was her morality core. She tells Chell the people who worked for Aperture Science installed it to make her stop killing them with \"Deadly Neuro-Toxin\". Because Chell broke it, GLaDOS can use the Neuro-Toxin again. Chell has a time limit of 6 minutes to kill GLaDOS before the Neuro-Toxin kills Chell. After breaking pieces off of her and burning them, GLaDOS is destroyed and Chell escapes the building. \n\nAfter Chell escapes, she faints, and a robot drags her back into the building. During the credits, GLaDOS sings a song called \"Still Alive\" written by Jonathan Coulton, that says even though Chell killed her, she is still alive.\n\n\"Portal\" is a first-person shooter game, which means that it is played from the view of the player character, Chell. When players get the fully-powered portal gun, they can make two portals that are linked together on some white surfaces. Chell starts out with nothing, only able to do what GLaDOS lets her, such as entering portals created by GLaDOS and using cubes that GLaDOS gives her. Once Chell gets a half-powered portal gun, she can fire a blue portal that connects to orange portals that GLaDOS puts in the rooms. When Chell gets the fully-powered portal gun, she can put both portals anywhere. \n\nThe portals are linked, making a tunnel that Chell can walk through. The tunnel works in both directions, so if Chell enters a blue portal, she will exit from an orange portal, and if she enters an orange portal, she will exit from a blue portal. The purpose of the portals is to make shortcuts to different areas, for example, if the player needs to get to a high ledge but is unable to jump to it, they can put a blue portal at their level and fire an orange portal above the ledge. Going through those portals will get the player onto the ledge.\n\nThe portals can be used in different ways, notably as a way to catapult Chell. If the player cannot put a portal on a high ledge but can put one on a wall across from the ledge and one on the floor below, these portals can be used to propel Chell forward far enough to reach the ledge. This is because portals do not affect forward momentum. When Chell enters the portal in the floor and exits the portal in the wall, she will fall, gaining speed. If she goes through the portal on the floor again while falling, she will be going fast enough that when she exits the wall portal again, she will be able to land on the ledge.\n\nThe different ways the portals work together mean there are multiple ways to solve the puzzles in the Test Chambers.\n\n", "id": "188309", "title": "Portal (video game)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188342", "text": "Naked mole rat\n\nThe naked mole rat (\"Heterocephalus glaber\"), (or sand puppy) is a burrowing rodent. The species is native to parts of East Africa. It is one of only two known eusocial mammals (the other is the Damaraland mole rat). \n\nThe animal has unusual features, adapted to its harsh underground environment. \nThe animals do not feel pain in their skin. They also have a very low metabolism.\n\nTypically, the animals are between eight and ten centimetres long, and weigh about 30 grams. Their eyes are quite small, and they do not see very well. Their legs are thin and short. Nevertheless, they are very good at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. They have large, protruding teeth, which they use to dig. Their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging. They have little hair and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin.\n\nThe naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat: its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about two thirds that of a mouse of the same size. It only uses very little oxygen. In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, its metabolic rate can reduce by up to twenty-five percent.\n\nThe naked mole rat can only regulate its body temperature in the typical mammalian fashion over a relatively narrow range of temperatures. Outside this range, it overheats or cools. It can overcome this by its behaviour. When cold, naked mole rats huddle together or bask in the shallow parts of their burrow systems. When they get too hot, they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of their tunnel system.\n\nThe naked mole rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, mainly South Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.\n\nColonies averaging 75-80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts. The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length.\n\nThe naked mole rat is one of the two species of mammals that are eusocial. Only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony are workers. Workers do different things. Some are tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, and some primarily as soldiers, protecting the group from outside predators.\n\nThis eusocial organisation social structure, similar to that found in ants, termites, and some bees and wasps, is very rare among mammals. \n\nThe relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years. \"Reproductive suppression\" causes the other females not to reproduce: the infertility in the working females is only temporary, and not genetic. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors.\n\nMales and females are able to breed at one year of age. Gestation is about 70 days. A litter is usually from three to twelve pups, but may be as large as 28. The average litter size is 11. In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days. The young are born blind and weigh about 2 gm. The queen nurses them for the first month; after which the other members of the colony feed them feces until they are old enough to eat solid food.\n\nNaked mole rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as 1000 times the body weight of a typical mole rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations, but also eat their own feces (coprophagia). A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food—lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines help them digest the fibres. \n\nThe naked mole rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 28 years) and holds the record for the longest living rodent. The secret of their longevity is debated, but is thought to be related to the fact that they can shut down their metabolism during hard times, and so prevent oxidative damage. This has been summed up as \"They're living their life in pulses\".\n\nDue to their extraordinary longevity for such a small rodent, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole rat.\n\nNaked mole rats are not threatened. Despite their tough living conditions, naked mole rats are quite widespread and numerous in the drier regions of East Africa.\n\n", "id": "188342", "title": "Naked mole rat"}

These trains do not run on the London Underground anymore as they were replaced by the London Underground 2009 tube stock between 2010 and 2011. The stock was built by Metro-Cammell. The trains have also ran on the Woodford–Hainault section of the Central Line in the past.\n\nAn order to buy 30½ 8-car trains of 1967 tube stock was made in March 1964. They were built by Metro-Cammell. Each train is made up of two 4-car units that are joined together. The trains cost £2.25 million to build. Today this would buy just three trains. The first unit was delivered to West Ruislip depot on 27 September 1967, and the fleet was bought to run the Victoria Line. The units were then tested at the depot, before they were moved to Hainault depot and being tried out in passenger service on the Woodford-Hainault on the Central line. Once the tests were finished, the trains were moved from Hainault to Northumberland Park Depot using a battery locomotive. The trains were looked after at this depot until they were scrapped. It is the only part of the Victoria line that is not Underground, and it is unusual because, unlike the rest of the London Underground network, there is a staff rail link from Seven Sisters station.\n\nThe trains had Automatic Train Operation (ATO). The train operator controls when the doors open and close and also starts the train by pressing two buttons at the same time. These buttons start the automatic process of driving the train. The trains were built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs and were the first London Underground trains to have windows like this. The trains were delivered with a shiny grey coat, but this soon faded to a dull grey.\n\nWhen the extension Victoria line to Brixton opened in July 1971, a further 72 cars of 1967 tube stock were ordered, which made up 9 trains. This brought the total number of 1967 tube stock trains to 39½.\n\nIn 1989, a refurbishment programme was started across the whole fleet of London Underground rolling stock, following the King's Cross fire in 1987. The Victoria line stock was chosen to be the first to be refurbished (repaired, changed and made to look newer). The refurbishment was carried out by Tickford Rail at Rosyth Dockyard. The refurbishment was due to take 5 years to complete, but the last train did not leave the works until 1997, because each train was slightly different to the next train. When the trains had completed the refurbishment the outside was painted in a white, blue and red colour scheme. The insides of the trains have fire-resistant materials and are finished in the Victoria line blue colours, though some have the Bakerloo line brown as they run on that line too.\n\nThe last 1967 stock in passenger service ran on 30th June 2011.

This makes trip times longer, and increases queueing. This is also known as a traffic jam. Congestion may result from a decrease in capacity, for example accidents on the road or roads being closed. Bad road layouts can also restrict capacity. Increased traffic, for example by many cars leaving a sports stadium at the same time, can also cause congestion. \n\nWhere congestion is common, for example because of commuting in big cities, several methods are used to relieve it. Cars may be banned in certain districts or certain times, or made to carry passengers or pay a fee, or people may use public transport, such as rapid transit, which travel independently of car traffic and are not affected by traffic jams. \n", "id": "188391", "title": "Traffic congestion"}

It is built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby, England. The stock belongs to Bombardier's \"Movia\" type of train. Bombardier Transportation UK used to be known as ADtranz, and before that ABB Asea Brown Boveri. ABB Asea Brown Boveri built the 1992 tube stock which is currently used on the Central and Waterloo & City lines.\n\nForty-seven 8-car units will be built for use on the Victoria line. These replace the line's original 1967 tube stock. The trains are still being built. They were introduced by 2012, when all of the 1967 tube stock trains were completely replaced. The first 2009 tube stock train started running on the line with passengers on board on 21 July 2009. One new train will enter service every two weeks from early 2010.\n\nThe trains are part of a 3.4 billion pound contract that was awarded to Bombardier by Metronet. The contract was to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria and sub-surface lines. When it is finished this upgrade should make the lines and trains more reliable. There should also be an 8% decrease in journey times between stations, and a 16% overall decrease in journey times. This decrease is partly because the new trains have better performance than the 1967 tube stock that they are replacing. The new trains have a higher top speed of , a faster maximum acceleration of 1.3 m/s, a normal service deceleration of 1.14 m/s, and an emergency brake deceleration of 1.4 m/s. This is the same as the 1992 tube stock.\n\nDuring the busiest times of the day, or the \"peaks\", 43 trains should be available in service. This will be an increase of 6 trains over the 37 units of 1967 tube stock. The trains have seats for 252 people and standing space for an estimated 1196 passengers. This gives a 19% increase in capacity. The new trains also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting (to descend or step down) of passengers to decrease the times that the trains have to wait at stations.\n\nThe new trains are being built wider than the current 1967 tube stock. This is because the Victoria line has a larger than normal loading gauge compared to the other deep level tube lines. The larger size means that the new trains cannot leave the Victoria line except by road as they are too wide to travel on the other London Underground deep level tube lines. This means that to move the units, each car has to be , loaded onto a lorry, and then re-coupled when they are delivered. The trains have been built using Bombardier's technology called FICAS, which gives them a thinner bodyshell. Along with the larger size this gives more space for passengers.\n\nThe stock is the first to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations came into force. Because of this they will have more facilities for people with impaired mobility, including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access.\n\nThe design of the trains was finalised in September 2004, and manufacture of two pre-production trains began in January 2005. The first train was scheduled to be completed by mid-2006. Metronet announced on 3 February 2006 that the first of the pre-production cars had been completed to allow it to be tested without being moved. From 21 July until 4 August 2006, an example of the train was on show at Euston Square Gardens, near Euston Square tube station, for a Customer Acceptance Test followed by public display. From September 2006, the first of the two trains underwent testing at Bombardier's manufacturing and test site at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby. It was due to be delivered to London Underground by the end of 2006 for testing on the Victoria line during engineering hours (times after the line stops carrying passengers and repair and testing work is carried out), but this did not occur until May 2007. It will also be used for driver and maintenance training and familiarisation. The first of the trains was expected to begin passenger service for the Victoria line for evaluation purposes in July 2008, with the remainder of the fleet being delivered and entering passenger service in 2009. However, by October 2007 the date for the first train entering service had been moved to January 2009. The first train entered service on 21 July 2009, leaving Northumberland Park depot at 23:00 and forming train 277 leaving Seven Sisters at 23:55 to Brixton.\n\n", "id": "188399", "title": "London Underground 2009 Stock"}

It is carried by particles known as the W and Z bosons, which are gauge bosons. The weak force causes beta decay, a form of radioactivity. At extremely high energy levels, the force of weak interaction and electromagnetism begin to act the same, and this is called electroweak interaction.\n\nBeta decay is what scientists call a neutron breaking down, in contrast with alpha decay where an atom breaks down. These types of breaking down are more commonly known as radioactive decay. In a beta decay a neutron breaks into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. However, this is not completely true.\n\nBeta Decay begins with a neutron, which is made of one up quark and two down quarks. Since up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and each down quark has a charge of -1/3 this results as giving 2/3 -1/3 -1/3 = 0 charge. Due to weak force, if there are too many neutrons in an atom nucleus, one of the down quarks in one of the neutrons turns into an up quark. This would change the charge of the neutron from 0 to (2/3 +2/3 -1/3) = 1. From this, the neutron is no longer a neutron, but actually a proton (particle with a charge of +1). \n\nIn a strange quantum effect, this transformation releases a particle called a W boson. This is the gauge boson (force-carrying particle) of weak force. Oddly, the W boson weighs about 80 times as much as a neutron. This sort of thing actually happens very often in quantum mechanics, but it follows the conservation of energy because it happens so quickly. After 3x10 seconds, the W boson breaks into an electron and an electron antineutrino. (The electron antineutrino doesn't really do much). This releases the electron, and basically creates a proton from a neutron.\n\n", "id": "188543", "title": "Weak interaction"}

It does the opposite things of the sympathetic nervous system, the other part of the autonomic nervous system. This way, the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems balance each other's effects. The sympathetic nervous system helps a person \"fight or flight\" when they are in danger. When the danger is gone, the parasympathetic nervous system lets the person \"rest and digest,\" \"feed and breed.\"\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system has many different effects. It affects every part of the body, including:\n\nBecause of these effects, the parasympathetic nervous system always has to balance with the sympathetic nervous system. For example, if only the parasympathetic nervous system was working, a person's heart rate and breathing would keep getting lower and lower. Eventually the person would stop breathing or their heart would stop beating.\n\nHowever, in a healthy person, the brain realizes when the parasympathetic nervous system's effects are getting too strong. For example, the brain may realize that the person is breathing too slowly, or that their heart rate is too low. The brain reacts by making the sympathetic nervous system kick in. Because the sympathetic nervous system has the opposite effects, it will make the person breathe faster and raise their heart rate. These two systems have to balance each other constantly for a person to stay healthy.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is controlled mostly by the vagus nerve. This is an important nerve that comes from the brain and goes all the way down to the bottom of the spinal cord. The vagus nerve sends out chemical messengers called neurotransmitters - mostly one called acetylcholine.

He soon showed musical talent and was playing the organ for church services when he was eight. He studied at the Augsburg Conservatory and then the Munich National Theatre and at Mönchen-Gladbach. He became conductor of the Kiel Opera where, during three years, he conducted more than 50 operas in several German cities. Then, in 1934, he followed Karl Böhm and Karl Muck as the conductor of the Hamburg Staatsoper. He stayed there until 1949. He also was guest conductor in Amsterdam with the Concertgebouw Orchestra and later he became chief conductor. \n\nAfter World War II, Jochum became the first chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1949. He often conducted in London with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Symphony Orchestra. In 1975, the LSO gave him the title of conductor laureate. \n\nHe appeared regularly at Salzburg and, from 1953, Bayreuth. The first opera he conducted there was Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde.\"\n\nJochum is remembered especially for his warm, romantic performances of Anton Bruckner's symphonies.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188903", "text": "Big O notation\n\nBig O Notation is a way of saying how much time it takes for a mathematical algorithm to run or how much memory it uses.\n\nThe Big O Notation is often used in identifying how complex a problem is (also known as the problem's complexity class).\n\nIt is an expression that is meant to give a person a feel for the worst case time and/or space requirements of a program without them having to actually code and run the program on a real computer. This is also advantageous since different computers may have different hardware specifications and may produce the answer in different amounts of time should any program be run on them. The Big O notation, on the other hand, remains the same even if you're running a program on your desktop, a server or a supercomputer.\n\nLet us see how big O is used in practice. Consider for example that we're trying to find the maximum number from a given set of numbers. To find it, we have to look at each and every number in the set. If we were given twice the numbers, we would take twice as long to find the maximum number. Thus, finding the maximum in a set is formula_1 - the time or number of steps required to find an answer increases or decreases directly with increase or decrease in the size of the input. On the other hand, if an algorithm were said to be formula_2, then the time taken to produce the output would take a time that would square in magnitude with change in size of the input - for e.g. if someone gave an input that was twice as large as an initial input, the time taken would be formula_3 times as large.\n\nNotice that when we're talking about Big O, we mean the big picture. We're not talking about how the time changes when we're given a set of 10 or 20 numbers (in fact the big O, due to its mathematical definition, may even give wrong bounds at these small scales). Instead, we're considering a huge bulk of data - talk about analyzing data from the Hubble Telescope, for example - where you have 120GB of data pouring in every week. In such situations, it becomes unnecessary to give the \"exact\" relation between the input and the size of growth. Thus you won't find expressions like formula_4 or formula_5 - the formula_6 in the first case and the formula_7 in the second case are trivial when compared to formula_8 and the formula_9 terms respectively. So, you simply write them as formula_1 and formula_2. Expressions like formula_12 and formula_13 are avoided as well, because what we need is a gist of how the time for the output changes with the input. So again the expressions are written as formula_1 and formula_2 (actually speaking, the provision for this coefficient is contained in the mathematical definition of the Big O). \n\nLittle-o Notation: \n\nA stricter version of the big O is the little-o. The difference between big O and little-o is that little-o is a strict upper bound. While the big O says that \"the requirement may get as worse as this but not more\", the little-o says that the \"requirement will definitely not get worse than this\". As an example, if I say that a program is formula_1, then it means that the time requirement may grow directly with the size of the input, but if I say that a program is formula_17, i.e. little-o of n, then I'm saying that the time requirement will definitely not grow directly in proportion to the size of the input, the growth rate is somewhere less than it. So in a way, formula_17 is better than formula_1, if we're seeking to reduce the time.\n", "id": "188903", "title": "Big O notation"}

It was started in 1948 and intended by its creators to be \"free at the point of service\". This meant that people who use the NHS would not be required to pay for services each time they used them.\n\nThe NHS is paid for out of employee contributions from their wages and also from general government money raised in the form of taxes.\n\nThe promise of a health service that would be free at the point of service was broken almost right away with the start of prescription charges. Prescription charges are a set price that people within England must pay for each item on a prescription form. This charge is currently £7.10 for each item and is raised each year.\n\nThe NHS is made up of four systems: National Health Service (England), Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland, NHS Scotland, and NHS Wales. Each system is ran by its government. For example, National Health Service (England) is ran by the UK Government.\nThe systems are run in different ways depending on which country within the United Kingdom a person lives in. For instance, there are no charges for prescriptions in Scotland or Wales, but there are in England.\n\nThe service also provides basic dental services and prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and other services. There are normally charges at the point of service for these services unless one lives in a no-charge country or is considered a special needs case; such as children (aged up to 18, or up to 21 if you are a student), pregnant women, or the elderly.\n\nThe coalition government has made cuts to the NHS. On 29 September 2013 around 50,000 people protested in Manchester. They set up a stage with banners saying things like 'Save Our NHS' around it. Hospitals can now earn up to 50% of their income from private work.\n\nThe NHS has been criticized for working through a 'postcode lottery', meaning that access to quality treatment depends on where you live. The percentage of diabetics getting the NICE recommended levels of care ranges from 6% to 69% depending on where they live.\n\n", "id": "188972", "title": "National Health Service"}

The problem of trying to store the negative sign (−) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign.\n\nTo overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers: sign-and-magnitude and 2's complement.

These are called the mantissa and the exponent.\n\nThe mantissa is found by taking the real number and removing the decimal point, for example:\n\n1101 . 0111 would become 1101 0111\n\nThe exponent is the number of spaces the decimal point has moved.

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.\n\nIn Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, \"I found a great way to make money fast. The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all\". But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually \"earn money\". Instead, \"all\" of the scheme's money comes from the investors.\n\nOnce a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash. This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.\n\nThese schemes always stop one of three ways:\n\nThe scheme was named after a man named Charles Ponzi. He used the scheme after moving from Italy to the United States in 1903. (Ponzi didn't invent the scheme, though. In 1857, Charles Dickens wrote a book called \"Little Dorrit\" about a scheme like this. The scheme is a simple idea, and probably very old.) However, Ponzi's scheme was so big that it became the most popular. His original scheme was based on using countries' money-exchange rates to make money, based on international postage stamps. But money soon stopped being invested in coupons, and went to early investors, and a lot to Ponzi himself. \n\nPonzi schemes can be run anywhere, even online, and are being run even now.\n\nPeople advertising Ponzi schemes often use impressive words, that are actually very vague. Examples are:\nSchemers often depend on investors \"not actually knowing\" about economics. The Madoff scandal of 2008 showed that even sophisticated people like bankers can fall for them. People are fooled by the schemer seeming to have financial skill or reputation. \n\nSometimes, the schemers claim that money can only be made if the investment is kept a secret (away from the authorities or public). For example, Bernard Madoff only allowed the accounting firm run by his brother-in-law to perform audits on his \"hedge fund\", claiming it had to be kept a secret to earn money. \n\nSince the investment is very vague, not very many investors come very fast. But the scheme often gets speed like this:\n\nSchemers often try to tempt the early investors to \"re-invest\" the money they've \"earned\". Schemers sometimes send investors \"invoices\", showing investors how much they've \"earned\" and how much they'll keep \"earning\" if they keep \"investing\".\n\nSchemers also try to make sure new investors can't take their money back, by making the rules tighter. In this case, the schemer will often have a few investors say they kept their money, making the investment still look productive enough to be good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "189238", "title": "Ponzi scheme"}

He was a composer and pianist He got involved in the musical politics of his country, which was then the Soviet Union. A lot of people hated him, especially in western countries. He is particularly remembered for what he did at the unpleasant conference in 1948, when some of the most famous Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Prokofiev, were made to say they were sorry for the music they had written and that they would compose better music in future.\n\nIn the days of the Soviet Union, and especially under Stalin, musicians had to be very careful about what they did and how they composed. Music, like all arts, was supposed to make people feel that they were lucky to be living in a great country like the Soviet Union. If composers wrote music that the politicians did not like or understand, life became very difficult for them: they would not be allowed to compose, and their music could not be performed. They might even be sent to prison. Tikhon Khrennikov became Secretary to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948, at the time when Stalin was dictator. He continued in this job until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He made sure that all musicians obeyed their political leaders.\n\nIt is difficult for us today to judge the actions of Khrennikov fairly. He survived because he did what he was told by Soviet dictators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union he tried to say he was sorry for what he did. It is difficult to judge whether he really meant this.\n\nTikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders, in the town of Yelets in the Russian province of Lipetsk in central Russia. His family started to teach him the guitar and mandolin. When he was nine he started learning the piano, and when he was 13 he started composing. Three years later he was sent to the Gnesin Academy of Music, studying with the composer Mikhail Gnesin. In 1932 he went on to the Moscow Conservatoire. He studied composition with Vissarion Shebalin and piano with the famous teacher Heinrich Neuhauss who was later the teacher of Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter.\n\nHis early works include a symphony, a piano concerto, and an opera based on the book \"Into the Storm\" which was based on a novel \"Loneliness\", a favourite book of Stalin. His music was always happy and energetic. He wrote music for 22 films and many patriotic songs. He did everything he could to please Stalin, and soon he became Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers.\n\nIn 1948 he headed a conference at which Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Myaskovsky and Shebalin (who had been his teacher), were told that they were bad “formalists”. The word “formalist” has no meaning in music, but it was used by the politicians to describe anyone who was not obeying the politicians’ guidelines. Khrennikov said at the conference that “we will stop all manifestations of formalism and popular decadence\".\n\nShostakovich had given Khrennikov some friendly advice about his opera \"Into the Storm\", but Khrennikov had been angry about being criticized and now he could get his own back. Shostakovich made satirical remarks about Khrennikov in an opera \"Rayok\" which he never showed to anyone and was found amongst his papers after his death in 1975.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union Khrennikov published a book \"That’s the Way It Was\". In this book he says that everybody had to obey political rules and he was only doing what everyone else did. However, he then wrote some bad things about Shostakovich. Khrennikov had also been an enemy of the composer Alfred Schnittke. He banned his music from being played, and was furious when it was performed in other countries. He also banned music by other composers who have now become famous such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin.\n\nKhrennikov was, however, not all bad. He supported Shostakovich and Prokofiev for getting the Stalin Prizes in the 1950s. He also invited Stravinsky, who had been exiled to the United States, to revisit the Soviet Union in 1962.\n\nWhen he was in his eighties, Khrennikov continued to compose many comic operas, operettas and ballets. They always had tunes that were easy for people to enjoy.\n\nThe Soviet state gave him many prizes for the work he did: three Stalin Prizes, a State Prize of the USSR and a Lenin Prize. Before his death he was even given an award by Vladimir Putin, which makes it seem as if Russia might be returning to its past values.\n\nHe died in Moscow aged 94.\n\n", "id": "189305", "title": "Tikhon Khrennikov"}

The word \"dialysis\" comes from the Greek word \"dialusis\", \"dia\" meaning through, and \"lusis\" meaning loosening.\n\nDialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time, or for people who no longer have working kidneys. The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body. These minerals include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and sulfate. The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood. Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance.\n\nHowever the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol. Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney's function.\n\nDialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration. A very fine material, called a membrane, allows blood and fluid to flow through it. In the machine, the blood flows in one direction, and on the other side of the membrane, a special fluid, dialysate flows in the opposite direction. Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it, such as potassium and calcium. A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient. The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have. The blood and dialysate mix together. The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane.\n\nA dialyser is part of a dialysis machine. The dialyser filters blood like a kidney. It is made of a clear hollow cylinder with two inlets and two outlets. One inlet and outlet is at the upper side and downside which are for blood entrance and exit before and after purification. The other inlet and outlet are beside through which a supporter liquid goes into the dialyser.\n\nA dialyser has very thin fibres of cellulose. The fibres work as a semi-permeable membrane (SPM). There are about 10,000 of them. Impurities such as urea keratin leave through the SPM. Blood cells cannot go through because the blood cells are bigger than the impurities. The whole process of purification is supported by a liquid called dialysate. Dialysate is sent into the dialyser by the pump situated in the dialysis machine. The pure liquid goes in and the impure dialysate comes out. Dialysers are also called artificial kidneys.\n", "id": "189361", "title": "Dialysis"}

The libretto (words) are based on a comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais called \"The Barber of Seville\". It is Rossini’s most famous opera, containing some very well known tunes.\n\nThe first performance took place on 20 February, 1816 in Rome\n\nRossini’s opera was not the first one to be based on Beaumarchais' play. The composer Giovanni Paisiello had written one with the same title, and another was composed in 1796 by Nicolas Isouard. Paisiello’s opera was popular for a time, but soon Rossini’s opera became famous and Paisiello’s opera was forgotten.\n\nMozart's opera \"Le nozze di Figaro,\" composed in 1786 is also based on the same play, but it deals with the second part of the play (the play was in three parts).\n\nRossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly. He composed all the music for \"The Barber of Seville\" in less than three weeks. He borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier. \n\nWhen the opera was first performed on 20 February 1816 it was a big failure. The audience hissed and jeered the whole time, and there were several little accidents on the stage. At one point a cat walked onto the stage.\n\nThe second time it was performed it was a great success.\n\n\"The square in front of Dr. Bartolo's house\"\n\nThe story takes place in the town of Seville in Spain. It is supposed to be the 17th century. In a town square outside Dr. Bartolo's house a band of musicians are serenading outside the window of Rosina. Among them is Lindoro, who is pretending to be a poor student, but he is really Count Almaviva in disguise. He hopes that Rosina will love him. He pays the musicians who then leave.\n\nFigaro comes in. He used to be Almaviva’s servant. The aria that he sings is very famous. It is called \"Largo al factotum\". Almaviva asks him to help him meet Rosina, offering him money if he can do it. Figaro says he should disguise himself as a soldier and pretend to be drunk and to try and get into the house. \n\nInside Dr Bartolo’s house Rosina sings a song \"Una voce poco fa\" (\"A voice just now\"). \nRosina writes to the Count, calling him Lindoro, because she thinks that is his name. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo and Basilio enter. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio says that they should start to tell bad stories about him to get him out of the way.\n\nWhen they are gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a short note to Lindoro. She has already done this. She is surprised by Bartolo, but she manages to fool him.\n\nBerta, Dr Bartolo’s servant, tries to leave the house. She is met by the Count disguised as an drunken soldier. Bartolo cannot get rid of the Count, who manages to have a quick word with Rosina. He whispers to her that he is called Lindoro and gives her a letter. Bartolo is watching and is suspicious. He wants to know what the letter is about, but Rosina fools him by giving him a list of things to be washed. Bartolo and the Count start arguing. Basilio, Figaro and Berta appear and the noise is heard by the Officer of the Watch and his men. Bartolo thinks that the Count has been arrested, but Almaviva tells the officer his real name and he is immediately released. Bartolo and Basilio cannot understand why this happened. Rosina laughs at them.\n\n\"Dr. Bartolo's house\"\n\nAlmaviva comes to the doctor’s house again. This time he is disguised as a music teacher. He is pretending that Basilio is ill and that he has come instead. At first Bartolo is suspicious but he soon lets him in when he shows him Rosina’s letter. He gives Rosina a singing lesson. Bartolo thinks that Lindoro is one of the Count’s servants and that he is trying to get girls for the Count. Bartolo does not want to leave him alone with Rosina, so he gets Figaro (who is a barber) to shave him.\nWhen Basilio suddenly appears, Almaviva bribes him with some money and he goes away saying he is sick. Bartolo realizes in the end that it is a trick, and gets everyone out of the room. He goes to a notary to get a marriage contract made between himself and Rosina. He shows Rosina the letter she wrote to \"Lindoro\", and makes her think that Lindoro is a servant and cunning friend of Almaviva.\n\nThe stage is empty while the music creates a thunder storm. The Count and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter the room through a window. Rosina shows Almaviva the letter and says she is very sad. Almaviva tells her who he really is. Rosina now loves him. Figaro tells them they should leave. Basilio and the notary come to the front door and try to leave by the ladder, but it has gone. Basilio can either take a bribe a be a witness to the marriage or he can be shot dead. He decides, together with Figaro, to witness the signing of the marriage contract between the Count and Rosina. Bartolo rushes in, but is too late. Bartolo (who was the one who had taken away the ladder) is made happy when he is told he can keep Rosina's dowry.\n", "id": "189401", "title": "The Barber of Seville"}

Hockey player Wayne Gretzky was born in Brantford.\n\nBrantford became a city in 1877.\n\nFrom 1900 until 1950, Brantford had many companies that made equipment and machinery. Those items were sold in Canada and many other countries. Having the river and a railroad for transportation made it easier to ship the items made in Brantford. That helped Brantford change from a farming town to an industrial city.\n\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, business in Brantford was dropping and some companies like White Farm Equipment, Massey-Ferguson, Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and others stopped making products. Many people lost their factory jobs.\n\nA new piece of highway (Highway 403) was built in 1997. The new highway made it easier to drive Hamilton and Toronto, and also to Detroit and Buffalo. So, in 2004, Procter & Gamble and Ferrero SpA moved to Brantford. Now other companies set up in Brantford because it is a good location for shipping products to eastern North America.\n\n40% of people in Brantford did not finish high-school.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189506", "text": "Historical geology\n\nHistorical geology uses the principles and techniques of geology to work out the geological history of the Earth. It looks at the processes which change the Earth's surface and rocks under the surface.\n\nGeologists use stratigraphy and paleontology to find out the sequence of the events, and show the plants and animals which lived at different times in the past. They worked out the sequence of rock layers. Then the discovery of radioactivity and the invention of radiometric dating techniques gave a way to get the ages of the layers (strata).\n\nWe now know the timing of important events that have happened during the history of Earth. The Earth is about 4.567 billion (4,567 million) years old. The geological or \"deep time\" of Earth's past has been organized into various units. Boundaries on the time scale are usually marked by major geological or palaeontological events, such as mass extinctions. For example, the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Palaeogene period is defined by the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event. This marked the end of the dinosaurs and of many marine species.\n\nProspecting for energy sources and valuable minerals depends on understanding the geological history of an area. Such knowledge can also help lessen the hazards of earthquakes and volcanoes.\n\nThe largest defined unit of time is the supereon composed of Eons. Eons are divided into Eras, which are in turn divided into Periods, Epochs and Stages. At the same time paleontologists define a system of faunal stages, of varying lengths, based on the kinds of animal fossils found there. In many cases, such faunal stages have been adopted in building the geological nomenclature, though in general there are far more recognized faunal stages than defined geological time units.\n\nGeologists tend to talk in terms of Upper/Late, Lower/Early and Middle parts of periods and other units, such as \"Upper Jurassic\", and \"Middle Cambrian\". \"Upper\", \"Middle\", and \"Lower\" are terms applied to the rocks themselves, as in \"Upper Jurassic sandstone,\" while \"Late\", \"Middle\", and \"Early\" are applied to time, as in \"Early Jurassic deposition\" or \"fossils of Early Jurassic age.\" The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus \"early Miocene\" but \"Early Jurassic.\" \n\nBecause geologic units occurring at the same time but from different parts of the world can often look different and contain different fossils, there are many examples where the same period was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America the Lower Cambrian is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on trilobites. The same timespan is split into Tommotian, Atdabanian and Botomian stages in East Asia and Siberia. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons (time division) that can be used around the world.\n\nThe following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale. As above, this time scale is based on the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time.\n\n\n", "id": "189506", "title": "Historical geology"}

He played college football for Alcorn State University. McNair was murdered on July 4, 2009.\n\nMcNair was born in Mount Olive, Mississippi, USA McNair credits much of his success to his older brother, Fred, who played a very important part in raising McNair and his siblings, plus helping their mother. He and attended Mount Olive High School starting in 1987, where he played football, baseball, and basketball, and ran track. He led his school to the State Championship as a sophomore.\n\nMcNair was offered a full scholarship to the University of Florida to play defensive back but wanting to play quarterback. McNair played college football for Alcorn State University in the NCAA. In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves went 7–4. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8–3 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. \n\nAs a senior in 1994, McNair had nearly 6,000 yards rushing and passing, with 53 touchdowns and was named an All-American. McNair also won the Walter Payton Award as the top I-AA player and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Rashaan Salaam and Ki-Jana Carter. McNair set career records for the Football Championship Series with 14,496 passing yards.\n\nMcNair was selected by the Houston Oilers with new head coach Jeff Fisher. McNair stayed in Houston for a few solid years, although McNair was often used as a backup. Runningback Eddie George assisted McNair with his strong running. In 1997 (McNair's first year as a starter), the Oilers moved to Tennessee, and became the Titans before the 1999 season, and also began play in LP Field, or as it was called then, Adelphia Collesium, in 1999.\n\nEarly in the 1999 season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following Tennessee's 36–35 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, and needed surgery. He was replaced by veteran Neil O'Donnell. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4–1 record. McNair returned against the St. Louis Rams, and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games to finish 13-3.\n\nTennessee opened the at home against the Buffalo Bills in a Wild Card game, winning on the \"Music City Miracle\" and got to Super Bowl XXXIV in a re-match with the St. Louis Rams. On the final play of the game, a McNair pass to Kevin Dyson was complete, but Dyson could not break the plane of the goal line, giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a six-year contract with the Titans after the season.\n\nMcNair led the Titans to another solid 13-3 season in 2000, but it ended in a hard-fought playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round.\n\nIn 2001, McNair had passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He also had five scores rushing. McNair was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, but the game due to a shoulder injury.\n\nAfter a solid 2002 season, McNair was arrested for DUI (and he also had a handgun in his possession). However, all charges were eventually dropped. McNair and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning were named co-MVPs for the 2003 season, although McNair had to sit out two games. Injuries continued to bother McNair over the next two seasons, as he played in only eight games in 2004 and fourteen in 2005.\n\nOn June 8, 2006 McNair was traded to the Baltimore Ravens. McNair was given the starting job in Baltimore over the disappointing Kyle Boller. McNair started all 16 games in 2006, but often rotated in and out with Boller. McNair got the Ravens to a 13-3 record. McNair's 2006 statistics with the Ravens included 295 pass completions on 468 attempts for 3,050 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. McNair also ran for a score in a win against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nMcNair and the Ravens both had a bad season in 2007. The Ravens went 5-11, and McNair was often injured. Due to bad quarterback play, McNair would always play when healthy over Kyle Boller and rookie Troy Smith, but McNair still threw only two touchdowns next to four interceptions. That was his last year in the NFL. McNair had his retirement press conference with the Ravens in April, 2008.\n\nMcNair was married to Mechelle McNair from June 21, 1997 until his death. McNair had a farm in Mississipi, USA, where he would often go.\n\nMcNair had two sons by Mechelle: Steve LaTreal McNair, Steven O'Brian Koran McNair; and two sons - Tyler and Trenton - by two other women.\n\nMcNair earned the nickname \"Air McNair\" in High School. He opened his own restaurant in Nashville, which he named Gridiron9. McNair was also a mentor to quarterback Vince Young.\n\nOn July 4, 2009, McNair and 20-year old Sahel Kazemi were found dead in a condominium rented by McNair in Nashville. McNair had several gunshot wounds, and Kazemi had only one to the head. Kazemi had been arrested for DUI two days earlier, and McNair left with his restaurant chef in a taxi. Traces of gunpowder were found on Kazemi's hand, as well as a gun. Kazemi was having trouble financially, and apparently found out that McNair had other relationships. Police ruled this a murder-suicide, with Kazemi as the killer, McNair as the victim. Many people came to McNair's funeral, including some notable players, like fellow QB Brett Favre and former teammate Ray Lewis. Said Titans owner Bud Adams:\n\nTo the Associated Press, Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome added:\nMcNair was buried in Memphis on July 11, 2009.\n\n\n", "id": "189953", "title": "Steve McNair"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190009", "text": "Malus\n\nMalus is a genus of about 30–35 species of small deciduous apple trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae. Other studies say it includes 55 species, including the domesticated orchard apple, or table apple as it used to be called. The other species and subspecies are generally known as \"wild apples\", \"crab apples\", \"crabapples\" or \"crabs\".\n\nThe genus is native to the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and North America.\n\nApple trees are small, usually 4–12 m tall when full grown. The leaves are 3–10 cm long, positioned opposite from each other. They have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge. The flowers come from corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen, and an ovary which is below them. Flowering takes place in the spring and pollination is by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen). \n\nThe fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and (in some species) very like wood, and are rarely eaten raw for this reason. However, crabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly. Some kinds of crab apples make good applesauce.\n\nCrabapples are widely grown as trees for the pleasure of their appearance, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit. There are cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease.\n\nSome crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to stand up to cold or drought.\n\nThey are also used as tree for pollinating food apple trees in apple orchards. Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom at the same time as the apple trees in an orchard, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. See also Fruit tree pollination.\n\nBecause of the many blossoms and small sized fruit, crab apples are popular for use in bonsai. Because the trees are small due to the needs of the hobby, but still show the abundant fruit bearing of full-sized crab apples, it is important to thin out fruit so that trees do not stress themselves.\n\nApple wood \"makes a wonderfully firewood with a lovely scent [smell], and smoke from an apple wood fire gives a most excellent flavour to smoked foods,\" including Applewood cheese.\n\n", "id": "190009", "title": "Malus"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190022", "text": "Operation Ichi-Go\n\nOperation Ichi-Go (or \"Operation Number One\") was a series of battles between the armies of Japan and China. The battles happened between April and December 1944. There were three battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Hunan and Guangxi. The goals of Operation Ichi-go were to make a route to French Indochina and to capture bases that American bombers were using to attack Japan and her shipping.\n\nThere were two parts to the operation. In the first part, the Japanese secured the Railway between Beijing and Wuhan. In the second part they destroyed the US air forces in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou. Liuzhou was near the border with Japanese-occupied Indochina. \n\n400,000 men, 12,000 vehicles and 70,000 horses took part in operation Ichi-Go. The Japanese army included the very well trained Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo, North China and Japan. It was the largest land operation by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many of the new American-trained Chinese units were fighting in Burma under General Joseph Stilwell using weapons leased from the United States. Chiang Kai-shek had agreed that Stilwell could manage the distribution of American arms. \n\nIn \"Operation Kogo\", 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General Tang Enbo, defended Luoyang. The Japanese 3rd Tank Division crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated the Chinese near Xuchang. They then moved around to the right and put Luoyang under siege. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack on May 13 and won Luoyang on May 25.\n\nThe second part of Ichigo began in May. Japanese forces moved south and occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin and Liuzhou. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and completed the operation. Despite this success, US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The U.S. Air Force often stopped the railway between Beijing and Liuzhou that had been started in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945. \n\nUSA's XX Bomber Command were using B-29 bombers like the ones that were attacking Japan. They were forced to move as well, but this affected their efficiency for only a short time. In early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command.\n\nThe failure to hold the coastal airfields led to a loss of confidence in General Joseph Stilwell by Chiang Kai-shek. Stilwell was replaced in October 1944 by President Roosevelt. The new Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-Shek and commander of the U.S. Forces in China was Major General Albert Wedemeyer. Stillwell's other responsibilities in China, Burma and India were given to other officers.\n\nA very different version of events was that General Joseph Stilwell was asking for a fuller use of Chinese forces and had made diplomatic connections with the Chinese Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong. They had agreed to follow an American commander. \n\nBecause Chiang Kai-shek was ignored by the American general, he had Stilwell called back to the United States. \"New York Times\" reporter Brooks Atkinson wrote at the time: The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. America is now committed... to support a regime that has become increasingly unpopular and mistrusted in China, that maintains three secret police services and concentration camps for political prisoners, that stifles free speech and resists democratic forces... The Chinese Communists... have good armies that are now fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China... The Generalissimo regards these armies as the chief threat to his supremacy... has made no sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese...\nBut the \"Time Magazine\" article in which Atkinson was quoted went on to talk about the true failure of Stilwell's goals by saying that: The Chinese, exhausted by seven years of almost singlehanded war against Japan, were reluctant to give General Stilwell the troops he wanted for the Burma offensive; the Japs might suddenly crack down on them in earnest. When the Japs began the drive that last week seemed on the verge of cutting China in two, Chiang Kai-shek's Government might well have felt that its go-slow policy was justified...\" \n\nThis loss and the poor opinion in the U.S.A. caused the Americans to lose confidence in the Chinese troops. Instead the U.S. focused all its resources on the island-to-island war in the Pacific.\n", "id": "190022", "title": "Operation Ichi-Go"}

The painters and the sculptors attempted to continue in the romantic tradition, in bringing new ways of expression already popular in another countries. The more influential current was the Art Nouveau, even if the Polish artists started attempting also new forms of national style.

His father changed his name from \"György\" to \"Georg\" and changed his family name to \"Solti\". This was so that his name did not look Jewish, because there was a lot of antisemitism in Europe.\n\nHe learned the piano but, when he was 14, he heard Erich Kleiber conduct Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and he immediately wanted to be a conductor. He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, under Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, Leo Weiner and Ernst von Dohnanyi. By 1935 he was becoming known as a conductor. He conducted \"The Marriage of Figaro\" at the Budapest Opera in 1938. It was the first time he had conducted there, and it was also to be the last time. That very day, Hitler annexed Austria. Life became dangerous for Jews in Hungary. In 1939 he moved to Switzerland, where he continued a career as a pianist and won the Geneva International Piano Competition, but he did not have many chances to conduct there. His father became ill and died, so he never saw him again.\n\nAfter World War II Solti became music director of the Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich (where he gave the first performance in Germany of Paul Hindemith's opera \"Mathis der Maler\", which had been banned when the Nazis were in power. He conducted the Frankfurt Opera where he gave the first performance in Germany of Alban Berg's \"Lulu\". In 1951 he performed at the Salzburg Festival conducting Mozart's \"Idomeneo\".\n\nSolti often conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and it was arranged that he would be their main conductor (music director) from 1962. However, Solti changed his mind because they appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor without telling Solti. Mehta became musical director instead.\n\nIn 1961 Solti became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and stayed there until 1971. He was a great conductor, but made the musicians work very hard. With his bald head he got the nickname \"The Screaming Skull\". He spent much of his time in Britain and the United States. \n\nHis first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Valerie Pitts, a British television presenter whom he met when she was sent to interview him. They had two daughter]s, Gabrielle and Claudia. He was given an honorary Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1971. The next year he became a British citizen, and was then known as Sir Georg Solti. \n\nSolti helped many young musicians, training them in workshops and giving them opportunities to perform.\n\nSolti was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) from 1969 until 1991, when he was given the title of Music Director Laureate, the only CSO conductor to be given that title. He made them into a world class orchestra and took them on tours to other countries. He gave 999 performances with the CSO. He died before his 1,000th performance. A square near the Symphony Center in Chicago was called \"Sir Georg Solti Place\" in his memory. \n\nSolti also had other jobs. He was music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975. From 1979 until 1983 he was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time with the London Philharmonic he performed and recorded many works by Elgar including the two symphonies, the Violin Concerto with Kyung Wha Chung and the Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. In 1983 he conducted Wagner's Ring Cycle at Bayreuth for the only time. For the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Solti formed the World Orchestra for Peace, which consisted of musicians from 47 orchestras around the world.\n\nSolti worked with Dudley Moore on a 1991 television series, \"Orchestra!\", which was made to explain to people all about the orchestra.\n\nSolti never retired. He had many plans for concerts and recordings when he suddenly died of a heart attack on 5 September 1997 in Antibes, France He was given a state funeral, and was buried next to Bartók who had been his teacher and had helped him a lot. Solti’s widow and daughters began the Solti Foundation to help young musicians.\n\n", "id": "190109", "title": "Georg Solti"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190206", "text": "The Guardian Legend\n\n\"The Guardian Legend\" got mixed reviews from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" and \"Nintendo Power\". People liked the game for how it looked, sounded, and felt. Other people did not like the game because the play was the same. It also had a very long password. The game was not well-known at first, but it is more known now. It is an example of a game where players do different things.\n\nIn \"The Guardian Legend\", the player controls the female guardian of Earth, a \"robot transformer\"; the Japanese version of the game calls her \"Miria\". The player is to destroy the alien moon Naju before it gets to Earth. The player needs to turn on the moon's self-destruct device and escape the moon before it gets to Earth. Five alien tribes who try to control the moon stand in the way of the player. To help players along, messages left by a person help guide them in finding the safety switches to turn on the self-destruct device. These messages also help players get to some other rooms.\n\nThe player controls the Guardian in human form while walking on Naju's surface, called the \"Labyrinth\". When in Naju, the Guardian turns into a spaceship in which the player can move around. The Guardian has a life meter that drops when hit by alien attacks. Players can pick up items to help fill the Guardian's life meter again. If the life meter runs out, then the Guardian dies, ending the game. The player can shoot at aliens with different types of weapons by pressing buttons on the gamepad. Players get different and better weapons during play.\n\nRound, colored creatures in the game named \"Landers\" appear in the game to help players. Landers can help fill the Guardian's life meter and increase the number of times players can fire weapons. Blue Landers may sell weapons to players. They also give out passwords. Passwords let players stop the game and come back to it later.\n\nThe player goes through the Labyrinth and find entrances to the Dungeon. The ten safety devices are located in the Dungeon. The Labyrinth is made up of many rooms that are as big as the screen. Players can look at a map to see where they are at. This map can be looked at while the game is paused. Players can either walk from one room to another, or they can go to another room through a \"warp panel\". Some of these warp panels require the right key to go through. Many rooms contain aliens. Other rooms contain clues, shops, passwords, and entrances to the Dungeon.\n\nThe Dungeon contains areas in which the Guardian flies through as a spaceship. The Dungeon has many aliens to destroy. At the end of an area in the Dungeon, there is a boss, a very strong alien that must be destroyed. After destroying the boss, the Guardian flies out of the Dungeon and back into the Labyrinth. The player then gets a power-up. The player may also receive a key for a warp panel. Some entrances to the Dungeon are already open. Other entrances need a certain task completed before going in. Clues in the Labyrinth tell players how to get into these entrances.\n\n\"The Guardian Legend\" was made for the Famicom and came out in 1988 in Japan. It came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990. The people who created the game were the same who created \"Guardic\", \"Zanac\", and \"Puyo Puyo\".\n\nReviewers liked the game for its multiple features. Some have compared the game to other Nintendo games like \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"Metroid\". Mike Engler, who made \"Retro Game Challenge\", said that \"\"The Guardian Legend\" is one of the best games ever released\". The game was nominated by \"Nintendo Power\" magazine in 1989 for \"Best Graphics & Sound\", \"Best Play Control\", and \"Best Overall\" but did not win any of them. Some of the music of the game were remixed.\n\n\n", "id": "190206", "title": "The Guardian Legend"}

It was the sixth yearly Vengeance event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the situations that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the \"Raw\" brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.\n\nThe main event was a 5-on-2 Handicap match, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as three against two, or five against two, between D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey). Triple H and Michaels won the match after pinning Kenny and Mikey, respectively. Two other matches were on the card. In singles matches, John Cena beat Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, which featured wrestlers from the \"Raw\" and \"ECW\" brands at ringside. The other featured match was for the WWE Championship, in which Rob Van Dam beat Edge to keep his title.\n\nVengeance made over $400,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 6,800 and received 320,000 pay-per-view buys, which helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $21.6 million compared to the year before. When the event was released on DVD, it reached the number one position on \"Billboard's\" DVD Sales Chart. \n\nThe event had eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers played either villains or heroes as they followed a series of events, which lead to a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to the \"Raw\" brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other two being \"SmackDown!\" and \"ECW\".\n\nThe main event scripted into Vengeance was between D-Generation X (DX) Triple H and Shawn Michaels versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Ken Doane<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Johnny <nowiki>[</nowiki>Johnny Jeter<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Mitch <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Mitchell<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Nicky <nowiki>[</nowiki>Nick Nemeth<nowiki>]</nowiki>, and Mikey <nowiki>[</nowiki>Michael Brendli<nowiki>]</nowiki>) in a 5-on-2 Handicap match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as five against two. The story for the match began after Backlash, \"Raw\"'s previous pay-per-view event, where The McMahons (Vince and Shane) defeated Michaels and \"God\" in a tag team match, with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. For weeks on \"Raw\", Michaels got revenge on both Vince McMahon and the Spirit Squad, until the May 22 episode of \"Raw\", where the Spirit Squad were scripted to injure Michaels' left knee. Then, by orders of McMahon, Triple H was to \"break Michaels' skull\", with a sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do what McMahon ordered and instead attacked the Spirit Squad, thus turning into a hero. Two weeks later, McMahon put Triple H in a gauntlet match, against the Spirit Squad. In the match, Kenny grabbed a steel chair and put it on Triple H's left knee, similar to what the group did to Michaels. Mitch, who was the only member not participating in the match, was thrown out from the backstage curtain by Michaels. Then, Michaels joined Triple H in the ring as they began to beat down the four members of the Spirit Squad. This lead to Michaels and Triple H reforming D-Generation X for the first time since their teased reunion in 2002. That same night, McMahon scheduled the Spirit Squad and D-Generation X in a 5-on-2 handicap tag team match. On the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", DX marked their return, when the duo humiliated the Spirit Squad as DX dumped green slime onto the group and embarrassed the team afterward, by beating them.\n\nOne of the featured matches was between John Cena and Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of \"ECW on Sci Fi\" on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who tried to leave through the \"ECW\" crowd, was attacked by Cena, because he caused Cena to lose the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and Cena wanted revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at \"Raw\" the next week. The next week on \"Raw\", Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to wrestle Cena in a match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW wrestler, Sabu, who, in the premiere of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\" won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, (a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left and declared winner) where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a match. Sabu beat up Cena and performed a leg drop on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the \"Raw\" announcers' table. The following night on an episode of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\", Cena went to the \"ECW\" locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme lumberjack match, which Sabu accepted.\n\nThe other featured match was between WWE Champion Rob Van Dam defending the title against Edge. The story for the match began on the television premiere of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\", when Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship by Paul Heyman, making Van Dam a double champion by holding both the ECW and WWE Championship. Van Dam's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend, Lita. Edge, who was number one contender for the title, told Van Dam that they both had a lot in common, meaning that they were both Money in the Bank winners and successfully became WWE Champions. Edge ended his speech by giving Van Dam some kind words and then attacking him. On the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", Van Dam attacked Edge, moments after Edge won a match against Ric Flair.\n", "id": "190212", "title": "Vengeance (2006)"}

It has an axial shaft with a tip of a certain shape that fits into the head of a screw. On the other end of the screwdriver is a cylindrical handle to be held by a person's hand. As the handle is rotated, it creates a torque that turns the tip via the screwdriver's shaft. There are many different sizes and kinds of screwdrivers. A screwdriver is usually identified by the shape of its tip. The tip is shaped in a certain way to match the groove cut into the head of a screw. A screwdriver is, therefore, a mechanism to apply torque to a screw and turn it in tight spaces.\n\nScrewdrivers come in a large variety of shapes and sizes to match those of screws. If a screwdriver that is not the right size and type for the screw is used, it is likely that the screw will be damaged in the process of tightening it. Many screwdriver designs have a handle that can be used with different tips. The shaft and the tip can be removed from the handle, and a different one can be attached instead. The shaft and the tip are together called a \"bit\" (as with a drill bit). This allows a set of one handle and several heads to be used for a variety of screw sizes and types.\n\nMost screwdrivers are operated manually, but there are some that use an electric or other motor to rotate the bit. They are used to drive screws quickly into various materials. There are different types of driver bits that let a drill drive different types of screws. The bit can be removed and swapped with another bit of a different shape. Many types of drills are able to be used as power screwdrivers. The best have a control over how much torque force is used, which allows the screws to be tightened to a specific level.\n", "id": "190352", "title": "Screwdriver"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190713", "text": "Plasma display\n\nTelevisions with plasma display panel (PDP) are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition. Only a few television use a PDP.\n\nPlasma screens are made of two sheets of glass with two gases stored between the sheets. The gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers, or spaces. Behind each space are a series of red, blue and green phosphors that give off light when struck by radiation. When electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen. They work in a very similar way to fluorescent lamps used for lighting.\n\nPlasma screens have been in use since 1964 but only two colors could be produced then. Now we have high definition Plasma screens up to 150 inches in size. In the early 21st century fewer plasma screens were made as people bought more liquid crystal displays.\n\nPlasma TVs have more pixels (tiny dots that when put together can create an image on a picture) per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube (CRT) screens so they can produce a much sharper image. In the old style of CRT screens the pictures were made up of lines. If you look closely at a Plasma screen you will not see any lines. You will find out that most Plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters. They are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods.\n\nOne of the big advantages is the space saving. The problem with old cathode ray tubes is that they needed a lot of space so that the rays can fire upon all areas of the screen. The wider the screen, the larger the volume of the television would be. The average Plasma television is around 6 to 8 inches deep. Moving your Plasma onto the wall can really increase the amount of floor space and they can be looked at from almost any point in the room (usually 180 degrees)\n\nPlasma screens are also very light especially when compared to a rear projection TV. A 40-inch Plasma TV will weigh from and provided you purchase a suitable bracket (that can hold the TV up to the wall) they can be hung very easily to a suitable wall. When fixing to the wall you need to make sure you choose a bracket which tells you the highest weight it can carry. Most brackets can be tilted if you want to view from a different angle.\n\nPlasma TVs can display up to 16 million colors so not only are they great for watching TV programs, they also make a good screen for the latest computer games consoles. Most Plasma TV's have inputs for HDMI and laptop computers connections making them ideal to use to display products and sales messages in offices and shops.\n\nYou will also find out that they are very easy to watch even on a sunny day or a very bright room. Unlike the old CRT screens they are not hard to see in bright areas.\n\nBecause of the phosphor technology in Plasma TVs, it is possible for traces of an image to be 'burned-in' to the display, meaning you might see little traces of it even while watching other images. This is a concern in commercial uses, where images are shown for long periods of time. Burn-in can generally be avoided by making sure the screen does not show the same image for a long time (sometimes as little as 20 minutes), either by turning the television off, or changing the channel.\n\nThough Plasma TVs are much brighter than rear-projection TVs, direct view and LCD TVs are often brighter still. Latest generation Plasma TVs have improved on brightness, but a warning is do not view where it is too bright or sunny.\n\nAlthough Plasma TVs are much lighter and thinner than direct view and rear projection TVs, an LCD TV can be even more light and slim. LCD TVs use the same technology as used in most laptop computers. You should know that LCD TVs are not really available in the same sizes as Plasma TVs, and if they are, they usually cost much more.\n\nPlasma screen TVs cost much more than CRTs and a little more than LCDs.\n\nCompared to other television technologies, Plasma TVs have a shorter life span. Most Plasma TVs have a life span of 20,000-30,000 hours based on maker's estimates. This life span is commonly referred to as the Plasma TV half-life, as it is the number of hours over which the Plasma TV will lose approximately half of its brightness.\n\nPlasma TVs break easily and it is possible to break them if you are not careful, and the parts are quite easy to damage. You must take a lot of care when moving them.\n\nAs technology has been made better, Plasma screens have a much longer life and you should expect 30,000 hours of use. In other words, your television would need to be on for 16 hours a day, every day for the next 5 years. By the time your TV needs replacing higher definition models will have become available. Most of us should not be worried as it will give years of enjoyment\n\nThe first Plasma televisions for home use were expensive, as much as US$5000 for a basic small model. As the technology improved and production increased, prices became smaller. In the 21st century some 37-inch models sold for $1000 or even less. Buying a CRT television became rare as LCD became the usual kind.\n\n", "id": "190713", "title": "Plasma display"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190790", "text": "Fashion design\n\nFashion design is the art and profession of designing clothes and related items like hats, purses, bags and shoes.\n\nFashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as attractive. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn. They have a range of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. \n\nSome clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and every-day wear.\n\nFashion design started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term \"couturier\" was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered fashion design.\n\nDuring this period many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs began as an economy.\n\nThe garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories\n\nUntil the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a made-to-measure or haute couture basis. Each garment was made for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make. Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.\n\nReady-to-wear clothes have elements of haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a city-wide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of Fashion Week include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.\n\nCurrently the fashion industry relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. In order to save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.\n", "id": "190790", "title": "Fashion design"}

Amy is also facing the difficulties of her family coming apart, and other problems with her friends and boyfriend \"Ben Boykevich\" (played by Kenny Baumann).\n\nDuring the summer at band camp, Amy Juergens meets Richard \"Ricky\" Underwood, who persuades her into having sex. Amy learns that she has conceived a child at the beginning of the school year. Her best friends \"Lauren Treacy\" (played by Camille Winbush) and \"Madison Cooperstein\" (played by Renee Olstead) are the first ones to know about her being pregnant. Madison unknowingly spreads word that Amy is pregnant, and Amy considers abortion before telling her parents. Soon, Amy's younger sister Ashley finds out. After some time during an argument at the Juergens' home, Amy admits being pregnant and her boyfriend Ben learns too. Ben remains faithful to her during and after her pregnancy. So that the child is not born out of wedlock, Ben and Amy secretly get married illegally.\n\nMeanwhile, Ricky develops relationships with \"Adrianne Lee\" (played by Francia Raisa), \"the school slut\" and \"Grace Bowman\", a spunky, innocent girl. Ricky gets Adrianne to have sex, but fails trying to have sex with Grace, who had wanted to save herself for marriage to her on-and-off boyfriend \"Jack Pappas\" who betrayed her by sleeping with Adrianne. \n\nAmy's parents, \"George Juergens\" (played by Mark Derwin) and \"Anne Juergens\" (played by Molly Ringwald) start having tensions and get a divorce.\nAfter the divorce of Anne and George, Amy's child is born. The baby was named John by Ashley because it was a \"clean simple name, his life would already be complicated enough\". Ashley and her father (George) moved in together in a house next door, and Anne is expecting a baby boy of her own after she slept with her new boyfriend, David. The baby turns out not to be David's, but it's George's. George and Anne will move back in together, which Amy does not like. Amy's nemesis Adrianne is moving into George's old house, which Amy does not like either because Adrian only wants to spy on her boyfriend, Ricky, and Amy. Amy does not want Adrianne near her baby.\n\nGrace has sex with her boyfriend Jack against her father's will. After that Marshall Bowman passes away in a jet crash and Grace lives in misery thinking she killed her father by sleeping with Jack. She thinks God is punishing her. She starts a teen abstinence group (TAG) and a dead parents club. \n\nMeanwhile, Ben Boykevich wants to go to Bologna, Italy for the summer to work. Amy feels insecure, because she is worried Ben might fall in love with someone else. Amy wants to go, but can not because she has to care for John. Since she can not go, she wants Ben to stay where she can keep any eye on him, but Ben goes to Italy anyway. When he comes back, his personality is changed and Amy thinks that Ben slept or fell in love with someone else. When she asks Ben if he fell in love in Italy, he says no but Amy thinks he's lying, and she thinks Adrianne might know whether he is telling the truth or not. This sparks part of Amy's hatred for Adrianne.\n\nBen's dad falls in love with a former prostitute named Betty, but Ben does not trust her at first, because he thinks Betty is only in love with his dad for his money.

They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide.\n\nDownes was born in Birmingham, England. His father worked in a bank. He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d (16 shillings and 10 pence, which is 84p in modern British money) a week. \n\nHe had been playing the piano and violin since he was five. When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music, and began playing the cor anglais. He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen.\n\nIn the 1960s, he married Joan, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. She later became a choreographer and television producer. They had two children: a son, Caractacus (born December 1967), who became a musician and recording engineer, and a daughter, Boudicca, who became a video producer.\n\nIn 1952 he started his work in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where he was assistant to Rafael Kubelík.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190943", "text": "Assisted suicide\n\nAssisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide (wants to die) is helped to do this by someone else. Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves.\n\nThe law about this varies a lot in different countries. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances. However, in many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison.\n\nSome people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life.\n\n", "id": "190943", "title": "Assisted suicide"}

This means that, if a person is very ill and wants to die, the doctors and nurses help them to end their life. Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped. The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want.\n\nDignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest (for example, so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies). The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die. There must be evidence for this, i.e. the patient has to sign a paper, and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing. If the patient is too ill to sign, a video film can be made. The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want. If everyone is absolutely sure, then he or she is given a drug which will kill them.\n\nSome people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die. For example, the rugby player Daniel James, who was 23, had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down, travelled there with his parents to die.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190948", "text": "Euthanasia\n\nMany people have diseases that cause pain, or that make them suffer. Ending the lives of these people to take away their suffering is called euthanasia. This is sometimes regarded as different from assisted suicide, which is where someone helps another person to kill themselves. It is also different to murder, where the intent is not to end the person's suffering, but to kill them for the killer's own ends. Euthanasia can be voluntary, where the and Belgium. Where it is permitted it is very tightly regulated, and it is only permitted in cases where the patient is terminally ill.\n\nWhen discussing euthanasia, euthanasia is generally separated into active and passive euthanasia, and voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. Many people see important differences between these different types of euthanasia, so that they can accept some types but not others.\n\nPassive euthanasia can be described as \"letting die\". When passive euthanasia occurs, a terminally ill person is allowed to die, even though treatment could have allowed them to live longer. Examples of passive euthanasia include removing life support from a patient, (such as a ventilator which is being used to keep the person alive), or not providing a patient with food or water. Active euthanasia, on the other hand, involves deliberately acting to end a person's life. This may occur through giving them an injection of a drug that will kill them, or by giving them pills that will result in their death.\n\nSome people see passive euthanasia as a more acceptable choice, because it does not involve a deliberate act to kill. However, others argue that once someone has decided to allow another person to die, they should make it as fast and as painless as possible, and act to bring about their death. Also known as mercy killing.\n\nIf someone asks to be allowed to die, or if they ask to be killed, then they have asked for \"voluntary euthanasia\". Voluntary euthanasia is often seen as the best by people who believe in euthanasia, because it is clear that the person wants to die. If the person can not say that they wish to die, but people think that they would ask to die if they could, then it is \"non-voluntary euthanasia.\" Non-voluntary euthanasia is sometimes a choice for people who are in a coma or who are very young, as they can not say what they want to do. \"Involuntary euthansia\" is when someone is killed even though they asked not to die, or when they could have asked to die but did not. Many people do not think that this is euthanasia. Instead they think that it is murder.\n\nThe types of euthanasia, active/passive and voluntary/non-voluntary/involuntary can be put together. If someone asks to die, and another person gives them an injection that will kill them, then it is active voluntary euthanasia. But if someone is in a coma and is only alive because of a ventilator, and the doctors turn the ventilator off and they die, then it would be passive non-voluntary euthanasia.\n\nSome people believe that euthanasia should be allowed, and some people think that it should not be allowed.\n\nEven if euthanasia is not a bad thing, some people believe that allowing euthanasia will result in bad things happening. If euthanasia is allowed to happen for people asking to die, people might then think that it is ok to allow euthanasia for people who are very sick but are not able to ask to die. And if that was allowed, then maybe they would allow euthanasia for people who are very sick and will not recover, but do not want to die. This is called the \"slippery slope\" argument.\n\nPeople who believe in the slippery slope argument point to times when this seems to have happened. In Germany, Adolf Hitler allowed disabled children to be killed, and called it euthanasia. People today agree that what Hitler did was very wrong, but some people think that if euthanasia was allowed it would lead to similar things happening again. So they think that it would be too big a risk to allow euthanasia at all.\n\nOther people say that this is wrong. There is a big difference between killing someone who is very sick, in pain, and asks to die, and killing a child just because they have a disability. They say that it is not true that allowing euthanasia will lead to bad things. They also say that what Hitler did was not euthanasia, and did not happen because they allowed euthanasia.\n\nPalliative care is when people who are ill are given special care to make them more comfortable. In regard to euthanasia, palliative care can be given to patients who are dying. It may include hospice care, when the patient is sent to a special hospital that is just for people who are dying, and which is meant to make their death as comfortable as possible. Palliative care can involve pain relief and help for the patient and family to come to terms with death. In some cases, doctors will give patient drugs which make them stay asleep, so that they will not feel pain.\n\nPalliative care is not perfect, and so it is not always seen as a replacement for euthanasia. There is still some pain, and there can be other side-effects, where the patient can still feel very sick. Palliative care is not available for all people, and not all people who wish to die through euthanasia are sick so that they will die soon – some people have healthy bodies, but they are suffering in other ways, and palliative care will not always help them.\n\nThe principle of double effect was first described by Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago. It says that it is sometimes ok to do something even if a bad thing will happen if a good thing also happens, and if it was the good thing that they wanted. Aquinas used the example of self defense: sometimes when they are attacked a person will kill the attacker, but the death of the attacker was not what the person was trying to do. They only wanted to protect themselves. So even though killing someone is bad, what they wanted to do – protect themselves – was not.\n\nSome people say that doctors may treat a person in order to reduce the pain that they are suffering, but that as a result the person will die sooner. If the doctor gives the treatment in order to help the patient die, then it is euthanasia. But if the doctor gives the treatment in order to stop the pain, and does not intend for the patient to die, then it may not be euthanasia, even if the doctor knew that the treatment would kill the patient.\n\nSuicide is when a person kills themselves. Sometimes when a person is very sick they need help to die, and if someone helps them to kill themselves, it is called assisted suicide. In some countries people are allowed to help someone to kill themselves, so long as they do not kill the person, and it can be seen as a more acceptable option because it must be the person's own decision. Because a second person did not kill the other person, it is not always considered to be euthanasia, as some people see an important difference between someone killing themselves and someone killing another person, and they believe that euthanasia is only when a second person kills the first.\n", "id": "190948", "title": "Euthanasia"}

He is particularly remembered for his work in Manchester with the orchestra called The Hallé.\n\nHarty was born in Northern Ireland, the fourth of ten children. His father was a church organist. He learned to play the viola, piano, and organ. When he was twelve he was organist at Magheracoll Church, County Antrim. He also had organist jobs at Belfast and Dublin. In 1900 he went to London where he was soon known as a composer and an excellent piano accompanist. In 1904 he married the singer Agnes Nicholls. For her he wrote a piece for soprano and orchestra called \"Ode to a Nightingale\". \n\nHe soon became known as a conductor, conducting the London Symphony Orchestra and, from 1920, The Hallé, which he made into one of the best orchestras in England.\nHe conducted works by many composers, some of whom were little known at the time: they included Bax, Sibelius, Berlioz, Moeran, Walton and Richard Strauss. He gave the first performance in England of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony.\n\nHarty was knighted in 1925. He resigned from The Hallé in 1933 after there had been a lot of arguments. After that he mainly conducted in London, as well as in United States and Australia. \n\nHarty composed many pieces during his early years, including \"An Irish Symphony\", a tone poem \"With the Wild Geese\", a \"Violin Concerto\", and \"Ode to a Nightingale\".\n\nHarty was ill for the last five years of his life. He had a brain tumour. He was looked after by his secretary Olive Baguley, because he had separated from his wife. He died in Hove near Brighton.\n\n", "id": "191045", "title": "Hamilton Harty"}

He organized the classic works of Confucianism and contributed to the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism.He was from Fujian province in China. \n\nZhu Xi was born Wu Yuan, North East Jiangxi province. His father died when he was at the age of thirteen. He continued his studies until he passed the test for a government job. He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the time he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan. In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions. After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the \"Book of Changes\" like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the \"Great Learning\", the \"Doctrine of the Mean\", the \"Analects of Confucius\", and the \"Mencius\" as the core curriculum (thing to learn) for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries (big reviews) that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as their standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905.\n\nAccording to Zhu Xi, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish (tell apart) between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought (thought before), and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said \"Knowledge and action always require each other.

The aim was to restore the then derelict Taff Vale Railway station, and establish a steam hauled passenger service to Cardiff Queen Street station. By 1994, a short section of track existed, and the steam locomotive \"Sir Gomer\" hauled short passenger trains.\n\nBy 1997, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was in charge of the redevelopment of Butetown, and dismissed the idea of a rejuvenated steam railway as part of their plans.\n\nEven prior to 1997 the railway started negotiations with the Vale of Glamorgan Council and moved in during 1998 to its new base at Barry Island Railway. It renamed it self the Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company and were based there till early 2009 operating heritage services both steam and diesel over an expanding network of lines.\n\nFollowing the December 2007 decision by landlords, the Vale of Glamorgan Council to terminate the £65,000 funding of the Barry Island Railway, the society maintain a service. However less than six months after withdrawing financial support, the council with out warning decided to put the railway site out to tender under a long term lease. There were three bids submitted with the sucsefull bidder being the commercial company Cambrian Transport who have been the councils railway adviser and contractor since the Barry Railway Project started.\n\nThe other bidder NEWCO was submitted by Graham Lee owner of the LH Plant, Hunselt Engine Company, Statfold Barn Railway and Mike Thomson owner of Arrowvale who make black boxes for the rail industry. NEWCO had spoken to the VGR in advance and agree a method of working together. Had this bid been successfully the VGR would have continued operating at Barry.\n\nThe Railway has recently sold assets following the break down of talks with Cambrian Transport which an has been forced to leave Barry. It is now the intention for the railway to relocate to the Bridgend Valleys Railway, with some stock also going to the Dean Forest Railway and further a field.\n\nThe Railway is now working with the Bridgend Valleys Railway to develop the 4.5 miles of line in place north of Bridgend.\n", "id": "191399", "title": "Vale of Glamorgan Railway"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191403", "text": "Epping Ongar Railway\n\nThe Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway. It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.\n\nThe branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton.\n\nThe trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used. At one stage, it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail. This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch.\nIn the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line. Over time, permission was given to electrify the line in 1957. However, because the electrification did not cost much, the branch was only able to have special two- or three-car trains running on it. This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars. Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms. This would mean that the normal 8-car trains would not be able to stop at them. Because of this, the Epping-Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line. However, for two days each year, trains did run through from London. These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening. The normal Epping-Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping. The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable. However, this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight.\n\nDuring the late 1960s it became clear that the number of people using the line had not become as high as people thought that it would. Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land. The number of people using the line peaked in 1971, and it was still only 650 people every day. This meant that the line did not make very much money. London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980, but they were not able to. Instead, fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays.\n\nBlake Hall was permanently closed in 1981. Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day. The station building still survives as a private residence. However, the platform was removed, but recently (2015) partially reinstated to a very high standard.\n\nNorth Weald station's platform one was closed in 1976. The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box. This signal box is still on the southbound platform. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals.\n\nThe line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey. It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed to the public, with one months notice. From this time on, the Central Line terminated at Epping station. When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day. Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Kelvedon Hatch.\n\nCravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three-car unit of 1960 stock. This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line.\n\nThe line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998. Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line. Their offer was for £339,500. However, Pilot Developments matched the offer and got London Underground to accept it. Martin Bell, an independent politician, said that this was \"the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years\". He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians.\n\nThe line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004. It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society. An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated. Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale. However, it is currently not possible to get off the train there.\n\nBetween 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works. The works included general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers. At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings.\n\nAt the end of 2007, the railway was sold to a new private owner. This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given. The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line.\n\nIn early 2008, the line was closed to passenger trains. This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works. The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again. To make this happen run-round loops and signalling, amongst other things, must be built.\n\nPassenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU. Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170. There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line. The line also has some small diesel shunters; a Drewry shunter (works number 2566, current number D1995), named \"Heather\" by the railway, and two Ruston 88 shunters (RH 512572 is in service, RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display). The line employs a Harsco tug unit (\"Badger\") for engineering work. The EOR's fleet also includes a small works trolley, a Shark brake van, a Dogfish ballast hopper, and a box van for permanent way duties. \n\nAt one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock. Units 1616 and 1491 (formed as an eight-car train) were purchased in 1996, and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998. These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003, respectively, after they were destroyed by vandals.\n\n", "id": "191403", "title": "Epping Ongar Railway"}

Segovia, 1654) was an important Spanish organist, composer, and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period.\n\nWe do not know very much about Correa de Araujo. He was probably born in 1584. He may have been of Portugese origin. In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville. It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money. Many years later he seems to have become a priest. He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist. In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money. Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time. By 1635 his health was very bad. In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money. \n\nAfter 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Jaén Cathedral. He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral. He worked there until 1653, by which time he was too ill to work. When he died the following year he was very poor.\n\nCorrea only seems to have published one collection of organ works. It was called \"Libro de tientos y discursos de música practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica\" (1626). This was a collection of organ music, as well as a discussion about music theory. It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time. His organ music uses a divided keyboard (medio registro), so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard (high notes and low notes) can use different stops (making different sounds). The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty. The pieces at the end are very hard indeed. He uses a lot of dissonances, and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments, even if they are not shown in the music. He uses glosa (ornamental figuration), although he also uses counterpoint. His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia.\n\n", "id": "191454", "title": "Francisco Correa de Arauxo"}
