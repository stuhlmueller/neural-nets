This data is a product of the origin and subsequent evolution of the Milky Way. The spectroscopic measurements will find the physical properties of each star observed, their luminosity, temperature, gravity and elemental composition. The massive stellar census will provide the basic observational data. With the data, astronomers hope to tackle a range of important problems, like the origin, structure, and evolutionary history of our galaxy. Large numbers of quasars, galaxies, extrasolar planets and Solar System bodies will be measured at the same time.\n\nGaia is being launched using a Soyuz rocket from its Guiana Space Centre (GSC) in French Guiana.

Planets, stars, galaxies, and other outer space objects may be viewed and recorded. This category does not include observatories in space which are pointed toward the earth for the purpose of reconnaissance and other types of information gathering.\n\nAll observation of space from Earth is filtered through the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere filters and distorts what is seen and recorded. Space-based astronomy is vital for frequency ranges outside the optical and radio windows. For example, X-ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from the Earth. It has reached its present importance in astronomy due to orbiting X-ray telescopes. Infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked by the atmosphere. Most space observatories are in low Earth orbit.\n\nIn 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer was the first to propose a telescope in outer space, a decade before the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, \"Sputnik\".\n\nSpitzer said a large telescope in space, above the Earth's atmosphere, would see better. His efforts resulted in the world's first space-based optical telescope, \"Hubble Space Telescope\", which was launched on April 20, 1990 by the Space Shuttle \"Discovery\" (STS-31).\n", "id": "430339", "title": "Space observatory"}

Using interpolation requires an exact fit to the data. With smoothing, a \"smooth\" function is constructed, that fit the data approximately. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fit to data observed with random errors. \n\nFitted curves can be used to help data visualization, to guess values of a function where no data is available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data. This is subject to a degree of uncertainty, since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data. \n", "id": "430358", "title": "Curve fitting"}

This is particularly true of the Church and Christianity, which are nearly all Latin derivatives. Common Brittonic was replaced in most of Scotland by Gaelic. South of the Firth of Forth it was replaced by Old English (which later developed into Scots). Common Brittonic survived into the Middle Ages in Southern Scotland and Cumbria. Common Brittonic was gradually replaced by English throughout England. In the north of England, Cumbric disappeared as late as the 13th century.

It is used to apply both to the seven kingdoms and to the time period in which they existed.\n\nThe idea of a heptarchy, a group of seven independent kingdoms, is thought to have come from the English historian Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century. He listed the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in his \"Historia Anglorum\" (History of the English People). Bede, however, set up the idea that several kingdoms were more dominant than others (at different times). He created a list of kings who dominated the other kingdoms as . The dividing line between these kingdoms was the River Humber. Northumbria (Deira and Bernicia) was the northern kingdom while the remaining kingdoms were those of the southern English. The actual term 'heptarchy' was first used in the 16th century by William Lambarde. His 1568 woodcut map is the earliest known use of the term.\n\nThe term heptarchy is sometimes used to imply a between the kingdoms that did not exist. From the 6th century to the 9th century these were simply seven kingdoms set up by the Germanic invaders and their descendants. There was little equality between them.

The Heptarchy basically ended with the coming of the Vikings. The term heptarchy was popular among scholars from the 16th to the 19th centuries but is only occasionally used today.\n\nOriginally Bede listed seven kings who held authority (\"\") over the other kingdoms in England at the time.

In 1938 Szasz moved with his family to the United States. He studied medicine at the University of Cincinnati. However, he was more interested in politics and philosophy. In 1956 Szasz became a professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York in Syracuse.\n\nSzasz was a heretic in psychiatry. This means that his opinions were very different to the ideas generally accepted within psychiatry. He said that psychiatry is a pseudoscience. He compared it to religion. In \"Schizophrenia: The Sacred Symbol of Psychiatry\", Szasz argued that schizophrenia is a symbol that is 'worshipped' by psychiatrists in the same way that Christians worship Christ. He said that mental illness is not an illness of the brain but \"problems of living\". People described Szasz as being 'anti psychiatry'. In response to this Szasz wrote a book called \"Antipsychiatry: Quackery Squared\".

The kingdom of Essex covered the area of the modern English counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex and (for a short while) Kent. Kings of Essex frequently found themselves under the control of other Anglo-Saxon overlords. The territory of the East Saxons included the two Roman provincial capitals of Colchester and, for a time, London. In the Tribal Hidage the East Saxons were listed at 7,000 hides. \n\nWhen they arrived in England the Saxons, like the Angles, Jutes and Frisians, were Pagans. After the Saxons gained control of Kent they set themselves up in the territory of Essex. The first attempts to convert the East Saxons to Christianity came in 604 with the arrival of Bishop (later Saint) Mellitus in London. Athelberht (King of Kent was the overlord of southern England and helped in the conversion of King Saebert of Essex. Athelberht built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St. Paul’s Cathedral now stands. After the death of Saebert in 616, Mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. King Oswi of Northumbria convinced King Sigebert of Essex to become Christian. Sigebert then invited Chad to become Bishop of London. By 874 the Great Heathen Army held much of Essex.

In 2005 he was put in prison for not paying taxes. On 20 December 2013 Putin let him out of prison. He lives in Germany, but he may move back to Russia if he wishes. Khodorkovsky would have been released in August 2014.\n\nKhodorkovsky was born in Moscow to a Jewish father and Russian mother. He went to the Mendeleev Chemistry and Technology Institute.\n\nIn 2003, Khodorkovsky was named Person of the Year by \"Expert\", sharing this title with Roman Abramovich and, in 2004, Khodorkovsky was the wealthiest man in Russia and one of the richest people in the world, ranked 16th on Forbes list of billionaires.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Khodorkovsky accumulated wealth by developing Siberian oil fields. He was the head of Yukos, one of the largest Russian companies to emerge from the privatization of state assets in the 1990s.\n\nHe was arrested on 25 October 2003. The government under Vladimir Putin then froze shares of Yukos shortly thereafter on tax charges. The state took further actions against Yukos, leading to a collapse of the company's share price. This destroyed most of Khodorkovsky's wealth. He was found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. While still serving his sentence, Khodorkovsky and his business partner Platon Lebedev were further charged and found guilty of embezzlement and money laundering in December 2010, extending his prison sentence to 2014. \n\nKhodorkovsky was pardoned by President Vladimir Putin following lobbying for his release by Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and released from jail on 20 December 2013.\n\nThere is widespread concern internationally that the trials and sentencing were politically motivated. During Putin's presidency, it became clear that many state assets had been sold far below their true value. This was shown as soon as shares became available on the open market. The conspiracy theory is that, wanting to recapture Yukos for the state, a way was sought to put an end to Khodorovsky's control.\n\nThere was a confrontation between state auditors and Yukos auditors as to the extent of Yukos' profits. It was claimed for Yukos that a large part of the profits were covered by investments in plant (pipelines, etc.), and exploration. The upshot was that Khodorovsky was charged with tax evasion.\n\nThe trial process was criticised abroad for its lack of due process. Khodorkovsky lodged several applications to the European Court of Human Rights. In response to his first application, which concerned events from 2003 to 2005, the court found that several violations were committed by the Russian authorities in their treatment of Khodorkovsky. In particular, the court ruled that Khodorkovsky's arrest was \"unlawful as it had been made with a purpose different from the one expressed.\" Despite these findings, the court ultimately ruled that the trial was not politically motivated, but rather \"that the charges against him were grounded in 'reasonable suspicion'\".\n", "id": "430614", "title": "Mikhail Khodorkovsky"}

In both situations, the homeowner is at least several months behind on payments. In a foreclosure, the bank or lending institution seizes the house, and they now own it and have to try to sell it themselves (or through an agency). In a short sale, the homeowner agrees with the bank to sell it for less than it is worth on the market. The banks would maybe agree to this because it means the house will get sold, saving them the selling responsibility. But they are losing money, because the house is selling for less than it is worth. Sometimes, they make the homeowner pay the balance, and sometimes they forgive it.\n\nShort sales are not always a great deal because of the highly inflated prices of the housing bubble. For example, if a house that normally costs $100,000 was suddenly 'valued' at $200,000, and someone got a loan for that amount, they would want to re-sell it for $200,000 or even more to make a profit. However, values dropped. So now, they may short sell (less than it is worth) the house for $175,000, and lose $25,000. But to a new buyer, that $100,000 house is probably still not worth $175,000.

In 604 he conquered Deira and became the first King of Northumbria. Aethelfrith was the first great leader among the Angles north of the River Humber. Bede called him an ambitious and powerful king who cruelly ravaged the Britons more than any other English leader. He was killed in battle against the East Angles.\n\nAthelfrith was the son of Athelric of Bernicia and grandson of Ida of Bernicia. In 593 Athelfrith became King of Bernicia. According to Frank Stenton \"The continuous history of Northumbria, and indeed of England, begins with the reign of Athelfrith...\" Among the northern Angles, Aethelfrith was the first great leader. He gained more territory from the Britons than any other English leader.\n\nIn 595 a large force of Britons, and Picts came together at \"Din Eydin\" (Edinburgh). They attacked the Angles of Bernicia at a place identified as Catterick. Among those killed at this battle called \"Catraeth\", was Owen of Rheged, Athelfrith's enemy. Owen had killed Athelfrith's father, Athelric. The remaining force of Britons, Gaels and Picts was completely defeated, most of them being killed. In 603 Athelfrith fought another great battle at a place called \"Degsastan.\" Dál Riatan Scots, under their king Aedan mac Gabrain came against the English and were completely defeated. Athelfrith's victory eliminated the Scots as a threat for a long period of time in northern Britain. Bede, writing in 731, wrote that up to his day no king of the Scots had attempted to wage war against the northern English again. The only remaining enemy to cause Athelfrith any concern was the Britons of Strathclyde.\n\nIn 604 Athelfrith attacked Deira to his south. King Athelric of Deira was killed. Athelfrith also tried to kill Edwin of Deira, Athelric's brother, but Edwin escaped. He took Edwin's sister, Achaas, as his second wife. In 605 Athelfrith united the two kingdoms, Bernicia and Deira, into a single kingdom called Northumbria. He must have spent the next few years setting up ways to govern such a large territory. He almost certainly set up fortifications as well. By 613 Athelfrith began trying to capture Edwin who had since been in exile in Gwnedd and Powys. He moved his army across the Pennines to Chester. When several monks were sent by the Britons to negotiate with Athelfrith they were killed. Between 613 and 616 Athelfrith defeated the Britons in battle at Chester. Edwin escaped again this time to Mercia, then to East Anglia. Athelfrith wanted the king, Raedwald of East Anglia, to murder Edwin, but he would not. Concerned that Athelfrith might attack East Anglia, Raedwald took his army and attacked Athelfrith. The two armies met at the River Idle near Doncaster. Not seeing the East Angles as a major threat, Athelfrith brought a smaller army. Athelfrith was killed after he was separated from his bodyguards. Edwin returned to Northumbria to become the king. At Athelfrith's death his family fled north to find safety. Eanfrith, the eldest son, found safety with the Picts. He married the sister of Gartnait, King of the Picts. His Oswald and Oswiu found safety with the Scots in Argyll.\n\nAthelfrith took a British or Pictish wife named Bebbe. The Bernician royal city of Bamburgh is named for her.

Beginning in the early 5th century Dál Riata covered the area of what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland. They came from the area of County Antrim in Northern Ireland where they were called 'Scots'. Other groups from Ireland followed. These groups also established themselves on the west coast as far south as Cornwall. The colony from Irish Dál Riata were known as the \"Scotti\" to the Romans. It was this group that later gave their name to Scotland.\n\nAt the time they began to colonize Dál Riata the only other people living in the far north of Britain were the Picts. They occupied the eastern part of Scotland north of what is now Edinburgh. About A.D. 297 they were mentioned by Roman writers regarding an attack along Hadrian's Wall. Even at this early period the Romans encountered Irish \"Scotti\" assisting the Picts even though they had not yet moved there permanently. So the two groups were seen by the Romans to be allies. How Dál Riata in Scotland was seen as a colony still controlled from Ireland is not clear to modern historians. Some view the Dál Riatans as having their own local kings with their overlord in Ireland. Others saw it as being ruled by one king. Dál Riata became the home of the Irish monk Saint Columba. He established a Christian community on the isle of Iona. He brought Christianity to the whole of Scotland, Gaels and Picts. \n\nThe kingdom rose to power under their king Aedan mac Gabrain. He became their king in 574. In 603 Aedan led his people against Athelfrith of Bernicia at a place called \"Degsastan.\" The Scots were completely defeated. Defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of Domnall Brecc (d. 642) ended Dál Riata's dominance. The kingdom came under the control of Northumbria, then subject to the Picts. The kingdom's independence ended in the Viking Age, as it merged with the lands of the Picts to form the Kingdom of Alba.\n\n<br>\n", "id": "430691", "title": "Dál Riata"}

At only 25 light-years from Earth, it is a relatively close star and one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.\n\nVega has been extensively studied by astronomers: this led it to be called \"arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun\". \n\nVega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded. It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the astronomical brightness scale.\n\nVega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun. Both stars are at present near the midpoint of their life expectancies. \n\nVega has not much of the elements heavier than helium. Vega is a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner. It is spinning rapidly with a velocity of 274 km/s at the equator. This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects, and, as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles. From Earth, Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles.\n\nBased on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation, Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting disk of debris, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega-like stars. Irregularities in Vega's disk also suggest the presence of at least one planet, likely to be about the size of Jupiter.\n", "id": "430826", "title": "Vega"}

Other types such as ragtime also used to be popular.\n\nAfrican-Americans started influencing mainstream American music in the 19th century when they performed in minstrel shows.\n\nThe period from the end of the First World War until the start of the Depression in 1929 is known as the \"Jazz Age\". In 1920 the first vocal blues recording, \"Crazy Blues\", was made by the Vaudevillean singer Mamie Smith. After this blues sung by African American females became popular. The most popular female blues singer was Bessie Smith. She was a big influence on other jazz singers. She sung a song called \"Squeeze Me\" that was composed by Fats Waller. In 1921 Black Swan Records was started in Harlem. It was the first record label owned by an African-American. In December 1928 Pinetop Smith recorded \"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\". The song influenced the boogie-woogie style of music. In the late 1920s the trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong became one of the most famous jazz musicians in the world.\n\nIn the early 30s swing music developed. In the late 1930s people were worried that barbershop music would die out, and there was a barbershop music revival. 1935-1946 is known as the swing era. At this time it was the most popular music in America. Big bands played swing music.\n\nR&B music began in the 1940s. Until 1948 it was called \"race music\". In 1949, the term \"Rhythm and Blues\" replaced the \"Billboard\" category Harlem Hit Parade. The trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie helped create the first modern jazz style, bebop. In the 1940s the jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday became popular.\n\nIn 1955 the single \"Tutti Frutti\" was released by Little Richard. It sold over a million copies. He was one of the first black musicians to be popular among both white and black people. Little Richard called himself the \"king of rockin' and rollin', rhythm and blues soulin'\". People have described \"Tutti Frutti\" as being the song that began rock and roll. Singer and guitarist Chuck Berry also helped to make rock and roll with songs like \"Maybelline\". Big Mama Thornton was the first person to sing \"Hound Dog\" in 1952. It was number one on the \"Billboard\" R&B charts in 1953 for seven weeks. It sold nearly two million copies. However, in 1956 Elvis Presley, a white singer, sung the song and was more successful. It sold 10 million copies. Presley was very influenced by African-American music. He made rockabilly, a kind of rock and roll, popular. Some black people say that Presley was nothing more than a racist white Southerner who stole black music.\n\nJames Brown became popular towards the end of the decade. He helped create funk music. Gospel began its golden age after World War II. In the 1950s soul music also started to appear. Etta James and Clyde McPhatter contributed to the creation of soul. Soul was a kind of non religious gospel music. Soul and R&B influenced the sound of girl groups, only some of which were white.\n\nA type of jazz called free jazz started to develop. Ornette Coleman helped to make it.\n\nIn the 1960s Jimi Hendrix released psychedelic rock music. He died in 1972. His music was very influential. However, rock music is often thought of as a white genre.\n\nStevie Wonder's first album \"The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie\" was released on Motown in 1962. Wonder was 12 years old. When he was 13 he had his first number one, \"Fingertips\". The soul singer Marvin Gaye helped to shape the sound of Motown Records with songs like \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\". He became known as the \"Prince of Motown\". Ray Charles had crossover success on ABC Records. This meant that he was popular with both black and white people. While with ABC Records, Charles became one of the first African-American musicians to be given artistic control by a mainstream record company. In the 1960s a record label called Motown released lots of successful singles. An R&B group called The Miracles were their first successful act. Smokey Robinson had started the group in the 1950s. He became the vice president of Motown. The girl group The Supremes were Motown's most successful act.\n\nIn 1960 The Shirelles had the first number one single by a girl group, \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\".\n\nHip hop started in New York City in the 1970s. 1979 was an important year for hip hop. In 1979 Sugarhill Gang released the single \"Rapper's Delight\". It made hip hop/rap popular in the United States and around the world. That year Lady B released \"To the Beat Y'All\". She was the first female solo hip hop artist to record music.\n\nIn the 1970s disco also became popular. African American disco musicians included Donna Summer and The Jackson 5. KC and the Sunshine Band had mostly African American members. Diana Ross left The Supremes in 1970 and released her first album the same year. Ross was named the most successful female music artist in history in 1993 by the \"Guinness Book of World Records\".\n\nIn the 1980s the success of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" helped to make African American music more popular. \"Thriller\" was released in 1982 and it is the best-selling album of all time. It was produced by Quincy Jones. Jackson was one the first African American pop icons. In 1982 Marvin Gaye also had a number one single \"Sexual Healing\". In 1983 it won Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Instrumental Performance. The funk musician Prince became popular. He had four number one singles in the United States. Whitney Houston released her first album in 1985. The album had three number one singles. This made Houston the first woman and first African American woman to have three number ones from one album. Michael Jackson's younger sister Janet Jackson started a pop career. Her third album \"Control\" had five American top five singles and was one of the decade's most important albums.\n\nFollowing the beginning of hip hop's popularity in 1979, in the 1980s hip hop developed more complex styles.\nThe mid 1980s is called the golden age of hip hop. Artists from this time include Run–D.M.C., Wu-Tang Clan, A Tribe Called Quest and Public Enemy. The gangsta rap group N.W.A started in 1986. Their music was banned from lots of radio stations. In the late 80s jazz rap started to be developed.\n\nIn the 1990s more female African American musicians became popular following the success of Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston. The girl band TLC released their first album \"Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip\" in 1992. It sold six million copies.\nMariah Carey, who has a white mother and African-American father, released her first album, \"Mariah Carey\", in 1990. It reached number one in the United States. Since then she has sold over 200 million albums, singles and videos. This makes her one of the best selling artists ever. Mary J. Blige released her first album, \"What's the 411?\", in 1992. It combined hip hop and soul. People gave her the name \"Queen of Hip Hop Soul\" due to this. It sold 3.4 million copies. \"Billboard\" ranked her as the most successful female R&B artist of the last 25 years.\nIn 1990 the girl band Girl's Tyme was started by Beyoncé Knowles and LaTavia Roberson. In 1996 they changed their name to Destiny's Child. In 1997 the band became well known from their single \"No, No, No\". Their 1999 single \"Say My Name\" reached number one and later won three Grammy Awards. In the 2000s the band continued to be successful with two more studio albums.\n\nR&B singer R. Kelly released his first album in 1993. He has since sold 40 million albums. He produced Aaliyah's 1994 album \"Age Ain't Nothing But a Number\" and wrote Michael Jackson's 1995 number one single \"You Are Not Alone\".\n\nR&B boy band Boyz II Men became popular in 1991 with their first album \"Cooleyhighharmony\" on Motown. They were the fourth most successful group of the 90s.\n\nHip hop duo Outkast released their most successful album so far, \"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\" in 2003. It won Album of the Year and Best Rap Album at the 2004 Grammy Awards.\n\nRapper Kanye West's first album \"The College Dropout\" was released in 2004. It entered the American album chart at number two. It has sold over four million copies around the world. Since then West has released five more albums on his own and one with Jay-Z in 2011. All of the albums have reached number one.\n\nToday, African-American musicians such as Beyoncé Knowles are among the most popular musicians in the world. There are more popular white musicians than ever who make African American music. Examples include Amy Winehouse, Adele, Eminem, and Macklemore. In 2013 there were no number one singles by black musicians in the US. This was the first time this had happened in the \"Billboard\" chart's 56-year history. For 44 out of the 52 weeks of 2013 the number one spot on the R‬&B and Hip-Hop Songs Chart was taken by white musicians.\n\nThe National Museum of African American Music is in Nashville.\n", "id": "430867", "title": "African-American music"}

All are within a few light years of each other. Their Bayer designations are Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Theta Tauri. They form a pattern which was identified as the head of Taurus the Bull. Epsilon Tauri, also known as Ain (the \"Bull's Eye\"), harbours at least one gas giant planet.\n\nThe age of the Hyades is about 625 million years.

It is in the Milky Way galaxy, about 3.5–5 kiloparsecs (12000–16000 light years) away from Earth. \n\nIt is the most massive compact young star cluster known in the entire Local Group of galaxies. It was discovered by Bengt Westerlund in 1961. It remained largely unstudied for many years due to high interstellar extinction (absorption) in its direction. In the future, it will probably evolve into a globular cluster.\n\nThe cluster contains a large number of rare, evolved, high-mass stars, including: 6 yellow hypergiants, 4 red supergiants, 24 Wolf-Rayet stars, a luminous blue variable, many OB supergiants, and an unusual supergiant sgB[e] star which may be the remnant of a recent stellar merger. In addition, X-ray observations have revealed the presence of a strange X-ray pulsar, a slow rotating neutron star that must have formed from a high-mass progenitor star. Westerlund 1 is believed to have formed in a single burst of star formation, so the stars have similar ages and compositions.\n\nApart from hosting some of the most massive and least-understood stars in the galaxy, Westerlund 1 is useful as an example of a relatively nearby, so easier to observe, super star cluster to help astronomers find out what happens in extragalactic super star clusters.\n\nWd1 is too far away for direct measurement of the distance by parallax measurements, so the distance must be got from the expected absolute magnitude of the stars and estimates of the extinction towards the cluster. This has been done, giving estimates of 5 kpc and 3.6 kpc by different methods. These estimates all place Wd1 near the outer edge of the Milky Way's galactic bar.\n", "id": "431057", "title": "Westerlund 1"}

It had many fenestrae (openings) and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth. They were replaced often: about every 14 days the whole set were replaced together. The jaws may have had a keratinous sheath, something like a wide beak. Its jaws were wider than the skull, and its teeth were placed far to the front.\n\n\"Nigersaurus\" was long, which is small for a sauropod, and had a short neck. It weighed around 4 tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant. Its skeleton was filled with air sacs, which lightened the weight. Its limbs were robustly built. \n\n\"Nigersaurus\" was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was small, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat (near rivers).

It is known locally as \"The Village\". The primary school, post office, the island's two hotels, the Bishop's House and the ruins of the Iona nunnery are here. The abbey and MacLeod Centre are a short walk to the north. There are a number of offshore Islands nearby. Eilean Annraidh (island of storm) and Eilean Chalbha (calf island) are larger islands to the north. Rèidh Eilean and Stac MhicMhurchaidh Islands lay to the west of Iona. Eilean Mùsimul (mouse holm island) and Soa Island are to the south.\n\nAt the start, Iona was a part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata. The island was the site of a highly important monastery during the Early Middle Ages. According to tradition the monastery was founded in 563 by the monk Columba, also known as Colm Cille, who had been exiled from his native Ireland. Columba and twelve companions went into exile on Iona and founded a monastery there. The monastery was very successful, and played a large part in the conversion of the Picts to Christianity. It also had an influence on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Many other monasteries were founded in Scotland and Iona became the center of a great monastic system. The scriptorium produced many very important documents.\n\nThe monastery itself became the center of Celtic Christianity. Iona was a major supporter of the \"Celtic\" system for calculating the date of Easter. The missionaries and bishops who came to Britain from Rome used a Roman calculation for the date of Easter. This issue was settled when they adopted the Roman system at the Synod of Whitby in 664. Pictland adopted the Roman system in the early 8th century. Iona changed systems in 716, according to the Anglo-Saxon historian Bede. Iona's prominence was reduced over the next centuries as a result of Viking raids and the rise of other powerful monasteries in the system, such as the Abbey of Kells. The Book of Kells was created on Iona about the year 800. At about the same time the island's high crosses were erected. They had a ring around the top part that became the symbol called a \"Celtic cross\". The series of Viking raids on Iona began in 794 and, after its treasures had been plundered many times, Columba's relics were removed and divided two ways between Scotland and Ireland in 849 as the monastery was abandoned.\n\nAs the Viking control of the west coast of Scotland advanced, Iona became part of the Kingdom of the Isles. Amlaíb Cuarán, King of Northumbria and Dublin, died in 981 while on Iona. Still, the island was sacked twice by his successors. On Christmas night 986 and again in 987. The ruling dynasty of Alba traced its origin to Iona, and the island thus became an important religious icon of the new kingdom. Many of its early kings are buried there. The kings of the Isles were at times vassals of the King of Norway, High King of Ireland, or the King of Scotland. By the 11th century they were nominally attached to the Kingdom of Norway, but in reality they were independent.\n\nA convent for Benedictine nuns was established in about 1208, with Bethóc, daughter of Somerled, as first prioress. The present Benedictine abbey, Iona Abbey, was built in about 1203. The monastery itself flourished until the Reformation when buildings were demolished and all but three of the 360 carved crosses destroyed.\n\nAccording to tradition, the first \"King of Scots\" was Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín). He founded the beginnings of what we know as Scotland in 843. The Reilig Cemetery on Iona was from that time until the 11th century the place where Scottish kings were buried. In total there are about forty-eight Scottish kings buried at Iona. In addition, eight kings of Norway and four kings of Ireland are buried on Iona.\n\nFollowing the 1266 Treaty of Perth the Isles (Hebrides) were restored to Scottish rule. An Augustine nunnery survives as a number of 13th century ruins, including a church and cloister. The nunnery continued to be active until the Reformation. By the 1760s little more of the nunnery remained standing than at present, though it is the most complete remnant of a medieval nunnery in Scotland.\n\nIn the 19th century green-streaked marble was commercially mined in the south-east of Iona; the quarry and machinery survive.\n\n", "id": "431281", "title": "Iona"}

She was also an East Anglian princess and Abbess of Ely.\n\nAethelthryth was born in East Anglia (now Suffolk). She was one of the four daughters of Anna of East Anglia. All of these women became nuns and founded abbeys.\n\nShe was a beautiful young girl who wanted to devote herself to the Church and took a vow to remain a virgin. When the \"\" Tondberht of the South Gyrwas. asked for her hand in marriage her parents said yes, but Aethelthryth refused. Though she was married she resolved to keep her solomn vow. Upon his death in 655, she retired to the Isle of Ely, which she had received from her husband as a gift.\n\nAethelthryth was then married to Ecgfrith of Northumbria in 660. Ecgfrith was a younger son of King Oswiu of Northumbria and his wife Enfleda. Shortly after Ecgfrith became king, Aethelthryth asked her husband if she could become a nun. She was encouraged by Bishop Wilfrid to remain . This caused friction between Ecgfrith and Bishop Wilfrid. One story tells that Ecgfrith first agreed that she should continue to remain a virgin but in about 672 he wished to have an heir. He tried to bribe Wilfrid to convince the queen to give him an heir. This failed and the king tried to take his queen from her convent. She fled back to Ely with two nuns and managed to evade capture. The legend says that she escaped due to the miraculous rising of the tide. Another version of the legend stated that she stopped on the journey at 'Stow' and hid under an ash tree which suddenly came from her staff after she planted it in the ground. This came to be known as 'St Aethelthryth 's Stow', when a church was built to commemorate this event. Stow Minster contains a stained glass window that portrays the legend. Ecgfrith later married Eormenburg and expelled Wilfrid from his kingdom in 678. According to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Aethelthryth founded a double monastery at Ely in 673, which was later destroyed in the Danish invasion of 870. She lived at St. Ely for the remainder of her life in pious devotion. She died of the plague. There is a hymn that was written in her honor.\n\nAethelthryth's niece and her great-niece, both of whom were royal princesses, succeeded her as abbess of Ely.\n\nBede and The \"Liber Eliensis\" describe how in 695, Aethelthryth's body was dug up by her sister Seaxburth, to be transferred from a common grave to the new church at Ely. She had been dead sixteen years. When her body was exhumed it was said to have been just as it was when she was alive. She was reburied in a white, marble coffin. Aethelthryth's uncorrupted body and clothes were said to have miraculous powers. A burial chamber made of white marble was taken from the Roman ruins at Grantchester, which was found to be the right fit for Aethelthryth. Seaxburh supervised the preparation of her sister's body, which was washed and wrapped in new robes before being reburied. Seaxburgh apparently oversaw the transference of her sister's remains without the supervision of her bishop, using her knowledge gained from her family's links.\n\nSt Etheldreda's Church is dedicated to the saint. It was originally part of the palace of the Bishops of Ely. In later years the palace was used by the Spanish Ambassadors, enabling Roman Catholic worship to continue in the church. It is now a Roman Catholic parish church in Ely, Cambridgeshire. It is part of the Diocese of East Anglia within the Province of Westminster.

This faint galaxy is well studied by professional astronomers, who are interested in the history of star formation in the galaxy. The galaxy is relatively nearby, so the Hubble Space Telescope can easily pick out its stars. In 2008 scientists studying images from Hubble calculated the galaxy's distance at nearly 11 million light-years away, making it a member of the IC 342 group of galaxies.\n\nThe most notable feature of NGC 1569 is its powerful starburst. It has formed stars at a rate 100 times greater than that of our galaxy during the last 100 million years. It contains two prominent super star clusters with different histories.\n\nSuper star cluster A, in the northwest of the galaxy is formed of two close clusters (\"NGC 1569 A1\" and \"NGC 1569 A2\").

They are similar to small globular clusters or R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nThis shows, with the results from other dwarf galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud and NGC 1705, that star formation in dwarf galaxies does not occur continuously but instead occurs in a series of short bursts.\n\nThe many supernovae produced in the galaxy as well as the strong stellar winds of its stars have produced filaments and bubbles of ionized hydrogen with respective sizes of up to 3,700 and 380 light years.

He wrote music under the pen name Kenneth J. Alford. He was a Bandmaster in the British Army, and Royal Marines Director of Music. Conductor Sir Vivian Dunn called him \"The British March King.\" Ricketts frequently used the saxophone in his music. This led to the instrument being used in all military bands.\n\nRicketts was born on 21 February 1881. He was the 4th child of Robert and Louisa (née Alford) Ricketts, who lived in London. Ricketts' father died when he was seven and his mother died when he was fourteen. His early musical training had been on playing the piano and organ and working as a church chorister. As a boy living in London’s East End he would often hear street musicians and bands. He decided that joining an army band would be best for his future.\n\nRicketts joined the Royal Irish Regiment in 1895. He was enlisted as a Band Boy. He was a good cornet player and was put into the regimental band. The band went with the regiment to Limerick in Ireland, and then to India. In his free time, Ricketts learned all the other band instruments. When he was 15 years old, he wrote his first piece, which was called “For Service Overseas.” It has never been published. In 1903, he was recommended for entry into the Student Bandmaster Course at the Royal Military School of Music, in Twickenham, Middlesex. Musicians who were as young as Ricketts were not nominated very often, but Ricketts was very skilled.\n\nRicketts began a two-year course at Kneller Hall in the summer of 1904. This course was very difficult. He graduated in 1906.\n\nIn 1908, Ricketts became Bandmaster to the Band of the 2nd Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He went to the Orange River Colony (formerly the Orange Free State) to lead them. This colony is now the Republic of South Africa. The colonel asked him to write a new march for the Argylls, so Ricketts wrote \"The Thin Red Line\". It was not published until 1925.\n\nRicketts wanted to compose music. However, it was not accepted for officers of Ricketts's rank to be engaged in commercial activities in the civilian world. Because of this, Ricketts decided to compose and publish under the pen name Kenneth J. Alford. The first march written under the new pen name was \"Holyrood\".\n\nA few weeks before the start of World War I, Ricketts composed his most famous march, called \"Colonel Bogey\". No one knows exactly how Ricketts began composing it. Ricketts's widow claims that it came from a game of golf. She says that during the game, Ricketts and another member of the Argylls started whistling the notes that would become the march's melody.\n\nShortly after World War I started, Ricketts and the Band Boys of the Argylls were sent to the 3rd Battalion (Reserve) in Edinburgh. They stayed there through the whole war. During the war Ricketts wrote several marches dedicated to the British military: \"The Great Little Army\" (1916), \"On The Quarter Deck,\" \"The Middy,\" \"The Voice of the Guns\" (1917), and \"The Vanished Army (They Never Die)\" (1919).\n\nIn 1921, Ricketts applied to become a bandmaster for the Band of the Plymouth Division, which was part of the Royal Marines. He was interviewed and was offered the position. However, the old bandmaster, P.S.G. O'Donnell, was trying to apply for a position with an Army band, but members of the Royal Marines were not allowed to become members of the British Army. Because of this, Ricketts could not take the position, since O'Donnell remained with the Band of the Plymouth Division.\n\nIn 1927, Ricketts applied again to become a bandmaster with the Royal Marines. This time, he was approved. He became a lieutenant in the Royal Marines Band Service on 4 July 1927. He was posted to the Band of the Marines’ Depot at Deal in Kent. In 1930, Ricketts was posted to the Band of the Plymouth Division.\n\nOn 5 September 1907, Frederick Joseph Ricketts was married to Miss Annie Louisa Holmes. This was while he was on staff at the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall. Annie (Nan) Holmes came from a musical family. Her brother was a partner in the London music publishing house of Walsh, Holmes and Company. Nan often gave Ricketts ideas and helped him make decisions about compositions. They had six children, Kenneth (March 1909), Leo (April 1911), Sheila (May 1913), Paula (October 1916), Gordon (October 1918),and José (October 1922).\n\nRicketts retired from the Royal Marines on 1 June 1944 because of ill health. He died at his home in Reigate, Surrey, on 15 May 1945, after an operation for cancer. He had given almost 50 years of service to the Crown.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "431344", "title": "Kenneth J.

The four ballades are said to have been inspired by Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. The exact inspiration for each individual ballade, however, is unclear and not agreed upon.\n\nBallades were composed before Chopin, in literature and Italian Renaissance music. But, Chopin invented the \"ballade\" as an abstract musical form. The ballade is a distinct form and cannot be placed into another form (e.g. sonata). After Chopin, other composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms also wrote ballades.\n\nThe ballades are thought to be the best of Chopin's compositions and of romantic music. The ballades are difficult for pianists to play, even after they learn the technical difficulty of the notes. There are still the creative expressions to be mastered. \n\nAll four ballades are from 8 to 12 minutes in length. They are in triple time (three beats to a bar), or in 6/4 or 6/8 time. Each is an individual work and should not be played as a group in a concert. Even Chopin did not do this. He wanted listeners to find their own interpretation of the music. Each piece has its own poetry, drama and story.\n\nChopin's four ballades are very popular pieces and are often heard in concerts around the world.

They were fast, omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs from the Upper Cretaceous of Laurasia (now Asia and North America). Members of the Ornithomimidae include \"Gallimimus\", \"Archaeornithomimus\", \"Anserimimus\", \"Struthiomimus\", and \"Ornithomimus\".\n\nOrnithomimids are a sister group to the troodontids. These groups had many bird-like features, including feathers, but they were not birds.\n\nThe skulls of ornithomimids were small, with large eyes, above relatively long and slender necks. All had toothless beaks.\nThe fore limbs ('arms') were long and slender and bore powerful claws. The hind limbs were long and powerful, with a long foot and short, strong toes terminating in hooflike claws. \n\nOrnithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants. Many ornithomimosaurs, including primitive species, have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs, characteristic of herbivores. Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested that the long, sloth-like 'arms' of ornithomimids may have been used to pull down branches on which to feed, an idea supported by further study of their strange, hook-like hands. Ornithomimids probably acquired most of their calories from plants. Many ornithomimosaurs, including primitive species, have been found with numerous gastroliths in their stomachs, characteristic of herbivores.\n\nThe sheer abundance of ornithomimids – they are the most common small dinosaurs in North America – is consistent with the idea that they were plant eaters, as herbivores usually outnumber carnivores in an ecosystem. However, they may have been omnivores that ate both plants and small animal prey.\n", "id": "431520", "title": "Ornithomimidae"}

At age twelve his father was killed in battle by Edwin who became King of Northumbria. Along with his brothers Eanfrith and Oswiu and their sister Aebbe, he found safety with the Scots in Dál Riata. The monks of Iona baptized the children and raised them in the Celtic Christian faith. For all of Edwin's reign Oswald remained in Exile. Cadwallon ap Cadfan, the Christian king of Gwynedd, along with the pagan Penda of Mercia, attacked Northumbria in 632. In 633 the two invading armies met Edwin at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. Edwin was killed and his army was destroyed. For the next year Cadwallon destroyed everything he could in Northumbria.

Oswald was the first king of Northumbria to come to the throne already a Christian. As one of his first acts Oswald set up what would become the holy island of . He asked for a bishop to come to Northumbria to convert his people to the Christian faith. They sent Bishop Aidan.

Oswald created several similar alliances in an effort to contain Penda of Mercia. About 638 he won a battle against Owen Map Bili, the king of Strathclyde near Edinburgh. In 640 Oswald tried to recover Lindsey from Penda. The two armies met again in 642 at the Battle of Maserfield (probably in Shropshire). Oswald was killed in the battle.

It was dug in order to learn more about the inside of the Earth. Digging started on May 24, 1970. The work continued until 1992, or 1994. The borehole was kept open until 2005. SG-3, the deepest part of the hole, reached below the surface in 1989. That is the deepest hole ever made and is still the deepest man-made point on Earth.\n\nFor a long time, SG-3 was also the longest hole by distance from its opening. In 2008, the Al Shaheen BD-04A oil well in Qatar reached farther and, in 2011, the Odoptu OP-11 oil well off Sakhalin got farther.\n\nThe hole was made with different machines at different times. The Soviets started making the hole with the Uralmash-4E. Later, they used the Uralmash-15000. At first, they wanted to get to below the surface. The machines broke the earlier record for the deepest hole—held by the Bertha Rogers hole in Washita County, Oklahoma, in the United States—on June 6, 1979. The machines got to below the surface in 1983 and the Soviet Union celebrated (took special note of) this for about a year without going any deeper. On September 27, 1984, the machine broke at a depth of ; its drill string twisted off and was left in the hole. When the Soviets started to make the hole again, they had to start from . \n\nThe greatest depth was reached in 1989. The people making the hole thought that they would get to by the end of 1990 and, at last, get to 15,000 m by 1993. They were not able to go any deeper, though, because they had made an error and the end of the hole was in place of the they had hoped for. Their machines stopped making any holes at all in 1992. The last studies were stopped in 2005 and the place was completely closed and left alone in 2008.\n\nThe Kola hole got about ⅓ of the way through the Baltic Shield, the part of the Earth's crust (its outer level of rock) below the Kola Peninsula. (People who study the Earth think it's about deep at the place where the hole was made.) The rocks at the bottom of the deepest hole were more than 2½ billion years old. \n\nThe people who made the hole said they wanted to learn about the different levels of the Baltic Shield, how sound and heat move under the ground, what kinds of rocks make up the deep crust, and to create new skills and tools for going deep into the Earth. One of the most important things they found was they had made an error about the kinds of rocks underground. When they looked at how sound waves moved through the Earth, they thought there should be a change from granite to basalt rocks at about below the surface. In fact, the sound waves had changed because the heat and pressure made the granite act differently. Also, this special kind of granite was broken into pieces and full of water. The water did not come from above but had been trapped in the deep crust by solid rock. Another important discovery was that the mud from the deep hole was \"boiling\" with hydrogen gas.\n\n\n\n", "id": "432031", "title": "Kola Superdeep Borehole"}

It was co-produced and directed by Richard Rich. It is the sequel to the 2010 animated movie \"Alpha and Omega\". The first announcement for the movie was in mid-2012, when it was announced for a worldwide theatrical release. However, the movie faced a lot of scandals and delays during its production and was released straight-to-DVD instead on October 8, 2013 with a Christmas theme. \"Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games\" was released on iTunes on March 4, 2014. It was released as a Walmart exclusive on March 25, 2014.\n\nKate and Humphrey are eager to spend the upcoming winter with their three pups, Stinky, Claudette and Runt, as it will be the first that they've spent together as a family.\n\nWhile out travelling with his siblings, Runt, the only Omega offspring of Kate and Humphrey, climbs a tree and spots 3 rogue wolves in the area. After 2 of the rogue wolves save Stinky and Claudette from a grizzly, Runt suddenly disappears. Stinky and Claudette then inform Kate and Humphrey, including their relatives as they were about to have a family dinner, about Runt's disappearance. The family hurries to find Runt, and Kate sees that the rogue wolves have captured Runt and are heading to Banff National Park, home to the rogue wolf pack and south of Jasper. After being warned by Tony and Winston about how dangerous the rogues are, Kate and Humphrey still go on to find their lost pup, much to their disappointment. Meanwhile, at Banff, Runt is taken to the rogues’ leader, King. He is then made as a bait, as King expects the western pack to come for Runt. Princess, King’s daughter, is appointed to care for Runt and to keep the bait alive. As night falls, a storm approaches, prompting Kate and Humphrey to stop the search and wait for the storm to subside the next day. Meanwhile, at the den, Stinky and Claudette sneak out to help their parents search for Runt while everyone is asleep.\n\nThe next day, Kate and Humphrey meet Marcel and Paddy. After following what their parents did before to cross the river, Stinky and Claudette find them and go with their parents to help in the search. On the way, they meet a lost grizzly cub who was separated from his mother. At first, Humphrey refuses because of his experience with a bear cub before. He then decides to let the bear go with them. A mile away from Banff, Kate and Humphrey leave Paddy to guard the children while they and Marcel retrieve Runt. Despite this, the children manage to convince Paddy to go. While on Banff, their family also arrives and Humphrey is made to distract the rogues by acting as a gigantic \"special-class alpha\" named Lockjaw while Kate retrieves Runt. After finding out that it is but a trick, King orders the Alpha rogues to kill them. Winston then orders Kate and Humphrey to take the cubs to the north side in the human roads and they will rendezvous there. Fortunately, the bear cub's family arrives and helps them defeat the rogues after the cub explained how the wolves helped him. As the snow covers the lands, Humphrey and his family are lost. Runt climbs a tree and sees the human roads about ten miles away at the foot of the mountain. They then logboard their way down.\n\nUpon reaching the same gas station and seeing Max, the same hunter they encountered before, Humphrey hesitates. They go in anyway and the man sees them. Once seeing Kate and Humphrey have pups (and him having a family of his own), Max decides to be nice this time. So, he gives them free food and leaves the door open, much to their surprise. The film ends with Kate and Humphrey deciding to settle there for the winter as they all go to sleep.\n\n\"Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure\" received generally mixed reviews by critics, who praised the film for its improvement on the script, humor, dialogue, story and voice acting, but they also criticized the film's animation quality, short run time and rushed ending. So far, the film has a 55% in Rotten Tomatoes and a 50 out of 100 in Metacritic, indicating \"mixed to average reviews\". The consensus for the movie in Rotten Tomatoes is \"While it suffers from sub-par animation and a rushed plot, \"Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure\" delivers enough good thrills and improvements to keep fans and audiences entertained\". Just like the first movie, \"Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure\" was very successful with fans, who gave the film extremely positive reviews, despite the mixed critical reaction and gaining a 81% rating in the RT community. The movie also gained a cult following.\n\n\nThe two other sequels of \"Alpha and Omega\" are currently in production. \"\" is set to have direct-to-DVD release in March 25, 2014 and it will be a Walmart exclusive. The plot will follow around The Great Wolf Games, which are happening in Jasper when Kate, Humphrey and the puppies arrive home. In the games, all the pups from different packs come together and compete in different games. But, something goes wrong, leaving most of the Alphas out of commission. So, it's up to Humphrey to lead the new team to victory. \"\" will be released in October 31 2014, along with \"Alpha and Omega 5: Family Vacation\" to be released in Spring 2015.\n", "id": "432065", "title": "Alpha and Omega 2: A Howl-iday Adventure"}

It was the first battle that took place west of the Mississippi River. Nathaniel Lyon, the Union general, was the first general killed in the Civil war.\n\nDuring the summer of 1861, the Union and Confederate Armies were both trying to control Missouri. By the second week of July 1861, the Union Army of the West commanded by Brigadier general Nathaniel Lyon, camped at Springfield, Missouri. In total, he had about 5,400 soldiers in his command.\n\nAbout 75 miles to the southwest of Springfield, the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard were camped. They were under the command of Major general Sterling Price. Price was joined by Confederate generals Benjamin McCulloch and Nicholas Bartlett Pearce. Combined their forces numbered about 12,000. In late July both forces started moving closer to together, each army trying to learn what they could about the other. There was a skirmish at Dug Springs, Missouri on August 2. This is near present-day Clever, Missouri. The Union forces won but this is when Lyon realized the Confederates had more than twice the forces he had. The Union forces retreated back to Springfield.\n\nOn August 9, 1861, Lyon marched his troops from Springfield to where the Confederates were now camped at Wilson Creek. His plan called for Colonel Franz Sigel to do a flanking maneuver on the Confederates and attack them from their rear. The rest of Lyon's forces would attack from the north.\n\nOn August 10, Sigel's flanking maneuver surprised the Confederate army. It allowed the Union army an early advantage. The two armies fought fiercely in the fields and hills around Wilson's Creek. After six hours of fighting and numerous casualties on both sides, the Union forces withdrew. Siegel's attack had at first proved very successful, but fell apart when he mistook the Confederate 3rd Louisiana for federal troops and allowed them to get too close without being challenged.\n\nThree times the confederates attacked the Union line and failed to break through all three times. During the battle, Lyon was killed and Major Samuel D. Sturgis replaced him. Meanwhile, Sigel's mistake had cost him the advantage and his forces were routed. After the third attack at about 11:00 am, the Confederates withdrew. With his ammunition running low and his men exhausted he withdrew to Springfield. Too disorganized to follow, the Confederate army did not pursue. Technically, it was a victory for the Confederate Army since the Union Army left the field. However, it can be considered a victory for the Union since they still kept control of Missouri. The Confederate army called the battle of Wilson’s Creek, the Battle of “Oak Hill(s)”.\nFive Union Soldiers received the Medal of Honor for their parts in the battle.

It was named after the river Adige (Etsch), which flowed through it. The capital of the department was Trento.\n\nThe department's territory was not the same as that of the modern Italian province of Alto Adige. Some of the territory is the same, such as the city of Bolzano, but most of the rest is now part of the province of Trento. These two provinces form the region Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.\n\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" was created in the late 18th century by Napoleon Bonaparte, when he occupied the territory of northern Italy near the Alps. This was the name of the French administrative division known as the \"Department of Alto Adige\" (\"Dipartimento dell'Alto Adige\"), created during Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 1810. It was officially named \"Haut Adige\" to get rid of relation to the historic \"County of Tyrol\" of Austria. The District of Alto Adige was created by Napoleon as part of the Dipartamento del Benaco in his Cisalpine Republic, and was near Verona. This Benaco department, created in 1797, was gotten rid of in 1798 as a result of administrative changes to the Cisalpine Republic.\n\nSome years later, Napoleon created the Department of Alto Adige further north. This department was a part of the Kingdom of Italy from 1810 to 1814. It was created with the division of the Austrian Tyrol between French Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy, and included the southern part of Tyrol with the city of Bolzano with surroundings (along with the Trentino). The boundaries were made by Austrian and German commissioners, who said that a territory would belong to the Kingdom of Italy if it is inhabited by Italians.\n\nThe department was ended after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. Its territory is now divided between the Italian provinces of Trentino and South Tyrol.\n\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" was reused. Today it is the Italian name of the part of Tyrol south of the Brenner Pass. Ettore Tolomei made it official in Italy after World War I.\n\n\n", "id": "432216", "title": "Department of Alto Adige"}

He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing.

This system is universal in vertebrates. That shows it is ancient in origin, and very important. \n\nHumans have some problems with the system, because though they share the physiology with other animals, they rarely face a clear-cut fight or flight choice.

He was best known for performing with Ozzy Osbourne and the band Quiet Riot.\n\nRhoads first formed a band with Kelly Garni called Little Women. Kevin DuBrow was recruited into the band and they changed their name to Quiet Riot. The band became popular by playing in clubs in Los Angeles. By late 1976 they were signed to CBS/Sony Records.\n\nDana Strum contacted Rhoads to see if he was wanted to audition for Ozzy Osbourne's new band. He asked his mother if he should join Osbourne's band since he was still in Quiet Riot. She asked him if he would accept \"an offer like this one\" and Rhodes replied \"Of course!\"\n\nHe went to audition in Osbourne's hotel room in Los Angeles with his guitar and a practice amplifier. As he started getting ready he was given the job. Osbourne was very drunk, and had fallen asleep during the audition. Rhoads remembered later, \"I just tuned up and did some riffs, and he said, 'You've got the gig'; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, 'You didn't even hear me yet'\".\n\nRhoads flew to England on the November 27, 1979.

While driving in their tour bus, the band stopped in Leesburg, Florida, to fix the bus' air conditioner. Osbourne stayed asleep because he had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening. While stopped, their driver Andrew Aycock noticed an airstrip with small helicopters and planes. Aycock had previously worked as a commercial pilot. He decided to take a small Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a man named Mike Partin. He took it without Partin's permission. He took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan for a flight. He took Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood on for the second flight. Aycock tried to fly the plane very low over their tour bus, where the other band members were sleeping. He made two close passes but caused an accident on the third one. One of the plane's wings had clipped the top of the tour bus. This broke the wing into two parts and sent the plane spiraling out of control. Both Rhoads and Youngblood were thrown out of the plane's windshield by the initial impact. While traveling at about , the plane crashed into a nearby garage. All three passengers were killed instantly. They were burned beyond recognition from the fire of the plane.

The jury learned that Duggan had been killed by a 9mm hollow-point round. A hollow-point bullet. Two witnesses said that they saw a police officer move something from the minicab to the place where the gun was found. Duggan's lawyers argued that police had put the gun found near where Duggan was killed there to make Duggan's killing look lawful. The officer who killed Duggan said Duggan was still holding a gun when both shots were fired. 9 of the jury decided that Mark Duggan threw the firearm on to the grass.\n\nOn 11 December 2013 students protested outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the inquest.\n\nOn 8 January 2014 the jury decided that Duggan's death had been a lawful killing.

Celts used their shields defensively but also as an offensive weapon. A favorite tactic of a Celtic warrior was to strike the enemy with his shield.

Evan Chandler killed himself on November 5, 2009. His death was four months after that of Michael Jackson.\n\nJackson first met Jordan Chandler when Chandler was five years old.\nJackson had become good friends with Jordan Chandler and his family after meeting Chandler in May 1992. Evan became jealous of Jackson because his son liked spending time with him more. In July 1993 Jackson and Jordan's relationship ended. Chandler, who was a dentist, was made to admit that he gave his son a barbiturate called sodium amytal to take out his tooth in August 1993. While he was under the influence of the drug Jordan told his father that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan Chandler told the police about the abuse. Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit began a criminal investigation on Jackson on August 18. Police searched Jackson's Neverland Ranch. They found books and photographs in his bedroom that had young boys wearing little or no clothing in them.\n\nJackson ended his Dangerous World Tour on November 11, 1993 to go to rehab. He had become addicted to painkillers, which he used for the stress of the allegations.\n\nLa Toya Jackson, Michael's sister, said at a press conference on December 9, 1993 that \"This has been going on since 1981, and it's not just one child.\" Her husband and manager at the time Jack Gordon said that Michael Jackson had said that he would kill La Toya if she told. In 2011 La Toya said \"I never for a minute believed my brother was guilty of anything like that\". \n\nIn December 1993, Jackson was strip searched. Jordan had told the police what Jackson's genitals looked like. Chandler said that Jackson was circumcised, but he was not. \n\nOn December 22 Jackson talked about what had happened via satellite from his ranch. He said,\n'As you may already know, after my tour ended I remained out of the country undergoing treatment for a dependency on pain medication...There have been many disgusting statements made recently concerning allegations of improper conduct on my part. These statements about me are totally false...I will say I am particularly upset by the handling of the mass—matter by the incredible, terrible mass media. At every opportunity, the media has dissected and manipulated these allegations to reach their own conclusions. I ask all of you to wait and hear the truth before you label or condemn me. Don't treat me like a criminal, because I am innocent. I have been forced to submit to a dehumanizing and humiliating examination...It was the most humiliating ordeal of my life...But if this is what I have to endure to prove my innocence, my complete innocence, so be it.'\n\nThe case was settled in 1994 with a payment of over $15 million to be put in Jordan Chandler's trust fund, $1.5 million for each of his parents, and $5 million for the family's lawyer. No criminal charges were ever made against Jackson. In 2004 Jackson's attorney for the 2005 Michael Jackson trial Thomas Mesereau Jr. said that Jackson regretted making these payments.\n\nThree years later a book by a journalist called Victor M. Gutierrez was published called \"Michael Jackson Was My Lover\". It claimed to be the diaries of Jordan from the time period in which he was molested by Jackson. Jackson sued Gutierrez for slander. It was banned in the United States.\n\nAfter the allegations PepsiCo ended its sponsorship of Jackson. Dubai would not let Jackson perform. \"Dangerous\" was going to be released as the tenth single from \"Dangerous\" but was cancelled. \n\nJackson's first album after the allegations was \"\". It has sold 25 million copies. This makes it one of the best-selling albums ever released. However, \"Dangerous\" sold more.\n\nOn December 18, 2003 Jackson was charged with seven child sexual abuse offences. Earlier that year a documentary called \"Living with Michael Jackson\" had been on television. In the documentary Jackson was shown holding hands with his accuser, 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. Jackson said in the documentary that he shared his bed with children who were not family. Arvizo said that Jackson started molesting him after the documentary was shown. Jackson was found not guilty of all charges on June 13 2005.\n\nMichael Jackson died in 2009. On May 1, 2013 Wade Robson's lawyer sent a private complaint against the Michael Jackson Estate 'for childhood sexual abuse'. In the 1993 investigation and 2005 trial Robson had said that Jackson had not molested him. Robson had been Jackson's \"special friend\" in 1990. Robson said on \"The Today Show\" on May 16, 2013 that Jackson as a \"pedophile\" who sexually abused him from ages 7 to 14. \n", "id": "433252", "title": "1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson"}

A 13-year-old boy called Gavin Arvizo accused him of sexual abuse in 2003. Jackson was charged with fourteen offences. These were four counts of molesting a child, four counts of getting a child drunk so that he could molest him, one count of trying to molest a child, and one count of secretly planning (conspiring) to hold the boy and his family captive at his Neverland Ranch. He called the charges “a big lie”. He was found not guilty of all charges. If Jackson was found guilty of all charges he could have been put in prison for 20 years.\n\nOn February 3 2003 a documentary called \"Living with Michael Jackson\" was shown on ITV in the United Kingdom. Three days later it was shown in the United States. In the documentary a British journalist called Martin Bashir asked Jackson questions about his life. In the documentary Jackson's accuser Gavin Arvizo was 12 years old. At one point he is filmed with Jackson. Jackson holds hands with Gavin. Gavin rests his head on Jackson's shoulder. At the trial Gavin said he did this because Jackson was his \"best friend\". Gavin tells Bashir that he slept in Jackson’s bed with his brother Star while Jackson slept on the floor. Jackson said many children had slept in his bed, including Macaulay Culkin, his brother Kieran, and his sisters.\n\nGavin later complained that he did not realize that the video was going to be shown all over the world.

Jackson went into court an hour and thirty minutes late. He was wearing pyjama pants and slippers.

Later he became the King of Northumbria. When Oswiu defeated and killed Penda of Mercia at the Battle of the Winwaed, he became the seventh over the southern English kings. He took the throne of Mercia and appointed his son-in-law Peada (Penda's son) as a client king. Oswiu was one of those rare kings of Northumbria who died of natural causes and not in battle.\n\nOswiu was born He was a son of King Athelfrith of Bernicia and his second wife Acha of Deira. He was a younger brother of King Oswald of Northumbria. When he was about 6 years old his father was killed in battle by Edwin who became King of Northumbria. Along with his brothers Eanfrith and Oswald and their sister Aebbe, he found safety with the Scots in Dál Riata. The monks of Iona baptized the children and raised them in the Celtic Christian faith.\n\nAbout 634 Oswiu married Rhiainmelt, daughter of Rhoeth of Rheged, a marriage alliance arranged by his brother King Oswald. He had a son by this marriage, Alfrith of Deira. Rhiainmelt seems to have died as a year later Oswiu was in Ireland with the Dál Riatans. There he was involved with Fina, the daughter of the high King Colman. There is no record they married but they had a son Aldfrith of Northumbria (Irish name \"Flann Fína mac Oswiu\").\n\nWhen his brother Oswald was killed in 642, the overlordship died with him. Oswald had been king of a combined Bernicia, Deira and Lindsey (kingdom). But Northumbria was divided back into its earlier weaker sub-kingdoms. Penda, now the most powerful king in England took Lindsey. Oswiu became King of Bernicia. Oswine claimed Deira, preventing Oswiu from keeping it with Bernicia. A year after it happened Oswiu recovered his brother's body from the battlefield where he died. Oswiu had Oswald's remains buried at Bardney in Lindsey.\n\nOswiu invaded Deira in 651 seeking to reunite Deira with Bernicia. Oswine was betrayed by one of his own noblemen and was murdered in 651 on Oswiu's orders. But the Deirans chose Athelwald, Oswiu's nephew, as their king. Athelwald then aligned himself with Oswiu's enemy, Penda. Deira was under the protection of Mercia for the next three years. But Penda was determined to defeat Oswiu and take Bernicia as well. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. According to Bede, Penda attacked Oswiu several times. With a much smaller force Oswiu attacked Penda's army near the banks of the River Winwaed. Most of the commanders of the thirty legions were killed including King Anna of East Anglia and Penda. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia.\n\nWhen Oswiu and Eanflaed were married, he was raised in the Celtic church while she was raised in the Roman church. The main difference was how each calculated the date of Easter. Members of the Celtic church might be celebrating Easter while the Roman church was celebrating Lent. In 658 his son Alfrith, who now supported the Roman Church, replaced several of his Celtic church officials with those from the Roman church.\n\nTo resolve the differences between the two religions in his kingdom, Oswiu called for a in 664. Called the Synod of Whitby it was to decide on when to celebrate Easter and what rules the monasteries in Northumbria would follow. Members of the church were summoned from all over the north. The Roman position was given by Wilfrid who would afterwards become Bishop of Northumbria. Bishop Colmán argued for the Ionan calculation of Easter given them by Columba, founder of their order. Oswiu made the decision in favor of the Roman practice, uniting Northumbria under one religion. It joined Northumbrian religious practices to those of the southern English.\n\nBede, in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Book IV, chapter 5 gives the date of Oswiu's death as 15 February, 670 and his age at 58. His wife Eanflaed retired to the monastery at Whitby. This is where their daughter, also named Enflaed, was brought up. In 680 Enflaed and her daughter became joint abbesses at Whitby. Enflaed died .\n\nBased on Nennius' \"Historia Brittonum\" Oswiu's first wife was a Briton named Reinmelth. She was the daughter of Royth, King of Rheged. Together they had a son:\n\n<br>\nBy Fina, daughter of the Irish High King Coleman, he had:\n\n<br>\nOswiu married Eanflaed, daughter of King Edwin of Deira.

The word homology has the Ancient Greek root \"homos\", which means \"identical\". \n\nFor a topological space, the homology groups are generally much easier to compute than the homotopy groups, and consequently one usually will have an easier time working with homology to help with the classification of spaces.\n\nThe original motivation for defining homology groups is the observation that shapes are distinguished by their \"holes\". Since a \"hole\" is defined by something that is \"not there\", this poses the problem of how to define what a hole is, and how to distinguish between different kinds of holes. Homology is a rigorous mathematical method for defining and categorizing holes in a shape.

After the War of the Portuguese Succession, the monarchies of Portugal and the Spanish brach of the House of Habsburg were linked. A dynastic union joined the crowns of Castile, Portugal and Aragon along with their respective colonial possessions, under the rule of the Hispanic monarchy. The Habsburg king was the only element of connection between the kingdoms and territories. The institutions, government and legal traditions of each kingdom remained independent of each other. The alien laws (Leyes de extranjeria) determined that the national of one kingdom was a foreigner in all the other Iberian kingdoms. The term \"Iberian union\" was not used at the time, it is a creation of modern historians. \n\nThe monarchs had long wanted to unify the penisula: They had the visigothic monarchy in mind. Sancho III of Navarre and Alfonso VII of León and Castile both took the title \"Imperator totius Hispaniae\", meaning \"Emperor of All Hispania\" centuries before. If Miguel da Paz (1498–1500), Prince of Portugal and Asturias had become king, the union could have been achieved earlier. Unfortunately, he died early in his childhood.\n\nThe history of Portugal from the dynastic crisis in 1578 to the first Braganza Dynasty monarchs was a period of transition. The Portuguese Empire's spice trade was peaking at the start of this period. It continued to be very important after Vasco da Gama had finally reached the East by sailing around Africa in 1497–98. Vasco da Gama's achievement completed the exploratory efforts started by Henry the Navigator. It opened an oceanic route for the profitable spice trade into Europe that bypassed the Middle East.\n\nThroughout the 17th century, the increasing predations and surrounding of Portuguese trading posts in the East by the Dutch, English and French, and their rapidly growing intrusion into the Atlantic slave trade, undermined Portugal's near monopoly on the lucrative oceanic spice and slave trades. This sent the Portuguese spice trade into a long decline. To a lesser extent the diversion of wealth from Portugal by the Habsburg monarchy to help support the Catholic side of the Thirty Years' War, also created strains within the union, although Portugal did benefit from Spanish military power in helping to retain Brazil and in disrupting Dutch trade. These events, and those that occurred at the end of Aviz dynasty and the period of Iberian Union, led Portugal to a state of dependency on its colonies, first India and then Brazil.\n", "id": "434179", "title": "Iberian Union"}

The concept is similar to the general text complexity, which is measured by the Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test.\n\nCyclomatic complexity is computed using the control flow graph of the program: the nodes of the graph correspond to indivisible groups of commands of a program, and a directed edge connects two nodes if the second command might be executed immediately after the first command. Cyclomatic complexity may also be applied to individual functions, modules, methods or classes within a program.\n\nOne testing strategy, called Basis path testing by McCabe who first proposed it, is to test each linearly independent path through the program; in this case, the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program.\n", "id": "434184", "title": "Cyclomatic complexity"}

Most notably he was appointed Secretary of Defense under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1987.\nHe was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 and an honorary British knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWeinberger was born in San Francisco, California on August 18, 1917. He studied at Harvard College and at Harvard Law School. Weinberger married Jane Weinberger in 1942. Their marriage would last until Weinberger's death. They had two children.\n\nWeinberger was treated for and died from complications of pneumonia at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, Maine, aged 88.\n\nWeinberger was born in San Francisco, California in 1917. His parents had been Jewish but by the time Weinberger was born they were not members of any synagoge or church. Weinberger later joined the Episcopalian Church. He had health problems as a boy, but did well in high school and was accepted to Harvard University. While in college, he edited the \"Harvard Crimson\", the university's student newspaper. He graduated with a law degree in 1941.\n\nSoon after he graduated from Harvard, Weinberger joined the United States Army. When Japan attacked the US Navy at Pearl Harbor in December of that year, Weinberger went to war in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. By the end of the war he served in intelligence, and became interested in politics. He came to admire Winston Churchill, who was a personal hero of Weinberger.

Here he was well known for being a major supporter water infrastructure projects and for trying to stop a freeway from being built through downtown San Francisco (the freeway was built, but it was torn down in 1989).

He served in a number of jobs in California before running the Federal Trade Commission, where he became known for enforced laws meant to protect consumers.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon appointed Weinberger as the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.

While at this job he saw a military buildup meant to be a force against Soviet aggression. He felt that if the United States had a stronger military it could better deal with the Soviet Union.\n\nWeinberger was Secretary of Defense during the Iran Contra scandal, which involved selling guns to Iran to give money to a group of rebels in Nicaragua called the Contras, who were fighting the socialist dictatorship there. Weinberger didn't want to do this but he did not prevent it from happening.

The outcome of the battle was a major victory for Oswiu and a restoration of Northumbrian dominance of Anglo-Saxon England.\n\nSeveral events led to the battle of the Winwaed. King Oswald of Northumbria was considered the or overlord over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England. Penda of Mercia defeated and killed Oswald of Northumbria in 642 at the battle of Maserfield. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Penda did not claim to be the overlord, however. When his brother Oswald was killed, Oswiu of Northumbria claimed the throne of Bernicia but was not able to rule Deira. It was a year before Oswiu felt it was safe enough to recover his brother's body from the battlefield where he was killed. To appease Penda Oswiu gave his daughter in marriage to Penda's son Peada. Also Oswiu agreed to the marriage of his son Alfrith and Penda's daughter Cyneburh. Still, Penda was not satisfied. He was determined to destroy Oswiu. In 654 Penda raised a large army of some thirty 'legions'. Then, about 653, Penda began raiding into Bernicia.\n\nIn a series of battles fought all across Northumbria, Oswiu kept being pushed back until he reached the far north of his kingdom. When Osiwu wanted peace, Penda took Oswiu's son Ecgfrith as a hostage. Oswiu also made an offer of tribute to Penda if he would bring an end to the hostilities. According to Nennius, Oswiu gave Penda all the treasure he had which Penda gave to his Briton allies. But Bede claims Penda turned down the offer of treasure as tribute. Penda took his army and left Bernicia. It was at this point, according to Bede, that Oswiu with a much smaller force attacked Penda's army. He caught up with Penda on the banks of the flooded Winwaed river. Some of Penda's allies deserted him and decided not to fight. But probably catching Penda's main force by surprise Oswiu's army fell upon the Mercians without mercy. Penda and most of the leaders of his 'thirty legions' were killed. Also killed with Penda was king Aethelhere of East Anglia. One of those who also withdrew and did not engage in the battle was Oswiu's nephew, King Athelwald of Deira. He had guided Penda through Northumbria and been his ally against his uncle. Because of the flooded river, more were killed by drowning than in battle.\n\nThe death of Penda and the rise of Oswiu to dominance had a major impact in 7th century England. Athelwald was either killed or went into exile. From this time Oswiu became the or overlord over all the southern English people including Mercia. Mercia was then divided. North of the River Trent was controlled directly by Oswiu. He made Peada of Mercia, Penda's son, king over the part of Mercia south of the Trent. Peada had married Oswiu's daughter, Alflaed. Peada was murdered five months later by Alflaed, possibly on Oswiu's orders. Mercians rebelled against Oswiu and Peada's brother Wulfhere became king of Mercia.\n\n", "id": "434452", "title": "Battle of the Winwaed"}

A very good example of how this happens is the publication of scientific studies that rely on data that is inaccurate or misleading. More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.\n\nThe neologism was coined by Robert N. Proctor,\na Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology. Proctor cites the tobacco industry's conspiracy to manufacture doubt about the cancer risks of tobacco use as a very good example of how this can be done. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.\n\nThe way in which media attention works can be exploited to produce ignorance. Other factors that influence it are that corporations or governments do not reveal certain facts. At times, they force these facts to be removed if they have been revealed. The methods they use include censorship, destroying documents, putting the weight of certain facts differently, or being inattentive or forgetful.\n\nAgnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do not \"come to be,\" or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about plate tectonics was censored and delayed for at least a decade because key evidence was classified military information related to underseas warfare.\n", "id": "434488", "title": "Agnotology"}

Neologisms are often directly attributable to a specific person, publication, period, or event. (Greek: a \"new word\", or the act of creating a new word) is a synonym for it. The term \"neologism\" was first used in English in 1772, borrowed from French \"néologisme\" (1734).\n\nUsing an existing word or phrase in a new context is also called \"neologism\". The process of using a word in such a new context is sometimes called a semantic extension. A new word that has not been used by anyone but the inventer is a \"protologism\". \n\nIn psychiatry, the term \"neologism\" is used to describe the use of words that have meaning only to the person who uses them, independent of their common meaning. This tendency is considered normal in children. In adults, it can be a symptom of psychopathy or a thought disorder, such as a psychotic mental illness, for example schizophrenia. People with autism may also create neologisms. Additionally, use of neologisms may be related to aphasia acquired after brain damage resulting from a stroke or head injury.\n\nIn theology, a neologism is a relatively new doctrine (for example, Transcendentalism).

The site of the battle is reported to be at Oswestry in Shropshire.\n\nKing Oswald's uncle, King Edwin of Northumbria, was killed at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in 633 by Penda and his ally Cadwallon ap Cadfan. After the battle Cadwallon and Penda began slaughtering the people of Northumbria. This included men, women and children. Northumbria fell apart and was divided into its two former kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia. Oswald defeated and killed Cadwallon ap Cadfan at the Battle of Heavenfield in 634. After that Oswald reunited Northumbria into a single kingdom. Oswald was considered a \"\" by Bede, the fourth such overlord over the other Anglo-Saxon kings. Penda remained a constant threat but was kept busy fighting the East Angles and making new alliances with the Welsh. Oswald also created several similar alliances in an effort to contain Penda. About 638 he won a battle against Owen Map Bili, the king of Strathclyde near Edinburgh. In 640 Oswald recovered the kingdom of Lindsey from Penda.\n\nThere is no record of what led to this battle or why this place. As a pagan, Penda would not have been happy over Oswald bringing monks from Iona to Lindisfarne, further expanding Christianity in the north. The conquest of the Gododdin at Din Eidyn (Edinburgh) in 638 removed the last stronghold of the Britons in the north. Domnall Brecc, King of Dal Riata defeated them and was a close ally of Oswald. Northumbrians may have been there also. It would have angered the Welsh, Britons themselves, against Oswald. In 642 the armies of Northumbria and Mercia (with his Welsh allies) met at a place called Maserfield (probably in Shropshire). Oswald was killed in the battle. For a year after the battle his head and hands were fastened to stakes. Oswald's brother Oswiu finally recovered Oswald's body. Oswiu succeeded Oswald as king of Northumbria.\n\nThe battle of Maserfield left Penda \"the most formidable king in England.\" Following the battle, Deira, in the southern part of Northumbria, chose a king of its own, Oswine.

He was the sixty-fourth Mayor of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nBefore he was elected mayor, Ford was a city councilor. He was first elected to Toronto City Council in the 2000 Toronto municipal election. He was re-elected to his council seat twice. Ford was elected mayor in the 2010 mayoral election and he took office in December 2010.\n\nOn September 10, 2014, Ford was taken to the Humble River Hospital in North York, Ontario, Canada. Ford suffered severe stomach pains for 3 months before. It was revealed that Ford suffered an abdominal tumor. After being rushed to the hospital, Ford announced he would not be running for Mayor, but for his old seat in the City Council. Ford's term as mayor ended when John Tory succeeded Ford as mayor on December 1, 2014.\n\nOn September 17, 2014, it was announced that Ford had liposarcoma.\n\nFord served as a Toronto City Councillor for Etobicoke North (Ward 2) from December 1, 2014 until his death.\n\nRob Ford was born in Etobicoke, Ontario in 1969. He is the youngest son of Doug Ford, Sr. (1933-2006) and his wife Diane. Ford attended the public Scarlett Heights high school in Etobicoke. There he played center for the school's football team. Ford wanted to play professional football. His father treated him to summer football camps with the Washington Redskins and the University of Notre Dame.

Ford started a sales job after Carleton at Deco Labels and Tags, the family business.\n\nFord served three terms as City Councillor from 2000 until October 2010. Ford was elected mayor in 2012 with 383,501 votes (47%). Among his accomplishments Ford arranged an agreement with the city's largest union to outsource garbage collection west of Yonge Street to a private . This was done with no work stoppage.\n\nWhen he ran for mayor Ford proposed to make the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) an 'essential service'. Under Ontario law, an essential service prevents its workers from going on strike. The Toronto City Council approved of the decision in January 2011. The Government of Ontario introduced the \"The Toronto Transit Commission Labour Disputes Resolution Act\" in February 2011 and it became law in March 2011. Another campaign promise was to cancel the annual $60 personal vehicle registration tax. The council approved and it went into effect on January 1, 2011.\n\nHis first budget (2011) was balanced with no increase in taxes. A planned TTC hike was cancelled after Ford objected to it. In 2013, the city budget increased to $9.4 billion for and $2.27 billion for capital projects. The 2013 budget did not use surplus monies to balance the budget. Before the 2014 budget, Ford's office staff was shrunk and his responsibilities and committee controls were reduced.\n\nIn September 12, 2014, it was announced that Ford would not run for mayor because of health issues.

Ford lived with Renata, their daughter Stephanie and son Doug in Etobicoke. After Doug Ford Sr.'s death in 2006, the Ford family retained ownership of the firm through the Doug Ford Holdings corporation. Ford, along with his brothers and his mother were directors of the company.\n\nA week after being hospitalized for an abdominal tumor, Ford was diagnosed with liposarcoma, a type of cancer. In late 2015, the cancer spread to his bladder.

They are also called elaters, snapping beetles, spring beetles or skipjacks. These beetles can be found almost anywhere on Earth. They have the unusual ability to flick themselves into the air. When they do this, they make a \"clicking\" (or snapping) sound. The beetle does this by flexing the joint between sections of the thorax, where there is a spine on one side of the joint and a groove on the other. The peg is snapped into the groove. This makes a \"click\" that flicks the beetle into the air. If it lands on its back, then it repeats the click until it lands on its legs. Clicking is mainly used to escape from predators. The click can make it jump between 15 and 30 centimetres into the air.\n\nThe Elateridae family of beetles was first defined in 1815. There are about 9,300 known species around the world. This includes 965 species in North America.\n\nMost click beetles are under 2 centimeters long and dull in colour. Some species are large and colorful. They usually look for food during the night, and are not usually active during the day.\n\nClick beetle larvae are called wireworms. Wireworms usually spend three or four years living under the soil.

He has also written several pieces for other publications on the intersection of Hasidic and secular lives, including articles in the \"Jewish Daily Forward\", \"Tablet Magazine\", \"Salon\", and \"Zeek\".\n\nHe currently serves as a Board member at Footsteps, a New York City organization that assists formerly ultra-Orthodox Jews with transitioning to life outside the Orthodox world. \n\nDeen spent his early life among Satmar Hasidim in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and joined the Skverer sect when he was a teenager, moving to the town of New Square, to settle after marriage. He was married in 1993, and has five children.\n\nIn 2005, Deen was expelled from New Square by its leaders for holding heretical views, and several years later divorced his wife and left the Hasidic lifestyle entirely.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435137", "text": "Welfare economics\n\nWelfare economics is a field of economics that looks at the problem of allocating resources. It uses techniques from microeconomics to assess general well-being. From this assessment, it tries to find an allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy, often relative to competitive general equilibrium. It analyzes \"social welfare\" in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered. Individuals and their economic activities are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare. The aggregation may focus on a group of people, a community, or a society. There is no \"social welfare\" apart from the \"welfare\" associated with its individual units.\n\nWelfare economics typically takes individual preferences as given and tries to improve welfare in terms of Pareto efficiency. As an example, social state B is \"better\" than social state A, if at least one person prefers \"B\" and no one else opposes it. Another aspect of welfare treats income/goods distribution, including equality, as a further dimension of welfare.\n\nSocial welfare refers to the overall welfare of society. With sufficiently strong assumptions, it can be defined as the sum of the welfare of all the individuals in the society. Welfare may be measured either cardinally in terms of \"utils\" or dollars, or measured ordinally in terms of Pareto efficiency. The cardinal method in \"utils\" is rarely used in pure theory today. Its main problem is that different kinds of \"utiity\" cannot easily be summed up without losing the meaning of the measurement. In applied welfare economics money-value estimates are often used. One example of applied welfare econmics is cost-benefit analysis. Money-value estimates are a useful form of measurement where income-distribution effects are factored into the analysis or seem unlikely to change the analysis.\n\nThe capabilities approach to welfare argues that freedom - what people are free to do or be - should be included in welfare assessments, and the approach has been particularly influential in development policy circles where the emphasis on multi-dimensionality and freedom has shaped the evolution of the Human Development Index.\n\nOther classifying terms in welfare economics include externalities, equity, justice, inequality, and altruism.\n", "id": "435137", "title": "Welfare economics"}

It controls the current depending on the voltage.\n\nIn these devices resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self reset–after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high. \n\nThis makes them ideal for surge-protection applications. As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.\n\nThey can be used to protect electronics from voltages that could damage components.\n", "id": "435260", "title": "Varistor"}

They moved up the rivers Thames and Lea from what is now Belgium. Evidence for them was found in Devil's Dyke, at the eastern side of Wheathampstead. \n\nThe Devil's Dyke earthworks are remains of an ancient settlement of the Catuvellauni. It is thought to have been the tribe's original capital. The capital was moved to Verlamion, later the Roman Verulamium.

The Dyke may have been part of the same defensive rampart as nearby Beech Bottom Dyke. If correct, this would make the area one of the largest and most important British Iron Age settlements.\n\nLater, the village is recorded in the Domesday Book under name \"Watamestede\". It appears that a church existed at Wheathampstead before the Norman Conquest, as Wheathampstead was given by Edward the Confessor to Westminster Abbey.

Patton slapping incidents refer to two events that involved an American general, George S. Patton. These happened during the World War II Allied campaign in Sicily. General Patton slapped two soldiers he thought were cowards who were in hospitals for . The general lost his command. He was sent back to England and played no part in the D-Day landing in Normandy.\n\nGeorge Patton believed it was part of a general's duty to visit his wounded soldiers in hospitals. He did this more than other generals even though he personally found it hard to do. His usual visit included talking to the soldiers and telling them how much he appreciated their courage. His aids followed him pinning medals on soldiers as they went. General Omar Bradly, who knew Patton well, said that when it came to his men Patton was in spite of his manner. \n\nGrowing up, Patton had serious doubts about himself. He came from a long line of military heroes. One of his greatest fears was that he might be a coward in battle. Through his own strength of will he conquered his fear. He expected the same from all the men he commanded. . Any display of fear reminded him of his own earlier problems with fear.\n\nOn 3 August 1943 Patton was visiting the 15th Evacuation Hospital. He found a soldier sitting on a supply box. The General asked him what he was there for. The soldier, Private Charles H. Kuhl, said \"I guess I just can't take it.\" The general was immediately angry. He swore at the soldier and slapped him with his gloves. The man had malaria and dysentery. \n\nA week later at the 93rd Evacuation Hospital the general came upon Private Paul G. Bennet laying on a bed. In reply to Patton's usual question of what was wrong with him, the soldier replied \"it's my nerves.\" The general yelled \"What did you say?\" Bennet repeated himself. Then Patton angrily swore at the soldier calling him a coward. He hit the soldier and told him he had to return to the front lines. He even reached for his pistol. Patton was still yelling when he left the hospital tent.\n\nWhen Patton and his army entered Messina (16 August 1943) General Eisenhower wrote him saying he had received word of the slapping incidents. Eisenhower told Patton there was no excuse for losing his temper in front of his soldiers. He said there was no excuse for brutality of the sick and injured. He ordered Patton to publicly apologize to their divisions and to the two men personally. Patton wrote Eisenhower a note of apology. Then he proceeded to address his troops as he was ordered. On 30 August he was giving his public apology for the third and last time to the 3rd Division. Patton was giving his short speech when his troops sensed he was about to apologize. They started chanting \"No general, no, no; General, no, no.\" They cut him off from his apology and would not let him give it. Overcome with emotion Patton left the stage.\n\nThe incidents were considered handled by Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. News reporters were told not to file any stories on the incidents. In November 1943, however, one American columnist, Drew Pearson, filed the story anyway. He accused the Army of a cover-up. The American people, however, still mostly were behind Patton. The Germans were amused at the story and at the Americans. They saw nothing wrong with a general slapping a soldier. But Patton was too valuable to dismiss. So in early January 1944, Eisenhower sent him back to England. There he was placed in command of the First United States Army Group. It was an army that did not exist and was only intended to fool the Germans. The Germans thought Patton would lead the invasion of Europe, whenever it came. For the next six months Patton was on his good behavior. After the D-Day landings, he was given command of the US 3rd Army in Normandy.\n\n", "id": "435307", "title": "George S.

Most radioactive waste is a by-product of operating nuclear power plants. Certain treatments in hospitals use radioactive substances. Scientists doing certain kinds of research use radioactive substances. Nuclear weapons also produce radioactive waste. Low-level radioactive wastes are radioactive gases, solids, or liquids that give off small amounts of ionizing radiation. High-level radioactive wastes give off large amounts of ionizing radiation. \n\nRadioactive waste is dangerous to the environment, and there are many regulations about transporting it, handling it, and processing it in such a way that the dangers are reduced. They can contaminate water and affect the living organisms. Storage of radioactive waste must be guaranteed for thousands of years, until it decays sufficiently to be safe to the environment and its inhabitants. Radioactive waste can be stored by deep geological burial or by dry cask storage. Dry Cask Storage is large cylinders of concrete and steel that are used to hold 10 or more metric tons of high-level radioactive waste.

He was born in McAlester, Oklahoma October 25, 1914. He was seen as one of the chief poets of confessional poetry.\n\nWhen John Berryman was born in Oklahoma, his name was John Allyn Smith, Jr.. His father was a banker named John Allyn Smith. His mother was a schoolteacher named Martha. When he was ten years old his family moved to Tampa, Florida. In 1926, when he was twelve years old, his father shot and killed himself. This haunted the poet for the rest of his life.\n\nAfter his father died, his mother married another banker named John. His last name was Berryman. The poet took his father's name, so he ended up with the same last name as his stepfather. They moved to New York City. John was sent to a private boarding school in Connecticut. He went on to graduate from Columbia College.\n\nThe book \"Five Young American Poets\" had some of his earliest poems alongside other poets like Randall Jarrell. The publisher of this book also published Berryman's first book, \"Poems\". His next book, \"The Dispossessed\", was more mature but received mostly bad reviews. When Jarrell reviewed Berryman's book, he wrote that Berryman's poems sounded too much like William Butler Yeats. Berryman later said, \"I didn't want to be \"like\" Yeats; I wanted to \"be\" Yeats.\"\n\nIn 1947 John Berryman started seeing a married woman while he was married to his first wife. He wrote many sonnets about her, but they were not published until 1967.\n\nIn 1950 he wrote a biography of the writer Stephen Crane, who he admired. He also published a book of poems called \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet.\" This book also featured drawings by the artist Ben Shahn. It was his first book to get attention from people all across the United States of America.\n\nEven though \"Homage to Mistress Bradstreet\" was successful, Berryman's biggest breakthrough came with \"77 Dream Songs\" in 1964. This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965. Berryman wrote a much longer sequel, \"His Toy, HIs Dream, His Rest\". This book was just as successful. He later combined the two into one book, \"The Dream Songs\".\n\nOn January 7, 1972, John Berryman killed himself by jumping off the Washington Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nBerryman wrote about shame, like mental illness and lust. He said that he was not writing about himself but about made-up people. Despite this remark, many critics believe Berryman did write about himself. John Berryman's best-known poems were called Dream Songs. He put out the 385 Dream Songs in two books: \"77 Dream Songs\" and \"His Toy, His Dream, His Rest.\" Later he put them into one book: \"The Dream Songs\".\n", "id": "435438", "title": "John Berryman"}

He was the son of a Roman senator, Faustinus, and the cousin of Roman consul Tiberius Flavius Clemens.\n\nHe was recognized as a great historian and recorded many important events in his time such as the martyrdom of his predecessors and the settling of disputes among Christians. During a time of trouble within the Christian community, Clement wrote to the church in Corinth, asking them to end their dispute with their fellow christians, which they did. This established the precedent of Popes being the final person to decide the rules within the Church. He either established, or continued the practice of recording the laws and customs of the Church.\n\nClement's persecution began with Emperor Trajan who sent him to do hard labor in a mine. He used that time to teach his fellow Christians and it was said that during that time he even taughted some pagans in Christianity. He is also credited with performing a miracle during that time. He is know as the \"Pope of Convicts\".\n\nHis martyrdom was described as being tied to an anchor and dragged out to sea.\n\nHis relics and the anchor were retrieved and preserved in a church that was submerged in the Black Sea.

It was made popular in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Knights were often said to have had intimate relationships with the noble ladies they served. These relationships were usually not physical. Since marriage was commonly just a formal arrangement without love, courtly love allowed women to be emotionally intimate with a man.\n\nRomance is a major theme found in art, particularly literature and fiction.

It is done to help the crops grow and to use the space available as much as possible.\n\nDepending on the crops chosen, companion planting may encourage processes that help the plants, such as pollination. Some companion plants may help stop pests, such as caterpillars or fungi, from damaging the crop. Some of these, called \"trap crops\" attract pests away from the crop. Other plants may serve as shelter for the crops.\n\nMany of the basic principles of companion planting were used thousands of years ago in Mesoamerica. From about 8,000 years ago, Native American peoples grew squash, maize and common beans together. The stalk of the corn were there for the beans to climb, and the beans fixed nitrogen, helping the maize.\n\n", "id": "435696", "title": "Companion planting"}

Endonucleases break nucleic acid chains somewhere in the middle of the molecule. Exonucleases remove nucleotides from the ends of DNA molecules.\n\nA restriction endonuclease does a specific job. It scans the length of a DNA molecule. Once it finds a particular sequence, it binds to the DNA molecule and makes a cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones. \n\nDifferent endonucleases cut in different places, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule breaks into fragments. In fact, more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since their discovery.\n\nThese enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to \"cut and paste\" DNA molecules.

Aretino was started by Arthur J. O’Neill. He started many record and phonograph businesses in the Chicago area. O’Neill named this company in honor of Guido Aretino, an 11th-century Italian monk.\n\nAretino is an odd type of record because the hole in the center is very large compared to the normal size. It is the largest ever for a record that was made for people to use in their houses. Like many of O'Neill's other companies, Aretino was run as a premium scheme. A phonograph (record player) was offered for not much money. However, this record player could only play Aretino records because it came with a 3-inch spindle. O’Neill also offered adapters for Aretino discs. These allowed the discs to be played on record players that had normal spindles, or even on a Busy Bee machine (another O’Neill brand) which had two spindles instead of one.\n\nAretino did not make any of its own recordings: it borrowed masters from other companies. The first series of Aretino records had music on only one side of the disc. They were each given a catalog number beginning with the letter A. The music was recorded on them by Leeds & Catlin. Leeds and Catlin also made a group of records for Aretino with catalog numbers starting with the letter D. These records have a recording on both sides. They are very hard to find now. Leeds & Catlin was later shut down by court order for patent infringement. After that, Aretino records were made for a short time by two record companies named Hawthorne & Sheble and Zonophone. These companies kept making records which only had music on one side of the record. They also kept using catalog numbers beginning with \"A\".\n\nIt was not long after this that Columbia became the maker of these records. No other companies made records for Aretino after Columbia began to make them. These records have a catalog number that begins with the letter \"D\" and then numbers that are larger than 500. They have music on both sides. Of all Aretino records, these are the most common. Most records from this time period have a diameter of 10 inches. Columbia also made a group of records for Aretino that are 12 inches in diameter. These are very hard to find. They have catalog numbers with the letter \"A\" at the beginning. Aretino stopped making anything after the year 1914.\nThe music on the Aretino label was like most music from those years. Some artists on Aretino are Henry Burr, William F. Denny, Byron G.

Shotgun Sports include several different events, each with different rules. The general goal of a shotgun event is to break a clay target, but the targets are thrown in different manners depending on the game.\n\nIn sporting clays, a shooter will walk through a course generally consisting of ten stations. Each station will have two targets that are thrown as a true pair or as a report pair(one thrown on pull command and one thrown on gun fire). Sporting clay courses are generally scored out of a 100.\n\nTrap is another clay target event. A game of trap is scored out of 25, and a full trap event generally consists of 4 trap games, or 100 targets. In this event, a team of 5 shooters lines up behind a trap house. Inside the trap house is a pivoting arm that throws a clay out at a random direction when 'pull' is called. To vary the difficulty of this game, shooters can stand farther back from the house.\n\nIn the skeet shooting event, a shooter moves around a field in a semi circle. Skeet, like Trap, is also a 25 target game, with skeet events generally consisting of four games. There are 8 stations on the field. On one end of a field is a high house, and on the other end of the field, there is a low house. On station 1, 2, 6, and 7 a high single, low single, and double are shot. On stations 3, 4, and 5 a high single and low single are shot. Station 8 is in between the high and low house. At this station, the shooter faces the high house, shoots a high single, then turns and faces the low house to shoot a low single. This totals 24 targets. The last target, to make 25, comes from what is referred to as the option. The option is a target that is shot after the first target that is missed. If the shooter misses the high bird on station 1, the high bird is shot again. If the shooter makes it all the way around the field without missing a bird, a second low single is shot on station 8, totaling a perfect 25. \n\n", "id": "435808", "title": "Shotgun Sports"}

For example, the function formula_1 is a constant function because the value of  formula_2  is 4 regardless of the input value formula_3 (see image).\n\nFormally, a constant function \"f\"(\"x\"):R→R has the form  formula_4. Usually we write formula_5  or just  formula_6. \n\nExample: The function  formula_7  or just  formula_8  is the specific constant function where the output value is  formula_9. The domain is all real numbers ℝ. The codomain is just {4}. Namely, \"y\"(0)=4, \"y\"(−2.7)=4, \"y\"(π)=4... No matter what value of \"x\" is input, the output is \"4\". \n\n\n\n\nIn the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function measures the rate of change of function (output) values with respect to change in input values. A constant function does not change, so its derivative is 0. This is often written:  formula_12 . \n\nExample:  formula_13  is a constant function. The derivative of \"y\" is the identically zero function   formula_14  .\n\nThe converse (opposite) is also true. That is, if the derivative of a function is zero everywhere, then the function is a constant function.\n\nMathematically we write these two statements: \n\nA function \"f\" : \"A\" → \"B\" is a constant function if \"f\"(\"a\") = \"f\"(\"b\") for every \"a\" and \"b\" in \"A\".\nReal-world example: A store where every item is sold for 1 euro. The domain of this function is \"items in the store\". The codomain is \"1 euro\".\n\nExample: Let \"f\" : \"A\" → \"B\" where \"A\"={X,Y,Z,W} and \"B\"={1,2,3} and \"f\"(\"a\")=3 for every \"a\"∈\"A\". Then \"f\" is a constant function.\n\nExample: \"z\"(\"x\",\"y\")=2 is the constant function from \"A\"=ℝ² to \"B\"=ℝ where every point (\"x\",\"y\")∈ℝ² is mapped to the value \"z\"=2. The graph of this constant function is the horizontal plane (parallel to the \"x\"0\"y\" plane) in 3-dimensional space that passes through the point (0,0,2).\n\nExample: The polar function \"ρ\"(\"φ\")=2.5 is the constant function that maps every \"angle\" φ to the \"radius\" ρ=2.5. The graph of this function is the circle of radius 2.5 in the plane.\n\nThere are other properties of constant functions. See on English Wikipedia\n\n", "id": "435860", "title": "Constant function"}

On his way back, ideas began in his mind which he developed later as his theory of evolution by natural selection. The second edition of 1845 includes some suggestion of this.\n\nLater, he realised he had made a big mistake in not noting which islands some specimens from the Galapagos Islands were found on. He knew this was a mistake because he had sensed how islands were rather like the higher parts of mountains, which also have many unique species.

On May 15, 2011, he became Cultural Counselor and Head of Educational Mission at the Embassy of Egypt in Berlin.\n\nHe attended high school in Cairo. In 1979, he registered at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University. In July 1981, he was looking for a summer job as a student. He went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and met with Dr. Mohamed Saleh, the vice director of the museum. He worked there for one month. In summer 1982, he worked at the museum again for a summer student job. He did work that brought him in contact with all departments of the museum. In 1983, he graduated at the Faculty of Archeology, Cairo University.\n\nAfter his graduation, he worked again for the museum for one month for free. After that, he joined the restoration team of the Coptic Museum for several months. In January 1984, he started his 15 month long conscription service. He worked at the museum again from April 1985 to September 1987. He rejoined his Faculty at Cairo University to resume higher studies. The thesis of his Master's Degree was \"St- Meskhnet hall at Dendara Temple, linguistic and cultural study\" under supervision of Prof. Abdelhalim Noureldin and partnership of Dr. Ola El-Aguizy.\n\nThrough his work at the Museum he became acquainted to many Egyptologists and archaeologists who visited the Museum. Among those was Prof. Erich Winter at Trier University, who along with his wife visited Egypt in 1987 and were accompanied by the young Mamdouh Eldamaty during their 3-day visit to Siwa Oasis. This new contact proved to be quite useful as Prof. Winter encouraged the young Egyptologist to continue his studies under his supervision at the Department of Egyptology at Trier University.\n\nIn October 1988 he worked as a curator at Faculty of Archaeology Museum of Cairo University. During his work he got his Master Degree in April 1989 in Egyptology from the same faculty. Immediately he left Egypt for Germany on leave to prepare his PhD. \nTrying his luck without any state sponsored scholarship it was rather difficult to get an entry visa to study in Germany without guarantor. Thanks to the help and support of his Professor and guarantor, Prof. Dr. Mohamed Saleh, an entry visa was issued and he started his German courses at Cologne University as soon as he arrived to Germany. He supported his life by working during summer vacation. While in Cologne he held correspondence with Trier University. He got an acceptance from Trier University, which he joined from winter semester 1989/ 1990. He started his Trier residence by learning German until he acquired the ‘Prüfung zum Nachweis der Deutsch Sprachkenntnis’ that qualified him to regular study at the university. He registered for Egyptology as major subject with classical archaeology and ethnology as minor subject in summer semester 1991.\n\nAt the winter semester 1992/ 93 he registered for his PhD with thesis ‘Sokar- Osiris- Kapelle im Tempel von Dendera’ for which he received a study scholarship from Ministry of Culture at Rhineland Palatia that enabled him to conclude his study in June 1995. \nDuring his stay in Germany, on February 26th 1992 he married Aida Abdelghany Ahmed, who studied sociology at Zagazig University. She accompanied him to Germany where gave birth to their first daughter, Mariam (11.Feb. 1993) in Trier.\n\nHaving concluded his PhD, he returned to Egypt in September 1995 but kept visiting Trier frequently in the years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2007 in order to follow recent publications and studies on Egyptology.\nBack in Cairo, where the family got a son and another daughter, he resumed his work for the Faculty’s Museum until January 1996.\n\nStarting from January 1996 he started as lecturer for Egyptology at Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Cairo University, Fayoum Branch. Upon founding an archaeological department at the Faculty of arts, Ain Shams University in August 1998, he moved to the new department as a lecturer for Egyptology until end of 2001.\n\nAt the beginning of 2001 he was appointed Director General of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, a post that he held until End of January 2004.\n\nDuring his directorship the Museum witnessed several far reaching activities, developing its cellar (April 2001), restoration of old records of the Museum (May 2001), preparing for the second chamber for royal mummies (June 2001) and establishing restoration laboratory for papyrus, in cooperation with Corrado Basile, Director of Istituto Internazionale del Papiro, Siracusa in Italy (March 2003).\n\nIn July 2001 he laid forward a concept for the centennial of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which included several projects to promote and develop the old institution. This concept was approved by Dr. Gaballa Ali Gaballa, the then Secretary General of the Higher Council for Monuments and by the Minister of Culture as well.\nThese activities were performed in late 2002 in the time of the successor of Gaballa, Dr. Zahi Hawas, who gave this ceremony special attention.\n\nEldamaty was assigned also to supervise the external exhibitions committee from May 2002 till February 2004.\n\nHaving concluded his assignment at the Egyptian Museum he returned to his main work in teaching at the Ain Shams University. There he got the post of associate professor of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts from 25.03.2001 till 20.08.2006. As of 21.08.2006 he became a full professor of Egyptology and presided over the archaeological Department of Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University from 12.09.2006 till 12.09.2009.\n\nBesides he was assigned to head the college center for studies, consultations and training from 15.10.2008 till 13.10.2009 when he overtook the post of director of open education center from 22.03.2009 till 15.11.2009.\nStarting from 13.09.2009 till 14.05.2011 he was the Dean of Faculty of Arts at the Ain Shams University. During his deanship he supervised the project for sustainable development and qualifying for Accreditation. This sustainable development specified certain criteria for selection of university cadres, which was approved by the college council, albeit not by the university council due to the political conditions accompanying the Arab spring in January 2011.\n\nFollowing the revolution he organized the first election process in Egyptian universities to choose his successor as Dean of the Faculty in March 2011, as he left the country on 15.05.2011 in the capacity of cultural counselor at the Egyptian Embassy to Berlin and head of educational mission there.

Demonstrations in Phnom Penh have taken place against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. These were because many reasons, including widespread claims of election fraud during the Cambodian general election of 2013. Protesters want the minimum wage raised to $160 a month. There is also resentment over Vietnamese influence in Cambodia. Also, Cambodia is a very poor country and the government is not doing much to address the issues. The main opposition party, CNRP (Cambodia National Rescue Party), refused to participate in parliament after the elections. Major demonstrations took place all through December 2013. The government took action in January 2014. This led to the deaths of 4 people and the clearing of the main protest camp.\n\nHun Sen has been the prime minister of Cambodia for 28 years. He is the leader of the Cambodian People's Party (CPP). In 2013 he was challenged by Sam Rainsy leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). On 28 July 2013 general elections were held in Cambodia. The ruling Cambodian People's Party claimed victory by winning 68 seats in Parliament. The Cambodia National Rescue Party won 55 seats. They then rejected the election results and boycotted the opening of parliament. The CNRP claimed there had been irregularities with the voting. The European Union (E.U.) and the United States also expressed concern about possible fraud. The international non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch called for an 'independent commission' to investigate charges of election fraud.\n\nSecurity police clashed with Cambodian protesters when the police blocked the two main roads near the Kbal Thnal Bridge leading into Phnom Penh. Police shot and killed one protester wearing a yellow headband with the word, “We demand Justice”. Three others were seriously injured. Ten people were arrested. Police used firearms, tear gas and against the protesters. The protesters smashed a barrier in the middle of a road. They also threw rocks, shoes and other objects at the police. One policeman was injured. This clash happened the day before the scheduled talks between Prime Minister Hun Sen and CRNP leader Sam Rainsy.\n\nA woman was shot and nine others were wounded when clothing workers in Phnom Penh protested . About 100 police blocked some 600 protesters who were airing their complaints over low pay and poor working conditions along Stung Meanchey road. Police fired live bullets and tear gas to rescue fellow officers. Protesters threw rocks at police. When protesters retreated into a pagoda police fired tear gas into the building. Buddhist monks joined in the protests also throwing rocks at police. More than a dozen people including several monks were arrested.\n\nOn 27 December striking garment workers and police officers clashed on a road on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The opposition party organised large protests in Phnom Penh during December, including motorbike rallies. The government called the protests illegal and stated that they were 'inciting anarchy'.\n\nOn 3 January at least four people were shot to death and 20 others were injured when police opened fire to break up a protest by garment workers. The workers were demanding their minimum wage be doubled. They had blocked the road with burning tires. Protesters also threw objects at police. By this time most of the workers at Cambodia's 500 factories were on strike. The demand was still for a $160 a month in minimum wage while the government had offered $100. This was the second day of strikes and clashes with police. The opposition party and anti-government protesters have close ties with the labor movement. Unions representing disgruntled garment workers joined the protest with opposition supporters against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen. They want a re-run of the July election. Sam Rainsy, CNRP leader promised to nearly double wage to $160 if CNRP wins a re-election.\n\nOn 4 January a camp occupied by anti-government demonstrators was taken down by Cambodian officials. The camp was in Freedom Park. Hundreds of CNRP supporters started occupying the space on 15 December. It is the only place in Phnom Penh that allowed protests. Protesters fled with their belongings as they saw police approaching. Police did not enter the park, but allowed security guards and city workers to take down the stage and clear the grounds. In spite of the clearing of the park a rally planned for Sunday would go ahead according to Rainsy. At that rally at least eight people injured. On 6 January a protest was led by radio station owner Mam Sonando. They gathered in front of the Cambodia Ministry of Information to demand a license for a television channel. The government rejected the application saying that there was no frequency available. All local TV channels are closely linked to Prime Minister Hun Sen.\n", "id": "436127", "title": "2013–14 Cambodian protests"}

He led a genetics research lab at Purdue University and at the California Institute of Technology.\n\nBenzer made fundamental discoveries in two quite different fields of genetics. He got his PhD in solid-state physics, but soon switched to genetics after he read Erwin Schrödinger's book \"What is Life?\"\n\nAt Purdue University, Benzer developed the \"T4 rII system\", a new genetic technique. This used recombination in T4 bacteriophage rII mutants to map the inside structure of genes. Benzer realized that by generating many r mutants and recording the recombination frequency between different r strains, he could make a detailed map of the gene, much as Alfred Sturtevant had done for chromosomes. \n\nTaking advantage of the enormous number of recombinants that could be analyzed in the rII mutant system, Benzer was eventually able to map over 2400 rII mutations. The data he collected provided the first evidence that the gene is not an indivisible entity, as previously believed, and that genes were linear. Based on his rII data, Benzer also proposed distinct classes of mutations including deletions, point mutations, missense mutations, and nonsense mutations.\n\nBenzer was one of the first scientists in the field of behavioral genetics. As the field began to emerge in the 1960s and 70s, Benzer found himself in scientific opposition to another of the field's leading researchers, Jerry Hirsch. \n\nHirsch believed that behaviors were so complex they could not be explained as the action of single genes, Benzer thought behaviors might be directed by single genes. Both researchers tried their ideas out on \"Drosophila\". Hirsch artificially selected for behaviors of interest over many generations, while Benzer used methods to isolate mutants for a particular behavior. Benzer and Hirsch's competing philosophies developed behavioral genetics, and helped it become a legitimate area of study in the scientific community.\n\n\nHe was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences.\n", "id": "436283", "title": "Seymour Benzer"}

He was best known for his critique of group selection, though later in life he recognized that it did sometimes occur. The work of Williams in this area, with W.D. Hamilton, John Maynard Smith and others, led to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution.\n\nIn 1999 Williams shared the Crafoord Prize, with Maynard Smith and Ernst Mayr, for developing the concept of evolutionary biology.\n\nWilliams' 1957 paper \"Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence\" was influential in 20th century evolutionary biology. It contains three important ideas. In this paper Williams proposed that senescence should be generally synchronized by natural selection.\n\n\"if the adverse genic effects appeared earlier in one system than any other, they would be removed by selection from that system more readily than from any other. In other words, natural selection will always be in greatest opposition to the decline of the most senescence-prone system.\" \n\nThis paper also contains the first outline of the idea that natural selection might select for menopause and post-reproductive life in females, although Williams does not explicitly mention grandchildren or the inclusive fitness contribution of grandparenting. By helping grandchildren survive, grandparents promote the survival of an average of one-quarter (1/4) of their own genome.\n\nIn his first book, \"Adaptation and Natural Selection\", Williams advocated a \"ground rule or perhaps \"doctrine\" would be a better term ... that adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary\", and, that, when it is necessary, selection among genes or individuals would in general be the preferable explanation for it. This contributed to the development of a gene-centered view of evolution; Richard Dawkins built on Williams' ideas in this area in the book \"The Selfish Gene\".\n\nWilliams was also well known for his work on the evolution of sex, and was an advocate of evolutionary medicine.\n\n", "id": "436444", "title": "George C.

It was fought near the town of Lewes, in Sussex, England. The battle took place on 14 May 1264. It was one of two main battles of the conflict known as the Second Barons' War.\n\nThe two armies that met in the battle were led by King Henry III of England and a rebel leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Henry III's son, Prince Edward, fought on his side. The battle came about because many of the leading noblemen of England were unhappy with the way King Henry was ruling the country. They wanted more involvement in the government. The Barons voted to hold a Parliament regularly so that they could discuss subjects such as taxation. King Henry would not agree to this, and so both sides started to raise armies. When the two sides met at Lewes two days before, Simon de Montfort tried to arrange a truce with the king. King Henry refused and so both sides got ready to fight a battle. \n\nThe king's army was nearly twice as big as the rebel army. The battle began when the Baronial forces attacked the king's . When the fighting started, it looked as though the king's army would win easily. Prince Edward, who was only 25, was headstrong and made one big mistake. Edward was in charge of the cavalry, who did well in the battle but then chased some of the rebels who were running away. By the time they came back to the battlefield, the rebels had managed to win the battle. With Edward off chasing foot soldiers, Henry was forced to attack using his two remaining divisions. Henry led one, the other was led by his brother, Richard, Earl of Cornwall. Henry's division fought until driven back by the Baronial reserve forces. Cornwall's division did not do well from the start. Cornwall fled the field and hid in a windmill but was quickly captured by the barons. As a result of the battle, King Henry III was forced to sign a document called the Mise of Lewes. This gave the rebel barons what they wanted. A year later the barons were defeated at the Battle of Evesham.\n\n\n\n<br>\n", "id": "436479", "title": "Battle of Lewes"}

It is used to assist with their duties in patrolling and responding to incidents. Typical uses of a police car include transportation for officers to reach the scene of an incident quickly. Police cars are also used to transport suspects, or to an area. Police cars usually marked to identify them. This is a high visibility to crime. Some police cars are adapted for certain functions such as traffic control, to transport police dogs or bomb disposal.\n\nIn the United Kingdom in the early 1900s, police vehicles were first used to chase speeding motorists. This had very poor results until police schools were opened to teach officers how to use their vehicles properly. In 1910 the first police car in the US was used in Akron, Ohio. By 1920 police cars were in wide use in the US. It was noticed that patrol cars allowed police to respond faster. It also allowed an officer to cover a wider area. By the 1960s most major cities had shifted away from foot patrols altogether in favor of police cars. But studies proved a mix of foot officers and police vehicles worked best.\n\nPolice cars are often identified with high speed of fleeing . The offense may have been anything from a to a major felony. Suspects often attempt to lose law enforcement by driving away, sometimes at high speed. From 1990 to 2005, 136 people were killed in the US in high speed pursuits by police. Despite controversy as to whether high speed chases are necessary police continue to work on the problem using technology and new techniques. One technique is the 'take out'. A take out is a technique used to cause the fleeing vehicle to lose control and be turned sideways by the police vehicle. \n\nTerms for police cars include (police) cruiser, squad car, area car and patrol car. In some places, a police car may also be informally known as a cop car, a 'Black and white', a 'Cherry top', a 'gumball machine', a 'jam sandwich' or 'panda car'. Depending on the configuration of the emergency lights and livery, a police car may be considered a marked or unmarked unit.\n\n<br>\n", "id": "436624", "title": "Police car"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436664", "text": "Linear function\n\nIn basic mathematics, a linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line in 2-dimensions (see images). An example is: \"y\"=2\"x\"–1. In higher mathematics, a linear function often refers to a linear mapping.\n\nFormally, a linear function is a function \"f\"(\"x\"):R→R such that the graph of \"f\" is a line. This means the domain or input of \"f\" is a real number R and the range or output of \"f\" is also a real number R. Usually we write \"y\"(\"x\") or just \"y\" in place of \"f\"(\"x\"). So the formal statement means:\n\nThere are three main forms for writing linear functions: slope-intercept, standard and parametric.\nThe slope-intercept (also called point-slope or explicit) form of a linear function is  formula_1  or  formula_2 . This form has 2 variables \"x\" and \"у\" and 2 constants \"m\" and \"b\". \n\nExample: \"y\"=–2\"x\"+4. The slope is \"m\"= –2 and the \"y\"-intercept is \"b\"=4 or the point (0,4). Substituting \"y\"=0 and solving for \"x\", we get 0=–2\"x\"+4 or \"x\"=2. So \"x\"=2 is the root of this linear function and the point (2,0) is the \"x\"-intercept. Since the slope is \"m\" = –2, the line is decreasing. Since |–2|=2>1, the decrease is \"relatively\" steep. For each change in \"х\" of 1 (to the right), the value of \"у\" changes -2 (goes down). \n\nExample: \"y\"=–2\"x\"+4. Substituting \"x\"=0 we get \"y\"=4 (this is the \"y\"-intercept) and thus the point (0,4). Substituting \"x\"=1, we get \"y\"=2 and thus the point (1,2). Plot these points and draw the line. (Notice that the 2nd point is 1 to the right and 2 down from the 1st point. As we said in the above example, this happens because the slope is \"m\"= –2) \n\nExample: \"y\"= –\"x\"+2. Suppose \"y\"= –1. We substitute \"y\"= –1 and get: –1= –'x\"+2 or \"x\"=3. This is the only solution. We can do this for any \"y\"-value.\n\n   formula_3.\n\nExample: The linear function 3\"x\"–2\"y\"=1 is in standard form. The constants are \"A\"=3, \"B\"=–2 and \"C\"=1. \n\nExample: The lines 3\"x\"–2\"y\"=1 and 6\"x\"–4\"y\"=2 are coincident (same line). Here the factor is: \"k\"=2. We multiplied the first equation by 2 to get the second equation. The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"=1.5\"x\"–0.5 (solve either equation for y).\nParametric form: formula_5    or\n\nVector form: formula_6  or  formula_7 .\n\n\nExample: X=(–1,1)+\"t\"(2,3), t∈R is a line in vector form. Here: \"a\"=2, \"a\"=3, \"x\"=–1 and \"x\"=1. The line goes through the points (\"x\",\"y\")=(–1,1) and (\"x\"+\"a\",\"y\"+\"a\")=(1,4). The corresponding parametric form of this line is: \"x\"(\"t\")= –1+2\"t\", \"y\"(\"t\")=1+3\"t\". The unique slope-intercept form of this line is: \"y\"(\"x\")=1.5\"x\"+2.5   (solve the first equation for \"t\" and substitute this result into the second equation).\n\nExample: X=(–1,1,2)+\"t\"(2,3,–1), t∈R is a line in 3-dimensional space. The line goes through the points (–1,1,2) and (1,4,1).\n\nIn the context where it is defined, the derivative of a function is a measure of the rate of change of function values with respect to change in input values. A linear function has a constant rate of change. This rate of change is the slope \"m\". So \"m\" is the derivative. This is often written:\n\nExample: \"y\"= –2\"x\"+4. Here \"m\"= –2 and so \"y\"′= –2.\n\nOften, the terms \"linear equation\" and \"linear function\" are confused. Both are polynomials. However, the word \"linear\" in \"linear equation\" means that all terms with variables are first degree. (The word \"linear\" in \"linear function\" means the graph is a line.) A linear equation can have 1, 2, 3, or more variables. So a linear equation is a linear function only if it has exactly 2 variables. (A linear equation in one variable is a point on the number line and a linear equation in 3 variables is a plane in 3-dimensional space.)\n\nMany countries and disciplines use different letters and ordering for the different forms. \nIn many countries, a linear functions is often written as formula_9 where \"a\" is the slope and \"b\" is the \"y\"-intercept.\n\nIn business and economics, a linear function is often written as formula_10 where \"a\" is the \"y\"-intercept and \"b\" is the slope.\n\n\n", "id": "436664", "title": "Linear function"}

He first went to school at age 12, going to Victoria College four years later to study science and the arts. He later went to Christ's College in Cambridge to study law.\n\nSmuts was a supporter of Cecil Rhodes until it was revealed that he was apart of the Jameson Raid by a group of Uitlanders (\"foreigners\" in Afrikaans) in the Transvaal Republic. In 1898, Smuts moved to Johannesburg in the Transvaal to practice law and later became a minister in the Transvaal government until the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War.\n\nDuring the Boer War, he led a Boer Commando in the Cape Colony using guerrilla tactics. After the war, Smuts joined the cabinet led by Louis Botha in 1907. However, uneasiness with his Afrikaner comrades cooperating with the British led him to disown the Afrikaners on year later, declaring himself to be South African instead.\n\nTwo years after the Union of South Africa was formed, Smuts created the Union Defence Force (UDF). He led the UDF and was instrumental in the conquest of German South-West Africa and German East Africa during World War I. In 1917, Smuts was invited to join the Imperial War Cabinet. In 1918, Smuts helped created the Royal Air Force.\n\nSmuts and Botha were key negotiators at the Paris Peace Conference. After signing the Treaty of Versailles, which gave South Africa control over Namibia, Smuts returned to politics.\n\nWhen Botha died in 1919, Smuts became Prime Minister, serving until his defeat in 1924 to the National Party.\n\nAfter serving nine years in opposition, Smuts became Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government led by Barry Hertzog.\nWhen Hertzog asked for neutrality towards Nazi Germany during World War II, he was deposed and Smuts became Prime Minister again. During World War II, Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet again, where he worked closely with Winston Churchill. In 28 May 1941, Smuts became a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. This cooperation with Churchill made Smuts very unpopular with the Afrikaners, which led to his downfall.\n\nIn May 1945, Smuts represented South Africa during the drafting of the Charter of the United Nations. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international organisation to preserve peace. Smuts signed the Paris Peace Treaty, becoming the only person to sign the treaties that ended both the First and Second World Wars.\n\nAfter World War II, Smuts continued to represent South Africa internationally. However, his support for the war and plans to change racial segregation in South Africa made him very unpopular with the Afrikaners, and in 1948, lost the election to Daniel Francois Malan and the pro-Apartheid National Party.\n\nSmuts died on 11 September 1950 from a heart attack on his family farm.\n", "id": "436729", "title": "Jan Smuts"}

It was the first flying medical service in the world. It provides emergency and other health care to people living in rural and remote areas. It is a not-for-profit organisation.\n\nCommunities in the Outback and the bush are generally small, and spread over large distances. Many farms, stations and outstations are located far from towns over rough trails. Because of this, many of these places do not have access to hospitals or doctors. The Flying Doctor Service brings medical service to them. It can land planes in any community that has an airstrip.\n\nToday it has a fleet of about 60 planes. They fly from 21 bases located across Australia.\n\nThe service was started by Reverend John Flynn. He had worked in rural areas of Victoria. In 1912, he was asked by the Presbyterian Church to look at the needs of people living in the Northern Territory. His report about it led to the creation of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM). Flynn became the manager of this. It began as one nursing clinic. By 1926, it had become a network of ten nursing clinics.\n\nOn 15 May 1928, Flynn formed the AIM Aerial Medical Service. This was an experiment based in Cloncurry, in Queensland. AIM leased a de Havilland DH.50 plane from the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service (Qantas). The plane was named \"Victory\". It would fly doctors to remote communities. The service answered its first call on 17 May 1928. From Cloncurry, the plane flew to Julia Creek in central Queensland. Within its first year of operations, the service flew more than 30,000 kilometres in 50 flights. It became the world's first flying ambulance service.\n\nFrom the mid-1920s, Flynn had been experimenting with radio together with Alfred Traeger. Traeger built the first pedal-powered transmitter in 1929. It allowed people in remote places to contact a central medical base. These transmitters were given out gradually to stations, missions and other communities around Cloncurry. Cloncurry was the base site for a large transmitter.\n\nDuring its first few decades, the service got most of its money from community fundraising, volunteers and donations. Today, the service gets financial help from the federal and state governments. But it still needs money from fundraising and donations from the community.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the service mostly leased planes and pilots. After this point, the service moved on to buying its own equipment and employing its own pilots and mechanics.\n\nBy the early 1930s, there was growing interest in expanding the service across the continent. Demand for its services was increasing. In response, the service expanded its fleet by hiring more planes and more pilots. Money from fundraising and the Australian Government helped to finance the project. In 1934, it became the Australian Aerial Medical Service. It opened up new bases across the country, in Wyndham, Port Hedland, Kalgoorlie, Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Meekatharra, Charters Towers and Charleville. These bases were organised into \"sections\". A council to manage the organisation was formed in 1936.\n\nThe service's name was changed to the Flying Doctor Service in 1942. It was given the honorific \"Royal\" in 1955.\n\n\n\n", "id": "437007", "title": "Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia"}

Thomas Henry Huxley in the 1860s had thought birds evolved from dinosaurs, based on a comparison of \"Archaeopteryx\" with \"Compsognathus\". Huxley's idea was later discarded, mainly because Heilmann, in 1926, had different views. \n\nThe first of Ostrom's reviews of the osteology and phylogeny of the primitive bird \"Archaeopteryx\" appeared in 1976. After the modern discoveries of fossil dinobirds in China, the HuxleyOstrom theory was accepted by almost all palaeontologists.\n\nOstrom was a professor at Yale University. He was the Curator Emeritus of vertebrate paleontology at the Peabody Museum of Natural History, which has an impressive fossil collection started by Othniel Charles Marsh. He died from complications of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHis 1964 discovery of \"Deinonychus\" was one of the most important fossil finds in history. \"Deinonychus\" was an active predator that clearly killed its prey by leaping and slashing or stabbing with its \"terrible claw\". Evidence of a truly active lifestyle included long strings of tendons running along the tail, making it a stiff counterbalance for jumping and running. The conclusion that at least some dinosaurs had a high metabolism, and were therefore warm-blooded, was popularized by his student Robert Bakker. This helped to change the impression of dinosaurs as the sluggish, slow, cold-blooded lizards which had prevailed since the turn of the century.\n\nThis changed how dinosaurs are seen by both professional dinosaur illustrators, and by the public. The find is also credited with triggering the \"dinosaur renaissance\", a term coined in a 1975 issue of \"Scientific American\" by Bakker. It describes the renewed interest in paleontology, which has lasted from the 1970s to the present. \n\nOstrom's interest in the dinosaur-bird connection started with his study of what is now known as the Haarlem \"Archaeopteryx\". Discovered in 1855, it was actually the first specimen recovered but, incorrectly labeled as \"Pterodactylus crassipes\", it languished in the Teyler's Museum in the Netherlands until Ostrom's 1970 paper (and 1972 description) correctly identified it as one of only eight \"first birds\" (counting the solitary feather).\n\nOstrom also studied fossilized trackways of the duckbilled dinosaur \"Hadrosaurus\". He decided they traveled in herds. To this extent they were social animals like many birds and mammals, but unlike lizards.\n\n\n", "id": "437142", "title": "John Ostrom"}

She was born in Moscow, Soviet Union. \n\nPlisetskaya gained an interest in ballet at a young age and was active during the Soviet period. She has been called by some, such as Nikita Khrushchev, one of the best ballerinas of all time. She was married to composer and pianist Rodion Shchedrin from 1958 until her death.\n\nPlisetskaya was born in Moscow, Russia to Lithuanian Jewish parents. Her mother, Rachel Messerer, was a silent movie actress and her father, Mikhail Plisetski, was a diplomat. She studied at the Bolshoi Theater.\n\nIn 1938, her father was arrested and later executed during the Stalinist purges. Her mother was arrested soon after and, with Maya's seven-month-old baby brother, sent to a gulag in Kazakhstan for the next three years. Plisetskaya was taken in by her maternal aunt (a ballerina) until her mother was released in 1941. \n\nDuring the years without her parents, and barely a teenager, Plisetskaya \"faced terror, war, and dislocation\". As a result, \"Maya took refuge in ballet and the Bolshoi Theatre\".\n\nFor many years she was not allowed to tour outside the Soviet Union. This ban was lifted in 1959 by Nikita Khrushchev. \n\nAble to travel the world as a member of the Bolshoi, her skill as a dancer was widely recognised. It set a high standard for ballerinas in technique and dramatic presence. Khrushchev allowed her to go on the Bolshoi tour in New York and he was immensely satisfied upon reading the reviews of her performances. He embraced her on her return.\n\nWithin a few years, she was recognized as “an international superstar” and a continuous “box office hit throughout the world”. The Soviet Union treated her as a favored cultural emissary, as “the dancer who did not defect”. Although she toured extensively during the years that other dancers defected, including Rudolph Nureyev, Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Plisetskaya always returned to Russia.\n\nPlisetskaya explains that for her generation, and her family in particular, defecting was a moral issue. She had once asked her mother why their family didn't leave the Soviet Union when they had the chance, at the time living in Norway. Her mother said “Misha would never have been a traitor”.\n\nPlisetskaya married composer Rodion Shchedrin in 1958. They lived in Munich, Germany. She was close friends with Robert F. Kennedy. Plisetskaya was a naturalized citizen of Lithuania and Spain.\n\nPlisetskaya died in Munich, Germany on 2 May 2015 from a heart attack, aged 89.\n\nPlisetskaya was given many awards by the Soviet Union, and by Russia.
