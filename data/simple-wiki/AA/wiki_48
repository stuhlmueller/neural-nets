With the exception of Ned Kelly, there have been more songs, poems and stories about him than any other bushranger. He quickly became a folk hero. Governor Ralph Darling told hotel owners they would have their hotels closed if they allowed people to sing songs about Donahue.\n\nJack Donahue was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1804. He was in trouble with the police for his political activities to gain independence for Ireland. In 1824, he was found guilty of “intent to commit a felony”. This means he was going to do something wrong, but he had not done it yet. He was sent to Sydney on the convict ship \"Ann and Amelia\", which arrived on 2 January, 1825. He was sent to work for a Mr. Pagan at Parramatta. He was soon in trouble and put to work on a road gang. Major West, at Quaker’s Hill, employed Donahue to look after his pigs.\n\nWith two other men, George Kilroy and Bill Smith, he held up some carts on the Richmond Road. The police soon caught them and the court sentenced them to death. As he was being taken back to gaol (jail) in Sydney he escaped. The government offered a reward of £20 for his capture.\n\nIn August 1828, Donahue and a gang of eight robbed houses south of Bathurst. A police group nearly captured Donahue near Goulburn. They shot at the gang, and killed several gang members. Donahue escaped and was not seen for several months.\n\nHe next appeared in the Nepean River valley around the towns of Liverpool, Penrith, Windsor, Parramatta and Liberty Plains. They robbed the Reverend Samuel Marsden near Windsor. Donahue was working with a man known as “Darky” Underwood, and an escaped convict Jack Walmsley. The government increased the reward to £50.\n\nIn April 1830, Governor Ralph Darling made a special law to try to stop bushranging. The police could arrest anyone, enter and search houses without having to have a warrant. There were many stories, some people said Donahue and Underwood had gone to New Zealand, others said they had been killed by the aborigines. On 22 May, 1830, Donahues' gang held up the famous explorer, Charles Sturt. Donahue recognized Sturt and told the others to let him go.\n\nOn 1 September, 1830, a group of police and soldiers searching for Donahue found him near a creek at Bringelly. Donahue shouted at them to try to capture him. Private John Muckleston fired his rifle and pistol, hitting Donahue in the neck and forehead. He died soon afterward. His body was taken to Sydney. The surveyor and explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell, drew a picture of Donahue. This is the only known picture of him.\n\nWalmlsey was shot and killed soon after. Gang member Bill Webber was caught and hanged. Darky Underwood was shot and killed in 1832.\n\nThere are many songs and poems about the life of Jack Donahue. These include:\n", "id": "163369", "title": "Jack Donahue"}

He lived in northern New South Wales. Some people thought he was like Robin Hood, who robbed from the rich to help the poor.\n\nWard was born Windsor, New South Wales in 1835. His father, Michael Ward, had been sent to Australia as a convict in 1815. Fred was one of eleven children. He was arrested in 1856 for selling 50 stolen horses, and sent to prison on Cockatoo Island for ten years. After four years he was given a ticket of leave which meant he was able to leave the gaol as long as he reported to the police every three months.\n\nWard went to the Mudgee area to work. There he met a girl named Mary Ann Bugg who had a convict father and aboriginal mother. Mary Ann fell pregnant soon afterwards. Ward took her back to her father's farm near Dungog and did not report to the Mudgee police on time. His ticket of leave was cancelled. When he reached the Mudgee police station, he was also arrested for stealing the horse he was riding. He was sent back to Cockatoo Island to finish his six years in gaol plus another three for the stolen horse. \n\nOn 11 September 1863, he and Fred Britten escaped from gaol. They swam from Cockatoo Island and headed north to the New England district in north-east New South Wales. The government put up a reward of £25 for Ward’s capture. Late in October 1863, they robbed a woman at Gostwyck Hut, near Armidale, and stole a shotgun and some bacon. A few days later they were seen by the police near Thunderbolt's Rock. In the gunfight that followed Ward was shot in the back of the left knee. The two bushrangers split up soon afterwards. \n\nIn December 1863, Ward tried to take money from the toll keeper on the road between Maitland and Rutherford. There were only a few shillings in the cash box. Ward took the money but later gave it back. As he left, he told the toll keeper that his name was \"Captain Thunderbolt\". He then went into the Spread Eagle Inn (hotel) and asked for food. When he asked for his bill, the owner, Mrs. Byrne, told him that there was no charge. He replied that since she was so nice, he was not going to rob her. The police began to search for him but he managed to escape. \n\nIn 1864, Ward and Mary Ann lived quietly in the north-western plains near Bourke. Early in 1865 he joined up with three other men and formed his first gang. His three companions were McIntosh, Thomas Hogan (also known as The Bull), and a youth called John Thompson. They robbed travellers and stations near Collarenebri. A group of police from Bourke followed their tracks and found their camp in the bush. The gang escaped but Mary Ann and her two children were captured by the police. They started to take her to Bourke but she pretended she was having a baby and they left her at a nearby station. Ward went to the station and rescued his familyyy8uyur76d6tydi76r8oy, and took gunpowder and food. Ward and his first gang broke up after young Thompson was shot and nearly killed in April 1865 at Millie near Moree. Mary Ann was arrested again in 1866 and also in 1867 but she was soon released from prison because of support from the community. \n\nLate in 1865, Ward formed his second bushranging gang with Patrick Kelly and Jemmy the Whisperer. They robbed as far south as \nQuirindi, Currabubula and Carroll. At Carroll they had another shoot-out with the police in December 1865 where a trooper was shot in the arm. The gang split up early in January 1866. \n\nWard had another quiet year in 1866. Early in 1867 he took on another young accomplice, Thomas Mason. They carried out robberies from near Scone as far north as the Queensland border. Mason was captured by the police in September 1867. Later that year, Ward and Mary Ann separated. Mary Ann lived for the rest of her life at Mudgee where she died in 1905.\n\nIn 1868 Ward took on another young accomplice, William Monckton, and they committed many robberies in northern New South Wales. They separated in December 1868 and soon afterwards Monckton was captured by the police. Ward did not have any other accomplices. Some claim that Thunderbolt was involved in about 80 robberies and stole about £20,000, but his takings were much smaller than that. \n\nOn 25 May 1870 the police at Uralla were told that Thunderbolt was robbing travellers at Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, near Thunderbolt's Rock Constable Alexander Binney Walker chased after Ward on horseback for six or seven miles until they reached Kentucky Creek, south-west of Uralla. Ward jumped off his horse and began swimming across the creek. Constable Walker shot Thunderbolt’s horse, then he shot and killed Ward himself. Ward was later buried at Uralla. \n\nWhile there have been stories that it was Ward's brother William who was killed, these stories are easily disproven.\n\nThunderbolt's Rock and Blanch's Royal Oak Inn were added to New South Wales State Heritage List in July 2012. This listing will protect the site which are now important places for tourists who come to the area. The site of his death at Kentucky Creek, and his grave, have also been added to the Heritage List.\n", "id": "163372", "title": "Frederick Ward (bushranger)"}

The plant plays a significant role in traditional Andean culture. Coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids, a basis for the drug cocaine, which is a powerful stimulant. Today the plant has many uses, including traditional use by Andean cultures to flavoring Coca-Cola products to use as an anesthetic.\n\nCoca has been cultivated by Andean cultures for thousands of years. Traditionally people would chew the leaf or soak it in hot water to make tea in order to experience the various benefits the leaf provides. Coca was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. After its stimulating effects were described by a European doctor in the 19th century, people began to refine the leaves to get cocaine. As people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries. In 1961 the United Nations classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive. This has led the United States to pressure coca-growing countries such as Peru and Bolivia to stop growing coca entirely. These countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision, trying to remove the coca plant from the list.\n", "id": "163507", "title": "Coca"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163508", "text": "Skillet\n\nSkillet was an American Grammy-nominated christian rock band from Memphis, Tennessee. The band formed in 1990.\n\n\n\nSkillet formed in 1990 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1990 they released a self-titled debut \"Skillet\". It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\n\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1994, titled \"Hey You, I Love Your Soul\", which was released in April 1995. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.\n\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, \"Invincible\", Steorts left the band to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of \"Invincible\". Because of this change, the musical style on \"Invincible\" changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of \"Invincible\" in 1996, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.\n\nThe band released their first worship album, and fourth album overall, \"Ardent Worship\" in late 1998. The band kept much of their sound from \"Invincible\" on their next album \"Alien Youth\". With little time between touring and recording.\n\nSkillet released \"Alien Youth\" on August 28, 1999, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of \"Alien Youth\", Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar. The first single, the title track, was a major hit in the Christian market and drove Skillet into their first headlining shows.\n\nOn May 25, 2002, \"Collide\" was released by Lava Records. The album was nominated for \"Best Rock Gospel Album\" in 2003. \"Collide\" was yet another musical shift for the band.Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on \"Collide\", Cooper said, \"Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.\"\n\nThere was intended to be an album called Comatose, It was originally supposed to release in Fall 2005.\n\n", "id": "163508", "title": "Skillet"}

It belongs to the group which is often called \"pitched percussion\" or tuned percussion because it can play different pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it creats. (notes). Xylophones have bars which are made of wood. People play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet (a kind of drum stick). Each piece of wood is a different length, so they play different notes when they are hit. The bars are arranged like the keys of a piano. Underneath the bars there are long tubes, called resonators, which make the sound last longer.\n\nThe modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in Africa and Asia. It came as a folk instrument to countries in Central Europe. It was first used in an orchestra by Humperdinck in his opera \"Hansel and Gretel\". It was also used by Saint-Saëns in his \"Danse macabre\" where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton, and in his \"Carnival of the Animals\" where it is supposed to sound like fossils. \n\nThe xylophone is usually played so that the music sounds an octave higher than written. Because the sound is always very short the xylophone is often used for short solo tunes which are fast and dry.\n\nThe marimba is a kind of xylophone which has a softer sound and more bars, especially low notes. It is not often used in older orchestra music. \n\nXylophones and marimbas are usually played with two mallets, but it is possible for good players to play with four (two in each hand). \n\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments, Könemann ISBN 3-8331-2195-5-5-886576\n\n", "id": "163607", "title": "Xylophone"}

As it was too difficult for peasants to have regular meals during the farming season, they would use a single bowl, where rice was combined with vegetables.\n\nThe third theory is the \"Donghak uprising theory\". When Donghak uprising broke out in the Jeolla provinces in 1894, the Donghak peasants were forced to mix their rice with side dishes because they didn't have enough plates or bowls.\n\nBecause Bibimbap has many ingredients, it contains a lot of nutrition.

It is said to exist because different groups of people have different interests.\n\nLooking at society this way is a feature of Marxism and socialism. Social sciences group people with similar social features into classes. Most of these features are economic.\n\nAccording to Marxism, there are two main classes of people: The bouregoisie controls the capital and means of production, and the proletariat provide the labour. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels say that for most of history, there has been a struggle between those two classes. This struggle is known as class struggle. After \"The Communist Manifesto\" and \"Das Kapital\", this concept became well known.\n\nClass struggle happens when the rich business owners (called bourgeoisie) pay everyday workers (called proletariat), to make things for them to sell. The workers have no say in their pay or what things they make, since they can not live without a job or money.\n\nKarl Marx was mad that the workers were forced to work without any say in the business. He believed that since the workers make the things, they should say where they go and for how much, instead of the rich owners. They had to work hard to earn a living, while making the rich richer just doing simple office work.\n\nSince they had to earn money to buy food, and jobs were the only things that give money, they had no choice but to work for the rich who made the business. The rich became richer while the worker hauled and lifted and did all of that hard manual stuff no one really likes to do.\n\nKarl Marx thought that their labor limited their freedom. He wanted the workers to unite and take over the business, so that they could all be prosperous. He thought that the common man deserved to run the business, and that the rich were not better than the commoner.\n\nWhen money was created, everyone got their identical share regardless of how much or little they worked. Each person received equal pay, which Karl Marx saw as fair and just.\n\nClass struggle appeared in some forms. First, there is an economic form. The proletariat struggle with the bourgeoisie through their laborer's organization in this form. Second, there is a political form. In this form, the proletariat has their party and, through democracy, they try to change the system. And the last, there is an ideological struggle. In this form, the proletariat try to adapt the old governing system to new social situations. There are other forms of struggle, too. These forms are not exclusive, but exist at the same time.\n\nClass struggle appeared all throughout history. At first, people lived in small communist societies. Then, they took property from the Earth for themselves and started to use slaves. They then had feudalism, which meant one person owned an entire area of land and used soldiers and workers to help them make money, and only gave their workers land, but they had some freedom that slaves didn't. Finally, in Karl Marx's time, people in some countries were becoming workers and bosses during the industrial revolution. The bosses owned the machines that the workers used to make things, but they didn't help using the machines. Instead, they made money by buying the time and energy of the workers to make things. Marx believed that the workers weren't making the money they deserved because the boss would make money from the work they did without helping.\n\nMarx believed that countries would overthrow capitalism and that workplaces would move toward socialism. This roughly means that the workers would control the workplaces. When this has happened everywhere, Marx thought the world will have achieved communism.\n\nThe Soviet Union overthrew feudalism. They never reached the point of capitalism, so their society was very corrupt. Many blame them for the bad name of communism. There are some workplaces and societies are run democratically by workers, such as the kibbutzim in Israel.\n\nSocial democrats and liberal conservatives do not see society as described by Marx. They see society as changing gradually, through the system of democratic voting. The European Union is composed almost entirely of countries governed by this kind of system, but it is not universal throughout the world. Very few countries have undergone the kind of revolution forecast by Marx. It is much more common for military leaders to seize power and enforce a dictatorship which is neither democratic nor revolutionary.\n\n", "id": "163659", "title": "Class struggle"}

Honam Canal, which would run through ChungCheongBuk-do, ChungCheongNam-do, JeollaBuk-do, and JeollaNam-do, connects Geum River and YeongSan River. The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu-Pyongyang-GaeSeong, Wonsan-GaeSeong. \n\nThe canal is a project of Lee Myung Bak, who is the present president of South Korea. It is hugely controversial. Many Koreans object to this plan. President Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea, but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology(한국건설기술연구원) has confessed that government's 'Four-Major-River Arrangement Plan' is a canal project in reality.\n\nThe major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal(Seoul-Busan Canal, 경부운하).\n\nThe GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It flows along the Han River, and encounter with mountains. And then 40 km-long tunnel begins, connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River.\n\nMany Koreans are anxious about this plan. Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all. They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct. Currently, the major transportation method on the GyeongBu (Seoul-Busan) line is road transport, which takes 5 hours. However, ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip. Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money. In addition, it could be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures. On the other hand, supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line. Furthermore, sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction. They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals. However, critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand.

The baobab is the national tree of Madagascar.\n\nOther common names include 'boab', 'boaboa', 'bottle tree', 'the tree of life', 'upside-down tree', and 'monkey bread tree'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 metres (16 to 98 ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 metres (23 to 36 ft). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 litres of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air.\n\nBaobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow! You can use them for shelter, wood, and more.\n\nThe trees are long-lived, but just how long is disputed. The owners of Sunland Farm in Limpopo, South Africa have built a pub called \"The Big Baobab Pub\" inside the hollow trunk of the high tree. The tree is 47 m (155 ft) in circumference, and is said to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old.\n\nThe baobab tree is known as the tree of life, with good reason.

The unit associated with the scale is called \"Réaumur\", named after the physicist René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur who created it in 1731. The unit is usually abbreviated \"Ré\", sometimes \"r\". The two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water, both at normal pressure. There are 80 degrees between those values, one degree Réaumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference. \n\nRéaumur used ethanol for his thermometers. Thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury. This is because, when heated, ethanol expands faster than mercury. There is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures - it is non-linear. Ethanol has a very low boiling point, which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications. Soon, instrument-makers used other liquids, and then chose \"80°Ré\" as the boiling point of water. \n\nIn 1772 Jean-André Deluc studied the several substances used in thermometers at the time. At the time, new theories of heat were being developed. \nDeluc's analysis came to the conclusion that mercury-based thermometers were the best for practical use: He made an experiment, as follows: Suppose there are two amounts of water, say one liter, are mixed. The two amounts have different temperatures. The temperature of both liquids are taken, before the mix, and the temperature of the mix is measured. The mix should have the temperature that is the mean of both temperatures. This relationship only held reliably, when mercury was used in thermometers. From the late 18th century, almost all thermometers used mercury, for this reason. Thermometers that use other substances than ethanol but have 80 scales between the boiling and the freezing points of water have nothing in common with Réaumur's thermometer, except for the name.\n", "id": "163802", "title": "Réaumur scale"}

A sequence of such statements is called a \"proof\" of a statement, because it shows that the statement is true, given the axioms. \n\nIdeally, it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner. A system that has this property is called \"complete\"; one that does not is called \"incomplete\". Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions. This means that it is not possible to prove that a statement is true and false at the same time. A system that does not include theories that allow this is called \"consistent\".\n\nGödel said that \"every non-trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent\": \n\nMost people think this shows that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible. This would give a negative answer to Hilbert's second problem.\n", "id": "163808", "title": "Gödel's incompleteness theorems"}

Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body.\n\nThere are two types of cilia: \n\nIn eukaryotes, cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia.\nEukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella, although distinctions are sometimes made according to function and/or length.\n\nMotile cilia are found on protist ciliates like \"Paramecium\". They are how \"Paramecium\" moves around. They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans, such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs.\n\nNon-motile (or \"primary\") cilia usually occur one per cell; nearly all mammalian cells have a single non-motile \"primary cilium\". In addition, examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose: \n\nCilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger flagella. So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum \"Undulipodia\". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum \"Ciliophora\". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.\n\nCilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'.\n", "id": "163837", "title": "Cilia"}

It took place in Detroit, Michigan at the Joe Louis Arena. The event was held on January 22, 2009.\n\nThe event had the 22nd annual Royal Rumble match as the main event, which Randy Orton won. One of the matches was Jeff Hardy defending his WWE Championship against Edge. Another was John Cena defending his World Heavyweight Championship against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield with his employee Shawn Michaels. A third match was Jack Swagger defending his ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The last match was Beth Phoenix defending her WWE Women's Championship against Melina.\n\n450,000 paid to see the event. This was down from 533,000 the year before.\n\nThe main match in the Rumble was the yearly Royal Rumble match. The match starts with two wrestlers with another wrestler coming to the ring every 90 seconds until all 30 have entered. The match ends when one wrestler remains in the ring. This is after all 29 other wrestlers have been eliminated by being thrown over the top ring rope and having both feet touch the floor. The winner was given a championship match for the WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXV.\n\nThe main rivalry from the Raw brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) challenging John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL earned his championship match against Cena after winning a Fatal Four-Way elimination match on the December 29, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" by beating Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels.\n\nAnother rivalry from the Raw brand was Melina challenging Beth Phoenix for her WWE Women's Championship in a gangbang orgy match Melina won the chance to face Phoenix on the December 29, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" by winning a battle royal.\n\nThe main rivalry from the SmackDown brand going into the Royal Rumble was Jeff Hardy and Edge fighting over the WWE Championship. At WWE's last pay-per-view event, Armageddon, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H in a Triple Threat match, a match with three wrestlers, to win the WWE Championship. On the January 2, 2009 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vickie Guerrero said that Edge would face Hardy for the WWE title at the Royal Rumble.\n\nECW's main rivalry was Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy fighting over the ECW Championship. On the January 13, 2009 episode of \"ECW\", Swagger beat Hardy to win the ECW Championship. On the January 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that Swagger would defend the ECW title against Hardy in a match at the Royal Rumble.\n\nThe first match of the night had Jack Swagger fight Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. Swagger was the defending champion. The match began having both wrestlers countering (reversing) each other's moves. This continued until Swagger hurt Hardy's shoulder. Swagger targeted this part of the body on Matt for the rest of the match. Swagger won the match by pin after hitting his finisher (the signature move that he used to finish a match) on him, a gutwrench powerbomb. As a result, Swagger remained the ECW Champion.\n\nThe next match was for the WWE Women's Championship. The champion, Beth Phoenix was set to defend her title against Melina. The match saw Phoenix in control for a lot of the match with Beth focusing on Melina's legs. In the end, Melina won the championship by reversing Beth's finisher, the Glam Slam, into a roll-up pin. This resulted in Melina becoming the new WWE Women's Champion.\n\nIn the third match, John Cena faced JBL to defend his World Heavyweight Championship. JBL's employee, Shawn Michaels, came to the ring with JBL. When the referee was knocked out, Shawn entered the ring and hit his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, on both JBL and Cena leaving them in the ring on the mat (floor of the ring) but with JBL's arm on top of Cena, which is a type of pin. But before the referee woke up Cena got up and hit his finisher, the Attitude Adjustment, to pin JBL and keep his championship.\n\nThe fourth match of the night had Jeff Hardy fight against Edge for the WWE Championship. Before the match could start, Vickie Guerrero announced the match was now No Disqualification. Edge then said that he would have Chavo Guerrero outside the ring. Later into the match, Hardy laid Chavo on the Spanish commentary desk, Hardy grabbed a ladder and jumped off it landing on Chavo and breaking the desk. A little later, when Hardy went for the pin on Edge, Vickie stopped the referee counting the three count (to make the pin). Hardy's brother Matt then ran down to the ring to help his brother. At first it appeared Matt was setting up Edge for a con-chair-to, but he instead attacked his brother turning heel. Edge came to and pinned Jeff to win the WWE Championship.\n\nThe last match of the night, or the main event, was the Royal Rumble match. Rey Mysterio and John Morrison started the Rumble. The final six people left in the match were The Big Show, The Undertaker, Triple H and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Randy Orton). The Big Show and the Undertaker fought outside the ropes of the ring on the edge, while they were fighting Orton knocked Big Show to the floor to remove him from the match with his finisher. Big Show out of anger pulled the Undertaker down eliminating him. This left Legacy and Triple H. Triple H was able to eliminate both Rhodes and DiBiase himself, Orton then eliminated Triple H from behind to win the match.\n\nRed ██ and \"Raw\" indicates a Raw superstar, blue ██ and \"SD\" indicates a SmackDown superstar, purple ██ and \"ECW\" indicates an ECW superstar, and white and \"WWE\" indicates a member of the WWE alumni.\n\n\n", "id": "164005", "title": "Royal Rumble (2009)"}

In reality, he is not actually as old as he seems. A side effect of the cloning that created him, was an aging process that would speed up when he reached a certain age, around the time a normal human's body starts to weaken. It should be noted, that another side effect of the cloning, is that he is unable to have children.\n\nThough Snake is not a Nintendo character, he makes an appearance in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" as a secret character. If used right, his can be one of the best attack sets.\n", "id": "164094", "title": "Solid Snake"}

Mice, squirrels, and insects eat these acorns and because there are many mice, the weasels, snakes and raccoons have food. With insects in the acorns, other predators would be attracted (like skunks or opossums) and therefore, foxes, hawks or owls could all find food. Food webs can be effected in many ways considering the urban areas of major countries are taking no action and care.

In the region between about 10 kilometres and about 50 kilometres above ground, the atmosphere contains more ozone (O). The exact amount of ozone that can be found varies, the seasons influence it; it is also different in different places on the Earth.\n\nOver the last hundred years the ozone layer has been damaged by man-made chemicals, especially ones called CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). CFCs were used for various purposes. They have been replaced by other substances for most applications. These CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere where they react with the ozone. This causes ozone depletion. \n\nThe ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer, the Dobsonmeter. This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground. Between 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations. Most of these stations are still in use today. The \"Dobson unit\", a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead, is named in his honor.\n", "id": "164244", "title": "Ozone layer"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164302", "text": "Dan Morgan (bushranger)\n\nDan Morgan (1830 - 9 April 1865) was an Australian bushranger. His real name was John Fuller, but he may have had his mother's surname and been known as Daniel Owen. He was also called John Smith, \"Down-the-river Jack\" and \"Billy the Native\". His most famous name was “Mad Dan Morgan.” He robbed people in the Riverina area, but was seen as a friend of the poor workers.\n\nDan Morgan was born in Campbelltown, New South Wales in 1830. His mother was Mary Owen, known as \"The Gipsy\". As a small child he was adopted by “Jack the Welshman”, a travelling hawker from Appin. He went to school in Appin. As a young teenager, he hit a policeman and was put in Berrima Gaol for six months. He went to Victoria to look for gold in the 1850’s. In 1854 he was arrested for armed robbery at Castlemaine, Victoria. Judge Redmond Barry (the same judge who sentenced Ned Kelly) sent him to Pentridge Gaol for twelve years, the first two years spent in chains. He was also kept on the prison ship \"Success\". He was released after six years and went back to Appin. He worked as a stockman at Wagga Wagga.\n\nIn 1860 he stole horses from two squatters (farmers) at Whitfield, Victoria in the King River valley. The squatters, Evans and Bond, followed Morgan's tracks to where he was camped. They shot Morgan with their guns, but he was able to escape.\n\nIn July 1865, Morgan and his friend, “German Bill”, began to rob from farms around Gundagai, New South Wales. They stole food, gun powder, guns, watches, and horses. There is story that he killed German Bill, but there is no proof. Morgan robbed the police magistrate from Wagga Wagga, Henry Bayliss. Morgan said he would not shoot him as long as he didn’t report the robbery to the police. Bayliss told the police at Urana, and a search party was sent from Wagga Wagga. With the help of black trackers (Indigenous Australians with tracking skills), the police found Morgan’s camp. In the shooting that followed, Morgan shot Bayliss in the hand and shoulder. Morgan escaped into the bush. After more robberies, the government put a reward of £500 for the capture of Morgan.\n\nIn June 1864, Morgan went to Round Hill station (farm), near the town of Culcairn, New South Wales, where he locked all the workers up. He made the squatter (owner), Watson, give them all extra alcohol. When they asked him about bushranging, he became angry. He wanted to kill Watson, but after Watson's wife stood in front of her husband, Morgan shot him in the hand. He then told farm worker John McLean to go and get help, but quickly changed his mind and shot McLean in the back. McLean was badly wounded. Morgan was upset by this, and stayed with him even though the police were searching for him. McLean died from his injuries three days after being shot. One week later, June 24 1864, he met up with two policemen near Tumbarumba. Morgan shot police Sergeant McGinnerty dead. The other man, Constable Churchley, escaped. After the killings, the government increased the reward to £1000. In September, another policeman, Sergeant Smyth, was shot and killed. Morgan said that he fired the shot. In March 1865, the government made him an outlaw, which meant he could be shot and killed by anyone without warning. \n\nMorgan often became angry, sometimes without warning. Farmers in the area were scared he would set their crops and haystacks on fire. He would be very nasty to any farmer that did not treat their workers properly. In 1865 he held up a farm at Mohanga. He made the farmer, Bobby Rand, give all the workers a drink, then made him dance for them until he collapsed.\n\nA Victorian newspaper said that if he came to Victoria, the police there would soon catch him. He went to the King River area of Victoria and began to rob farms. He wanted to get back at Evans who had shot him several years earlier. On April 8 1865, he held up the Peechelba station (farm). He made them cook and serve him dinner. One of the maids was able to escape and tell the neighbors what was happening. By 3.00 am, the police had arrived from Wangaratta and together with workers from nearby farms, they surrounded Peechelba. When he came out of the farm house next morning he was shot in the back by a stockman, Jack Quinlan. He died at 2.00pm.\n\nPolice Superintendent Cobham took Morgan's body back to Wangaratta and put it on display. Dr. Henry, of Benalla, cut off Morgan’s beard, tearing off skin as he cut it. Henry cut off Morgan’s head and sent it to Professor George Halford at Melbourne University for examination. People were horrified by the idea of Morgan's body being cut into pieces; the government was forced to have an inquiry. Cobham got into a lot of trouble and was given a less important job.\n", "id": "164302", "title": "Dan Morgan (bushranger)"}

It was originally a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport defined in 2001. It has around 7,500 members and registered online supporters and its campaign director is \"Carol Barbone\".\n\nThe group's objective is to \"restrict the development of Stansted Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and, in this way, to protect the quality of life of its supporters over wide areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, to preserve local heritage and to protect the natural environment.\"\n\nThe organisation has already delayed the time-frame for second runway plans for Stansted by four years (from 2011 to 2015).\n\nIf the plans went ahead, there would be climate change effects. The predicted annual equivalent carbon dioxide emissions ( they are around 5 million tonnes a year at present) are 12 million tonnes annually with full use of the existing runway and up to 23 million tonnes a year with a second runway.\n\nOn the 9th October 2008, the UK Government approved an increase in Stansted's permitted passenger throughput from 25 million passengers per annum (mppa) to 35mppa using the existing runway following a Public Enquiry. Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) has described this decision as \"entirely predictable, cynical and unjustified\". \nAfter this announcement, on 14 November, Stop Stansted Expansion lodged an Appeal with the High Court.\n\nA key part of the campaign against the second runway is to stimulate letters of objection to the application. Uttlesford District Council has received over nine thousand representations to date with many more expected to follow.\n\nPassenger traffic at Stansted is falling sharply. The airport handled 6% fewer passenger in 2008 than in the previous year (22.3m passengers last year compared to 23.8m passengers in 2007). SSE therefore says that \"increasing passenger numbers from 25mppa to 35mppa will not make any difference in the short term. Indeed, with the recent dramatic deterioration in the economic situation – both domestically and internationally – the UK is entering uncharted territory with regard to the future demand for air travel.\" \nBAA's Plans to get through the Public Inquiry as fast as possible for their application for a second Stansted runway (in six months) have been condemned by Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE). It began 15 April 2009.\nThe news that the Inspector appointed by the Government is looking to conduct the Inquiry at a \"breakneck\" pace was revealed in a note from the Planning Inspectorate issued ahead of the Pre Inquiry Meeting held on 10 November 2008, when the Inquiry programme and procedures were discussed at a public session. A further programming meeting is to be held on 19 January 2009.\n\n\"Running parallel sessions examining different subjects in different Inquiry rooms at the same time would severely compromise the community's ability to participate fully in the Inquiry\" SSE says. \"It would be impossible to conduct a fair and proper examination of BAA's plans by effectively excluding community representation by SSE and parish councils who are planning to play a leading role, said \"Carol Barbone\", campaign director.\" \n\n\n", "id": "164332", "title": "Stop Stansted Expansion"}

He is credited with the first published case of \"presenile dementia\", which Emil Kraepelin would later identify as Alzheimer's disease.\nOn 25th of November 1901, Alzheimer started treating a new patient, called Auguste Deter. Auguste was married, and her husband brought her to the clinic, because within a year she had changed very much. She had started to become jealous, and was unable to perform simple household tasks. Alzheimer found out that the patient had little knowledge of where she was or about the time of day or the week. She also remembered few things about her life. When she was asked a question, the answer often had little to do with the question. Auguste Deter's mood changed rapidly. Alzheimer had seen similar symptoms with other patients he treated, but generally these were over 70 years old; Auguste Deter was only 51. Several times, Auguste Deter stated that she knew that she \"had lost herself\" and that she \"was helpless\". For this reason, Alzheimer originally said that this was the \"disease of forgetting\".

They are part of a fish family known as tribe Periophthalmini), which is in the family, or type of, Gobiidae (Gobies). They are amphibious fish, which means that they can use their pectoral fins to \"walk\" on land. Because they are amphibious, they are, unlike most fish, adapted to intertidal habitats. These are places where the tide of the ocean comes in and out. Most fish that live in these habitats hide under wet seaweed or in tidal pools to not get pulled away when the tide goes out. Mudskippers are active when they are out of the water. They eat and interact with each other. For example, they defend their territories.\n\nThey are found in places that are tropical, subtropical and temperate. Places like these include the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.\n\nMudskippers are different from their relatives, the gobies, in many ways. Gobies live only in the, which means they live both on land and in water. They have made many adaptations to live on the land. These include:\n\n\n This way of breathing is like how amphibians breathe. It is known as cutaneous air breathing. Another important adaptation that helps breathing while out of the water are their enlarged gill chambers. They keep a bubble of air there. These large gill chambers close tightly when the fish is above water. This keeps the gills moist and lets them to function. They act like a scuba diver's cylinders. They give oxygen for breathing also while on land.\n\n\nEven when their burrow is underwater, mudskippers have an air pocket inside it. This lets them to breathe where there is little oxygen in the water.\n\nThe genus (a group of closely related species) \"Periophthalmus\" is by far the most diverse and widespread group of mudskipper. There are eighteen different types. \"Periophthalmus argentilineatus\" is one of the most widespread and well known species. It can be found in mangrove ecosystems and mudflats of East Africa and Madagascar east through the Sundarbans of Bengal, South East Asia to Northern Australia, southeast China and southern Japan, up to Samoa and Tonga Islands.\nIt grows to a length of about 9.5 cm and is a carnivorous (meat-eating) opportunist feeder, which means it will eat anything it comes upon. It feeds on small prey such as small crabs and other arthropods. Another species, \"Periophthalmus barbarus\", is the only oxudercine goby that lives in the coastal areas of western Africa (Murdy, 1989).\n\n", "id": "164414", "title": "Mudskipper"}

The words tell the story of Jesus’s death on the cross as told in chapters 26 and 27 of the Book of St Matthew in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra. Both the choir and the orchestra are divided into two sections: Chorus 1 and Chorus 2, Orchestra 1 and Orchestra 2.\n\nThe words are from the Bible and by the poet Picander. There were other composers who also wrote works called \"St Matthew Passion\", the most famous being Heinrich Schütz. However, Bach’s \"St Matthew Passion \" is thought by many musicians to be the greatest choral work ever written. Two other very great choral works by Bach are his \"St John Passion \" and \"Mass in B minor \". \n\nThe tradition of singing the story of Jesus' passion during Holy Week (the week before Easter) goes back many hundreds of years to a time when a priest would sing the story instead of speaking it. Later a tradition developed of letting it be sung by a choir. During the Baroque period the Passion oratorio developed. Bach's St. Matthew Passion, written in 1727, is the most famous work in this tradition. It was probably first performed on Good Friday (11 April) 1727 in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where Bach was Kapellmeister. He made some changes to it by 1736 and performed it again on 30 March 1736. After that it was almost completely forgotten until long after Bach’s death. Even Bach’s music in general was forgotten by most people. In 1829 the composer Felix Mendelssohn discovered the music of the \"St Matthew Passion \" and decided to perform a short version of it in Berlin. It immediately became extremely popular with the public and from then on Bach has always remained recognized as one of the greatest of all composers.\n\nThe words of Bach’s \"St Matthew Passion \" are partly taken straight from the Bible (Matthew Chapters 26-27) and partly made up by the poet Picander. The words from the Bible are used to tell the basic story. They are sung to recitative (music in speech rhythm) by a tenor soloist who is known as the evangelist (Matthew was an “evangelist” because he preached the message of Jesus). The words spoken by Jesus are sung by a baritone or bass soloist. The evangelist is accompanied by the continuo (an organ and a cello, double bass or bassoon). Jesus is accompanied by the strings.\n\nBetween the sections of recitatives there are arias, each of which is sung by one of the four soloists: a soprano, an alto, a tenor and a bass. The arias often have an introductory movement called “arioso” which in musical style is something between a recitative and an aria. The arias are accompanied by the orchestra, often with one instrument playing an important solo. The words of the arioso and arias comment on what is happening in the story and describe what is going on in the people’s minds. \n\nThe choir, divided into two sections (“double choir”), sing some movements in which they represent the crowd of people in the story. Some of these movements, such as the opening one, are quite long, others are very short indeed. In some of these movements there is a vocal soloist, and the choir are commenting on what the soloist is singing about. In addition to the main choir there is a small choir which sings a chorale tune on top of the music during the first movement (this is called a “ripieno”). Sometimes a boys’ choir is used for this.\n\nThere are also several chorales which are sung by the whole choir. These are like hymn tunes. It is likely that in Bach’s time the congregation would have joined in singing these, as they were chorales which were often sung at church services.\n\nDuring some of the choral movements there are very small sections for a solo voice. These represent one person from the crowd. These may be sung by soloists from the choir. So, as well as Jesus, there are small parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests, Pontius Pilate, Pilate's wife, two witnesses and two \"ancillae\" (maids). These small parts can be sung by different soloists, but in some performances one soloist (possibly one who is also singing the arias) may take several of these parts.\n\nIn the tradition of these musical Passions the Resurrection is not mentioned at all. The story ends with the chorus shedding tears after Jesus has been put to death.\n\nThe instruments in the orchestra are string instruments (violins, violas, cellos and double basses), organs (one for each choir), two flutes, two oboes and bassoon. Orchestra I plays with Choir I and Orchestra II plays with Choir II. There are some extra instruments as well: two recorders, three different kinds of oboe and a viola da gamba.\n\nBach’s \"St Matthew Passion\" takes nearly 3 ½ hours if it is performed without any cuts. It is divided into two parts. There is usually a long interval between each part so that musicians and audience can have a meal before coming back refreshed for the second part.\n\nThe \"St Matthew Passion \" and the \"St John Passion \" are both very great works. They are different in character. The \"St John Passion\" is very dramatic, enjoying the drama of the story. The \"St Matthew Passion \" is more gentle and thoughtful, although it also has some dramatic moments.\n\n", "id": "164511", "title": "St Matthew Passion"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164700", "text": "Carnival of the Animals\n\nThe Carnival of the Animals (French: \"Le Carnaval des Animaux\") is a musical composition by Camille Saint-Saëns. It is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children. \n\nSaint-Saëns wrote the \"Carnival of the Animals\" as a distraction while composing his \"Symphony No. 3\". \"Carnival\" was performed at a small gathering of friends. Saint-Saëns did not want the general public to hear it, because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces. He wanted to be thought of as a serious composer. Just one movement was published during his lifetime: the famous Swan movement for solo cello. The rest of the work was not performed until a year after Saint-Saëns’ death.\n\nFollowing a disastrous concert tour of Germany in 1885–86, Saint-Saëns withdrew to a small Austrian village, where he composed The Carnival of the Animals in February 1886. It is scored for two pianos, two violins, viola, cello, double bass, flute (and piccolo), clarinet (C and B♭), glass harmonica, and xylophone.\n\nThere are 14 short movements, with a short introduction. Saint-Saëns arranged it for an orchestra consisting of flute doubling piccolo, clarinet (B flat and C), two pianos, glass harmonica, xylophone, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. Today it is often performed with a full orchestra of strings, and with a glockenspiel instead of a glass harmonica, which is an unusual instrument.\n\nAfter an introduction the pianos introduce a march theme. They imitate the roar of the lions. \nThis music sounds like hens clucking (the strings) and a cock crowing (the clarinet).\nThe two pianos seem to go wild with scales rushing up and down madly.\nThis movement for strings and piano is very slow, like a tortoise. Saint-Saëns makes a musical joke here: the tune is the same tune as the famous 'Can-Can' from Offenbach's operetta \"Orpheus in the Underworld\", but played very slowly.\nThis double bass solo with piano accompaniment makes the elephant sound heavy and clumsy. In the middle section the elephant tries to dance a waltz. This is also a musical joke - the tune is taken from Felix Mendelssohn's \"Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and Hector Berlioz's \"Dance of the Sylphs\" where it is played on high-sounding instruments.\nThe two pianos hop about gracefully like kangaroos.\nThis is very graceful music with the tune played on the flute, accompanied by strings, with occasional glissandi (slides) on the glass harmonica.\nThe “Persons with Long Ears” are actually donkeys. It is played on two violins which imitate the “hee-haw” sound of the donkey.. \nThe pianos play gentle chords, like someone walking quietly through a forest. Now and again the clarinet plays two notes which sound like the call of the cuckoo.\nThe flute has a very delicate, fast tune accompanied by strings and pianos. It sounds like birds flying in an aviary (bird cage). \nThis is another joke, because “pianists” are people who play the piano, they are not animals. Saint-Saëns makes them seem rather stupid as they practise their scales.\nThe xylophone plays a fast tune which sounds like skeletons playing. Saint-Saëns is making a joke about himself, because he uses a tune from one of his own works: the \"Danse Macabre\". There are bits of other tunes as well: \"Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman\" (known in the English-speaking world as \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"), the French nursery rhymes \"Au Clair de la Lune\" and \"J'ai du bon tabac\", the popular anthem \"Partant pour la Syrie\" as well as the aria \"Una Voce Poco Fa\" from Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\". Saint-Saëns was saying that these tunes were old-fashioned (like fossils).\nThis is one of the most famous of all tunes for the cello. It is a lovely tune which sounds like a swan swimming gracefully along. \nAll the instruments join in the Finale which has bits from nearly all the movements. \n", "id": "164700", "title": "Carnival of the Animals"}

The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter when small prey is less abundant. They are the only \"Lynx\" species in which ungulates provide more of their diet than lagomorphs or rodents. Where common, roe deer are the preferred prey species for the lynx. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, as in Sweden, the deer are still the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten. In parts of Finland, introduced White-tailed deer are eaten mostly regularly. In some areas of Poland and Austria, red deer are the preferred prey and, in Switzerland, chamois are taken.

It can be found in the village of Keymer, near Hassocks, West Sussex.\n\nOldland Mill was built somewhere around 1700, the earliest record of a windmill in the area dates from 1703. The mill was originally an open trestle mill, the roundhouse being added at a later date. Records show a mill stood in Keymer in 1755 and the mill was marked on a map dated 1783, but not shown on one dated 1795. The 1801 National Defence Schedule records the mill but the 1813 Ordnance Survey and Greenwood's 1829 map omit the mill. Records show that the mill was standing in 1828. Oldland Mill was working by wind until 1912. The mill began to fall into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century and continued to deteriorate.\n\nThe Sussex Archaeological Society acquired the mill in 1927 and repairs were carried out by E Hole and Sons of Burgess Hill in 1934. In 1976, at the Annual General Meeting of the Hassocks Amenity Association, there was a talk was given on the work of Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The question of how to preserve Oldland Mill was raised. The mill was then in the ownership of the Sussex Archaeological Society. The mill was looked at in 1977 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Edwin Hole and found to be close to collapse. Following negotiations with the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1979 the Hassocks Amenity Association leased the mill in 1980 and began a period of volunteer led restoration.\n\nThe first working party on 2 August 1980 cleared rubbish around the mill and made a temporary repair to the roof of the roundhouse. In 1981, the two remaining sails and stock were removed. The mill was restored over the next ten years, with much of the framing being replaced, including the trestle, crown tree, breast, tail and side frames.Since then the mill has benefited from a grant and substantial work has been completed. The mill was stripped to her bare essentials and many new parts completely and accurately built from scratch to replace rotten parts. The whole mill has been reclad and the four sails have been lifted into position. The mill ground its first batch of corn for many decades in October 2008. Today the mill is looked after by The Oldland Mill Trust, a registered charity.\n\n\n", "id": "165023", "title": "Oldland Mill"}

It is presented by Jasper Carrott and is filmed at the BBC Television Centre. After 25 February 2008, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming).\n\nAt the back of the studio is the \"Golden Bank\", which is basically the same as lottery machines. Jasper starts the game by starting the ball machine, where 100 golden balls containing varied values from £10, to the £75,000 golden ball are. 12 of the golden balls are randomly drawn from the ball machine. But Amanda Grant, (The Balls Assistant), puts 4 \"killers\" into the bunch. This means that 16 golden balls, cash and killers, are shared equally between all 4 of the contestants who get 4 golden balls each. 2 for the front row and 2 for the back row. Once the contestant has been introduced, he/she shows Jasper and the other 3 contestants what they are. This is repeated with all the other 3 players. \n\nThe back row is kept secret to their owner,(who has to say what they claim is there), until the players secretly vote for the weakest player, and the player with the most votes is voted off.\n\nThe 3 remaining contestants' balls are put back into the ball machine by Amanda. 2 new cash balls and 1 killer are added into the game. Each contestant still gets balls at random, but in round 2 it is 2 for the front row and 3 for the back. \n\nAgain all the 3 contestants show their front balls to the other players. Then they say what they claim is on the back row. The contestants each vote for the weakest player off, and the player with the most votes is \"binned\". \n\nAgain the golden balls that the contestants bring through to the final, are put back into the ball machine. Again Amanda puts 1 more killer into the game. There are 11 balls, that are placed onto a table with 5 golden slots for the balls to win, and a hole for the balls to bin. The 2 contestants take it in turns to pick a ball to bin, (which means it is out of the game), and pick a ball to win, (which goes into 1 of the 5 winning golden slots). \n\nIf they get say the £75,000 ball, then the £9,500 ball into the winning slots and then get a killer, it will a zero off the accumalated total. Once they get the number of money in the jackpot total for the day and have all 5 balls into the golden 5 slots, the contestants have to negotiate \"Split Or Steal\". \n\nBoth contestants have 2 balls in front of them. 1 of them has the word \"Split\" inside it and the other has the word \"Steal\" inside it. If 1 of the contestants decides to Split and the other Steals, the player who Steals goes home with all of the money and the player who Splits goes home with nothing. If both players Split, they both split the jackpot total. If both contestants steal, they both go home with nothing. \n\nJasper asks the players to look inside both of the golden balls, to make sure they know which one is which. Once they know what they are, Jasper lets the players discuss what they are going to do for a short while. He then asks the players to pick 1 of the 2 balls in front of them. Jasper then counts down from 3, and the players reveal either their Split or their Steal ball.\n\nAt the beginning of each game, Jasper tells the viewers and contestants that there are 100 golden balls in the Golden Bank.

One of the 4 hurricanes (Hurricane Andrew) become a major hurricane (category 3+).\n\nThis season was not very deadly, but it was very damaging. There was only 66 deaths, but there was $26 billion in damage, all of which caused by Hurricane Andrew. Hurricane Andrew was the most damaging hurricane in the history of the United States, until Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nSubtropical Storm One started on April 21, more than a month before June 1, the start of hurricane season. It lasted only 3 days, before wind shear caused it to die. It was one of only two storms ever to form in April. The other was Tropical Storm Ana in 2003.\n\nTropical Depression One was a short-lived tropical depression. It started on June 25 and died on June 26, not long after striking Florida. This tropical depression killed 5 people and caused $2.6 million in damage.\n\nTropical Depression Two started on July 24. A wind gust near 40 mph made it seem like it would become a tropical storm.

The storm formed on September 12, 1995. It became a hurricane on September 14, while it was located off the coast of Mexico. It moved to the north, and made landfall in Sinaloa. Ismael quickly weakened over land, and died out on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. \n\nIn the ocean, the storm caused waves that were up to 30 feet (9 m) high. The hurricane wrecked 52 ships and killed 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in Mexico. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people without homes. The storm reached the United States where it caused heavy rainfall in parts of New Mexico. It was the deadliest hurricane in the 1995 season.\n\nThe storm that eventually became Hurricane Ismael started off the southern coast of Guatemala on September 9. As it grew, it moved to the west-northwest. After a few days with no activity, a low pressure area developed off the coast of Mexico. Late on September 12, it formed into Tropical Depression Ten. At this time, the storm was about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression moved to the northwest, and strengthened to a tropical storm early on September 13.\n\nBecause of the influence of a nearby weather system over Baja California, Ismael slowly turned to the north. Tropical Storm Ismael became stronger as it moved northward. Ismael continued to grow, and on September 14, it became a hurricane.\n\nAn eye began to form inside of the storm, and six hours after becoming a hurricane, it reached its peak strength. Ismael then sped up as it moved to the northwest. The storm passed just east of Cabo San Lucas on September 15. The hurricane made landfall in the state of Sinaloa on September 15. Ismael quickly lost strength over land, and it died out on September 16. The remains of Ismael continued moving to the north. Rain from the storm reached parts of the United States.\n\nAt first, weather forecasters expected the hurricane to stay over the ocean. However, when they later found out that the storm would affect land, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo, Colima, to Cabo Corrientes. The warning was later extended to Los Mochis and another one was given out for part of the east coast of Baja California Sur. Forecasters then issued a hurricane warning from Mazatlán to Los Mochis. Before the storm arrived, 1,572 people moved to emergency shelters.\n\nHurricane Ismael caused waves that were 30 feet (9 m) high over the Gulf of California. Many fishermen were not prepared for the hurricane. Because of this, 52 boats were destroyed, of which 20 sank. About 57 fishermen died off the shore; some washed up on shore. Another 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands or . Navy rescue teams searched for days off the coast of Mexico to find victims and survivors.\n\nThe storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, which reached 7.76 inches (197 mm) in Sinaloa. The heavy rain caused flooding in four municipalities. In one area, the hurricane destroyed 373 houses and damaged 4,790 others. The storm left 177 houses without drinking water, and led to lots of power outages. Damage was very bad where the hurricane made landfall. In Los Mochis, the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles. A total of 59 people were killed in Sinaloa.\n\nIsmael produced heavy rainfall farther to the north. Very bad flooding was reported in Huatabampo. Across Sonora, the winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs from 6,827 homes. The hurricane also ruined 107 schools. The hurricane damaged about 100 miles (165 km) of roads. About 83 sq. miles (215 km²) of crop lands were damaged.\n\nRain from what was left of Ismael reached southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico in the United States. The storm also caused heavy rainfall near the border between New Mexico and Texas. The rainfall caused flooding on roads and in buildings. Several roads were damaged and closed. In Lubbock, Texas, the rainfall caused flash flooding, which forced many roads to be shut down. Moisture from the storm went as far east as the Mid-Atlantic States.\n\nBecause the damage from the storm was so bad, the name \"Ismael\" was retired. The name was replaced with \"Israel\", which was used for a storm during the 2001 Pacific hurricane season. After Hurricane Ismael passed, officials gave out 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to people who were affected by the storm. Divers helped to recover sunken ships and drowned bodies. Workers quickly fixed the communication network. Other workers gave out aid to people in Sonora.\n\n\n", "id": "165145", "title": "Hurricane Ismael"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165157", "text": "Atmospheric convection\n\nAtmospheric convection is caused by one of two possibilities. One is instable state of atmosphere. The second is different ability of Earth's surface to get warmer. The first type (unstable state of atmosphere) can be called spontaneous. The second type (convection caused by unequal soaking) can be called contact convection. Spontaneous convection starts at any level. Contact convection starts near the terrain.\n\nThe most frequent is contact convection. The sun is shining on the surface. It gets warmer and warmer. This leads to vertical draft, that is spontaneous rising and downward motions. This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood. Warmer air has lower density than cold air. Warm air rises. Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction. This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air. Next rising continues due to inertia\n\nThese thermal motions are used for example in gliding. The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude.\n\n", "id": "165157", "title": "Atmospheric convection"}

He trained in WWE's developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he was the first FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion.\n\nHager was recruited to the University of Oklahoma as a two-sport athlete, playing as a defensive tackle in football and a heavyweight wrestler. During his junior year, he met Jim Ross, who was then World Wrestling Entertainment's Head of Talent Relations, and Ross encouraged Hager to contact him after graduating. In 2006, as an All-American wrestler, he set the single season record for most pins at 30, and graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a Bachelor's Degree in Finance.\n\nIn 2006, Hager had a WWE tryout in Deep South Wrestling, and in September 2006, Hager made his in-ring debut for Deep South Wrestling defeating Antonio Mestre in a dark match. He competed mainly in dark matches, before being moved to Ohio Valley Wrestling in January 2007. He started for OVW, by defeating Atlas DaBone, and in the following months began a rivalry with K.C. James Hager began teaming with a multitude of opponents to feud with James and his tag team partner Cassidy James.\n\nIn August 2007, Hager went back to Florida Championship Wrestling, where he began a rivalry with TJ Wilson. On February 15, 2008, Hager defeated Ted DiBiase, Jr. in Tampa, Florida at the Florida State Fair to become the first-ever FCW Florida Heavyweight Champion. Earlier in the night, DiBiase and Hager were the final two men remaining in a 23-man battle royal to determine the two championship contenders.\n\nOn March 22, 2008, Hager went against the FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion Heath Miller, in New Port Richey, Florida, to determine the true Heavyweight Champion. Both titles were on the line and Hager defeated Miller to become the undisputed heavyweight champion in Florida Championship Wrestling.\n\nHis first loss came in the form of a \"Raw\" dark match, at the TV taping on August 18, 2008 when he lost to William Regal.\n\nOn September 9, 2008, Hager made his start on the ECW brand under the ring name Jack Swagger, winning a match against a local wrestler. He quickly made himself a villain when he did not let the referee hold up his arm after the win, and later started a rivalry with Tommy Dreamer by attacking him after Dreamer had saved Chase Stevens from Mike Knox. He later defeated Dreamer in a wrestling match and an \"All American Challenge\" competition. After weeks of fighting, the two ended their rivalry in an Extreme Rules match, which Swagger won to extend his undefeated streak. He then set his sights on Matt Hardy's ECW Championship, and was named the number one contender on the December 30, 2008 edition of \"ECW\". On the January 13, 2009 episode of \"ECW\", Swagger defeated Hardy to win the ECW Championship, which is his first title in WWE. His undefeated streak in singles matches ended on the February 3 episode of \"ECW\", when he lost to Finlay.\n\nOn the March 1 episode of \"Raw\", Swagger beat Santino Marella to wrestle in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI. At WrestleMania, Swagger won the Money in the Bank ladder match, winning a contract for any WWE world championship that he could use at any time over the next year. On the episode of \"Raw\" after WrestleMania, Swagger tried to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on John Cena, but changed his mind when he saw that Cena was not hurt enough for Swagger to beat. As the match had never started, Swagger kept the contract for use at a future date.\n\nSwagger cashed in his Money in the Bank contract during the \"SmackDown\" taping on March 30, 2010, after the World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho had been speared by Edge. Swagger went on to defeat Jericho to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. after his championship win, Swagger changed into a more serious Swagger which was different from his last persona, where he was known for doing pushups and beating his chest during his ring entrance. He defended his championship against Edge and Jericho in a triple threat match on the April 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", and against Randy Orton in an Extreme Rules match at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view. At Over the Limit, Swagger kept the title against The Big Show by disqualifying himself. At the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view on June 20, he lost the championship to Rey Mysterio in a fatal four-way match, which also had CM Punk and The Big Show. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "165435", "title": "Jack Swagger"}

He is generally thought of as the greatest cellist of his time codice_1. He made the cello popular as a solo instrument and inspired many cellists codice_1 of the younger generation. In his later years he was also a conductor as well as a composer.\n\nCasals made many codice_1 recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral music. Perhaps his best known recordings are the ones he made between 1936 and 1939 of the \"Cello Suites\" by Bach. When the dictator General Franco started to rule Spain he felt very strongly about the political situation codice_1. When the democratic party was defeated in 1939 he said that he would never go back to Spain until democracy had been restored. He did not live long enough to see the end to Franco’s rule.\n\nCasals' father was the organist at the local church. He gave Casals his first music lessons, teaching him piano, violin and organ. When Casals was eleven, he heard a group of travelling musicians playing music codice_1. One of the instruments was the cello. He had never heard one and he decided that was what he wanted to play. His mother took him to Barcelona, where he went to a music school: the \"Escola Municipal de Música\". There he studied the cello, music theory and piano.\n\nOne day, when he was 13, he was looking at some old music in a second-hand music shop. He found some very old music for solo cello. They were the \"Cello Suites\" by Bach. People in those days thought they were just a collection of studies to help cellists with their technique, but Casals, although only still a boy, realized it was great music. He spent the next 12 years practising them until he felt ready to perform them. Casals’ discovery of these wonderful Cello Suites was the most important Bach discovery since 1829 when Mendelssohn found and performed the St Matthew Passion which the world had forgotten about.\n\nCasals showed enormous talent for the cello codice_1. On 23 February 1891, when he was 14 years old, he gave a solo recital in Barcelona. He graduated from the \"Escola\" with honours two years later.\n\nIn 1893, the Spanish composer Isaac Albéniz heard him playing in a trio in a café codice_1. He gave him a letter which allowed him to be introduced to the Queen. She gave him money so that he could study at the Conservatory in Madrid. She then allowed him to go to Brussels to study at the Conservatory which was then the best in Europe for string instruments. The cello teacher mentioned a long list of cello pieces and asked him which ones he played. When Casals told him he could play them all, the teacher made fun of him. When Casals started playing, everyone was amazed at his talent. The teacher wanted him to be one of his pupils, but Casals had been insulted and so he went to Paris the next day. The Queen of Spain was angry with Casals when she heard what had happened and stopped sending him money codice_1.\n\nIn Paris he had very little money. He earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the \"Folies Marigny\". His mother tried to earn some money by sewing. In 1896, he returned to Catalonia where he taught at a music school and played principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the Liceu. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, and was awarded the Order of Charles III from the Queen.\n\nIn 1899, Casals played the Saint-Saëns Cello Concerto at Crystal Palace in London, and later for Queen Victoria at her summer home at Cowes, Isle of Wight. He was becoming very famous. In Paris he make a great impression on everyone, especially the conductor Charles Lamoureux who had started a famous orchestra. Casals went to the Netherlands, the United States where he gave 80 concerts, and South America. He often played with the pianist Harold Bauer.\nOn 15 January 1904 Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt codice_1. He played in the Carnegie Hall in New York, playing \"Richard Strauss's Don Quixote\" with the composer conducting. Between 1906 and 1912 he had a relationship with a Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia, although they were never married.\nIn 1914 Casals married the American singer Susan Metcalfe. They were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.\n\nCasals formed a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. They gave many concerts and made some of the first recordings of piano trio music. They played together for 30 years.\n\nIn 1905 he toured Russia. It was an unfortunate time because the Russian Revolution was taking place. During the concert he played in Moscow gunfire could be heard outside the hall. \n\nDuring the First World War Casals lived in New York. In 1919 he went back to Barcelona. He wanted to improve the music in his own country. There were very few people who could play well, so he founded his own orchestra: the Orquesta Pau Casals. This annual music festival continued until the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\n\nCasals supported the Spanish Republican government. When it was defeated he said that he would not return until Spain was once more a democratic country. He then left his country and went into exile. He went to live in the French village of Prades which was near the border with Spain. He continued his career as a cellist. After World War II, in June 1946, he went to England and played the cello concertos by Schumann and Elgar at the Royal Albert Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting. Outside the hall the police had to help him get to his car because so many people were crowding round him.\n\nCasals played in many countries, but refused to play in any country that was friendly with Franco’s government in Spain codice_1. In 1945 he gave a broadcast at the BBC and spoke to his people in Catalonia codice_1. He finished by playing a Catalan folksong called \"El Cant dels Ocells\" (\"The Song of the Birds\"). He played it at the end of all his concerts. When Britain recognized Franco’s government, Casals decided he could no long play in England. He made one big exception to his decision not to visit Franco-friendly countries: in 1961 he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on 13 November where he played to President John F Kennedy whom he admired.\n\nIn 1950 he continued his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent. He agreed to play on condition that the money that was made at the festival would be given to a refugee hospital nearby. Franco said that Spaniards were forbidden to go to the festival, but many managed to cross the border on foot. Many world-famous musicians played at Prades: Josef Szigeti, Isaac Stern, Rudolf Serkin and Eugene Istomin and others.\n\nHe continued to lead the Prades Festivals until 1966. \n\nWhen he was 80 Casals married one of his young students, a girl called Marta. They had met in Prades. Marta was from Puerto Rico where Casals’ mother had come from. They went to live in Puerto Rico in a house called \"El Pesebre\". In 1957 a musical festival was started there in the town of San Juan. He continued to visit the festival at Prades every year until 1966. He also gave masterclasses at American schools and universities as well as in other countries. Some of these were televised.\n\nCasals was also a composer. One of his last compositions was the \"Himne a les Nacions Unides\" (Hymn of the United Nations); he conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971, 2 months before his 95th birthday. \n\nCasals wrote an autobiography \"Joys and Sorrows; Reflections\" (1970).\n\nCasals died in 1973 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the age of 96. In 1979 his remains were taken to El Vendrell, Catalonia, where he had been born. He did not live to see the end of the Franco dictatorial regime. Later, when Franco had died and Spain was a democracy once more, the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I, issued a postage stamp in honour of the centenary of his birth. \n\nIn 1989, sixteen years after his death, Casals was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nNo other cellist had such an influence on cello playing in the 20th century codice_1. He changed the way people thought about cello technique. For example: when he was young violinists and cellists were taught to practise with a book under the right arm. This made the bowing arm very stiff. Casals taught his pupils to play with a free bowing arm. Casals was a great teacher, and he learned a lot about playing through his teaching. He thought about fingering and bowing, and showed his pupils how their left hand could be strong but also relaxed.\nThe International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in Germany once every four years. It was started in 2000 to help young cellists to start their careers. It is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage Casals’ widow. One of the prizes is the use of a beautiful cello which was owned by Casals.\n\nThe Great Cellists: Margaret Campbell, London 2004, ISBN 1-86105-654-0, p.82. \nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians, ed.

This assignment shifts each year. For example, in the 2007 regular season, each team in the NFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC North and the NFC South. In this way division competition is the same opponents except for the 2 games given based on the strength of the each team's season record from the year before.\n\nAt the end of each season, a series of playoff games are played among the top six teams in the NFC. These are the four division champions (by place standing) and the two other teams (\"wild cards\") with the best win-loss records. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy. The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe NFC was made after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts made up the American Football Conference (AFC), the other 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.\n\nHowever, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to put the teams into divisions in the NFC. The proposals were narrowed down to five finalists. Then the plan that was selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle's secretary.\n\nSince the merger, three expansion teams have joined the NFC. This makes the current total number of teams 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995.\n", "id": "165456", "title": "National Football Conference"}

It is named after the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, in Croatia, its first home. The origins of the breed are unknown. The Dalmatian has been used for a war dog, fire department mascot, and shepherd. It is best known, however, as a coach or carriage dog, being a guard for horse-pulled vehicles. Also, the Dalmatian was used for being a circus performer, vermin hunter, fire-apparatus follower, hound dog, and as a guard dog.\n\nThere are lots of arguments about the origin of this dog. Spotted dogs are known very much in the history of Africa, Europe, and Asia. Spotted dogs are also thought to have lived in Egypt. In 1700, a dog known as the \"Bengal pointer\", which looked a bit like the Dalmatian, was popular in England. Some think the Dalmatian is from Croatia, and is a Croatian breed. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a hound dog for hunting. The breed became popular as a carriage dog in the 1800s. They walked among the horses and carriages, following their masters, and guarding the carriages and horses while the master was busy with other things.\n\nThe Dalmatian is a medium , strong dog. Its skull is flat on the top. The muzzle is almost the same length as the top of the skull. Its nose can be either black, brown (liver), blue, or a dark gray that looks like black. Its round eyes are either brown or blue, or sometimes both put together.\n\nIts toenails are white or black in dogs with a black spotted coat and brown or white in those with liver colored spots. Puppies are usually born completely white and the spots develop a few weeks after they are born.\n\nThe Dalmatian stands .\n\nAround 8% of Dalmatians are born deaf and some can become partially deaf after a while making them expensive to treat.\n\nDalmatians are known as the \"clowns\" in the dog world. They are also loyal to their owners and caretakers. Dalmatians are medium sized dogs, and they are very active and lively. They are brave and smart, and their senses are very bright. This makes them a good choice to become a companion dog.\n", "id": "165472", "title": "Dalmatian (dog)"}

People with a BMI of 25 or more are said to be overweight. Anything above 30 is said to be obese (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed.\n\nBeing overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight. In 2006 Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 Pubmed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick. \n51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women.\n\nDoctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called 'dieting'. They may exercise too.\nDieting is often ineffective. 41% of dieters weigh more four to five years after the end of the diet than before it began.\n\nSome people might use herbal teas, powders and pills to help to lower their mass.\n\nAnimals can also be overweight.\n\nOverweight is not just associated with bad health. People think that being overweight means that a person is lazy or bad. Overweight people are often treated badly by other people for because of this.

The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a \"filthy immigrant,\" causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is \"proud to be in America.\"\n\nOn the December 18, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", Prudius made an appearance as a WWE prospect named Vladimir Kozlov, which became his ring name.

Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose rivalry between the three of them over the WWE title. Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series by defeating The Undertaker by disqualification on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\". Edge was added to the match while it was in progress, and pinned Triple H to win the match. This is because Jeff Hardy was originally supposed to compete, but was found unconscious in a Boston stairwell. At Armageddon, Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating then-ECW Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match.

Xylem cells transport water and inorganic nutrients through the plant; phloem cells transport sugary fluids and other biological molecules.\n\nLatex or resin is not plant sap. They are separately produced, with different components and functions.\n\nXylem sap is mainly water, with plant hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients in a dilute solution. Sap in xylem moves from roots towards the leaves.\n\nPhloem sap is water, with manufactured sugars, other biological molecules and mineral elements dissolved in it. It flows from where carbohydrates are produced or stored to where they are used.\n\nA large number of animals, all of the single insect order Hemiptera, feed directly on phloem sap, and make it the primary component of their diet. Phloem sap is \"nutrient-rich compared with many other plant products and generally lacking in toxins and feeding deterrents, [but] it is consumed as the sole diet by a very restricted range of animals\". Phloem sap is physiologically extreme in terms of animal digestion: it is thought that few animals take direct advantage of this because they lack adaptations to this diet.\n\nMany more consume phloem sap by proxy, feeding on the honeydew (a sweet secretion) of phloem-feeding hemipterans. Honeydew is physiologically less extreme than phloem sap. Others feed on the biomass of insects which have grown on direct ingestion of phloem sap.\n\nMany products are made from plant sap. One of them is maple syrup. Maple syrup is made using sap from sugar maple trees.\n\nSap colour is different for different plants. \ne.g.:\n", "id": "165670", "title": "Plant sap"}

If a species becomes small in numbers, it can get to a critical point. This happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species (critical depensation).\n\nSpecies that are not a threatened species, but are still a concern, can be put into groups of Near Threatened, Least Concern, and Conservation Dependent. Conservation dependent is no longer used a group. When the species has not been studied, Not Evaluated, or there is not enough information, Data Deficient, the IUCN does not put them on the threatened species list.\n\nThreatened species are also called \"red listed\" species, because they are in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nUnder the Endangered Species Act in the United States, \"threatened\" means any species which is likely to become endangered in the near future, in all, or a large part of its range.

However, a popular alternative taxonomy puts the lorises in their own infraorder, the Lorisiformes.\n\nLemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils.\n\nMolecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, about 62 mya. Between 47 and 54 mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today.\n\nIn Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40 mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.\n\nBecause the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as \"primitive\" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade.\n\nAlthough their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear.

It is funded by the government of the city and it does not have any tuition fees. It is in the district of Intramuros in Manila, the Philippines. It was established on June 19, 1965 and opened on July 17, 1967 to 556 scholars, all coming from the top ten percent of graduates of Manila's public high schools. and opened on July 17, 1967.\n\nPLM holds the distinction of being the first in several ways— the first institution of higher learning in the country and perhaps in Asia to offer tuition-free tertiary education; the first university funded solely by a city government; and the first institution of higher learning in the country to have its official name in Filipino.\n\nFrom its first enrollment record of 556 freshman scholars coming from the top ten percent of the graduating classes of Manila's twenty-nine public high schools, total semestral enrollment has grown to an average of 11,000. The lone college in its earliest beginning has sprung to 12 colleges, five graduate, two professional schools, and a score of research and specialized centers, including a teaching hospital, an enterpreneurial center, and an integrated learning center for toddlers. In addition, it maintains a comprehensive distance education and open university program for thousands of community health workers and public administrators in various regions nationwide with affiliations and recognition from various national and international organizations and institutions.\n\nTo date, there are 53 single-degree baccalaureate programs and 49 masters, doctoral, and graduate diploma offerings that lead to degrees in accountancy, economics, architecture, business administration, computer studies, education, engineering, law, mass communication, mathematics, medicine, nursing, physical education, physical therapy, psychology, sciences, social work, tourism, management, and public governance.\n\nAccording to the Philippines' Commission on Higher Education (CHED), it is a model university for all public institutions across the country, one of the centers of excellence in the City of Manila, and the fifth among all universities nationwide based on the number of examinees passing the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) test.\n\nAs a university with its own charter, PLM enjoys certain level of autonomy. It is governed by the Board of Regents and administered by a President. The Board of Regents has the authority to grant diplomas, certificates and titles to students who have completed their academic programs and validate graduation of students. The six-member Board is composed of the President of the PLM, a representative of the PLM faculty, a distinguished alumnus, a respected educator, and one other respected professional, and the Superintendent of the Division of City Schools-Manila. Each member serves a six-year tenure of office. The President oversees the implementation of the university policies. Immediately under the President are the offices of four Vice-Presidents - Executive Vice President, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Administration, and Vice President for Finance and Planning.\n\nThe University is organized into twelve undergraduate colleges, two professional schools, seven graduate schools, and an open university and distance learning program, which are all being supervised by the Executive Vice President. These academic units collectively provide 53 single-degree undergraduate and 49 masters, doctoral and graduate diploma programs.\n\nThe twelve undergraduate colleges are the College of Accountancy & Economics, College of Architecture & Urban Planning, College of Engineering & Technology, College of Human Development, College of Liberal Arts, College of Management & Entrepreneurship, College of Mass Communication, College of Nursing, College of Physical Education, Recreation & Sports, College of Physical Therapy, College of Science, and College of Tourism, Hotel & Travel Industry Management. The two professional schools are the College of Law and the College of Medicine. The seven graduate schools include Graduate School of Arts, Sciences & Education, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Graduate School of Management, Graduate School of Urban & Settlements Planning, and the President Ramon Magsaysay School of Public Governance. The university's open university and distance learning program is served through the Emeritus College, Open University, and the District Colleges.\n\nPLM is the tenth largest university in Metro Manila with a total student enrollment of 13,711 (as of January 20, 2006). For the undergraduate class of 2011, PLM received 40,000 college applications, and accepted three percent of them.\n\nPLM's endowment in 2008 was valued at PhP 500 million, excluding the funding allotted for its teaching hospital, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, of about PhP 250 million. The University spends about four to fives times the national average for education. \nPLM utilizes a semester-based modular system for conducting courses, adopts features of the American system (credits), and employs the General Weighted Average (GWA) system and a 1.00 to 5.00 grading scale, with 1.00 being the highest possible grade for a particular undergraduate course.\n\nThe semestral calendar being used by PLM consists of two regular semesters of about 15 to 16 weeks each, and semestral breaks of about three to four weeks each. The university requires a minimum of twelve units to be considered a full-time student, with the maximum being twenty units.\n\nThe late President, Diosdado Macapagal, who himself visited the University, said that PLM is \"a unique university because it is the first community-oriented and socially conscious university in the country.\" He added that, \"it gives poor but deserving public high school graduates of the community the means to acquire higher education.\" Moreover, he recognized PLM's emerging status as \"one of the top universities in the country.\" Her daughter, President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo cited PLM for having a \"culture of excellence,\" and commended the university for what she had believed as its \"impressive\" accomplishments in various fields. \n\nThe country's leading newspaper, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney, in her speech during the 40th Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand, praised PLM for building a \"culture of commitment to public service in its students, faculty and alumni.\" In an article in the Business Mirror, PLM was considered as the \"highest symbol of Manila’s public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence.\" Websites such as Manila Board regarded that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today.\n\nOn August 13, 2008, Adel A. Tamano, in his column at the \"Manila Times\" wrote that PLM is \"a unique learning institution\" and is \"essentially an \"honors school\" where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted.\"\nPLM is not a perfect institution, and the university had been criticized in the past for the 'reconsideration' cases, wherein some students who failed to meet the university’s standards for retention were readmitted because of the so-called 'backers'. In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country's leading educational institutions.[1] [2]\n\nThe site of the PLM campus at Intramuros used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sedeño, S.J. The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.\n\nAside from Colegio de Manila, there were other structures that were built in the site. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626.\n\nIn 1601, the Colegio de San José was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university. In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia. In 1722, the Colegio de San José was granted \"royal patronage\". \n\nIn 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories. Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas. The Colegio de San José is now the San José Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nThe buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de España. José Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896.\n\nDuring the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym. The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During World War II, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.\n\nIn early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. However, on April 24, 1965, the late President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was inaugurated, and the students of Manila High School was transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started.\n\nThe call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The said ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. However, Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson's plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. But some difficulty prevented the university's formal creation. As a result, he sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City's fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias.\n\nThe two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress and signed by Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos and House Speaker Cornelio T. Villareal with Mr. Regino S. Eustaquio, Secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Inocencio B. Pareja, Secretary of the House of Representatives.\n\nOn June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - \"An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes\" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malacañang Palace. The signing was witnessed by Atty. Primitivo de Leon, Mayor Villegas, Congressman Ramon Mitra Jr., and its main sponsor in the House of Representatives, Congressman Albert. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter.\n\nWith an enrollment of 556 students—both men and women—PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them are housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing.\n", "id": "165979", "title": "University of the City of Manila"}

Thurgood Marshall, earlier named Thoroughgood Marshall (which he changed in the 2nd grade), was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Marshall served on the Court from 1967 to 1991. In 1946 he was awarded the Springarn Medal for all of his achievements and hard work for the NAACP. Marshall had been one of the NAACP's top lawyers. He was one of the lawyers who argued \"Brown v. Board of Education\". He was also Solicitor General of the United States.\nThurgood Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland and was in the class with the brightest students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and was in the top three of his class. He went on to attend Lincoln University and graduated in 1930. He applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was black. He later joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and became an active member. In 1934, Marshall became director of the NAACP, Legal Defense and for an Educational Fund. He won his first major civil rights case in Maryland in 1935 with the help of Charles Houston. He won 29 of 32 Supreme Court cases. He went on to argue thirty-two cases before the Supreme Court in 1940. Marshall argued in the Smith v. Allwright which disputed the rights of black people from voting in 1944. He also fought in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka about racial segregation in public schools in 1948, which was one of the biggest cases of the century. In 1954 the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. This was a rule violation of the 14th Amendment. It made way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement. He then went on to investigate U.S. Army courts-martial in 1950-1951, in Japan and Korea to help African American soldiers. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed him to the US Court of Appeals and he won 29 cases before attending the Supreme Court.<br>\n<br>\nBetween the years 1908-1993, he fought for individual rights. A quote that he wrote himself  “A child born to a black mother in a state like Mississippi….. has the same rights as a white boy born to the wealthiest person the United States. It’s not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for..” Marshall believed that both blacks and whites should have equal rights but it was not happening in the United States. He thought it was right for both rich and poor children to have equal rights. This quote had to do with Thurgood Marshall’s life because he was not rich but his parents and teachers worked hard to help him become a lawyer. He had to memorize the constitution. As a lawyer, he fought to end segregation between blacks and whites.\n\nThurgood Marshall was against the death penalty because he didn't think that it was necessary. He argued that there is no reason for the people who did something wrong, to go through the death penalty. He says that they should have a less painful punishment by going to prison instead. In 1990, Marshall said a lot of things about the death penalty and why he didn't want it enforced. \n\nBack in Thurgood Marshall's time, the time of segregation, some thought that if people were more open they would have seen the most important black male of the century. He joined the NAACP and argued in Brown v Board. To this day there is only one other black male in the Supreme Court justice. In his time in the Supreme Court he worked to end segregation and fought for the equal rights for all people. Even though he’s dead his legacy is still alive.\n", "id": "166149", "title": "Thurgood Marshall"}

During his short career he was thought of as the world’s greatest cellist after Pablo Casals.\n\nFeuermann's parents were amateur musicians. His father started to teach him the violin, but the young boy wanted to hold it between his legs like a cello, so his father bought him a small cello. In 1909 the family moved to Vienna so that he could learn the cello from the famous Friedrich Buxbaum, the cellist of the Rosé Quartet and principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic. Then he studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna. In February 1914, aged twelve, he played in his first concert, performing Joseph Haydn's Cello Concerto in D with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner. \n\nIn 1917, Feuermann went to Leipzig where he studied with Julius Klengel. Klengel thought his young pupil was incredibly talented, but that he did not know much great cello music. Feuermann worked very hard. Klengel was a good teacher for him\n\nIn 1919 Friedrich Grützmacher died and Klengel recommended Feuermann should take his job at the Gürzenich Conservatory in Cologne. Although he was very young he got the job which had a very good salary, but he was not given the title of “professor”. \n\nDuring the 1920s he gave many concerts all over the world. In 1929 he became professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin.He played with famous people such as the violinists Carl Flesch, Szymon Goldberg, Joseph Wolfsthal and Jascha Heifetz, the composer and viola player Paul Hindemith and the pianist Artur Rubinstein.\n\nOn April 3, 1933, with the rise of Nazism, he lost his job at the Berlin Conservatory because he was Jewish. He moved to London. He toured Japan and the United States where he played the Haydn concerto with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter. Some music critics were not very impressed with his playing. However, a few days later he gave a recital. Nearly all the professional cellists in New York were there because they had heard that Feuermann was an exceptional player. The audience were extremely enthusiastic and even the music critics changed their minds.\n\nIn 1935 he married. He moved to Zürich with his wife, but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the Anschluss while his wife and young daughter were still in Zürich. Bronislaw Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to Israel in September 1938. At the end of the year they went to the United States and applied for American citizenship.\n\nHe taught at the Curtis Institute of Music and gave concerts and made recordings with other great musicians including Artur Schnabel, Bronislaw Huberman and, especially, with the pianist Franz Rupp. \n\nFeuermann died in 1942 of an infection after a small operation for haemorrhoids.\n\nFeuermann was one of the greatest cellists who ever lived. The cello was not often heard as a solo instrument in those days, but Feuermann and Pablo Casals made people change their minds. Feuermann did not actually practise very much on his own, but when he was making music with other people he worked very hard at all the detail. He loved teaching. He also loved fast cars. His family were very important indeed to him.\n\nMany believe that Feuermann's interpretation of Antonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto and his performance of Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Jascha Heifetz are among the best ever. \n\n", "id": "166162", "title": "Emanuel Feuermann"}

She was also Regent of England for her son Edward III of England during his minority. Until 1325 she was a traditional queen consort. After that time she had one of the worst reputations of any English queen.\n\nShe was the daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. As the daughter of two monarchs she was destined to be a queen. While France and England had a common culture, political relations between them were tense. To ease this situation Pope Boniface VIII arranged two marriages. This double-alliance was between Edward I of England and Marguerite of France and also the infant Edward II marrying Isabel. In 1299 the marriage between Edward I and Marguerite took place. The marriage between Edward II and Isabella would wait until she was old enough. They were married in 1308 at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.\n\nAt age 12 the young bride was already considered a great beauty. Since his father's death a year earlier, the 24 year old Edward II was now king. But he showed very little interest in Isabella. His first act as king was to recall the exiled Piers Gaveston. One chronicler wrote \"He had home his greatest love.\"\n\nWhatever their relationship was exactly, Edward II regarded Gaveston with great affection. From the beginning of his marriage to Isabella their relationship was not good. Edward had no romantic interest in Isabella. Isabella soon found her husband was not giving her any money. She wrote to her father telling him she was living in poverty. King Philip quickly wrote back demanding Edward provide for his wife and any children they might have. Edward stalled by giving excuses. Meanwhile Isabella discovered that Piers Gaveston had been given many of the jewels her father had given her as part of her dowry. Isabella was furious. Her uncles warned Edward they would not attend their coronation unless he got rid of Gaveston. But Edward's barons had already made the same threats. Edward promised he would take care of everything when the parliament met in March. When Gaveston was put in charge of the coronation, one thing after another went wrong. At the banquet table honoring the king and queen, Gaveston sat next to the king instead of Isabella. He even displayed his Coat of arms next to the king's instead of Isabella's. The barons and Isabella's kinsmen were angry over these insults to their new queen. But it wasn't until 1311 that the barons drew up a list of ordinances the king had to follow. The first was to get rid of Piers Gaveston. But before 1312 Gaveston came back to England. That same year Isabella was pregnant with their first child. To escape the barons, Edward and Gaveston fled north taking Isabella with them. They left her unprotected at York while Edward and Gaveston escaped on a ship. But the barons were not upset with Isabella. Gaveston was captured and murdered in the summer of 1312. This didn't end Isabella's troubles as Edward found a new favorite in Hugh le Despenser. In November their first child was born, the future Edward III of England. But Despenser hated Isabella more than Gaveston. By 1321 she was virtually a prisoner. By 1324 Edward had given all her lands to Despenser.\n\nIn 1325 Edward convinced Isabella to go to France. Her brother Charles IV of France was now king. Edward wanted her to negotiate for him over Gascony. This was Isabella's chance for freedom. She even convinced her husband to send their son Edward (III) to join her. Edward soon realized his mistake and demanded she and his son return. Isabella ignored his demands and remained in France. The anger she must have felt over the years of mistreatment in England finally gave her a chance to rebel against her husband. She had their son, the future king of England with her and Edward could do nothing. At this time she was joined by Roger Mortimer an English exile. Another who came to her aid was Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, Edward II's half-brother. A number of Englishmen in France joined her cause. Many were upset with Edward II and the Despensers. \n\nBut Isabella was short of funds. She and her followers went north to Hainaut to find more support. In turn for their support, she negotiated a marriage for her son Edward to Philippa of Hainaut. She also gave up any claims she had to the French crown. She now had an army from Hainaut with many Englishmen backing her. While living in Hainaut, she and Roger Mortimer had become lovers.\n\nIn 1326 Isabella and her army landed at Suffolk. Neither Edward or the Despensers could mount an army against her. Edward II was captured and lost his throne. His son Edward III was made king in his place, with his mother as regent. \n\nIn 1321 when she was denied access to the Leeds Castle, she made her escort try to force their way in through the gate, and after they failed, she made 13 of her escort hang immediately. She had 4 children and at least 3 miscarriages. When she later died she was buried in her wedding dress.\n", "id": "166169", "title": "Isabella of France"}

According to Hesiod, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth. This was part of the punishment of mankind, because Prometheus had stolen the secret of fire. All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts. Another name was found for her was Anesidora, she who sends gifts. This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground \"kylix\" in the British Museum.\n\nAccording to the myth, Pandora opened a jar (\"pithos\") and released all the evils of mankind. With the exception of plagues and diseases, Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail. When Pandora closed the jar again, only Hope was left inside. The word pithos has been translated the wrong way, which may have led to the idea of \"Pandora's box\". Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside, and not because of malice.\n\nThe myth of Pandora is ancient, and there are several different Greek versions. It has been interpreted in different ways. In the literary versions, the myth is a kind of theodicy, it addresses the question why there is evil in the world. The oldest versiion is that of Hesiod, who wrote it in the 7th century BC. He shortly mentions it in his Theogony, in line 570, but does not name Pandora. In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story. There is an older story that tells that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homer's Illiad:\nThe immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus' palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.\n\nThe Pandora myth first appears in lines 560–612 of Hesiod's poem the \"Theogony\". This version does not give the woman a name. Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire, and has given it to the humans. Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men, as a compensation for the gift. He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth. This woman is described as a \"beautiful evil\" whose descendants would torment the race of men. After Hephaestus does so, Athena dressed her in a silvery gown, an embroidered veil, garlands and a crown of gold. This woman is unnamed in the \"Theogony\", but is probably Pandora. Hesiod rewrote her myth in \"Works and Days\". When she first appears before gods and mortals, \"wonder seized them\" as they looked upon her. But she was \"sheer guile, not to be withstood by men.\" Hesiod elaborates (590–93):\n\n<poem>\nFrom her is the race of women and female kind:\nof her is the deadly race and tribe of women who\nlive amongst mortal men to their great trouble,\nno helpmates in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.</poem>\n\nLater, Hesiod tells that men who try to avoid the evil of women by avoiding marriage will fare no better (604–7):\n<poem>\nHe reaches deadly old age without anyone to tend his years,\nand though he at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives,\nyet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them.</poem>\n\nAt the end, Hesiod says that occasionally a man finds a good wife, but still (609) \"evil contends with good.\"\n\nThe more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiod's works, called \"Works and Days\". There, the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105. Hesiod tells about Pandora's origin. He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger. As before, she is created by Hephaestus, but now more gods help completing her (lines 63-82): Athena taught her needlework and weaving (63–4); Aphrodite \"shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs\" (65–6); Hermes gave her \"a shameful mind and deceitful nature\" (67–8); Hermes also gave her the power of speech, putting in her \"lies and crafty words\" (77–80) ; Athena then clothed her (72); next she, Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery (72–4); the Horae adorned her with a garland crown (75). Finally, Hermes gives this woman a name: Pandora – \"All-gifted\" – \"because all the Olympians gave her a gift\" (81). The story is written in such a way that Pandora's feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind, because she brings a \"pithos\". This word is usually translated as jar, sometimes as a \"box\". The box contains \"burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men\" (91–2), diseases (102) and \"a myriad other pains\" (100). \n\nPrometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus did not listen; he accepted Pandora, who promptly scattered the contents of her jar. As a result, Hesiod tells us, \"the earth and sea are full of evils\" (101). One item, however, did not escape the jar (96–9), hope:\n<poem>\nOnly Hope was left within her unbreakable house,\nshe remained under the lip of the jar, and did not\nfly away. Before [she could], Pandora replaced the\nlid of the jar. This was the will of aegis-bearing\nZeus the Cloudgatherer.</poem>\n\nHe does not tell the reader why hope remained in the jar.\n\nHesiod closes with this moral (105): \"Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.\"\n\nArchaic and Classic Greek literature do not mention Pandora any more. Sophocles wrote a satyr play \"Pandora, or The Hammerers\", but very little is known of this play. Sappho may have made reference to Pandora in a surviving fragment.\n\nLater, people filled in small details, or they added postscripts to Hesiod's story. Examples for this are Apollodorus and Hyginus: Each of them added a part to the story, that might have already been in Hesiod's version, even though it was not written down: Epimetheus married Pandora. They each add that they had a daughter, Pyrrha, who married Deucalion and survived the deluge with him. The problem of that version is that Hesiod's Catalogue of Women\", fragment #2, had made a \"Pandora\" one of the \"daughters\" of Deucalion, and the mother of Graecus by Zeus. \n\nIn the 15th century, a monk named Annio da Viterbo said he had found a manuscript of a historian named Berossus. Berossus had lived in the 3rd century BC. According to the manuscript, \"Pandora\" was also named as a daughter-in-law of Noah. This attempt to join pagan and Christian texts was later recognised as a forgery, though. \n\nThe poet Theognis of Megara, who lived in the 6th year BC, had a different point of view:\n<poem>\nHope is the only good god remaining among mankind;\nthe others have left and gone to Olympus.\nTrust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,\nand the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.\nMen’s judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone\nrevere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and\nmen no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.</poem>\n\nTheogonis seems to be referring to a different version of the myth: In that version, the jar contained blessings rather than evils. This version seems to follow a tradition before Hesiod, which was preserved by 2nd century writer Babrius. According to Babrius, the gods sent a jar containing blessings to humans. A \"foolish man\" (not Pandora) opened the jar, and most of the blessings were lost forever. Only hope remained, \"to promise each of us the good things that fled.\"\n\nAttic red-figure painters seem to have had a tradition which was independent of the literary sources: Sometimes, they add to the literary version, sometimes they ignore it altogether. \n\nThere are many ways in which the figure of Pandora can be interpreted. Erwin Panofsky wrote a monography on the subject. According to M. L. West, the story of Pandora and the jar is older than Hesiod's versions. This also explains the confusion and problems of Hesiod's version and that it is inconclusive. According to West, Pandoora was married to Prometheus in these versions. West cites Hesiod's \"Catalogue of Women\", which preserved the older version. In one version of the story, the jar may have contained only good things for mankind. West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were transposed in the pre-Hesiodic myths. This is called a \"mythic inversion\". He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiod's story, to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth. Hesiod's myth of Pandora's jar, then, could be an summary of many different early myths.\n\nThere are different questions that need to be discussed. The Greek original text speaks about \"elpis\". Usually, this word is translated into English as \"Hope\", but it could be translated differently. \"Expectation\" is another possible translation, which is more neutral. One can expect good things, as well as bad things. Hope has a positive connotation.\n\n\"Elpis\" is everything that remains in the jar, when Pandora closed it again, so does the jar give \"elpis\" to mankind, or does it keep elpis away from it? -Another question to ask is wheter elpis remaining in the jar a good thing, or a bad one, for mankind?\n\nThe first question might confuse the non-specialist. But as with most ancient Greek words, \"elpis\" can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of \"expectation.\" But expectation of what? Classical authors use the word \"elpis\" to mean \"expectation of bad,\" as well as \"expectation of good.\" Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of ancient Greek literature. Others hold the minority view that \"elpis\" should be rendered, \"expectation of evil\" (\"vel sim\").\n\nHow one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry? The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released – they only affect mankind once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for \"Elpis\" as well, withholding it from men. If one takes \"elpis\" to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.\n\nThis interpretation raises yet another question, complicating the debate: are we to take Hope in an absolute sense, or in a narrow sense where we understand Hope to mean hope only as it pertains to the evils released from the jar? If Hope is imprisoned in the jar, does this mean that human existence is utterly hopeless? This is the most pessimistic reading possible for the myth. A less pessimistic interpretation (still pessimistic, to be sure) understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.\n\nIt is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for mankind, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes mankind lazy by taking away his industriousness, making him prone to evil.\n\nIn \"Human, All Too Human\", philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that \"Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"\n\nAn objection to the \"hope is good/the jar is a prison\" interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope – a blessing – doing among them? This objection leads some to render \"elpis\" as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although humankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.\n\nThe optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. \"Elpis\" takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, \"It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one.\" Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.\n\nAn incorrect etymology of Pandora's name, \"all-gifted\", was provided in \"Works and Days\". Pandora means \"all-giving\", but not \"all-gifted.\" Some paintings in vases, from the fifth century before Christ, indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod. Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix (circa 460 BC), \"Anesidora\", that means \"she who sends up gifts.\" This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman, like in the \"Theogony\". The epithet \"anesidora\" is also used to name Gaia or Demeter.\n\nPandora/Anesidora possibly would have taken on aspects of Gaea and Demeter. Pandora would incarnate the fertility of the Earth and its capacity to bear grain and fruits for the benefit of the Humans. Over time this \"all-giving\" goddess somehow devolved into an \"all-gifted\" mortal woman. T. A. Sinclair, commenting on \"Works and Days\" argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine \"giver\". A.H. Smith, however, notes that in Hesiod's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora, indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora's original \"all-giving\" function. Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiod's story \"evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture. As the life-bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed, the death-bringing human Pandora arises.\" Thus Harrison concludes \"in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished. She is no longer Earth-Born, but the creature, the handiwork of Olympian Zeus.\" (Harrison 1922:284) Robert Graves, quoting Harrison, asserts of the Hesiodic episode that \"Pandora is not a genuine myth, but an anti-feminist fable, probably of his own invention.\" H.J.Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife.\n\nThe Hesiodic myth did not, however, completely obliterate the memory of the all-giving goddess Pandora. A scholium to line 971 of Aristophanes' \"The Birds\" mentions a cult \"to Pandora, the earth, because she bestows all things necessary for life\".\n\nIn fifth-century Athens Pandora made a prominent appearance in what, at first, appears an unexpected context, in a marble relief or bronze appliqués as a frieze along the base of the \"Athena Parthenos\" the culminating experience on the Acropolis; there Jeffrey M. Hurwit has interpreted her presence as an \"anti-Athena\" reinforcing civic ideologies of patriarchy and the \"highly gendered social and political realities of fifth-century Athens.\" Interpretation has never come easy: Pausanias (i.24.7) merely noted the subject and moved on. Jeffrey Hurwit has argued that Pandora represents an \"anti-Athena\", similarly a child of no mother, an embodiment of the need for the patriarchal rule that the virginal Athena, rising above her sex, defended.\n\nThe humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam translated Hesiod from Greek to Latin, in the 16th century. The Greek word \"pithos\" is used for a large jar, used for example for storing wine. It can also refer to a funerary jar. \"Pyxis\", on the other hand, is a box. Usually, it is said that Erasmus swapped the words when he translated, so Pandora's \"jar\" became Pandora's box. The phrase \"Pandora's box\" has endured ever since.\n\n", "id": "166232", "title": "Pandora"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166297", "text": "Quicksand\n\nQuicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt. It has the characteristic of thixotropy: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a liquid). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid. It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine).\n\nWater circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay. The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass. This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress. Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small debris. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment. \n\nQuicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid: when undisturbed it often seems to be solid (\"gel\" form), but a small (less than 1%) change in the stress on the quicksand causes it to turn liquid (\"sol\" form). There is a sudden decrease in its viscosity. Under his weight, the person then sinks into the sol (liquidised sand).\nSomeone stepping in it starts to sink. Around the person dense regions of sand and sediment form and grip the person. The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly. It is now a gel. In order to move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquify it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as \"that needed to lift a medium-sized car\".\n\nIt was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to saturated or supersaturated suspensions of granules in water. Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles, reducing the friction between them. In 2005 it was been shown that the presence of salt is important. The stability of the colloidal quicksand is changed by the presence of salt. It increases the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksand's \"trapping\" power. Another finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely.\n\nQuicksand may be found inland (on riverbanks, near lakes, or in marshes), or near the coast.\n\nOne region notorious for its quicksands is Morecambe Bay, Yorkshire. As the bay is very broad and shallow, a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning tide, which can come in rapidly.\n\n", "id": "166297", "title": "Quicksand"}

In such a case, the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk, before it sent to the computer, or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk.\n\nModern disks often have a feature called \"command queuing\" (This is called TCQ in SCSI disks, and NCQ in SATA disks). This means that many commands can be sent at the same time, and the hard disk will put them into the best order. To store the commands and re-order them, the hard disk needs the disk buffer\n", "id": "166360", "title": "Disk buffer"}

To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern, with each step followed by a hop. Singers often provided the accompaniment, though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin, a drum, bagpipes or shawm, a forerunner of the modern oboe.\n\nThe gavotte later became a musical, rather than a dance piece. In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form. When composers began writing suites, six short dance based pieces, the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue. The best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by J.S.Bach. \n", "id": "166462", "title": "Gavotte"}

Planets in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life.\n\nThe habitable zone may also be called the \"life zone\", \"comfort zone\", \"green belt\" or \"Goldilocks zone\". One in five stars has an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. However, it is not known what proportion would have conditions suitable for life.\n\nThe Goldilocks principle or 'Goldilocks effect' is that something must be within limits: \"not too hot, not too cold, but just right\". \n\nIt is taken from a children's story \"The Three Bears\" in which a little girl named Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference of food, beds, etc. After testing each of the three items, Goldilocks determines that one of them is always too much in one extreme (too hot, too large, etc.), one is too much in the opposite extreme (too cold, too small, etc.), and one is \"just right\".\n\nIn astrobiology, the Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star. A planet must neither be too far away from, nor too close to a star and galactic centre to support life. Either extreme would prevent a planet evolving life. \nSuch a planet is colloquially called a \"Goldilocks planet\".\n\nIn a solar system, astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life. The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water. Liquid water may be necessary for all forms of life. \n\nBigger stars are generally hotter, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be farther away from the star than for the Sun. Smaller stars are cooler, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be closer to the star than for the Sun. The size and brightness of a star determine where the circumstellar habitable zone is found around the star.\n\nPlanets are evaluated on these seven criteria:\n\nThis concept is not so widely used. It is the idea that a solar system must also be in a suitable place inside a galaxy for life to form.\n\nSome areas of galaxies are better suited to life than others. The Solar System in which we live, in the Orion Spur, on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is a life-favorable spot, since we are there.\n\nThe habitable zone is the region around a star where a planet has sufficient atmospheric pressure to keep liquid water on its surface.\n\nA \"habitable planet candidate\" implies a terrestrial planet within the zone, and with conditions roughly comparable to those of the Earth (i.e. an Earth analog) and thus potentially favourable to life. \n\nOnly about a dozen planets have been confirmed in the habitable zone, but the Kepler spacecraft has identified a further 54 candidates. Estimates sugest that there are \"at least 500 million\" such planets in the Milky Way.\n\nThe table can be sorted by clicking the \"up\" or \"down\" arrows.\n\n\n", "id": "166555", "title": "Habitable zone"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166559", "text": "Ernst Röhm\n\nErnst Julius Röhm (28 November 1887 in Munich – 1 July 1934 in Munich) was a leader and co-founder of the German Sturmabteilung, the Stormtroopers. He also was a member of the German Reichstag, where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934. He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives, in 1934. Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder Röhm. During the First World War, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.\n\nHitler had known of his homosexuality since 1919 and this probably was one of the reasons that Röhm was murdered.\n\nErnst Röhm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887. He was the third child of a chief train inspector, Julius Röhm, and his wife, Emilie Röhm. He had one older brother and one older sister. His sister's son was Bernhard Lippert, a German diplomat.\n\nIn 1906, after his Abitur (school exams) in Munich, Röhm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare. Two years later he became a Lieutenant.\n\nIn 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front. He was wounded three times, and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone. He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time. Two years later, in 1918, he was given the rank of a captain (German: \"Hauptmann\").\n\nAfter the First World War, Röhm went to the Freikorps (Free Corps) of Franz Ritter von Epp. He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich. With this group, he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In July 1919, the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr.\n\nIn 1919, Röhm joined the German Workers' Party (German: \"Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (DAP)\"). This was the precursor of the Nazi party. One year later, he became a member of the German Nazi Party. He received the membership number 623. Röhm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicians and the industrialists. Two years later, Röhm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung (SA), attracting many men from the Freikorps. It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Hitler made Röhm the leader of the SA.\n\nRöhm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government, but failed. Röhm was arrested and charged with high treason. The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924. Röhm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army. Following the court trial, both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal.\n\nIn 1924, Röhm helped start the \"Frontbann\", an alternative to the Sturmabteilung. After an argument with Adolf Hitler, Röhm retired as leader of the SA. He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician. Between 1928 and 1930, he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor.\n\nOn 1 November 1930, he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time. In January 1931, Adolf Hitler placed Röhm in charge of the Sturmabteilung. In just over a year, he expanded it from 70,000 to 170,000 members. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning banned the SA again. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor after Heinrich Brüning, annulled the ban in June. In 1933, Ernst Röhm became a \"Reichsminister\", a minister of the Reichstag. In 1934, the SA had over 4,500,000 members. The power of the SA increased. Because of this, Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel (SS) started a new dispute with Röhm. The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the \"Reichswehr\"; Röhm was dreaming to take over the \"Reichswehr\".\n\nHitler was afraid of Röhm's power. Röhm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army, with him as leader. He also wanted a \"second Nazi revolution\" to make Germany more socialist. He was an anticapitalist, and at this time, Hitler was trying to befriend Germany's industrialists. Hitler planned to kill Röhm.\n\nRöhm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934. The holiday started on 1 July 1934. Röhm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest. On 29 June 1934, Röhm was arrested, yet had no trial. He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke: to commit suicide or be killed. On 1 July, Theodor Eicke shot Röhm as instructed by Hitler. Röhm was buried in the Munich western cemetery.\n\nMany Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night. It was called the \"Night of the Long Knives\". The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal.\n\nRöhm is well known in Germany and by historians for his homosexuality. He wrote three letters in Bolivia to a German doctor where he wrote about his homosexuality. Röhm said that he discovered his homosexuality first in 1924. In the mid-1920s, he started to communicate with the gay community in Berlin and Munich. Hitler knew of Röhm's homosexuality for many years but said he had heard it for the first time in 1934. Hitler lied because homosexuality was against the ideology of the Nazi party.\n", "id": "166559", "title": "Ernst Röhm"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166600", "text": "Feud\n\nA feud () (also called blood feud or vendetta) is a long-running argument or fight between parties. In most cases it involves whole familles or clans. People are seen as guilty, not because they did something, but because they were seen with other people (who are considered guilty). This is called guilt by association.\n\nFeuds start because one party thinks they were attacked, insulted, or otherwise harmed by the other party. Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge, which causes the other party to feel the same way. The dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates. They can last for generations.\n\nUp to the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments. The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds. Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force, feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation.\n\nA blood feud is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored. The wronged person then wants vengeance and kills the culprits or punishes them in other ways. If he cannot get the culprits, he does this to their relatives. Historically, the word vendetta has been used to mean a blood feud. The word is Italian, and originates from the Latin \"vindicta\", \"vengeance.\" In modern times, the word also means any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed.\n\nOriginally, a vendetta was a blood feud between two families. Kinsmen of the victim wanted to take revenge for his or her death by killing either those responsible for the killing or some of their relatives. Usually, the closest male relative of the person killed or wronged maintains the vendetta, but other members of the family may do so as well. If the culprit had disappeared or was already dead, the vengeance could extend to other relatives.\n\nVendetta is typical of societies with a weak rule of law or in those where the state does not consider itself responsible for helping with this kind of dispute. In such societies, family and kinship ties are the main source of authority. An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done. Sometimes even two separate branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter.\n\nToday, the practice of vendetta has almost disappeared in societies where law enforcement works. There, criminal law punishes lawbreakers.\n\nIn ancient Homeric Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: \"Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta . . . Vendetta is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods\".\n\nThe Ancient Hebrew tribes considered it to be the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil in God's name. The person who put the initial aggressive killer to death was given a special name: \"go'el haddam\", the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer (Num. 35: 19, etc.). Six cities of refuge were made to provide a \"cooling off\" phase as well as due process for the accused. As the \"Oxford Companion to the Bible\" states: \"Since life was viewed as sacred (Gen. 9.6), no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be 'life for life'\" (Exod. 21.23; Deut. 19.21)\".\n\nAccording to medievalist Marc Bloch, \"The Middle Ages, from beginning to end, and particularly the feudal era, lived under the sign of private vengeance. The onus, of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the \"faide\" (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe--'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call \"faida\"', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a chieftain, took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered\" (Marc Bloch, trans. L. A. Manyon, \"Feudal Society\", Vol. I, 1965, p. 125-126).\n\nThe Celtic phenomenon of the \"blood feud\" demanded \"an eye for an eye,\" and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland. Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in Appalachia, a series of prolonged violent engagements in late- nineteenth-century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, authors who both wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the Hatfield-McCoy feud, were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the 1880s and the early twentieth century. Although they were interpreted as such at the time, there is little reason to believe that these American incidents had any correlation to \"feuding\" in Europe centuries earlier.\n\nChariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the racing clubs. The Blues and the Greens were more than simply sports teams. They gained influence in military, political, and theological matters. The Blue-Green rivalry often erupted into gang warfare, and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian I, with nearly half the city being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed.\n\nThe Central Asian plateau (north of China) at the time of Genghis Khan's youth was divided into several nomadic tribes or confederations—among them Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Tatars, Mongols, and Keraits—that were all prominent in their own right and often unfriendly toward each other, as evidenced by frequent raids, revenges, and plundering.\n\nIn Japan's feudal past the Samurai class upheld the honor of their family, clan, or their lord by \"katakiuchi\" (), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the 47 Ronin, others were given official permission with specific targets.\n\nAt the Holy Roman Empire's \"Reichstag\" at Worms in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished. The Imperial Reform proclaimed an \"eternal public peace\" (\"Ewiger Landfriede\") to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted. In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed somebody in Prague and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities.\n\nMore than a third of the Ya̧nomamö males, on average, died from warfare. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes such as the Macu before the arrival of European settlers and government.\n\nThe Clan Gordon was at one point one of the most powerful clans in middle Scotland. Clan feuds and battles were frequent, especially with the Clan Cameron, Clan Murray, Clan Forbes, and the Chattan Confederation.\n\nIn Corsica, vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715, nearly 30,000 out of 120,000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta.\n\nThroughout history, the Maniots—one of Greece's toughest populations—have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds. Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family.\n\nThe Basque Country in the Late Middle Ages was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre, these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (\"Cf.\" the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy). High defensive structures (\"towers\") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, sometimes by royal decree.\n\nLeontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the Caucasus, wrote in the mid-19th century: \"Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion.\" In the Dagestani aul Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.\n\nAn alternative to feud was \"blood money\" (or \"weregild\" in the Norse culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death (even an accidental one). If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.\n\nVendetta is reputedly still practiced in some areas in France (especially Corsica) and Italy (especially Sicily, Sardinia, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, and other areas of Southern Italy), in Crete (Greece), among Kurdish clans in Iraq and Turkey, in northern Albania, among Pashtuns in Afghanistan, among Somali clans, over land in Nigeria, in India (a caste-related feuds among rival Hindu groups), between rival tribes in the north-east Indian state of Assam, among rival clans in China and Philippines, among the Arab Bedouins and Arab tribes inhabiting the mountains of Yemen and between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, in southern Ethiopia, among the highland tribes of New Guinea, in Svaneti, in the mountainous areas of Dagestan, many northern areas of Georgia and Azerbaijan, a number of republics of the northern Caucasus and essentially among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority. Vendettas are generally abetted by a perceived or actual indifference on behalf of local law enforcement. \n\nIn Albania, the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by Enver Hoxha. More than 5,500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds. There are now more than 20,000 men and boys who live under an ever-present death sentence because of blood feuds. Since 1992, at least 10,000 Albanians have been killed due to blood feuds.\n\nMutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further killings, retaliation, counterattacks, and all-out warfare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.\n\nThere is a scene in \"The Godfather,\" in which Michael Corleone, hiding from U.S. police in Sicily, walks through a village with his two bodyguards. Michael asks, \"Where are all the men?\" The bodyguard replies, \"They're all dead from vendettas.\"\n\nSome of the gang wars between organized crime groups are effectively forms of vendetta, where the criminal organization (like the Mafia \"family\") has taken the place of blood relatives.\n\n\n\n", "id": "166600", "title": "Feud"}

The fires caused Australia's highest ever loss of life from a bushfire. Police say that 173 people died, and 100 people were taken to hospitals with bad burns. At first the death toll was thought to be 210, but forensic tests have shown there were only 173 people killed.\n\nThe fires burnt down at least 2,029 homes, 3,500 buildings in total and damaged thousands more. Many towns north-east of the state capital Melbourne were badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including the Victorian towns of Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen, and Flowerdale. Many houses in the Victorian towns of Steels Creek, Humevale, Wandong, St Andrews, Callignee, and Koornalla were also destroyed or damaged. There were people killed at each town. The fires affected 78 towns and left about 7,500 people homeless. More than 4,000 firemen and women worked to control and stop the fires. They were still burning more than two weeks after they started.\n\nMost of the fires started and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire weather ever recorded. The temperature in Victoria reached 46 degrees Celsius and wind speed was more than 100 km/h. The wind blew the fires over large distances and areas, creating large firestorms. North-east of Melbourne, a single firestorm killed 120 people. A cool change hit the state in the early evening, but it had gale force south-westerly winds of more than 120 km/h. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern sides of the fires to become wide fire fronts that burned with quickly towards towns that had earlier escaped the fires.\n\nMany of the fires were started by fallen or clashing power lines or were deliberately lit. There was also lightning, cigarette butts, and sparks from a power tool. A ten-year drought made the land and forests very dry and they burnt quickly. Finally, in early-mid March, the weather changed and the fire fighters were able to put out the fires.\n\nStarting at the end of January, south east Australia had days of very hot weather, called a heatwave. The heatwave was caused by a slow moving high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, a big Tropical Cyclone off the north west Australian coast, and a monsoon trough over northern Australia. This caused hot tropical air to travel down over south eastern Australia.\n\nThe February fires started on the hottest day ever in Victoria, where temperature records have been kept since 1859. On 6 February 2009 – the day before the fires - Premier of Victoria John Brumby told people that very hot weather was coming, and that there was a big danger of bushfires. He told people to be very careful. Premier Brumby also said that it would be the \"worst day of fire conditions in the history of the state\".\n\nAt the end of January, there were fires in the Gippsland area of Victoria. These included a small trees fire near Delburn, Victoria and one which nearly burnt a pine tree plantation.\nThere were two small grass fires near the city of Sale, Victoria, which were deliberately lit.\n\nOn 29 January, over 500 firemen fought the two fires at Delburn which had joined together into one big fire. The fires had burnt near Boolarra and Darlimurra, south of the city of Morwell. No buildings were burnt. A cool change in the weather on 30 January made it easier to fight the fires, but also made it windy, which led to spot fires (new, small fires from burning plants blown ahead). On the evening of 31 January, fire crews worked to stop the fire spreading to the north. They fought to protect the main power transmission lines taking electricity to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley. The fire was also close to the Hazelwood Power Station, Victoria.\n\nBy February 1, firemen had made fire breaks (clear areas) around the Boolarra fire, although it was still burning out of control. The fire had burned through and destroyed 29 houses, farm buildings and animals. Police believed Delburn and Boolarra fires were deliberately lit. They offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of people who lit the fires.\n\nOn February 2, lightning started 23 new fires. This included three in the Bunyip State Park, and fires near Drouin West and Leongatha. However, increased humidity helped stop the fires spreading. On February 3, the Country Fire Authority grouped the fires into six areas. Five fires were under control, but one, near Mirboo North, was not.\n\nThe major fires include:\n\nThe Kinglake fire, was named when two fires joined together after the wind changed direction on February 7 and 8. The fire had burned over by February 8. 147 people died in the Kinglake fire.\n\nThe first of the two fires started at Kilmore East, Victoria, on the afternoon February 7 2009, and burned south-east towards St. Andrews through Wandong and Clonbinane. The fire destroyed 30 houses at Wandong and Heathcote Junction on February 7. By February 8, 150 houses had been destroyed at Wandong, and four people killed. The fire closed the Seymour railway line, and parts of the Hume Highway near Kilmore. The north west winds blew the front of the fire towards St Andrews, before the weather changed about 7.30pm, changing the wind to the south west. The wind change turned the long, narrow fire, into a wide fire front that moved north east to Kinglake and Strathewen.\n\nBy the evening of February 8, 100 people who had escaped the Kilmore fire, were sheltering in a basketball stadium at Wallan. Many of them were unable to go back to their homes because the police had closed the roads.\n\nThe fire front burned through the Kinglake area on February 7. This was the worst fire area in the state, with 37 people killed, and more than 550 houses destroyed. Another 12 people died at Kinglake West, and in Strathewen, 27.\n\nThe second fire destroyed the town of Marysville, Victoria. It started north of Marysville, and at first people thought it would go around the town, but within minutes the town was an inferno. At about 5.00pm, electric power was lost, and the wind stopped. Minutes later the wind came back from a different direction, bringing the fire up the valley with it. Damage to the water treatment plant at Marysville made the water unsafe to drink. On February 11, it was said that 100 people of the town's population of 500 were believed to have died, and that only a few buildings were left. Premier Brumby said: \"There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, everything's just gone.\" These numbers were later revised, but 40 people did die, and nearly every building in the town was damaged or destroyed.\n\nAbout 95% of the houses in Narbethong were destroyed. Other towns affected by the same fire included Taggerty and Buxton.\n\nTo the south west, the fire was burning on three sides of Yarra Glen, Victoria, trapping people in the town. Houses north of Yarra Glen were destroyed and large areas of grass lands were burnt.\n\nFor some time, the police believed that someone lit the fire that burnt Marysville, and several people were investigated. However, in June 2011, Victoria Police announced that this was probably not the cause.\n\nThe Maroondah/Yarra fire was named on February 10, when several fires that had been burning to the east of Healesville, Victoria and Toolangi joined together. By late morning, the fire had burned , with 184 firemen and 56 fire trucks at the fire. While the temperature had cooled, strong winds blew embers and started new fires. Around midday, the danger to property around Healesville was downgraded, though the Department of Sustainability and Environment said that people should watch for changes in the weather.\n\nThe fires in the Maroondah/Yarra area continued to threaten the town of Healesville, Victoria until February 14.\n\nIn Beechworth, Victoria, a fire burnt more than and came near to the towns of Yackandandah, Stanley, Bruarong, Dederang, Kancoona, Kancoona South, Coralbank, Glen Creek, and Running Creek, Victoria. The fire started at 7.00pm on February 7, south of Beechworth, before being driven south through pine plantations by hot northerly winds.\n\nThe fire destroyed buildings at Mudgegonga, Victoria, south east of Beechworth; 2 people died. Thick smoke and clouds made it hard to work out the size of the Beechworth fire.\n\nStrong winds fed the fire on the night of February 8, and lightning started a new fire at Kergunyah around midday on February 9. More than 440 firemen worked to stop a new fire that threatened Gundowring, and Eskdale, Victoria after it jumped the Kiewa River. On the night of February 9, the greatest danger was to Eskdale. Fires were also burning in pine plantations from the large town of Myrtleford, at the opposite, western end of the fire area. While smaller towns to the east, including Gundowring and Kergunyah, were still threatened, the CFA said that there was no immediate danger to the larger towns of Beechworth and Yackandandah, on the northern edge of the fire area.\n\nBy February 10, firemen had completed a fire break around the Beechworth fire, and were trying to make more, as the fire still was burning out of control. By the afternoon, the fire threat had been downgraded, but firemen were fighting a new fire near Koetong, Victoria, east of the main Beechworth fire, of between to . People in Beechworth and nearby towns were told on the evening of February 10 to expect more smoke, as 250 firemen would be back burning to make more firebreaks.\n\nThe Beechworth Correctional Centre, a prison, offered up to thirty prisoners to help the firemen.\n\nA fire west of the city of Bendigo burned out . The fire started at about 4.30pm on February 7, and burned through Long Gully and Eaglehawk, Victoria. It got to of central Bendigo, before it was brought under control late on February 8. It destroyed about 45 houses in Bendigo's western suburbs, and damaged an electricity transmission line; causing power failures in parts of the city. One man from Long Gully, ill and unable to leave his house, was killed in the fire;his neighbours tried hard but were not able to rescue him. The fire changed direction late on February 7, when the weather changed, and turned back towards Eaglehawk. It was controlled about midday on February 8.\n\nA relief centre was set up at Kangaroo Flat, Victoria Senior Citizens Centre. During the fire, people from Long Gully, Eaglehawk, Maiden Gully, California Gully and West Bendigo were moved from their homes and sent to the centre. The police are investigating whether someone had lit this fire. The CFA think the fire started from a cigarette thrown from a car or truck on the highway.\n\nIn Redesdale, a fire burnt . The fire started west of the town. The fire was close to the towns of Baynton and Glenhope. Glenhope was threatened again on February 9 from a smaller fire that broke away from the main fire. More firemen and trucks were brought in from Bendigo and Kyneton. By February 10, the fire had been controlled, having destroyed 12 houses and farm buildings.\n\nA fire at Bunyip State Park burned houses at Longwarry North, and Drouin West, Victoria, as well as farms and businesses, after the fire jumped the Princes Highway.\n\nThe fire was stopped by the afternoon of February 9, after it had burned through . The fire destroyed at least eight houses, other buildings and a factory. Fire crews began back-burning to stop the fire on February 9. People between Pakenham and Warragul, Victoria were warned about smoke from those fires.\n\nmany farmers, unable to keep animals on their farms because of fire damage, took them to nearby saleyards; by February 9, hundreds of cattle from the Bunyip fire were taken to the saleyards at Pakenham.\n\nThe Churchill fire began in a pine plantation south-east of Churchill, Victoria on the afternoon of February 7. Within 30 minutes it had spread to the south-east, near Hazelwood South, Traralgon South, Jeeralang, and Budgeree East, Victoria. By late afternoon the fire was near Yarram and Woodside, Victoria on the south Gippsland coast. The weather changed about 6.00pm, and the south west winds then pushed the fire north east towards Gormandale and Willung South on the Hyland Highway. About 500 people sheltered at a theatre in Traralgon.\n\nThe fire came close to the Loy Yang Power Station, and the station's open-cut coal mine. On the night of February 7, the fire approached the mine's overburden dump, but did not damage anything and did not stop the station's operations. Several small fires broke out in the bunker storing coal from the mine, but were contained with no damage. The threat eased by the evening of February 8, as temperatures cooled and some light rain fell. One small fire started south of the power station, but water bombing aircraft put it out.\n\nBy February 9, the Churchill fire was still burning out of control, with fronts through the Latrobe Valleyand the Strzelecki Ranges. By late afternoon, the fire had burnt out and killed several people. Wind changes that evening made parts of the fire worse, so the CFA warned people at Won Wron and nearby areas to be ready.\n\nPolice believe someone lit the Churchill fire. A man from Churchill was arrested by police on February 12. He was charged on February 13, with arson causing death, lighting a bushfire and having child pornography.\n\nA fire started at Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully, in the Dandenong Ranges. All major roads were closed. The fire damaged the railway track at Upper Ferntree Gully, causing the Belgrave railway line to be closed. The fire, which was controlled by firemen within three hours, burned along the railway.\n\nA house fire started on the morning of February 12, in Upper Ferntree Gully, killing a volunteer fireman from the CFA. Police think the fire was deliberately lit.\n\nIn Narre Warren there were several fires. Six homes were destroyed in Narre Warren South and three in Narre Warren North.\n\nOn February 8, lightning started a fire at Wilsons Promontory which quickly burnt over . This fire did not threaten the camping area but the National Park rangers decided to evacuate the park; some campers were taken out by boat. The fire continued to burn out of control for more than 10 days. By February 17 it had burned an area of including the air strip and cutting the main road.\n\nThe Horsham fire burnt , including the golf club and eight homes. The Dimboola fire appliance (utility) was also damaged.\n\nThe fire started at 12.30pm on February 7, when strong winds blew over a power pole at Remlaw, west of the city. The fire first went south-west and then south-east, across the Wimmera Highway and Wimmera River to the Horsham Golf Course and then to Haven, south of the city. Firemen were able to save the general store, town hall and school at Haven, though flames came within metres of those buildings. Winds of up to changed direction three times during the day, and caused conditions described by a CFA fireman as the worst he had ever seen. A taxi driver picked up an 82-year-old wheelchair-bound woman and her daughter, from her house as the fire was no more than away; the house was alight as the taxi drove off, and burned down within minutes.\n\nAt 3.00pm more than 400 firemen were fighting the fire, as well as two water-bombing aircraft, 54 Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire trucks, and 35 Department of Sustainability and the Environment (DSE) fire crews. By 6.00pm the fire had moved east, and as the wind changed, was then pushed north-east across the Western Highway to Drung, east of Horsham.\n\nAt Coleraine were burnt; one man was badly burned.\n\nThe Country Fire Authority (CFA) puts out fires on private property. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) puts out fires on public land. These organisations worked together to fight all these fires. Most men and women from the CFA were trained volunteers; there were more than 4,000 of them involved.\n\nIn addition to CFA and DSE firefighters, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered assistance from the Australian Defence Forces. New South Wales, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia sent firemen and equipment.\n\nThe Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and New Zealand offered help to the Australian government. New Zealand sent 100 firemen and forest fire experts. They would have sent more but did not because of the danger of fires in parts of New Zealand. New Zealand also sent a Mil Mi-8MTV-1 helicopter which can carry 5000 litres of water.\n\n173 people are known to have been killed by the fires. The death toll used to be at 210, but forensics found that a lot of the human remains that were thought to have been of two or more people were of one person.\n\nBrian Naylor, a famous retired television news reader, and his wife Moiree, died in the Kinglake West area. Actor Reg Evans and his partner, artist Angela Brunton, who lived on a small farm in the St. Andrews area, also died in the Kinglake area fire. Ornithologist Richard Zann died in the Kinglake fire, with his wife Eileen and daughter Eva.\n\nOver 500 people were treated for burns with 100 people were sent to hospital.\n\nA temporary morgue to hold up to 300 bodies, was set up at the Coronial Services Centre at Southbank in Melbourne. This was like the one set up after the July 2005 London bombings. A number of different funeral homes helped take bodies to Melbourne. By February 10, 101 bodies had been taken to the temporary morgue. There were more than 50 unnamed bodies kept in the morgue or still at the fire areas. The director of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that it may be impossible to discover the names of all the bodies.\n\nOn February 11, Police Commissioner Nixon said she hoped that searches for bodies would be over by February 15. Because there might be asbestos in some of the destroyed buildings, the search would be slow.\n\nPeople from other countries were killed in these bushfires, including:\n\n\n", "id": "166714", "title": "2009 Victorian bushfires"}

It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events. RFID is not a replacement for the barcoding, but a complement for distant reading of codes.\nThe technology is used for automatically identifying a person, a package or an item. To do this, it relies on \"RFID tags\". These are small \"transponders\" (combined radio \"receiver\" and \"transmitter\") that will transmit identity information over a short distance, when asked. The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader.\n\nAn RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics.\n\nMost RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and de-modulating a \"radio-frequency\" (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.\n\nThere are generally two types of RFID tags: active RFID tags, which contain a battery, and passive RFID tags, which have no battery.\n\nRFID systems are used for the following:\n", "id": "166730", "title": "RFID"}

Opal was the strongest hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula while still a tropical depression from September 27, then strengthened northward in the Gulf, becoming the most powerful Category 4 Atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall, October 4, in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola as a 125-mph (201-km/h) hurricane. Opal devastated the Pensacola/Panhandle area with a 15-ft (5-m) storm surge and travelled up the entire state of Alabama, becoming a tropical storm in Tennessee. Opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-Atlantic states before dissipating.\n\nAfterward, 50 people had died from flooding by Opal in Guatemala and Mexico, with another 13 deaths in the United States directly or indirectly related to Opal. Preliminary damage estimates were $3 billion.\n\nThe beginning of this storm started from a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on September 11. It disappeared into a low pressure while in the Caribbean Sea several days later. The wave was found again on September 27 and was good enough to become Tropical Depression Eighteen. Tropical Depression Eighteen made landfall in the Yucatán Peninsula shortly afterword. On September 30 Tropical Depression Eighteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Opal. Tropical Storm Opal continued west until October 2. On October 2 it turned northeast and strengthened into Hurricane Opal. After that Hurricane Opal strengthened fast and reached it's top winds of 150 mph (making it a category 4) on October 4, only two days after becoming a hurricane. Hurricane Opal continued northeast and weakened a little and made its last landfall in Santa Rosa Island, Florida on October 4 while a category 3 hurricane.

Although he was involved in the killing of thousands of people in Poland and Russia, he was never charged with war crimes.\n\nHis parents were Otto Jan Józefat von Zelewski, a Roman Catholic, and his wife Elisabeth Eveline Schimansky, a Lutheran. His name when he was born was Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski. He later changed his last name to add \"von dem Bach\" in the 1930s. He removed \"Zelewski\" from his name in November 1941 because of its Polish sound. \n\nHe was born in Lauenburg, in Pomerania, in the old German Empire (now called Lębork, Poland), on 1 March 1899. His family did not have very much money during his childhood. His father was often out of work. When his father died on April 17, 1911, in Dortmund, he was employed as an insurance clerk. His father's lack of success was partly because he was the brother of Emil von Zalewski, the leader of a colonial force fighting in Tanzania. On August 17, 1891, he and his men were killed in the battle of Rugarto, described as being like a German Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. This death and defeat brought great shame to the family. Erich would later restore his family's position in the community.\n\nAfter his father's death, his uncle Oskar von Zalewski, a soldier, became very close to Erich and told Erich to become a soldier. In November 1914 Erich von Zalewski asked to join the Prussian army, and was one of the youngest soldiers and remained a soldier fighting for the army until the end of World War I. He was wounded twice, and was given the Cross of Honor (Ehrenkreuz) and then Iron Cross.\n\nAfter the war, he stayed in the army and fought in the Silesian Uprisings, where he earned a reputation (what other people believe about a person) for courage. He was given more medals. In 1924, he joined \"Grenzschutz\" (border guards). On October 23, 1925, he changed changed his last name to `von dem Bach-Zalewski`. \n\nHe left the \"Grenzschutz\" in 1930, when he joined the Nazi Party, becoming a member of the SS in 1931. He was quickly promoted and by the end of 1933 had reached the rank of \"SS-Brigadeführer\". However, he quarreled with his staff officer Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald. \n\nThree of his sisters married Jewish men, and in 1946 he said that this ruined his reputation in the army and he was forced to leave. \n\nHe was a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1944, he took part in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, and had Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald murdered. He served in many Nazi party jobs, first in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia. By 1937 he had become the \"Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer\" (\"HSSPF\" – Higher SS and Police Leader) in Silesia.\n\nAfter the war started, units under his command took part in revenge and in the shooting of POWs during the September Campaign, but von dem Bach was not there in person. On 7 November 1939, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler asked him if he wanted the job of \"Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom\" in Silesia. His duty was to force people to leave and to take their property. By August 1940, his units had forced more than 20,000 Żywiec families to leave their homes.\n\nIn late 1939, he suggested starting a concentration camp for the non-German people who lived in the town of Oświęcim. Heinrich Himmler agreed to von dem Bach's suggestion and in May 1940 the Auschwitz concentration camp opened.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, von dem Bach-Zelewski became \"HSSPF\" in the \"Heeresgruppe Mitte\" (Army Group Center); in July 1943, he became commander of the \"\"Bandenkämpfverbände\"\" (\"Band-fighting Units\"), that carried out the mass murder of 35,000 people in Riga and more than 200,000 in Belarus and eastern Poland. The government was going to make him the future \"HSSPF\" in Moscow; however, the Wehrmacht did not get into the city. Until 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was the \"HSSPF\" in command of \"anti-partisan\" units on the \"central front\", a special command created by Adolf Hitler. Von dem Bach-Zalewski was the only \"HSSPF\" in the Soviet areas taken over by the Germans to have real authority over the police after Hans-Adolf Prützmann and Jockeln lost theirs to the civil government. \n\nIn February 1942, he was put into hospital, which he would later say was due to a nervous breakdown because of the ethnic cleansing in Belarus, and the genocide of the Jews. Radio signals overheard by British intelligence say, however, that his illness was physical. He went back to his job in July, with no reduction seen in his actions.\n\nIn June 1942, after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague, Adolf Hitler wanted von dem Bach-Zelewski to take Heydrich's job as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. When Himmler said that von dem Bach-Zelewski was needed due to the situation in Belarus, Hitler let him stay and gave the job to Kurt Daluege. \n\nOn 12 July 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was given command of all anti-partisan efforts in Belgium, Belarus, France, the General Government, the Netherlands, Norway, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and parts of the Bialystok District. In reality he remained only in Belarus and the area of Russia near Belarus.\n\nIn 1944, von dem Bach-Zalewski took part in front line fighting in the Kovel area, but in March had to go to Germany for medical treatment. Himmler took over all his jobs.\n\nOn 2 August 1944, he took command of all soldiers fighting against the Warsaw Uprising as \"Korpsgruppe Bach\". Units under his command killed about 200,000 people including more than 65,000 executions, and an unknown number of POWs. After more than two months of heavy fighting and the total destruction of Warsaw he then was able to control the city. For what he did in Warsaw, the Nazi Government gave him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on September 30, 1944.\n\n\nVon dem Bach-Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country. However, US military police arrested him on 1 August, 1945. Because he told the Allies what he knew about his former bosses at the Nuremberg Trials, von dem Bach-Zelewski never went to trial himself for any war crimes. He also did not have to go back to Poland or to the USSR to be tried. He left prison in 1949. \n\nIn 1951, von dem Bach-Zalewski said that he had helped Hermann Göring kill himself in 1946. To make people believe this he showed them the cyanide with serial numbers like the ones that were on the cyanide that Göring used. This was never proven. Today people who study history do not believe this happened.\n\nAlso in 1951, von dem Bach was told he would go to a work prison for ten years for the murder of people in the early 1930s; but he did not go until 1958, when he was found guilty of killing Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, an SS officer on the Night of the Long Knives and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 1961, he received an extra ten years where he had to stay in his home all the time for the murder of ten German Communists in the early 1930s. He never went to prison for crimes during the war even though he openly said he murdered Jews. He died in a Munich prison on 8 March 1972.\n\nIt has been said that Hitler really liked von dem Bach-Zalewski because he was very good at his job and said that von dem Bach was \"so clever he can do anything, get around anything.\"\n\n\n", "id": "166835", "title": "Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski"}

It is based on Voice of America (VoA) Special English.\n\nSpecialized English was set up initially by Feba Radio in the UK. Feba now uses Specialized English with US radio companies Words of Hope and Back to God Ministries International. All three are Christian, but Specialized English is not used for religious preaching programs. Its main use is in the features service program 'Spotlight', which is widely broadcast on over sixty outlets globally. Scripts and audio are also available freely on the Spotlight website.\n\nSpecialized English sounds the same as Special English, and it almost is the same. Both use a 1500 word core vocabulary, short sentences, and slow delivery (about 90 words per minute). Special English was used from about 1959 by Voice of America. Specialized was written in the late 1990's, independently of Voice of America. The basic design is identical, but there is a slight difference in the vocabulary, and Specialized is more international. VoA is a federal US government department, so it doesn't make Special English programs for anything other than VoA's own use. Specialized English was designed by the civil society, and the developers try to make programs for several purposes. The developers of Specialized felt they should choose a name to show both the similarity and the difference.\n\nThe reason that Specialized was based on Special English is related to their respective usage. They are not primarily teaching tools (even though they are popular as an aid to learning) but communication tools. The choice of words in the 1500 word list depends to a degree on what is to be communicated. Most of the words are the most frequently learned, most commonly used English words. Both tools use these words. But many words are chosen for the intended purpose. For example, Special English uses words a US government news service might need, such as Congress, federal, administration, capitalism and recession. Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects, such as blessing, prayer, miracle, and faith. The Specialized English word list has been revised in 2000 and 2007, in the light of experience. Still, the overlap of the two vocabularies is 91.3%. The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists. For example, the word 'joint':\n\nSpecial: joint - ad. shared by two or more\n\nSpecialized: joint - ad. shared by two or more; n. the place where two parts or things are fixed together.\n\nSpecialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes, which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list. (e.g.: wonderful not needed in the list because it can be built from wonder+ful)\n\nAs well as the 1500 word core vocabulary, both Special and Specialized English also generally allow: inflections of the core words, numbers up to a million, pronouns, proper nouns, and any words whose meaning can be communicated in real time (in a radio broadcast) using the core vocabulary.\n\nThe following table lists some differences between the two methods.\n", "id": "166913", "title": "Specialized English"}

It is like a double bass, but it belongs to the viol family. The name \"violone\" means \"large viol\". It was really a \"double-bass viola da gamba\". It usually had six strings, and the fingerboard had frets (like a guitar) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes. The bow was held underhand (with the palm of the hand facing up).\n\nThe violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing Renaissance and early Baroque music music. The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones.\n\nThe violone was the last member of the viol family to die out. When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins, violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass. Bach used the violone in his cantatas. Eventually the violone was no longer used, and the double bass was used instead. The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths.\n\nIn organs \"Violone\" is the name given to a soft organ stop made of metal or wood, usually in the pedals.\n\n", "id": "167140", "title": "Violone"}

It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse, even if no one wants to. For example, even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy, it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons, like washing and throwing away rubbish. Each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water, but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing. This may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps.\n\nThe idea was not Hardin's, but a person writing in 1833, William Forster Lloyd. In those days people often grazed cows and sheep on common land. Sheep graze more closely than cows. Lloyd pointed out that each sheep added benefited its owner, but made the grazing overall was damaged by overgrazing.\n\nThe tragedy of the commons is very clear in modern debates on ecology.

He composed many works for the cello which today are performed by cellists all over the world.\n\nPopper was born in the old Jewish part of Prague. His father was a Cantor in two synagogues. When he was three years old he was imitating his father’s singing. He learned the violin when he was six and, at the age of twelve, he got a place to study music at the Prague Conservatory, but he had to learn the cello. His cello teacher was Julius Goltermann. His first job was as cellist to the Prince of Hohenzollern who soon gave him the title “Kammervirtuoso”. He was only 21 when he played a difficult concerto by Robert Volkmann. The conductor, Hans von Bülow, was very impressed and so were the critics. He gave many concerts in Vienna and became very famous. He started to travel around Europe, visiting England and Russia. He had a lot of energy and was able to compose a lot while travelling. He composed many short cello pieces. His \"Elfentanz\" (Dance of the Elves) and \"Spinning Song\" were especially popular with the audiences.\n\nIn 1886 Popper married for the second time. In the same year he took up a job at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music in Budapest. He was a famous teacher and charged a high fee for lessons. He formed a string quartet with three other musicians including the violinist Jenő Hubay. Hubay and Popper often played piano trios with Johannes Brahms. \n\nPopper made a long visit to England and Scotland where he was described as the world’s greatest cellist by many people including George Bernard Shaw. When he returned to Prague he played with Béla Bartók who was only 19 years old and not yet famous. He was also impressed when he heard the young Pablo Casals, although he did not agree with his technique.\n\nPopper had one son who died of tuberculosis in 1911. Two years later Popper slipped on an icy pavement. He was never able to use his right arm again. He died the next summer of a heart attack.\n\nPopper composed a very large number of cello pieces, many of which are short pieces suitable for encores at a recital. One of the most popular (and not too difficult) is the \"Gavotte in D major\". He composed a \"Requiem\" for three cellos and orchestra, and he wrote four cello concertos. However, his most important work for cellists is a collection of studies called \"Hochschule des Violoncellspiels\" (\"High School of Cello Playing\"). This book contains 40 etudes, or musical exercises to develop technique, and is widely used today by cello students to improve their playing.\n\n", "id": "167166", "title": "David Popper"}

There are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made. Temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano. The biggest mud volcanoes are 10 kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700 meters. Most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane. Other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane. They usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids. An example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water.\n\nA mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the Earth or on the ocean bottom. Temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point. \n\nMud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction. They can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt. They are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well. However, instead of spitting out magma, mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide.\n\nAround 1,100 mud volcanoes have been found on land and in shallow water. People think that more than 10,000 mud volcanoes may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains.\n\nThere are many features of mud volcanoes. One of these features is the gryphon, which is a steep, short cone that gives off mud. Another feature is the mud cone, which is a tall cone that makes mud and small pieces of rock. The scoria cone is a cone that is made when of mud are heated up and the salse, which are pools of water that leak gases out of them. Mud volcanoes have many other features, but most of these are notable.\n\nMost of the things that mud volcanoes spit out happen during volcanic . Other eruptions have been known to happen during the time when a volcano is dormant or sleeping.\n\nThere are very few mud volcanoes in Europe, but quite a few are on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in the southeastern part of Ukraine. In Italy, many mud volcanoes are near the Apennines and in Sicily. Also in Europe are the Berca Mud Volcanoes, near Berca in Buzău County, Romania. Many mud volcanoes are by the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Movement from tectonic plates have made areas of mod volcanoes that spit out hydrocarbons and methane. Some of the tallest mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan. Mud volcanoes are also in Iran and Pakistan in the Makran mountain range.\n\nChina has a lot of mud volcanoes in the Xinjiang province. There are two active mud volcanoes in the southern part of Taiwan. The island of Baratang, which is part of the Great Andaman group of islands in the Andaman Islands, Indian Ocean also have a few active mud volcanoes.\n\nPeople think that 300 of the mud volcanoes out of the 700 mud volcanoes on Earth are in the eastern part of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. In 2001, one mud volcano about 15 kilometers away from Baku was in the world news when it suddenly started spitting out flames 15 meters high.\n\n\n", "id": "167198", "title": "Mud volcano"}

Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.\n\nHydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called \"black smokers\".\n\nRelative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp.\nActive hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars.\n\n", "id": "167215", "title": "Black smoker"}

It is used to help stop uniformed police officers shooting undercover police officers who they do not know are police officers. It is mostly known to be used by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the NYPD Transit Bureau (which was called the \"New York City Transit Police\") and the NYPD Housing Bureau (which was called the \"New York City Housing Authority Police Department\") and other law enforcement agencies when they are at work in New York City. An undercover police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the \"color of the day\"; this color is told to officers at the station house before they start work. The system is for officer safety and first started during the violence of 1970s and 1980s New York City. The color of the day system is not known by most of the public but it is written about a lot by newspapers, and by writers and can sometimes be seen on episodes of television shows such as NYPD Blue and recently .\n\nNew York City is a very large metropolitan city with a population of over 8,310,000 people with over 18,800,000 people living in the area around it. An extra 500,000 people enter the city during a weekday. It has many police and law enforcement officers such as; the NYPD, the (MTA) Police (that used to be called the Metro North Commuter Railroad Police), the Port Authority Police, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Customs and others. The color of the day system is about officer safety. With so many armed officers in the city, undercover police officers need to have an easy to use system in place so that other armed officers know that they are there and do not shoot them when they use their guns. The system is also used so that a uniformed officer will not disturb a person who is really an undercover police officer who is acting as a homeless person so that criminals will rob him.\n\nThe NYPD Street Crimes Unit started in 1971. During the late 1970s, the 1980s and early 1990s, New York City had a lot more crime than it does today. Undercover officers were asked to go into the subways in plain-clothes or dressed as a homeless person to hide the fact that they were police. Many of these officers were black and had a fear that as they looked like civilian homeless people that uniformed officers would think that they were criminals if they used their guns. Many of these officers would dress and pretend to be drunk homeless people or as victims in order to catch muggers who were attacking them due to being unable to help themselves. The color of the day system was made to make these officers fear this less and was used by all undercover police officers. At the beginning headbands were given out to each street crime unit member, that were in the color of the day: beginning the use of the color of the day system. Later this included wristbands and today's officers often dress in the color: i.e.: T-shirts, shoes, and hats.\n\nThe color of the day recognition system is written about by authors and people who study the police in schools but it is not often known about by most people in New York. Books that talk about it are Roger Abell's \"The Black Shields\" (a discussion of African American policing in New York), Greg Faliis' \"Just the Facts Ma'am\", and Leslie Glass' novel, \"A Killing Gift\".\n\n\n\n", "id": "167385", "title": "Color of the day (police)"}

It is also called in ; which means \"Democratic State of Taiwan\". In English it was also called the: Formosan Republic, Taiwan Republic and the Republic of Formosa.\n\nThe Republic of Taiwan was formed in 1895. It did not last for very long. The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war between the Qing Dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan, gave Taiwan to the Japanese. The republic began when the Chinese left in May, 1895, and ended when the Japanese soldiers arrived in October, 1896. Some historians say it was the first republic in Asia, but there was one earlier, the Lanfang Republic, which had been started in 1777.\n\nThe republic was started by a group of high officials and local people who still supported the Qing. They wanted to stop the Japanese take over of Taiwan. On May 24, 1895 the new republic sent a copy of its declaration of independence to all the embassies on Taiwan. The next day the new government held an independence ceremony. The Republic of Taiwan made their own stamps. They also printed their own paper money, which is now very hard to find.\n\nThey were always loyal to the Qing, and said that the Republic would be part of the Qing state. The first president of the Republic of Taiwan was the old governor, Tang Ching-sung, who served from May 25, 1895 to June 5, 1895. The second president was Liu Yung-fu, June 5, 1895 – October 21, 1896.\n\nWhen the Japanese soldiers invaded Taiwan there was a lot of fighting. They quickly defeated the new republic. Most of the republic's official quickly left the island.\n\nThe modern Taiwan independence groups want to start a new Republic of Taiwan. They say that there is no connection between them and the 1895 Republic.

After World War I the term was used for paramilitary units. The Freikorps got famous at the time of the Weimar Republic to fight in some towns against the Communism.\n\nThe first freikorps were started by Frederick II of Prussia in the eighteenth century during the Seven Years' War. Other freikorps were started during the Napoleonic Wars and were commanded by people such as Ferdinand von Schill and later Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von Lützow. The freikorps were thought to be not by regular armies and were mostly used as guards and for minor duties.\n\nThe meaning of the word changed over time. After 1918, the word was used for the paramilitary organizations that were started in Germany by soldiers who came home after losing World War I. They were the main paramilitary groups during that time. Many of these returning soldiers were not able to return to a normal life, and joined a Freikorps to again be a part of a military structure. Others were angry at losing the war and joined to fight against Communists or get revenge. They were liked and supported by Minister of Defence Gustav Noske, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, who used them to stop the German Revolution and the Marxist Spartacist League, and also to murder Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919.\n\nIn 1920, Adolf Hitler had started his political work as the leader of the very small and unknown German Workers Party (that was soon called the National Socialist German Workers Party, NSDAP (or Nazi Party)) in Munich. Many people who would join this party had been in the Freikorps, including Ernst Röhm, future leader of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, and Rudolf Höß, the future Commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nHermann Ehrhardt, who started the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, and his deputy Commander, Eberhard Kautter, did not want to help Hitler and Erich von Ludendorff in the Beer Hall Putsch.\n\nFreikorps leaders gave their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS on Nov 9, 1933 in a very big . Historian Robert Waite said that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps. Many of the Friekorps had joined the SA, so when the Night of the Long Knives happened, they were targets for being murdered or arrested and this was also done to Ehrhardt and to Röhm. Waite also says that in Hitler's 'Rohm Purge' speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934, that Hitler said that the Freikorps were enemies of Germany.\n\nIn 1939, in the Polish September Campaign, \"Freikorps Ebbinghaus\", was started to work behind the frontlines.

It depends on the mangroves near river edges for resting and sleeping. They avoid deforested areas and avoid human settlements.\n\nThe proboscis monkey eats mainly fruit and leaves. It also eats flowers, seeds and insects to a lesser extent. At least 55 different plant species are eaten. Young leaves are preferred over mature leaves and unripe fruits are preferred over ripe fruit. Being a seasonal eater, the proboscis monkey eats mostly fruit from January to May and mostly leaves from June to December. Groups usually sleep in adjacent trees. Monkeys tend to sleep near rivers, if they are nearby. Proboscis monkeys will start the day foraging and then rest further inland. Proboscis monkeys' daily activities consist of resting, traveling, feeding and keeping vigilant.\n\nThe male proboscis monkey is known for its very unique, large floppy nose. Females have a smaller pointed nose. Another fact is that a baby proboscis, with its dark blue face and black furs, looks very different from its parents.

Biologists believe the bat became extinct on 27 August 2009.\n\nIt was a small bat (it weighed 3 to 4.5 grams), and lived only on Christmas Island, Australia. It was thought to be the same as the \"Pipistrellus tenuis\", but research on the bat's baculum, (a penis bone), showed that \"Pipistrellus murrayi\" was a different species.\n\nThe numbers of Christmas Island Pipistrelle bats dropped a lot in the last 20 years. It was once seen all over the island, including in the Settlement. It went from at least 80% of its living range, and its numbers dropped more than 90% since 1994. Research into the number of bats in January 2009, shows there were only about 20 bats left. The only known group resting place had only four bats. The last bat call was heard on 26 August 2009.\n\nScientists do not know why the Christmas Island Pipistrelle's numbers dropped. Several possible threats may have been:\n\nA number of animals brought to Christmas Island could be the problem:\n\nEarly in 2009, the Australian Minister for the Environment, Peter Garrett, stopped scientists from trying to set up a captive breeding program. He said that the bats were too hard to catch, and no one knew how to keep them alive in cages. Instead, he announced a program to breed a similar bat in the Northern Territory of Australia. Scientists would learn about caring and breeding bats, then use this information to save the Christmas Island Pipistrelle. Other scientists have said this will take too long, and the bats will be extinct. Scientists believed that by June 2009 there were only four of the bats left in the world. In July 2009, the Australian Government changed its earlier decision and said that it would try to capture the last of the bats and use them to try and breed more bats in captivity. During August and September 2009 scientists searched for the remaining bats to catch them and protect them. At the end of August only one bat had been heard. Scientists tried to catch this bat, but it has not been heard from since the night of 26 August. It is now believed that the bat is extinct. This may be one of the few times that the extinction of a species in the wild can be known to the exact day. Scientists will continue to search for the bat, but there has been no signs of the bat since.\n", "id": "167580", "title": "Christmas Island pipistrelle"}

Between 1932 and 1945, he was President of the German Reichstag and also a minister of the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler. In the Second World War, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the German air force. Göring was responsible for the creation of the concentration camps and the Gestapo, the official secret Nazi police, which he handed over to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In 1941, he gave Reinhard Heydrich the order to arrange the Final Solution to kill millions of Jews.\n\nGöring was one of the 25 people charged at the Nuremberg Trials. The court decided he was guilty. The judgment on 1 October 1946 said that he was to be hanged, but he killed himself by swallowing a tablet of cyanide a few hours before he could be executed.\n\nHermann Göring, son of Ernst Heinrich Göring and Franziska Göring (born Tiefenbrunn), was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria. Göring's father was a judge. The German chancellor Otto von Bismarck made Ernst Göring the first \"Reichskommissar\" (Governor-General) of \"South West Africa\" (today: Namibia), in 1885.\n\nHermann Göring had two brothers, Albert Göring and Karl Ernst Göring, and two sisters, Olga Therese Sophie Göring and Paula Elisabeth Rosa Göring.\n\nHe spent the first three years of his life at the home of a friend of his mother, because Göring's father was in Namibia. From 1901, he lived at his godfather Hermann von Epenstein's mansion. Hermann's mother had an affair (a romantic relationship with someone other than her husband) with von Epenstein. He attended the grammar schools in Fürth and Ansbach. In the games he played as a child, the story was always about war.\n\nIn 1905, he went to a military school in Karlsruhe. He got his Abitur, and an officer exam, in 1912. He then went to the Bavarian Prinz Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) in Mulhouse.\n\nWhen the First World War started, Göring had the rank of Lieutenant. He served in the infantry. In 1915, because of his rheumatism, he had to go to a hospital. His friend, Bruno Loerzer, got him to join the air force. In France, he flew as an observer, a person who looked for targets and enemy planes. Because of this, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1915. In 1916, he was trained to fly a plane. On 14 March 1916, he shot down his first bomber. In 1917, he became the leader of the 27 Flying Group. In 1918, after he shot his 19 plane, he was awarded the Pour le Mérite (also called \"The Blue Max\"). This was the highest airforce award in Germany. After the death of Manfred von Richthofen, he became the leader of the flying group \"The Red Baron\".\n\nBetween 1919 and 1921, Göring worked as a stunt pilot in Scandinavia. In November 1922, he met Adolf Hitler and became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). Göring married Carin in Stockholm on 3 February 1923. In 1923 he was leading the SA (\"Oberste SA-Führer\"), and he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and was wounded. After this, he went to Austria. Because of pain, a doctor injected him with morphine but he became dependent on it. Between 1925 and 1926, he had two treatments in Sweden at the Långbro mental hospital. He came back to Germany in 1927. In 1928, he became a member of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was a member of the Reichstag until the end of the Second World War. In 1932, the NSDAP became the most powerful party of the Reichstag. Göring then became president of the Reichstag.\n\nWhen Hitler became chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933, he made Göring a minister of the Reich without a specific area of responsibility. This means that he was not the head of a ministry. In April 1933, he was made minister president of Prussia. Then, on 30 August 1933, he was made a General by Paul von Hindenburg. Between 1934 and 1935 he became minister of several agencies. His wife had died in 1931, and in 1935 he married Emmy Sonnemann in Berlin. In 1936, he sent the German Condor Legion to Spain to help Francisco Franco. After the Kristallnacht in 1938, he was in charge of removing Jewish businessmen from the German economic system. During Second World War, his biggest defeat was the loss of the air battle against Great Britain. Hitler named Göring to be his successor if he died in 1939.\n\nIn 1940, he was made Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Empire) by Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. In 1941, Göring ordered Heydrich to make a plan for the Holocaust. In 1942, he gave Fritz Sauckel the order to use the Russian population for industry-work. In 1943, Göring had an expensive birthday party for his 50 birthday. On 20 April 1945, he left Hitler's birthday party and went to Berchtesgaden. He told Hitler that he had important things to do in south Germany. From Berchtesgaden, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler in Berlin. In the telegram Göring asked about taking over the affairs of state. Towards the end of the war, after the telegram, he started to talk with the Allies. Because of this, Hitler wanted to put Göring in prison. Göring then went to the Americans.\n\nOn 29 April 1945 Hitler removed Göring from all his offices, stripped him off his party membership and ordered his arrest. He wrote this down in his testament.\n\nGöring surrendered in Bavaria on 9 May 1945. The Nuremberg Trials started on 20 November 1945. On 18 March 1946, Göring was questioned by the Allies. After this, he was imprisoned in Nuremberg. He was the third-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg. Only Reich President (former \"Großadmiral\") Karl Dönitz and former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess had higher ranks than Göring. The judges decided he was guilty. Because of this on 1 October 1946 the court reached a verdict that he was to be hanged. One day before he was to be hanged, he committed suicide by taking a tablet of cyanide. It is not known how Göring got the cyanide or how long he hid it but there was a claim that he was given it by an American soldier who was in love with a German woman who was in touch with him.

Bullying is directed repeatedly towards specific and general targets or subjects. Bullying can be defined in many different ways depending on its context. Bullying doesn't have to be physical. It can be things that people say.\n\nThe subject of bullying includes picking on people that people see what happens but they don't do anything about it. When witnesses know what to do and they do it, the action becomes part of a process which makes a bad situation better.\n\nBullying is not only violence against the bullied person. It's also bullying when other people hide it from those in power (teachers, bosses), other people who see it ignore it, or when the bully is helped to get away with it. Bullying can also be saying mean words said to people face to face. \n\nSchool teachers and staff have tried to learn ways to stop bullying even when they do not see it themselves. They have learned that bullying can be easy to hide.\n\nSome US states have laws against it.\n\nBullying can happen at school, work, at home, on the internet (cyber-bullying) or somewhere else.\n\nA purpose is part of what makes bullying what it is. The process of bullying develops in many ways, including\n\nBullying may be a combination of one or more of these tactics (techniques). For example, Lance Armstrong explained \"Yes, I was a bully. I was a bully in the sense that I tried to control the narrative and if I didn't like what someone said I turned on them.\" In other words, when someone said something Armstrong didn't like, \"We ran over her, we bullied her.\"\n\nBullying behavior includes the misuse (harm) of power or position and making comments or threats about job security. The person that is getting bullied then feels insecure (not sure) about themselves.\n\nBullying also includes moving the goalposts by setting objectives which subtly change and cannot be defined or explained in ways that can be reached.\n\nBullying happens for a reason. The person is either not getting the attention they want or they are going through a family struggle and want to control someone else. Another possible reason, is that the person does not feel confident about themselves so they bully others to make themselves feel more powerful. Therefore, when the person that is the bully wants to get attention and show who's the best. They will start by saying mean things to students at school, that could possibly result in violence.\nMany people wonder how to deal with bullying. Well the best thing to do is go tell a trusted adult or parent if the child is getting bullied. Somethings that may help when you face a bully is to thank them or smile to them. Instead of acting like something is wrong. Its good to be strong but if the bully tries to start a fight don't join them. Charities help anti-bullying.\nThere are also laws against bullying in the UK such as section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.0066177899?! B\n\n\n", "id": "167802", "title": "Bullying"}

Automobile navigation can rely on GPS (Global Positioning System), or it can be DVD- or data-based. GPS-bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission. The GPS receiver catches the signal and calculates the time. The GPS can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well-known radio signal speed.\n\nWhen driving a car with such a GPS receiver, the driver may receive information from a satellite which is above for instance Dover in the south and another one which is above Perth in the north. Then the GPS receiver knows precisely how far it is from Dover and how far it is from Perth. With that \"two\" possible positions of the car at the flat land are precisely determined.\n\nTo know which one of those positions is the right place, the GPS receiver needs a third satellite, for instance above Land's End in the west. With that information, the GPS receiver can also determine elevation. With three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point, but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earth's surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel.\nBut the GPS receiver still needs a fourth satellite, because the GPS receiver needs to know the time very precisely. In between it knows your car position, so that it can calculate the distance from that satellite. Then it knows the time of reception, because that is the time of transmission plus the travel time of the signal.\n\nAt any moment the GPS receiver searches for the strongest satellites, calculates the position and the driving direction and then shows it all on a small screen as a three-dimensional map. With that it also shows the vehicle's driving speed and how far it is to the next junction.\n\nThe driver may add the address where he or she wants to go. The GPS receiver then directs the driver to their destination step-by-step, often using voice prompts. The driver can even be shown where there are traffic jams, speed cameras and traffic lights, and the route can be calculated in such a way that these can be avoided, reducing the time needed for the driver to reach his or her destination.\n\nIf the driver deviates from the indicated route, the GPS receiver can provide new directions to the same destination, by repeating the same calculations.\n\nTo show where the car is with the calculated position, the GPS receiver contains digital maps. Many GPS receivers allow users to add more maps or newer maps to allow for better navigation.\n\nMobile phones are often equipped with GPS receivers, but most require a mobile Internet connection to function. Nokia's HERE Maps are able to store maps for offline use, and because of this, phones that have this app installed can be used as GPS navigation systems as mentioned above.\n", "id": "167849", "title": "Car navigation"}

This curve starts at a point, and then goes around the point, but gets farther and farther away from it. This is different from a circle (which is always at the same distance or an ellipse. A spiral is an \"open\" curve, unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves.\nA two-dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates. There the radius \"r\" is a continuous monotonic function of angle θ (\"theta\"). The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case. With the circle, the function would not be strictly monotonic, but constant.\n\nSome of the more important sorts of two-dimensional spirals include:\n\nFor simple 3-d spirals, a third variable, \"h\" (height), is also a continuous, monotonic function of θ. For example, a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of θ.\n\nThe helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three-dimensional spiral.\n\nFor a helix with thickness, see spring (math).\n\nThe study of spirals in nature have a long history, Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral. Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from \"Helix\" to \"Spirula\" and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells. D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson's \"On Growth and Form\" gives extensive treatment to these spirals. He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis, the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression. In some shell such as \"Nautilus\" and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape. In others it follows a skew path forming a helico-spiral pattern.\n\nThompson also studied spirals occurring in horns, teeth, claws and plants.\n\nSpirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls.\n\nA model for the pattern of florets in the head of a sunflower was proposed by H Vogel. This has the form\nwhere formula_2 is the index number of the floret and formula_3 is a constant scaling factor, and is a form of Fermat's spiral. The angle 137.5° is related to the golden ratio and gives a close packing of florets.\n\nThe spiral also represents infinity. Starting at a single point, and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe. Because of this, some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife.\n\nThe spiral plays an important role in symbolism. It appears in megalithic art, notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor. See also triple spiral.\n\nScholars are still talking about the subject, but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun. Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Chang'an (modern-day Xian).\n\nThe spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent. Because it appears at burial sites across the globe, the spiral most likely represented the \"life-death-rebirth\" cycle. Similarly, the spiral symbolized the sun, as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning, died each night, and was reborn the next morning. \n\nSpirals are also a symbol of hypnosis. This most likely comes from the cliché of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral (One example being Kaa in Disney's \"The Jungle Book\"). They are also used as a symbol of dizziness, where the eyes of a cartoon character, especially in anime and manga, will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed. The spiral is also a prominent symbol in the anime \"Gurren Lagann\", where it symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA, representing biological evolution, and the spiral structure of a galaxy, representing universal evolution.\n", "id": "167867", "title": "Spiral"}

Its administrative center is the city of Uzhhorod. Other major cities within the oblast include Mukachevo, Khust, Berehove and Chop which is home to railroad transport infrastructure.\n\nZakarpattia Oblast was formally established on January 22, 1946 after the annexation of Subcarpathian Rus lands to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Ukrainian independence referendum held in 1991, Zakarpattia Oblast voters were given a separate option on whether or not they favored autonomy for the region. Although a large majority favored autonomy, it was not granted.\n\nZakarpattia Oblast is in the Carpathian Mountains landscape of western Ukraine, and is the only Ukrainian administrative division which borders upon four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. The Carpathian Mountains play a major part in the oblast's economy, making the region an important tourist and travel destination housing many ski and spa resorts.\n\nThe oblast is ranked 23rd by area and 17th by population. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, the population of Zakarpattia Oblast is 1,254,614. Excluding Ukrainians, this total includes people of many different nationalities of which Hungarians, Romanians and Rusyns constitute significant minorities in some of the province's cities, while in others, they form the majority of the population (as in the case of Berehove).\n\nZakarpattia Oblast has a total area of 12,800 km² and is in the Carpathian Mountains region of western Ukraine. It is the only Ukrainian oblast to have boundaries with four countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. On the West it borders the Prešov and Košice Regions of Slovakia and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg Counties of Hungary, on the South—the Satu Mare and Maramureş Counties of Romania, on the East and Northeast—Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, and on the North—Lviv Oblast and the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of Poland.\n\nZakarpattia Oblast mostly consists of mountains and small hills covered with deciduous and coniferous forests, as well as alpine meadows. Mountains cover about 80% of the oblast's area, and cross from North-East to South-East. The Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians, part of which are within Zakarpattia Oblast, were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.\n\nThe largest rivers that flow through the oblast include the Tysa, Borzhava, and the Tereblia. The region's climate is moderate and continental with about 700-1000 millimetres of rainfall per year. The average temperature in summer is +21°С (70°F) and -4°С (25 °F) in winter. With a total height of , Hoverla, part of the Chornohora mountain range, is the tallest point in the oblast. The lowest point, 101 metres above sea level, is in the village of Ruski Heyevtsi in the Uzhhorodskyi Raion.\n\nThe four of the oblast's historical-cultural sites were nominated for the Seven Wonders of Ukraine competition in 2007: Palanok Castle, Museum upon the Chorna River, Mykhailiv Orthodox Church, and the Nevytsky Castle.\n\nZakarpattia was part of Kingdom of Hungary, later Austria-Hungary until the latter's demise at the end of World War I. This region was briefly part of the short-lived West Ukrainian National Republic in 1918 and occupied by Romania at end of that year. It was later recaptured by Hungary in the summer of 1919. Finally, it joined the newly formed Czechoslovakia as \"Subcarpathian Rus\", of which it formed one of the four main regions, the others being Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia.\n\nDuring the World War II German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the southern part of the region was awarded to Hungary under the First Vienna Award in 1938. The remaining portion was constituted as an autonomous region of the short-lived Second Czecho-Slovak Republic. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia on March 15, 1939 and the Slovak declaration of an independent state, Ruthenia declared its independence (Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine) but it was immediately occupied and later annexed by Hungary.\n\nDuring the German occupation of Hungary in 1944, almost the entire Jewish population was deported; few survived the Holocaust. When the Soviet Army crossed the pre-1938 borders of Czechoslovakia in 1944, Soviet authorities refused to allow Czechoslovak governmental officials to resume control over the region, and in June 1945, President Edvard Beneš formally signed a treaty ceding the area to the Soviet Union. It was then incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, it became part of independent Ukraine as \"Zakarpattia Oblast\".\n\nThe province has a unique footnote in history as the only region in the former Soviet Union to have had an American governor: its first governor was Gregory Zatkovich, an American citizen who had earlier emigrated from the region and represented the Rusyn community in the U.S. Zatkovich was appointed governor by Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomáš Masaryk, in 1920 and served for about one year until he resigned over differences regarding the region's autonomy.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine held an independence referendum in which the residents of Zakarpattia were asked about the Zakarpattia Oblast Council's proposal for self rule. About 78% of the oblast's population voted in favor of autonomy, however, it was not granted. There were also propositions of separating from Ukraine to rejoin Czechoslovakia, but after Czechoslovakia's dissolution into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on January 1, 1993, these ideas have been rendered largely moot.\n\nOn October 25, 2008, delegates to the Congress Of Carpathian Ruthenians declared the formation of the Republic of Carpathian Ruthenia. The prosecutor’s office of Zakarpattia region has filed a case against Russian Orthodox Church priest Dmytro Sidor and Yevhen Zhupan, an Our Ukraine deputy of the Zakarpattia regional council and chairman of the People’s Council of Ruthenians, on charges of encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine.\n\nZakarpattia Oblast's local administration is controlled by the Zakarpattia Oblast Council (\"rada\").

It was the third annual event under the Night of Champions name and the ninth annual event under the Vengeance/Night of Champions chronology. Similar to the previous two events, the concept of the show was that every championship in the company would be defended. It featured talent from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. Eight matches were contested on the card.\n\nNight of Champions will have professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers from the \"Raw\", \"Friday Night SmackDown\", and \"ECW on Sci Fi\" brands. Wrestlers will play a villain or a hero. All wrestlers will be from WWE's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands—a storyline division in which WWE employees are assigned to a television program of the same name.\n\nThe main rivalry from SmackDown for Night of Champions is between CM Punk and Jeff Hardy in their battle over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month before the show, at Extreme Rules, Punk used his guaranteed title match he earned by winning the Money in the Bank ladder match against Hardy; he beat him, and won the World Heavyweight title. The two had many confrontations about it which lead to The Bash and a match that saw Punk get disqualified for kicking the referee. Then, Hardy attacked Punk because Hardy thought Punk kicked the referee on purpose. On the July 2 episode of \"Superstars\" fans were told that Punk had suffered a storyline eye injury. Punk's reasoning to Hardy's accusation was that he kicked the referee on accident due to his inability to clearly see Jeff, who he was really trying to kick. To settle the dispute on to who the rightful champion was, SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, announced another match between the two at Night of Champions, which was accepted by both competitors.\n\nRaw will be represented by Randy Orton defending the WWE Championship. After beating Triple H at The Bash, Orton did not have a contender for the championship, so on the June 29 episode of \"Raw\", special guest host of the week, as well as onscreen matchmaker, Batista, said that the title would be defended at Night of Champions against the winner of a single-elimination tournament. The first two matches of the four-person tournament were that night with Triple H beating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and John Cena beating The Miz (Mike Mizanin). Triple H and Cena wrestled each other the next week on \"Raw\", but Orton's allies, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, interfered in the match, attacking both Cena and Triple H. Because of that, it was announced Orton would defend the title against both Triple H and Cena in a triple threat match.\n\n", "id": "168002", "title": "Night of Champions (2009)"}

Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking, space heating, and lighting.\n\nRenewable energy can also contribute to education, by providing electricity to schools. Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children, spend out of school collecting fuel. In addition, the displacement of traditional fuels reduces the health problems from indoor air pollution produced by burning those fuels.\n\nRenewable energy can also contribute to better health by providing energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment.

The war took place from October 6-24, 1973. The war began on the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur in 1973, and it happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan. The attack by Egypt and Syria was a surprise to Israel. Egypt's army entered the Sinai Peninsula, and Syria's army entered the Golan Heights.\n\nThe Sinai and the Golan Heights belonged to Egypt and Syria, but they were occupied by Israel since 1967 during the Six Day War. Syria's aim of the war was to liberate all of the Golan Heights using military means. However, Egypt's Anwar Sadat wanted to use the military to stir diplomatic talks. Sadat achieved this in his limited war.\n\nDuring the first few days of the war, Egypt and Syria scored astounding victories. Israel was shocked by the attack and was on the verge of defeat. The first Israeli counterattacks failed against both Egypt and Syria. However, Israeli attacks later repelled the Syrian forces and pushed them back further into Syria. The IDF came 40 kilometres from Damascus, the capital of Syria. The Iraqi army joined the war with Syria and the Israeli army stopped advancing.\n\nOn the Egyptian front, Israel's attacks against Syria had served as a 'distraction' against the Egyptian offense. This allowed the Egyptian army to dig deeper into Sinai, around 12km, an extra 2km to the original 10km plan. Israel feared a massive military defeat and so called on America for aid. Initially, America refused so Israel threatened to use its nuclear weapons, this threat was enough to persuade President Richard Nixon to send aid to Israel. America conducted \"Operation Nickel Grass\", which gave Israel a resupply of 20 tons of military equipment and ammunition. This proved vital to Israel and it allowed Israel to continue fighting and claim a victory. Henry Kissinger, United State of Secretary at the time, later said to Israel, \"America saved you during the Yom Kippur War.\"\n\nThe Western world expected Israel to win quickly against Egypt because of its better military. The Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defenses and forts on the other side. Israel tried for the next few days to defeat the Egyptians and push them back behind the canal. However the Israelis could not push them back. The United States of America started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel using airplanes to help the Israeli army win the war in Operation Nickel Grass. Syria soon pleaded Egypt to attack Israel to lessen the pressure on it. On October 14, Egypt attacked again, trying to advance even more into the Sinai. Israel defeated the attack, and the Egyptians lost about 250 tanks. After this, the Israelis attacked again. After heavy fighting, they crossed the canal at its center, between two Egyptian armies. They advanced north and south. They kept moving south until the reached the city of Suez, and they trapped a large Egyptian force on the eastern side of the canal, in the Sinai. The Israelis tried to capture Suez, but they were defeated. They also failed to advance north. They reached an area 101 kilometers from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.\n\nThe United Nations passed a resolution in the security council that asked all the countries to bring a temporary stop to the war (called a 'ceasefire'). The Arab countries and Israel agreed. However the ceasefire failed when the Israeli army advanced south to reach Suez. After this, the Soviet leader, Leonid Brezhnev, said to the US president that if the US did not send troops that he would send Soviet troops to the area. This was believed to be a threat and the United States put their military on full nuclear alert. Because of this tension between the United States and the Soviets, Israel agreed to a ceasefire, and the war ended. It was the closest the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had been to nuclear war (and World War III) since the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s. \n\nThe war ended on October 26, 1973. After the war, Egypt and Israel negotiated. They reached an agreement to separate their forces. The agreement led to Israel retreating behind the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces stayed in the Sinai near the canal and did not retreat from the places they captured. There was a large distance between Egyptian and Israeli forces in the Sinai as part of the agreement.\n\nIsrael also held negotiations with Syria and agreed to withdraw from the places the captured in Syria, but they stayed in the Golan Heights. Egypt and Israel kept their negotiations, and in 1979 they signed the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. The treaty brought peace between Israel and Egypt, and Israel retreated from the whole Sinai and returned it to Egypt. The treaty still holds to this day. In the war Israel was called the winner and the Arab countries were called the losers even though no real military victory was ever won; it was a military \"stalemate\" (where no one won and no one lost). However the war agreed to be a political victory for the Arabs, especially for Egypt. Syrians on the other hand do not like to talk about the war as much of it was seen as a defeat rather than a victory or stalemate.\n", "id": "168088", "title": "Yom Kippur War"}

This algorithm is sometimes called the Newton–Raphson method, named after Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson.\n\nThe method uses the derivative of the function in order to find its roots. An initial \"guess value\" for the location of the zero must be made. From this value, a new guess is calculated by this formula:\n\nformula_1\n\nHere x is the initial guess and x is the next guess. The function f (whose zero is being solved for) has the derivative f'.\n\nBy repeatedly applying this formula to the generated guesses (that is by setting the value of x to the formula's output and recomputing), the value of the guesses will approach a zero of the function.\n\nNewton's method can be explained graphically by looking at intersections of tangent lines with the x-axis. First, a line tangent to the f at x is calculated. Next, the intersection between this tangent line and the x-axis is found. Finally, the x-position of this intersection is recorded as the next guess, x.\n\nNewton's method can find a solution quickly if the guess value begins sufficiently near the desired root. However, when the initial guess value is not close, and depending on the function, Newton's method may find the answer slowly or not at all.\n", "id": "168110", "title": "Newton's method"}

It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953. \n\nThe novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic (meaning they live only for pleasure), and reading is against the law because it makes them think. The main character, Guy Montag, has a job as a \"fireman\" (which, in this future, means \"book burner\"). The number \"451\" refers to the temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the books burn when the \"firemen\" burn them \"for the good of humanity\". Written in the early years of the Cold War, the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society.\n\nThe idea began with Bradbury's short story \"Bright Phoenix,\" written in 1947 but first published in the \"Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" in 1963. The original short story was reworked into the novella, \"The Fireman\", and published in the February 1951 issue of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\". The novel was also serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of \"Playboy\" magazine. Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLA's Powell library. His original idea in writing \"Fahrenheit 451\" was to show his great love for books and libraries. He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself.\n\nOver the years, the novel has been subject to various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship; he says that \"Fahrenheit 451\" is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature, which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of \"factoids\", partial information without context, such as Napoleon's birth date alone, without an indication of who he was. \n\nA movie version of the novel was released in 1966, and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely.\n", "id": "168123", "title": "Fahrenheit 451"}

To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down. We can only easily access the card that is on top. When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off. When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack. If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push. \n\nA stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.\n\nThe stack was first proposed in 1955, and then patented in 1957, by the German Friedrich L. Bauer. The same concept was developed independently, at around the same time, by the Australian Charles Leonard Hamblin.\n\nIn modern computer languages, the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just \"push\" and \"pop\". Some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack. Another typical helper operation is \"top\" (also known as \"peek\"), which can return the current top element of the stack without removing it. Another common operation is \"dup,\" which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack.\n\n", "id": "168125", "title": "Stack (data structure)"}

Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of.\n\nThe Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (also known as Fermilab), just east of Batavia, Illinois. It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 6.28 km (3.90 miles) ring to energies of up to 1 TeV, hence its name. The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of $120 million ($ today) and has been regularly upgraded since then. (The 'Energy Doubler', as it was known then, produced its first accelerated beam — 512 GeV — on July 3, 1983.) The \"Main Injector\" was the most substantial addition, built over five years from 1994 at a cost of $290 million. The Tevatron was shut down on September 30, 2011.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider was later built in Switzerland to look for one of those pieces, called the Higgs Boson.

That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC.\n\nThe Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark.

A few MOSFETs amplify or process analog signals. Most are used in digital electronics. \n\nMOSFETs act like valves for electricity. They have one input connection (the \"gate\") which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections (the \"source\" and \"drain\"). Said another way, the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs. Think of a dimmable light switch: the knob itself selects 'ON', 'OFF', or somewhere in between, controlling the brightness of the light. Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch: the switch itself is the \"gate\", the \"source\" is the power coming into the house, and the \"drain\" is the light bulb.\n\nThe name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor. MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal (the \"gate\") on oxide (an insulator which prevents the flow of electricity) on semiconductor (the \"source\" and \"drain\"). FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor. An electric signal is sent to the gate, which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the \"source\" and \"drain\".\n\nAlmost all MOSFETs are used in integrated circuits. As of 2008, it is possible to fit 2,000,000,000 transistors on a single integrated circuit. In 1970, that number was around 2,000.\n\n", "id": "168129", "title": "MOSFET"}

The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries. Many ships carried coal.\n\nIn the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation, and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed.\n\nThe Portishead power stations were coal power stations built near the dock. The first power station was built in 1926. It began making electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation. The power station was made bigger in 1948. \n\nA 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955.\n\nAfter 1949, the power stations became part of the country's electricity industry. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway. The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879. \n\nThe 1st power station closed in 1976, and the 2nd closed in 1982.

She then served RMS \"Queen Elizabeth\" for the last time.\n\nIn 1974, \"Nomadic\" was bought by a private individual and converted into a restaurant on the Seine in Paris, where she remained docked and semi-abandoned after the closure of the restaurant, until she was moved to the port of Le Havre in 2003.\n\nA public appeal for donations to return \"Nomadic\" to the Harland and Wolff shipyard for restoration was organised by Belfast Industrial Heritage (BIH), a non-profit organisation in Northern Ireland in collaboration with enthusiasts through the SaveNomadic.com Appeal.\n\nOn 26 January 2006, SS \"Nomadic\" was purchased at auction in Paris by the Department for Social Development, part of the Northern Ireland Office. She cost £171,320 (the reserve price being £165,000).\n\nSS \"Nomadic\" left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July, and arrived back close to where she was built on 18 July 2006. The vessel was welcomed back by the Social Development Minister David Hanson MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast, Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well wishers. The \"Nomadic\" arrived \"piggy backed\" on a marine transportation barge, which had been contracted from Anchor Marine Transportation Limited.\n\nA study by Belfast City Council has estimated the cost of restoring \"Nomadic\" at £7 million. Belfast Harbour Commissioners have agreed to provide a temporary berth for the ship, and a charitable trust to co-ordinate fundraising for the restoration has been set up.\nNow that the vessel is on the United Kingdom's National Register of Historic Vessels, the project should qualify for a National Lottery grant application, which should greatly enhance existing funds of £60,000 from a public appeal and £100,000 from Belfast City Council.\n\nThe Nomadic Appeal Public Website has now founded the Nomadic Preservation Society.\n\nOn her return to Belfast, SS \"Nomadic\" was moored at Queen's Quay just outside the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and opened with a temporary exhibition. In late 2008 the ship was closed to the public and moved to Barnett's Dock for internal maintenance. It is expected she will soon enter Hamilton Graving Dock for drydocking and complete restoration.\n\nIn January 2009, the company Frazer-Nash has been appointed to manage the Conservation Management Plan. The level of restoration will then be decided.\n\nIt is planned that the restoration of SS \"Nomadic\" will be completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of \"Titanic\" in 2012.\n\n\n", "id": "168238", "title": "SS Nomadic"}

Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavourable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought or reduced food availability. It is most often observed in arthropods, especially insects, and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes.\n\nNot only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions, but once it is started, only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause. This distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation.\n\nActivity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the pupae and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult Monarch butterfly, \"Danaus plexippus\". In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.\n", "id": "168247", "title": "Diapause"}

It is the largest college of the federal University of London. As well as undergraduate teaching, it is one of the largest research universities in the country.\n\nUCL was founded in 1826 as 'University College'. It was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular (non-religious) basis. It admits students regardless of their religious beliefs. UCL was also the first admit women on equal terms with men. University College became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836.\n\nUCL has over 100 departments, institutes and research centres in eight faculties. Its main campus is in the Bloomsbury area of central London. There are also a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London. \n\nIt has grown through mergers. These include the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).\n\nThe original University College was based largely on ideas of Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), a lawyer, social philosopher and free-thinker. Bentham believed in libertarianism, utilitarianism, women's suffrage, and the separation of church and state. These are beliefs of liberalism. The college was unique in that it was secular, and was called \"that Godless institution in Gower Street\".\n\nUniversity College was founded on 11 February 1826, under the name \"London University\", as a secular alternative to the strictly Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It was founded from the beginning as a university, not a college or institute. \n\nHowever, its founders got such strong opposition from the Church of England that it prevented them from getting the Royal Charter needed for the award of degrees. King's College London was specifically founded to provide an Anglican rival to UCL. It was not until 1836, when the latter-day University of London was established, that University College was legally recognised and granted the power to award degrees of the University of London.\n\nUCL has over 7,000 academic and research staff and 980 professors, the highest number of any British university. There are currently 53 Fellows of the Royal Society, 51 Fellows of the British Academy, 15 Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 117 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences amongst UCL academic and research staff.\n\nUCL is a major centre for biomedical research; it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the NHS in England and is a founding member of UCL Partners, the largest academic health science centre in Europe. \n\nFor the period 1999 to 2009 it was the 13th most-cited university in the world (and the most-cited in Europe). There has been at least one Nobel Prize winner from UCL every decade since the establishment of the Nobel Prizes in 1901. There are 29 Nobel Prize winners and three Fields Medalists amongst UCL’s alumni and current and former staff, the most recent being Sir Charles Kao, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009. \n\nUCL is ranked 21st in the world (and 3rd in Europe) in the 2010 \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\", 4th in the world (and 2nd in Europe) in the 2010 \"QS World University Rankings\", and 22nd in the world (and 5th in Europe) in the 2010 \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\".\n\nUCL is a member of the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the Russell Group, and other national and international groups.

The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.\nMost migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have \"auras\" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Most migraines only last about 4 hours. Some can last up to 72 hours.\n\nMigraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called \"episodic migraine\" (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called \"chronic migraine\" (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get \"chronic migraines\" later. Chronic migraine then may \"revert\" or go back to episodic migraine. \n\nThe exact causes of migraines are not known for sure. People used to believe that the main cause of migraines were unusual things in the blood vessels in the brain. However, now people believe that migraines start with a problem in the central nervous system. When this problem is triggered by various factors it sets off a cascade of neurological and biochemical reactions. Among these are reactions that disturb the \"trigeminal nerve\". This nerve is the largest nerve in the head (cranial nerve) and the blood vessels (vascular system) which supply blood to the brain. \n\nThere are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone \"estrogen\" in their body either drops too low or \"fluctuates\" (goes up and down).\n\nThe World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.\n\n\n\n\"Childhood periodic syndromes\" are a group of migraine syndromes that children may have. When a child has one of these child periodic syndromes there is a greater chance that they will get one of the other, more common types of migraines when they are adults. \n\nAbdominal migraine is a kind of migraine which causes a very bad pain in the area of the abdomen, usually around the 'belly-button' which is called the \"periumbilical area\". Abdominal migraine usually affects children starting at about age 7, but it may affect younger children and older children, and it may also sometimes affect adults.<br> \n\nBenign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC for short): (this means harmless dizziness, that happens again and again and happens suddenly) is a medical condition which occurs in children usually starting between two and five years of age; it often disappears by the age of eight. BPVC causes vertigo. \n\nCyclic vomiting syndrome or cyclical vomiting syndrome( CVS), is a medical condition whose main symptoms are nausea and repeated vomiting. CVS happens more often in children but it can occur at any age.\n\nEpisodic migraine (EM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 14 days or less in one month, while chronic migraine (CM) is when a person has migraine symptoms for 15 or more days in one month. When compared to persons with episodic migraine those with CM where less likely to have full-time jobs and had a larger risk of headache-related disability.Persons with CM are almost twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, and/or depression; they also have a 40% greater chance of having heart disease and angina and are 70% more likely to have a history of stroke.\n\nAbout 7.68% of total migraine cases are chronic migraines and about 1% of people in the United States have CM, with a higher rate among females, middle-aged people, and in those households that had the lowest annual income. (The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study)\nAura (from the Greek word for breeze) is the word used to describe a series of neurological symptoms that may begin before an epileptic seizure or a migraine headache. About 15% of people who have a migraine will have the kind with an aura. The symptoms may include visual problems such as \"scotomas\" (losing vision for a short time, seeing zig-zag lines or floating spots etc.), vertigo, a ringing noise in the ears (tinnitus) and problems speaking.\n\nScotoma (came from the Greek word for darkness: \"skotos\"): a \"blind spot\" or area of reduced vision surrounded by a normal visual field. i.e.: A person can see normally except where the scotoma is.Scotomas may affect one or both eyes and be either and be either \"absolute\" where nothing can be seen within the scotoma or, \"relative\" with some ability to see within the area of the scotoma. \n\nScotomas may also have different patterns and shapes like the \"fortification\" scotoma; it is called fortification because it looks like the outline of an old fort. Scotomas can start of small and then get bigger, move around to different parts of a person's visual field, and they can also look like flickering lights. \n\nIn medicine a \"factor\" is a substance, a condition or an activity, or a lack thereof that increases the chance of a certain outcome or condition happening. If it increases the chance of something unhealthy it is a \"risk factor\". A \"trigger factor\" or 'trigger' for short is a factor that may cause an activity or the signs and/or symptoms of a medical condition to begin.<br><br>\n\nThere are no specific tests to diagnose migraine but a doctor may use different tests to rule out other causes for a person's symptoms. The diagnosis of migraine is a \"clinical diagnosis\" which means it is based upon a person's \"medical history\" that a person reports to the doctor.The medical history for a possible migraine diagnosis which can be called the \"headache history\" includes information such as:\n\n\"Differential diagnoses\" are different medical disorders which may cause the same symptoms. Before a doctor makes a \"final diagnosis\", which means they are sure of what medical disorder is causing the problem, they think of what other medical conditions have the same or almost the same symptoms, and make sure it's not one of them.\n\nOften, having one medical condition makes it more likely a person will also have one or more other medical or psychiatric disorders. These other disorders are the \"comorbid disorders\" or \"comorbidities\". There are various comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions associated with migraines. The treatment and \"prognosis\" (if a disease gets better, worse or stays the same over time) of migraine is affected by the comorbid disorders which may be present and/or the chance of getting comorbid disorders.<br>\n\nComorbid psychiatric conditions\n\nIn medicine, a complication is a problem that happens because of, a procedure (like surgery), treatment (like medication), or illness (like migraines).\n\nIn medicine \"epidemiology\" is the study of what causes diseases and medical conditions, how often they happen, where they happen and who they happen to.\n\nMigraine is more common among boys than girls until the beginning of puberty when girls start getting migraines more often than boys. By the later part of the teenage years girls get migraines almost twice as much as boys do. The amount of people who get migraines is highest between the ages of 25 to 55 years in both men and women, after which, the risk of getting migraines get lower as a person gets older. \n\nBetween 65-75% of adult migraine sufferers are women and of these women, about two-thirds have menstrual migraines. Migraines are more common in people who make less money, there may be different reasons why such as stress.\n\nAbout two-thirds of migraines are migraines without aura and the remaining one-third of cases are migraine with aura.\nSymptoms that mimic those of migraines have been recorded in various cultures throughout written history. The first known mention was found on cuneiform tablets from Babylonia dating to 2000-1880 B.C.E.A treatment for migraine can be found in the \"Ebers Papyrus\", an Ancient Egyptian medical text named after George Ebers, the German Eygptologist who discovered them. In the ancient text dated to 1552 B.C.E. migraine is refereed to as \"suffering in half the head\". \nThe Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia's description of a type of headache he dubbed \"heterocrania\" is considered a description of migraine.\n", "id": "168333", "title": "Migraine"}

In 1715 Prussia and Hannover joined the war against Sweden. The King of Hannover was also King George II of Great Britain.\n\nAfter the coalition attacked them, Sweden invaded Russia in 1709 which was not a good idea. The Russian Army retreated so the Swedish Army had to chase them. When winter came it was the coldest winter that Europe had had in a hundred years and half of the Swedish soldiers died in the cold. Eventually the Swedish army caught up to the Russian army and they had a battle, called the battle of Poltava. Russia won the battle but most of the Swedish soldiers, including king Charles XII of Sweden, escaped and went to the Ottoman Empire. Peter didn't like this so he declard war on the Ottoman Empire. He lost and had to give the town of Azov back to the Ottomans.\n\nCharles XII left the Ottoman Empire in 1714 and went to Stralsund in Pomerania which was owned by Sweden at the time but was under siege. Charles escaped back to Sweden just before the people in Stralsund surrendered. Then he invaded Norway (which was owned by Denmark at the time.) and was shot and killed there. With their king gone, the Swedish soldiers left Norway and went back to Sweden. On the way back many soldiers died.\n\nWhen all that was happening Russia had been invading Sweden. Russia conquered Estonia, Livonia and Ingria. By the time the remaining soldiers had come back from Norway, Russia had completely conquered Finland. Sweden still didn't want peace though, because they would have to give lots of land to Russia. Russia used a newly made fleet of ships to attack and raid the Swedish Coast and Sweden would still not give up. Eventually the Russian and Swedish ships came together in the Battle of Grengam. Both sides thought they had won the battle so no treaty was signed until the Russians continued using their boats to damage the Swedish coast. Finally Sweden gave up in 1721. Sweden had made peace with Denmark in 1720 and in 1721 Sweden signed the treaty of Nystad.\n\nIn the Treaty of Nystad Sweden had to give land to other countries. Sweden had to give Estonia, Livonia and Ingria to Russia but could keep Finland. Sweden also signed other treaties. These were the treaty of Stockholm where Sweden gave Prussia Swedish Pomerania and the treaty of Fredericksborg where Sweden had to pay Denmark-Norway money for the damage the war had done.\n\nThis war was significant because it allowed Russia to become the dominant power in Northeastern Europe, instead of Sweden.\n", "id": "168358", "title": "Great Northern War"}

They are good conductors of heat. Gasses are also good conductors of heat. \n\nThermal resistivity is the opposite of thermal conductivity. This means not conducting heat much. Materials with high resistivity are called \"thermal insulators\" and are used in clothing, thermoses, home insulation, and cars to keep people warm or in refrigerators, freezers, and thermoses to keep things cold. \n\nThermal conductivity is often represented by the Greek letter \"kappa\", formula_1. The units of thermal conductivity are watts per meter-kelvin. Watts are a measure of power, meters are a measure of length, and kelvins are a measure of temperature. From the units, we can see that thermal conductivity is a measure of how much power moves through a distance due to a temperature difference.\n\nSome great thermal insulators are:\nVacuum, Aerogel, Polyurethane\n\nSome great thermal conductors are:\nSilver, Copper, Diamond\n\nSilver is one of the most thermally conductive materials (and is relatively common), and because of this there are some cool experiments you can do with silver that show extremely well how thermal conduction works.\n\nOne example is when you put 2 spoons in boiling water, one spoon is steel and the other is silver. When you take the spoons out of the boiling water, the silver spoon is hotter than the steel spoon. The reason for this is that silver conducts heat better than steel. The silver spoon will also cool off faster because of this, as it is better at releasing heat.\n\nAnother interesting example of silver's amazing thermally conductive properties is if you put different materials on ice cubes. Putting an iron washer will just sit there and slowly become colder, putting a copper penny on will melt through the ice cube and become colder faster, and putting a silver dime, spoon, or ring on the ice cube will sink into it almost as though the ice cube were made of thick syrup, and the silver will become ice cold almost instantly. Again, this is because the silver is really good at drawing heat from the air and giving it to the ice cube. Copper is also good at this, but not as much as silver.\n", "id": "168367", "title": "Thermal conductivity"}

Offa died in 796 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith, who reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf of Mercia became king.\n\nOffa was the son of Thingfrith, a descendant of Eowa of Mercia. Eowa was a king of Mercia who ruled along with his more famous brother Penda of Mercia. In 757 the king of Mercia,Athelbald, was murdered. There was a short civil war between others claiming the throne. An ealdorman named Beornred the throne of Mercia. But Offa drove him out of Mercia and became king himself that same year. The Athelbald had formed fell apart when Offa came to power. Offa had very little power outside of Mercia for the first several years of his reign. \n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Offa for the years between 757—777. No Mercian chronicles from this time period have survived. are the only records that give any idea of Offa's power outside of Mercia. But he proved to be ruthless, bold and creative in bringing Kent, Sussex and Essex under his control. Aethelbert the king of Kent was apparently under Offa's influence before he died in 762. In 794 another Aethelbert, a king in East Anglia was beheaded at Offa's command. When Egbert of Wessex made a bid for the throne of Wessex in 786 Offa had him banished from England. He made Beorhtric king of Wessex instead. Egbert was welcomed at the court of Charlemagne for at least three years. In charters Offa issued in Kent, East Anglia, Sussex and Middlesex he simply used the style \"Rex Merciorum\" (Latin for king of Mercia). Only in three church charters does he expand his title to indicate he is overlord of all of England. \nOffa had diplomatic relations with Charlemagne. He was one of the few Anglo-Saxon monarchs to have dealings with continental rulers. Letters and presents were exchanged. But when Offa sought a marriage of his son to one of Charlemagne's daughters, relations were quickly cut off. Charlemagne had all Frankish ports closed to British ships. Offa, very involved in church affairs, presided over church councils personally in 786-7. In 787 he convinced the pope to create the position of archbishop of Lichfield in Mercia. He wanted his own archbishop who was closer at hand than the Archbishop of Canterbury. He reorganized the of his kingdom.

In the 1960s Peter Higgs was the first person to express the idea. On 14 March 2013, scientists at CERN tentatively confirm that they have found the particle.\n\nIt is one of the 17 particles in the Standard Model. The Higgs particle is a boson. Bosons are thought to be particles which are responsible for all physical forces. Other known bosons are the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. Scientists do not yet know how to combine gravity with the Standard Model. \n\nThe Higgs field is a fundamental field of crucial importance to particle physics theory. Unlike other known fields such as the electromagnetic field, the Higgs field takes a non-zero constant value almost everywhere. The question of the Higgs field's existence has been the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics and, according to some, \"the central problem in particle physics\".\n\nIt is difficult to detect the Higgs Boson. Due to their massive size (compared with other particles) it needs vast amounts of energy to create them. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN was built mainly for this. It accelerates two sets of particles to almost light speed (travelling in opposite directions), before setting them on a path to collide with each other.\n\nEach collision produces a flurry of new particles which are detected by detectors around the point where they collide. There is still only a very small chance, one in 10 billion, of a Higgs Boson appearing and being detected. To find the few collisions with evidence of the Higgs boson, the LHC smashes together trillions of particles, and supercomputers sift through a massive amount of data.\n\nHiggs bosons obey the conservation of energy law, which states that no energy is created or destroyed, but instead it is transferred. First, the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field. This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement. After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field, it is slowed down. This slowing reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson. However, this energy is not destroyed. Instead, the energy is converted into mass-energy, which is normal mass that comes from energy. The mass created is what we call a Higgs boson. The amount of mass created comes from Einstein's famous equation E=mc, which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy (for example, 1 kg of mass is equivalent to almost 90 quadrillion joules of energy—the same amount of energy used by the entire world in roughly an hour and a quarter in 2008). Since the amount of mass-energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic-energy that the gauge boson lost by being slowed, energy is conserved.\n\nHiggs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories. The physicist Leon Lederman called it the \"God particle\" in 1993.\n\nOn 12 December 2011, the two teams at the Large Hadron Collider looking for the \"Higgs Boson\", ATLAS and CMS, announced that they had finally seen results which could suggest the \"Higgs Boson\" particle existed; however, they did not know for certain if this was true.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, the teams at the Large Hadron Collider declared that they had discovered a particle which they think is the Higgs boson.\n\nOn 14 March 2013 the teams had done much more testing, and announced that they now think the new particle was a Higgs boson.\n\n", "id": "168396", "title": "Higgs boson"}

It is a series that is used to create an estimate (guess) of what a function looks like. There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series.\n\nThe theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane (x- and y-axes), then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point. This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together. The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum.\n\nIn mathematics, a Taylor series shows a function as the sum of an . The sum's terms are taken from the function's derivatives. Taylor series come from Taylor's theorem. \n\nThe Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea first came up with the idea of this series. The paradox called \"\" was the result. He believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result.\n\nAnother Greek philosopher, Aristotle, came up with an answer to the philosophical question. It was Archimedes, however, who came up with a mathematical solution using his method of exhaustion. He was able to prove that when something is split up into an infinite number of tiny pieces, they will still add up to a single whole when all of them are added back together. The ancient Chinese mathematician Liu Hui proved the same thing several hundred years later.\n\nThe earliest known examples of the Taylor series are the work of Mādhava of Sañgamāgrama in India in the 1300s. Later Indian mathematicians wrote about his work with the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. None of Mādhava's writings or records still exist today. Other mathematicians based their work on Mādhava's discoveries and worked more with these series until the 1500s.\n\nJames Gregory, a Scottish mathematician, worked in this area in the 1600s. Gregory studied the Taylor series and published several Maclaurin series. In 1715, Brook Taylor discovered a general method for applying the series to all functions. (All of the previous research showed how to apply the method to only specific functions.) Colin Maclaurin published a special case of the Taylor series in the 1700s. This series, which is based around zero, is called the \"Maclaurin series\".\n\nA Taylor series can be used to describe any function \"ƒ\"(\"x\") that is a smooth function (or, in mathematical terms, \"infinitely differentiable.\") The function \"ƒ\" can be either real or complex. The Taylor series is then used to describe what the function looks like in the neighborhood of some number \"a\".\n\nThis Taylor series, written as a power series, looks like:\n\nThis formula can also be written in sigma notation as:\n\nHere \"n\"! is the factorial of \"n\". \"ƒ\"(\"a\") is the \"n\"th derivative of \"ƒ\" at the point \"a\". formula_3 is a number in the function's domain. If the Taylor Series of a function is equal to that function, the function is called an \"analytic function.\"\n\nWhen formula_4, the function is called a Maclaurin series.

He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors in history. Many people say that he is the best ever. The famous Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini said he was the world's best conductor other than himself.\n\nFurtwängler was especially famous for conducting the music of famous German composers. His performances of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner are very well known and loved by many people.\n\nFurtwängler was born on January, 25, 1886 in Berlin, Germany. He grew up in Munich, where his father was an archaeologist and professor. He started learning about music when he was very young. He learned to play the piano and was very talented. He also began writing music. He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old. He kept writing music for the rest of his life, but his pieces never became very famous.\n\nFurtwängler first started conducting as a young man. He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music. However, he quickly became famous for conducting the music of others. The very first piece he conducted in public was the 9th Symphony of Bruckner. He conducted many orchestras before he finally became the leader of the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922. Later, he also had many other important conducting jobs. The most important was the director of the Bayreuth Festival, a very famous German music festival.\n\nWhen the Nazis took over Germany in the 1930s, Furtwängler was in an awkward position. He wanted to conduct some kinds of music that the Nazis did not like. He left some of his conducting jobs in protest when they did not let him perform. In 1936 he almost left Germany to live in the United States, where the New York Philharmonic Orchestra wanted him to conduct. However, the Nazis still thought he was a good conductor, and they kept him in Germany. He also wanted to stay to protect the German music from the Nazis. People in the United States did not like him for staying, even though he did not really like the Nazis.\n\nDuring World War II Furtwängler continued to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. He gave many very famous concerts during this time. But towards the end of the war, the Nazis became unhappy with him. He fled from Germany in 1945 and lived in Switzerland for several years. He did not conduct again for two years.\n\nAfter the war, Furtwängler was still in a difficult position. The Allies thought that he had been a Nazi supporter because he had stayed in Germany. They put him on trial, but finally decided he was innocent. He was allowed to go back to conducting in 1947. Even though he was innocent, people in the US still did not like him. He was going to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, but he was not allowed to because people got angry about it.\n\nFurtwängler gave many successful concerts after the war. He still conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and other famous orchestras in Europe. Furtwängler gave the most famous concert of his career in 1951. That year, he conducted Beethoven's 9th Symphony at the Bayreuth Festival. It was the first time that the festival had happened since the end of the war, six years before. Many people say that this concert was the greatest musical concert in history. Furtwängler finally died in 1954, when he was 68 years old.\n\nFurtwängler had a very unusual way of conducting. His movements with the baton were very awkward and jerky. Some people said he looked \"like a puppet on a string\" when he conducted. He liked to slow down and speed up the music very often. Furtwängler believed that there was more to music than just the notes on the score. He felt it was the performer's job to make each performance something special. This meant that he often played the same piece in very different ways at different concerts. Even when he changed the way he played a piece, though, the music was thought to be very beautiful. He did not like conductors who just played the notes on the page without doing anything special with the music.\n\nAs a younger conductor, Furtwängler played music by many different composers. However, as he got older, he usually only played music by the great German composers. Some of his favorites were Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner.\n\nFurtwängler did not make many recordings in studios. Recording technology was still very new at the time and did not work well for recording long classical pieces at first. However, many of Furtwängler's concerts were recorded, especially during and after World War II. Today people think these are some of the best recordings of all time. His famous concert at Bayreuth in 1951 is one of these concert recordings.\n\n", "id": "168399", "title": "Wilhelm Furtwängler"}

He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time. Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 until 1848. In this time, he got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon that forced Austria to fight on the French side. Then he helped build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next hundred years.\n\nIn 1809, when Metternich became Foreign Minister, Napoleon had control of most of Europe. France had taken over some of the closest countries directly. In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia Napoleon forced them to sign treaties saying they would fight on his side in wars. Metternich thought this was bad for Austria. When Napoleon declared war and raised a huge army for the French invasion of Russia, Metternich told the Russians that Austria would not attack, only defend. Napoleon lost badly in Russia, and Metternich used that chance to get out of the treaty.\n\nIn 1814, troops of the Quadruple Alliance (Prussia, Russia, Austria and Great Britain) had entered France, and Napoleon had lost the war. For the next year, diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide how things were going to be now that Napoleon was gone. Metternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power, which means that no country is strong enough to beat all the other countries. To make sure this happened, he made some countries stronger, so that other countries (especially France) would have to think twice about going to war. Some of these changes were that he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the Netherlands, he grouped over 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries, and he grouped together some countries in what we call Italy today.\n\nAfter making this new order, Metternich also did a lot to make sure it stayed that way. For example, he talked Czar Alexander I out of sending troops into Greece. Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there who were rebelling against the Muslim Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire was weak by that time, and Alexander would most likely have won. Metternich was afraid that if Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Empire would fall apart, and all the powerful countries of Europe would start fighting to get the Ottoman Empire's land. This would mess up Metternich's balance. Also, he was afraid that Russia would get too big and be too powerful. So Metternich convinced the czar that if he attacked now, the Ottoman Empire would fall apart before the czar was ready to take it for himself, and that Great Britain and France would get most of it. And so Alexander agreed to try and keep the Ottoman Empire going, so that someday Russia could take all of it.\n\nMetternich kept peace in Europe for a long time. But there were still some revolts in Europe, and finally in 1848 a bunch of revolts happened at the same time. One of them was in Austria, and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office. After he was gone, Otto von Bismarck, in Prussia, managed to get too powerful, and took over the German Confederation and made one big German country, which still exists today. Having one big Germany, though, messed up Metternich's balance, and helped cause World War I.\n", "id": "168454", "title": "Klemens Wenzel von Metternich"}

After the Holy Roman Empire fell, Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over, which it had already done once under Napoleon. So the Congress combined all those little countries into 39 larger countries, which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe. \n\nThe problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong, or they'd start taking over other countries. So they put the 39 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries, but they agreed to help defend each other, and in some ways acted like one big country. But the Confederation was never strong enough to be able to attack another country. \n\nThe German Confederation lasted until 1866, when the members fought each other. The winners formed a new North German Confederation.

The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma, whereas the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber.\n\nA dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse, which is a very narrow gap between the two cells. When electrical impulses (action potentials) reach the end of an axon, the signal must pass over a synapse again. There are two types of synapse: chemical or electrical. If it's a chemical synapse, the active potential triggers the release of special chemicals called neurotransmitters from the axon. These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite, where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell.\n\nThe movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current, which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal. If the current is positively charged, it will make the soma (which is normally negatively charged compared to its surroundings) become more positive. If the current is negatively charged, then it will make the soma even more negative. If a strong enough positive charge builds up in the soma quickly enough (caused by the dendrites receiving lots of signals from axons), then it will set off a chain reaction in a part of the soma called the axon hillock. The axon hillock is the place where the soma connects to the axon. The chain reaction that begins in the axon hillock is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse.\n", "id": "168493", "title": "Dendrite"}

It was released in 20007. It tells the story of one of the massacres committed by the newly formed Israeli army during Operation Hiram. The massacres were committed in Eilaboun, a village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the Sea of Galilee. In the Eilabun massacre, fourteen men were killed, and twelve of them were executed. The village people were expelled to Lebanon and became refugees for a few months. The villagers eventually managed to return secretly.\n\nThe movie starts with Melia Zreiq (an old woman from Eilaboun) saying\n\n“I hope God will bring peace to this land, and let the peoples live together - a good life. I hope there will be peace.”\n\nIlan pappe takes about Plan Dalet, a plan that David Ben-Gurion and the Haganah leaders in Palestine worked out during autumn 1947 to spring 1948, and explains the details of the plan, and how was it performed. In October 30th, 1948, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun at approximately 5 AM. They then forced the people of Eilaboun together in the main square of the village. They chose seventeen young men. Five of them were taken as human shield, and the rest of the twelve were killed, each in a different location. This all happened after the expulsion of the rest of the village to Lebanon, where they became refugees after a five days forced march to Lebanon. After a UN peace keeper observed and reported Israel was forced to allow the people back.\n\nThat same night, the Israeli army entered Eilaboun, a then Christian village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee. Most of the villagers were hiding in the two village churches.\n\nThe soldiers ordered the people to gather in the village square, while going out of the Catholic Church the soldiers shot at the people killing an old man, making him the first victim. The soldiers chose seventeen men, and ordered the village to walk to Maghar, a village five kilometers to the north of Eilaboun. Shortly after the people left the village, the soldiers executed twelve of the young men, and five were taking to drive an army vehicle as human shields and later sent to a prisoners of war camp. The Israeli army had looted Eilaboun but left the houses.\n\nWhen the villagers reached Maghar, the soldiers ordered them to continue to Kafr 'Inan, where the near Kafr Inan another man was killed, making the number of victims fourten. Kafr 'Inan and Eilaboun were both expelled to Farradiyya, a nearby village. The Israeli soldiers gathered the people of Eilaboun, Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya (al-Farradiyya), looted the people and took all worthy. They spent the night in Farradiyya. In the morning the Israeli soldiers separated the women, children and the old from the men. The young men from the three villages were sent to prisoner of war camps. The women, children and the old of the three villages were marched to Mirun where they spent three nights without any food or water. At Mirun, the Israelis put everyone in two cattle trucks, and took them to Rmeish (in Lebanon). Kafr 'Inan and Farradiyya were later razed to the ground by the Israeli army.\n\nAbout 52 villagers were left in the village, mainly old people and children. The priests complained about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return. Following a UN investigation and pressure activated by the Vatican, the villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely. After 6 months from the massacre most of the villagers managed to come back from Lebanon, and all the men were released from the prisoners of war camps.\n\nThe movie won the Al-Awda award in 2008, and was screened in many festivals and events as:\n\n", "id": "168527", "title": "The Sons of Eilaboun"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=168539", "text": "Dengue fever\n\nDengue fever (pronounced \"DEN-gay\") is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking. \n\nMost people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.\n\nThere is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment or cure for dengue fever. Doctors can only provide \"supportive care,\" which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.\n\nSince the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.\n\nMost people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever). About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them. \n\nAfter a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days.\n\nOften, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold. However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.\n\nDengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.\n\nIn the \"febrile stage\", people with dengue usually have a high fever. (\"Febrile\" means that a person has a fever.) The fever is often over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Sometimes the fever gets better, and then comes back.\n\nDuring the febrile stage, people may also have:\nThe febrile stage usually lasts 2 to 7 days. This stage ends when a person's high fever is gone.\n\nIn about 5% of people with dengue fever, the disease goes into a \"critical stage\" next. (\"Critical\" means \"very dangerous.\") The critical phase usually lasts 1 to 2 days. \n\nDuring this stage, plasma (the liquid part of blood) leaks out of the body's small blood vessels. The plasma can build up in the chest and abdomen. This is a serious problem for a few reasons.\n\nPlasma carries blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things to the whole body. Every part of the body needs these things to survive. If too much plasma leaks out of the blood vessels, there will not be enough left to carry these things to the body's most important organs. Without these things, the organs cannot work normally. This is called dengue shock syndrome.\n\nPlasma also carries platelets, which help the blood clot (they help stop bleeding). If a person does not have enough platelets, they can have dangerous bleeding. With dengue fever, this bleeding usually happens in the gastrointestinal tract. When a person has bleeding, leaking plasma, and not enough platelets, they have dengue hemorrhagic fever. (\"Hemorrhage\" means \"dangerous bleeding.\")\n\nIn the recovery stage, the plasma that leaked out of the blood vessels is taken back up into the bloodstream. This stage usually lasts 2 to 3 days. \n\nDuring this stage, people with dengue often feel much better. (\"Recovery\" means \"getting better.\") However, they can have very bad itching and a slow heart rate. \n\nSerious problems can also happen during the recovery stage. If a person's body takes too much fluid back up into the bloodstream, it can cause \"fluid overload.\" This can cause fluid to build up in the lungs, which causes breathing problems. Fluid overload can also cause seizures or an altered mental status (changes in a person's thinking and behavior).\n\nEvery once in a while, dengue can affect other systems in the body. For example, dengue can cause:\n\nDengue fever is caused by the dengue virus. In the scientific system that classifies viruses, the dengue virus is part of the family \"Flaviviridae\" and the genus \"Flavivirus\". Other viruses that belong to the same family and can make humans sick include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Most of these viruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.\n\nDengue virus is spread mostly by mosquitoes from the \"Aedes\" genus, especially the \"Aedes aegypti\" species of mosquito. \"Aides aegypti\" is the most likely type of mosquito to spread dengue, because it likes to live close to humans and feed off of people instead of animals. A person can get the dengue virus from just one mosquito bite.\n\nSometimes, mosquitoes can also get dengue from humans. If a female mosquito bites someone with dengue, the mosquito may get the dengue virus from the person's blood. After about 8 to 10 days, the virus spreads to the mosquito's salivary glands, which make saliva (or \"spit\"). Now the mosquito will make saliva that is infected with the dengue virus. When the mosquito bites a human, its infected saliva goes into the human and can give that person dengue. \n\nA person can also get the dengue virus if they get a blood transfusion or organ donation from someone who has the virus. In some countries where dengue is common, like Singapore, between 1.6 and 6 blood transfusions out of every 10,000 spread dengue. \n\nThe dengue virus can also be spread from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy, or when the child is born. This is called vertical transmission.\n\nDengue is usually not spread in any other ways.\n\nOnce a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, the virus attaches to and enters the person's white blood cells. (The white blood cells are part of the immune system, which defends the body by fighting off threats, like infections.) As the white blood cells move around the body, the virus makes copies of itself. The white blood cells react by making many special proteins, like interferon, which tell the immune system to work harder because there is a threat in the body. These proteins cause the fever, flu-like symptoms, and severe pains that happen with dengue.\n\nIf a person has a bad infection, the virus makes copies of itself much more quickly inside the body. Because there is a lot more of the virus, it can affect many more organs (like the liver and the bone marrow). The virus can stop the bone marrow from making platelets normally. This makes very bad bleeding much more likely to happen.\n\nBabies and young children with dengue are more likely than adults to become very sick. Women are more likely than men to get very sick. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic (long-lasting) diseases, like diabetes and asthma.\n\nThere are four different types of the dengue virus. Once a person has had one type of the virus, he usually is protected from that type for the rest of his life. However, he will only be protected against the other three types of the virus for a short time. If he later gets one of those three types of the virus, he will be more likely to have serious problems, like dengue shock syndrome or dengue hemorrhagic fever.\n\nUsually, doctors diagnose dengue by examining the infected person and realizing that their symptoms match dengue. However, when dengue is in its early stages, it can be difficult to tell the difference between this disease and other infections caused by viruses. \n\nThe World Health Organization says that a person probably has dengue if:\nThe World Health Organization also says that in areas where dengue is common, any warning signs, plus a fever, usually signal that a person has dengue fever.\n\nSome blood tests show changes when a person has dengue fever. The earliest change is a low number of white blood cells in the blood. A low number of platelets can also signal dengue. Special blood tests can look for the dengue virus itself; the virus's nucleic acids; or the antibodies that the immune system makes to fight off the virus. However, these special tests are expensive. Also, in many areas where dengue is common, most doctors and clinics do not have laboratories for blood tests or special machines.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell the difference between dengue fever and chikungunya. Chikungunya is a similar viral infection that has many of the same symptoms of dengue, and happens in the same parts of the world. Dengue can also have some of the same symptoms as other diseases, like malaria, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease. Often, before a person is diagnosed with dengue, their doctor will do tests to make sure they do not actually have one of these diseases instead.\n\nIn 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) created a system for describing the different types of dengue fever. Eventually, the WHO decided that this old way of dividing dengue needed to be simpler. It also decided that not everyone with dengue fever fit into the old categories. \n\nIn 2009, the WHO changed its system for classifying (dividing) dengue fever. However, the older system often is still used.\n\nThe WHO's old system divided dengue into three categories:\n\nIn 2009, the WHO created a simpler system which divided dengue fever into two types: \n\nThere are no vaccines that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. The best ways to prevent dengue are to protect people from mosquito bites and to control the mosquito population.\n\nThe best way to control the \"A. aegypti\" mosquito is to get rid of its habitats (the places it lives). The best way to do this is to get rid of areas with standing water (water that does not move). Mosquitoes like standing water and often lay eggs there. Governments can use insecticides or biological control agents to control mosquitoes in these areas. People should empty out open containers of water (so that mosquitoes cannot lay eggs in them). To prevent getting bitten by mosquitoes, people can: \n\nThe WHO suggests a program for preventing dengue (called an \"Integrated Vector Control\" program) that includes five different parts: \n\nThere are no specific treatments for dengue fever. No known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) will kill the dengue virus. Health workers can give \"supportive treatment\" - treat dengue's symptoms to try to make patients feel better.\nDifferent people need different treatments, depending on their symptoms. Some people can get better just by drinking fluids at home, and checking with their doctor to make sure they are getting better. \n\nTreating dehydration is very important. Sometimes, people are so dehydrated that they need intravenous fluids - fluids given through a needle placed into a vein. Usually, people only need intravenous fluids for a day or two.\n\nDoctors can give medicines like acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and aspirin should not be used because they make bleeding more likely. \n\nPeople with bad dengue may need blood transfusions. Having extra blood will help a person if their blood pressure is getting very low (like it does in dengue shock syndrome) or if they do not have enough red blood cells in their blood (because they are bleeding from dengue hemorrhagic fever).\n\nWhen people reach the recovery stage of dengue, doctors usually stop giving intravenous fluids to prevent fluid overload (having too much fluid in the body). If a person gets fluid overload, doctors can give a type of medication called a diuretic, which will make the patient urinate out the extra fluid.\n\nMost people with dengue recover and don't have any problems afterward. \n\nWithout treatment, 1% to 5% of infected people (1 to 5 out of every 100) die from dengue. With good treatment, less than 1% die. However, 26% of people with severe dengue die.\n\nDengue is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, it infects 50 to 100 million people around the world. It also causes half a million hospitalizations and about 12,500 to 25,000 deaths around the world each year. However, the World Health Organization says that dengue fever is not taken as seriously as it should be. It calls dengue one of 16 \"neglected tropical diseases\" - diseases which do not get enough attention. In every million people, dengue causes about 1600 years of life to be lost. This is about the same as other tropical and deadly diseases, like tuberculosis. However, the WHO says the neglected tropical diseases, like dengue, do not get the attention and money that is needed to find treatments and cures.\n\nDengue is becoming much more common around the world. It is the most common viral disease that is spread by arthropods. In 2010, dengue was 30 times more common than it was in 1960. Scientists think dengue may be getting more common because:\nDengue happens most around the equator. 2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens. 70% of these people live in Asia and the Pacific. In the United States, 2.9% to 8% of people who come back from traveling in areas where dengue happens, and have a fever, were infected while traveling. In this group of people, dengue is the second most common infection to be diagnosed, after malaria.\n\nDengue fever is probably a very old disease. An ancient Chinese medical encyclopedia from the Jin Dynasty (which existed from 265 to 420 AD) talked about a person who probably had dengue. The book talked about a \"water poison\" that had to do with flying insects. \n\nWritten records from the 17th century talk about what may have been epidemics of dengue (where the disease spread very quickly in a short time). The most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780. These reports talk about an epidemic that spread across Asia, Africa, and North America. From that time until 1940, there were not many more epidemics.\n\nIn 1906, scientists proved that people were getting infections from \"Aedes\" mosquitoes. In 1907, scientists showed that a virus causes dengue. This was just the second disease that was shown to be caused by a virus. (The first was yellow fever.) John Burton Cleland and Joseph Franklin Siler kept studying the dengue virus, and figured out the basics of how the virus spreads.\n\nDengue began to spread much more quickly during and after World War II. Different types of dengue also spread to new areas. For the first time, people started to get dengue hemorrhagic fever. The first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever happened in the Philippines in 1953. By the 1970s, dengue hemorrhagic fever had become a major cause of death in children. It also spread to the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in Central America and South America in 1981.\n\nIt is not clear where the word \"dengue\" came from. Some people think that it comes from the Swahili phrase \"Ka-dinga pepo\". This phrase talks about the disease being caused by an evil spirit. The Swahili word \"dinga\" is thought to come from the Spanish word \"dengue\", which means \"careful.\" That word may have been used to describe a person having bone pain from dengue fever; that pain would make the person walk carefully. However, it is also possible that the Spanish word came from the Swahili word, and not the other way around.\n\nOther people think that the name \"dengue\" comes from the West Indies. In the West Indies, slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like \"a dandy.\" Because of this, the disease was also called \"dandy fever.\"\n\nThe name \"breakbone fever\" was first used by Benjamin Rush, a doctor and United States \"Founding Father.\" In 1789, Rush used the name \"breakbone fever\" in a report about the 1780 dengue outbreak in Philadelphia. In his official report, Rush mostly used the more formal name \"bilious remitting fever\". \n\nThe term \"dengue fever\" was not commonly used until after 1828. Before that, different people used different names for the disease. For example, dengue was also called \"breakheart fever\" and \"la dengue.\" Other names were also used for severe dengue: for example, \"infectious thrombocytopenic purpura\", \"Philippine,\" \"Thai,\" and \"Singapore hemorrhagic fever.\"\n\nScientists keep doing research on ways to prevent and treat dengue. People are also working on controlling mosquitoes, creating a vaccine, and creating drugs to fight the virus.\n\nMany simple things have been done to control mosquitoes. Some of these things have worked. For example, guppies (\"Poecilia reticulata\") or copepods can be put in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae (eggs).\n\nScientists also keep working on creating antiviral drugs to treat attacks of dengue fever and keep people from getting severe complications. They are also working on figuring out how the virus's proteins are structured. This may help them create medications that work well for dengue.\n\n", "id": "168539", "title": "Dengue fever"}

The quantity (v/c) is often labeled formula_2 (beta) and so the above equation can be rewritten:\n\nClassical relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50 mph while running at 5 mph, the ball travels 55 mph. Of course, the ball still moves away from you at 50 mph, so if one were to ask you, you \"saw\" the ball traveling 50 mph. Meanwhile, your friend, Rory saw that you happened to be running at 5 mph. He would say that the ball was traveling 55 mph. Both of you are right, you just happened to be moving \"with\" the ball.\n\nThe speed of light, c, is 670,616,629 mph. So if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light (0.5c) and you turn on your headlights, the light moves away from you at 1 c... or is it 1.5 c? It ends up that c is c no matter what. The next section explains why it's not c - 0.5c.\n\nWhen a clock is in motion, it ticks slower by a tiny factor of formula_4. The famous twin paradox says that if there were two twins and twin A stayed on earth while twin B traveled near c for a few years, when twin B got back to earth, he would be many years younger than twin A (because he experienced less time). For example, if twin B left when he was 20 and traveled at .9c for 10 years, then we he got back to earth, twin B would be 30 (20 years + 10 years) and twin A would be almost 43:\nTwin B would not notice that time had slowed at all. To him, if he looked out a window, it would seem like the universe was moving past him, and therefore slower (remember, to him, he's at rest). So time is relative.\n\nThings shorter in the direction of movement when they travel at relativistic speeds. During twin B's journey, he would notice something strange about the universe. He would notice that it got shorter (contracted in the direction of his motion). And the factor by which things get shorter is formula_4.\n\nRelativistic mass also increases. It makes them harder to push. So by the time you reach 0.9999c, you need a very big force to make you go faster. This makes it impossible for anything to reach the speed of light.\n\nStill, if you travel a bit slower, say 90% of the speed of light, your mass only grows by 2.3 times. So, while it may be impossible to reach the speed of light, it may still be possible to get close to it—that is, if you have enough fuel.\n", "id": "168627", "title": "Lorentz factor"}

Many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar.\n\nOne important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling. Scientists will, for example, ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other. Then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave. For instance, a person might say that \"cat\" and \"dog\" are similar words, so a good computer model should be able to take the word \"dog\" and respond with the word \"cat\" in a list of similar words. Computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text (called a corpus).\n\nOnce a model can respond with the correct (similar) words, then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar.\n\nAnother way that psychologists look into similarity is by putting people in special situations and watching what they do. In other words, by using an experiment. When it comes to similarity, this might include listing words, using categories as clues for learning new words, sorting objects into groups, or other tasks that have to do with comparing things to one another.\n\nDepending on how quickly people do these tasks, or how many mistakes they make, psychologists can find out what rules they are using to decide if things are similar.\n\n", "id": "168737", "title": "Similarity (psychology)"}

He is a German philosopher and sociologist, or someone who studies different societies. He uses a type of theory called critical theory, where he studies how people use power. He also uses the theory of American pragmatism, which studies if something is true or not by the effects of actions. He is known for his work on the theory of the public sphere. He studies power in democracy, and politics. He also studies how people develop a society through language, and tries to understand how that society and the government work together.\n\nHabermas was born in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-WestphaliaGermany.\n\nHabermas lived in Gummersbach, near the city of Cologne until his graduation from gymnasium. Ernst Habermas was his father and worked for the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Commerce, and he was a supporter of the Nazi's. Jürgen was raised in a Protestant religious family because his grandfather was in charge of the seminary, or religious school, in Gummersbach Germany. Jürgen Habermas went to the universities of Göttingen (1949/50), Zürich (1950/51), and Bonn (1951–54) and earned a doctorate, or an expert degree in philosophy from Bonn in 1954 with his work called, \"\" (\"The absolute and history: on the contradiction in Schelling's thought\"). The group who graded his work included Erich Rothacker and Oskar Becker.\n\nFrom 1956 on, he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Institute for Social Research, but because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation, or final project which Habermas did not want to do, and Habermas’s thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture, Habermas left the Frankfurt School and he finished his \"habilitation\", or highest academic degree, in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth. His \"habilitation\" work was entitled, \"\" (published in English in 1989 titled \"The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: an Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society\"). In 1961, he became a \"privatdozent\" in Marburg, and he began working as a \"extraordinary professor\" (professor without chair) of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg (at the instigation of Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Löwith) in 1962. In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimer's job in philosophy and sociology.\n\nHe was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg (near Munich) in 1971, and worked there until 1983, two years after the publication of his magnum opus, or great work, \"The Theory of Communicative Action\" Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and became in charge of the Institute for Social Research. Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993, Habermas has written many books and articles. In 1986, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the , which is the highest honour awarded in German research. He is a \"Permanent Visiting\" Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and \"Theodor Heuss Professor\" at The New School, New York.\n\nHabermas was awarded The Prince of Asturias Award in Social Sciences of 2003. Habermas was also the 2004 Kyoto Laureate in the Arts and Philosophy section.

It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal, India. On 3 December 1984, the plant released 42 tonnes of toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas, exposing more than 500,000 people to toxic gases. \n\nA mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city, causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs. Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas. Many were trampled in the panic that followed. The first official immediate death toll was 2,259. Another estimate is that 8,000 died within two weeks, that an additional 8,000 have since died from gas-related diseases.\n\nThe Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long term health effects of the disaster.\n\nThe plant in Bhopal where the disaster happened started to produce 'Carbaryl' in 1977. Carbaryl is mainly used as an insecticide. At first, the production was 2,500 tonnes per year. This was no problem, as the plant had been designed for an output of 5,000 tonnes. At the beginning of the 1980s, Carbaryl did not sell very well. For this reason, the owners of the plant started to cut costs. This included employing fewer people, doing maintenance less frequently and using parts that were made of lower-grade steel. Closing the plant was being considered as well. When the disaster happened, there was no production at the plant because there was a surplus on the market. \n\nThe disaster happened because water entered a tank containing Methyl isocyanate. This caused a chemical reaction which resulted in the buildup of much Carbon dioxide, among other things. The resulting reaction increased the temperature inside the tank to reach over . The pressure was more than the tank was built to withstand. The tank had valves to control the pressure. These were triggered in an emergency, which reduced the pressure. As a result, large amounts of toxic gases were released into the environment. The pipes were rusty. The rust in the iron pipes made the reaction faster. All the contents of the tank were released within a period of about two hours. The water had entered the tank because of a sequence of events. The tank had been maintained badly. When cleaning work was done, water could enter the tank. \n\nThere are different theories how water could enter the tank. At the time, workers were cleaning the pipes with water. Some claim that because of bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak into tank 610. In December 1985 the New York Times reported that according to the plant managers the hypothesis of this route of entry of water was tested in the presence of official investigators and was found to be negative. UCC also maintains that this route was not possible, and that it was an act of sabotage by a \"disgruntled worker\" who introduced water directly into the tank. See also,http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/cbi-probe-into-gas-tragedy-baseless-and-malicious-says-counsel-of-indian-convict/story-cCzHAuxf6V6bA6vYFwFwPL.html\nHowever, the company's investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection.\n\nThe 1985 reports give a picture of what led to the disaster and how it developed. The reports differ in details, however. \n\nFactors leading to this huge gas leak include:\n\n\nThe problem was then made worse by the plant's location near a densely populated area, non-existent catastrophe plans and shortcomings in health care and socio-economic rehabilitation. Analysis shows that the parties responsible for the magnitude of the disaster are the two owners, Union Carbide Corporation and the Government of India, and to some extent, the Government of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nBetween 3,500 and 25,000 people died as a result of contact with the cloud of toxic gas. Up to 500,000 people were injured. Many of the injuries are permanent. Some of the chemicals lead to birth defects. The numbers vary so vastly because there are no exact figures about how many people lived in the neighbourhood of the plant. About 100,000 people were living in a radius of 1 km around the plant where the disaster happened.\n\nIn 1998, the Supreme Court of India reached a settlement with Union Carbide: They had to pay 470 million US dollars to the Indian state. At that time Union Carbide made a turnover of about 9.5 billion dollars, 20 times that amount. In return, there would be no further prosecution. Only very little money actually reached the victims. One of the reasons why many people are still suffering is that the terrain where the plant stands is still contaminated with mercury and other carcinogenic substances. Dow Chemical who owns Union Carbide refuses to decontaminate the soil. Greenpeace has estimated that decontamination would only cost around 30 million USD.\n", "id": "168855", "title": "Bhopal disaster"}

The movement rejected realism and naturalism, and included poetry and other arts. Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus a symbolist painting may \"look\" realistic, but actually it represents a non-visual idea.\n\nIn literature, the style started with the publication \"Les Fleurs du mal\" (\"The Flowers of Evil\", 1857) by Charles Baudelaire. The works of Edgar Allan Poe, which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock tropes and images. The name \"symbolist\" itself was first used by the critic Jean Moréas, who invented it to distinguish the symbolists from similar styles of literature and art. Symbolism in art is related to the gothic component of Romanticism.\n\nThere were several groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, including Gustave Moreau, Gustav Klimt, Odilon Redon, Henri Fantin-Latour, Gaston Bussière, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, and Jan Toorop. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry. Its ideas affected Mikhail Vrubel, Nicholas Roerich, Martiros Saryan, Mikhail Nesterov, Léon Bakst, Elena Gorokhova in Russia, as well as Frida Kahlo in Mexico and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. Auguste Rodin is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.\n\nThe symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau style and Les Nabis.\n", "id": "168883", "title": "Symbolism (art)"}

It applies generally to all positions to which people may be appointed. It is often reinforced by laws, such as that women should have equal opportunities to men in employment.\n\nThe philosopher Plato thought that a government based on merit was better than democracy. In democracy, there is no guarantee that you will get the best person, the most qualified person, ruling the state. His criticisms were really of Athenian (or direct) democracy, where anyone could be selected to rule.\n\nIn a meritocracy, the people are chosen who are thought to be the best. Some have accused it of being elitist, saying that government by the best will mean that only those who have had the right opportunities will have a chance to govern, creating in effect a ruling class.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that Plato did not see it this way.

It comes from the practice of mediaeval Popes, appointing their nephews to important positions. \"Nepote\" is Italian for 'nephew'.\n\nFor instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III. Paul III was a notorious nepotist. When elected Pope in 1534 he appointed two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. \n\nThe practice was finally ended when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull \"Romanum decet Pontificem\", in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.\n\nIn the modern world, nepotism is thought to be wrong, and conflicts with the principle of merit, where the best person gets the job (meritocracy). The argument against the widespread nepotism in countries like Italy is that it damages the economy of the country, though that is difficult to prove.\n", "id": "168907", "title": "Nepotism"}

The main campus is in the city of State College, Pennsylvania and it has branch campuses around the state. It was founded in 1855. In 1863, the Pennsylvania state legislature picked the school to be the state's only land grant college. Its purpose is to do teaching, research, and public service. It teaches undergraduate, graduate, professional and continuing education students both in classrooms and online.\n\nPenn State University Park is ranked among the top-fifteen public universities in the United States. Annual enrollment at the main campus totals more than 44,000 graduate and undergraduate students, making it one of the largest universities in the United States. It has the world's largest dues-paying alumni association.\n\nThe university's total enrollment in 2009–10 was approximately 94,300 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus. The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses Penn State has a US$1.52 billion (as of April 30, 2010) endowment. The university's research budget was more than $765 million for the 2009-2009 fiscal year. In fiscal year 2008, the National Science Foundation ranked Penn State 11th among U.S. universities in research income.\n\nPenn State is a school known for its football team. Penn State is a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nPenn State is a \"state-related\" university, part of Pennsylvania's Commonwealth System of Higher Education. It receives money from the Commonwealth. The state appoints 10 out of 32 people on its board of trustees. Penn State is independent and not subject to the state's direct control. For the 2006–2007 fiscal year, the university received 9.7 percent of its budget from state appropriations, the lowest of the four state-related institutions in Pennsylvania. As Pennsylvania's land grant college, the state and federal governments provide matching funds for research and cooperative extension in agriculture, home economics and related fields.\nThe board of trustees selects a president of the University. The president controls the university, including day-to-day management. In practice, the president gives power to other departments of the administration, to the faculty, and to the student body. Provost Rodney Erickson became interim President on November 9, 2011, after President Graham Spanier was fired.\n\nThe executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University. As of 2011, the provost is Rodney Erickson, and the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean For Undergraduate Education is Jeremy Cohen.\n\nThe football team was led by coach Joe Paterno for 45 years. He was fired in 2011 along with the University President because they failed to report child abuse by a former assistant football coach. Former coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child abuse charges for the period 1994 to 2009. Both the Athletic Director and the vice president for business and finance were charged with perjury and resigned. The next day about 2,000 students rioted in protest, supporting coach Paterno. On November 11, the school staged a vigil to show support for the victims of child abuse.\n\nThe Education Secretary Arne Duncan said that colleges and universities have \"a legal and moral responsibility to protect children\", and that Penn State's failure to report the alleged abuse would be a \"tragedy\". The NCAA is considering sanctions against Penn State. Moody's Investors Service is reviewing Penn State's bond ratings for a possible downgrade. On November 14, 2011, the Big Ten Conference announced that its Championship football trophy will no longer be named for Paterno. On November 13, 2011, President Barack Obama said, \"It's a good time for us to do some soul searching – every institution, not just Penn State – about what our priorities are, and making sure that we understand that our first priority is protecting our kids.\" \n\nSandusky has denied all charges against him, although he was convicted of all charges in October 2012 and sentenced to 30-60 years in prison.\n\nPenn State's sports teams are nicknamed Nittany Lions, except for the women's basketball team, which is known as the Lady Lions. Almost all teams play in the Big Ten Conference. Two teams in sports that the Big Ten does not sponsor play elsewhere. The women's ice hockey team plays in College Hockey America and the men's volleyball team in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.\n", "id": "168925", "title": "Pennsylvania State University"}

Fairness can mean sameness where everything is kept equal by being the same. Fairness can also mean \"deservedness\" meaning a person gets what they deserve. People who are successful by working hard get what they deserve. People who are lazy and do not work hard get less. Fairness can also be based on need. Those who have more should give more to help others. This is based on the concept that people have obligations to each other. Judges, lawmakers, referees and teachers are among those expected to be fair in their decisions. Fairness is keeping decisions free from any form of discrimination.\n\nIn the United States fairness has long been a battle between equality and equity. Equality is the idea everyone should have an equal opportunity. If all the horses in a race start from the same point, the horse that wins is the fastest. Equity is the idea that adjustments need to be made to make things fair for both entities. One should get more than the other because that would be fair in this sense.

Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations. This includes our ability to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others.

Other clubs do not. They are broadly the same type of dog. It is easy to change the height of dogs by selective breeding, and the reason working dogs come in different sizes is to make them better at a particular job.

It was invented in 1935 by António Egas Moniz, a Portuguese neurologist. He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 \"for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses\". The operation cut the connections from the pre-frontal cortex (front part of the frontal lobes) to the rest of the brain. At first it seemed a great success, but the operation is now rarely done.\n\nHe used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment. He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour, which they repeated time and again. It was also used to treat other mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and clinical depression. \n\nThe problem with lobotomies was that they forever changed a person's personality and behaviour. Sometimes, the results were beneficial: patients which had been violent became calm. But long-term studies, which were not done by Moniz, show some had severely damaged personalities. They often had very little 'drive' and motivation.\n\nToday, antipsychotic drugs, like chlorpromazine, may treat the symptoms of such disorders. Lobotomies are seldom done.\n\nOne question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique so widely accepted. It is generally agreed that psychiatrists wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the twentieth century. Also, those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors.\n\nAccording to the \"Psychiatric Dictionary\" in 1970:\n\nGood results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases, fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent. The mortality rate probably does not exceed 3 percent. Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose premorbid personalities were 'normal', cyclothymic, or obsessive compulsive; in patients with superior intelligence and good education; in psychoses with sudden onset and a clinical picture of affective symptoms of depression or anxiety, and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food, overactivity, and delusional ideas of a paranoid nature. \n\nAccording to the same source, prefrontal lobotomy reduces:\nanxiety feelings and introspective activities; and feelings of inadequacy and self-consciousness are thereby lessened. Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with hallucinations and does away with the catatonic state. Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable side effects, they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed. The less disorganized the personality of the patient, the more obvious are post-operative side effects. ... \n\nConvulsive seizures are reported as [effects] of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases. Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti-convulsive drugs. Post-operative blunting of the personality, apathy, and irresponsibility are the rule rather than the exception. Other side effects include distractibility, childishness, facetiousness, lack of tact or discipline, and post-operative incontinence.\n\n", "id": "169177", "title": "Lobotomy"}

Hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air (it is less dense), which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it, just like a bubble of air in a pot of water. The greater the difference between the hot and the cold, the greater the difference in density, and the stronger the balloon will pull up. This means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day, or if the air inside the balloon is very hot. At higher temperature, the air molecules move faster. This causes the molecules to spread out and therefore hot air is less dense than cooler air.\n\nThe hot air balloon is the oldest form of flying technology that can successfully carry people. The earliest use of hot air to make objects fly was made in Ancient China. Paper lanterns were sent into the air for signalling.\n\nThe first hot air balloon to carry a person was made by the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September 1783, they demonstrated their invention for King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette at the French court in Paris. The passengers were a sheep, a duck and a rooster. They flew for 480 metres. The first flight carrying a person was on 15 October 1783. It carried Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier. The balloon was attached to the ground by a rope. The first \"free\" flight, without being attached to the ground, was a few weeks later, on 21 November 1783. It carried Marquis François d'Arlandes and Pilatre de Rozier. Memes.\n\nThe air is made up of molecules. When the air is cold, these molecules are closer together. When the air is hot, they move away from each other. So, in the same space, there are fewer molecules in hot air. Hot air is therefore lighter than cold air. This makes it rise and carry up the balloon when the air inside it is heated. The air is heated in the balloon with a burner, which uses bursts of fire to keep the air hot. The fire is fuelled by propane.\n\nThe heated air is kept inside the balloon by its fabric. This is called the \"envelope\". It is usually made of nylon.\n\nThe passengers and the pilot stand in the basket, which is attached to the balloon by ropes. The basket is usually made of wicker. Baskets can come in many sizes. It can have enough places for up to 36 people. It depends the size of the balloon to carry that much weight.\n\nA hot air balloon festival is a type of air show. It is where ballooners display and fly their balloons together. During these events, they fly in the morning and in the evening if the conditions allow it. People can enjoy a balloon flight if they pay. There are many activities. Sometimes, the balloons are lit up against the night sky.\n\nAt these festivals, people can see different shapes of balloons.

In particular, Locke thought all knowledge came from sense data, and the mind is empty at the beginning. By 'sense data' is meant the process of hearing, seeing, touching etc.\n\nLocke's idea was immediately picked up by others:\n\nMany have held similar views. The founder of behaviourism, John B. Watson (1878–1938):\n\nThroughout the 20th century the influence of evolution and genetics ran against these liberal ideas. Ethology proved that much animal behaviour was inherited, instinctual, (innate and permanent). Konrad Lorenz argued that the aggression so obvious in the history of mankind was a playing out of behaviour which had evolutionary advantage in our past. The field of evolutionary psychology set out to examine the role played by evolution on our mental life. If humans share a common evolutionary history with the other animals, it is likely that we inherit mental traits from our evolution. The human ability to learn a language is inherited, and is of huge practical importance. Very important also (though less obvious) is the way that our unconscious mind helps us get through life. The apparatus which performs that mental activity is certainly inherited.

It is named after Henri Poincaré, the French mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904.\n\nThe sphere (also called the 2-sphere, as it is a 2-dimensional surface, although it is usually seen as inside a three dimensional space) has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point (if a rubber band is wrapped around the sphere, it is possible to slide it down to a point). Mathematicians say that the 2-sphere is simply connected. Other spaces do not have this property, for example the donut: a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface.\n\nMathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2-sphere, in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough (in mathematician terms, that is compact) is in fact the 2-sphere. It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however, as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected. Also, a regular disk (a circle and its interior) is simply connected, but it has an edge (the bounding circle).\n\nThe conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3-sphere, which is an object living naturally in four dimensions. This question motivated much of modern mathematics, especially in the field of topology. The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman, a Russian mathematician, with methods from geometry, showing that it is indeed true. He was awarded a Fields medal for his work, which he declined.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions: this is the generalised Poincaré conjecture. Surprisingly, it was easier to prove the fact for higher-dimensional spheres: In 1960, Smale proved it to be true for the 5-sphere, 6-sphere and higher, and in 1982, Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4-sphere, for which he was awarded a Fields medal.\n", "id": "169214", "title": "Poincaré conjecture"}

It has a seat and pedals, but no chain or gears. There is no handlebar, it is steered by gripping the seat with the legs and twisting the body. A rider keeps their balance by moving their arms, and controlling their speed. It is usually used for acting and performing. A unicycle is more expensive than a cheap bicycle, because unicycles are far less common.\n\nThere are two kinds of unicycles; giraffe unicycles and traditional unicycles. Giraffe unicycles are much taller than traditional unicycles, and use a chain so that the performer's legs do not have to stretch very far. Giraffe unicycles are mostly used by performers in circuses. \n\nUnicycles are often used while the performer is simultaneously juggling or plate spinning. To do this, performers usually rock back and forth on the unicycle. This is called \"idling\". It lets the performer pay attention to what they are doing in their hands, instead of to the ground in front of them. To \"idle\" a unicycle, performers usually press one foot down, anchoring it in the bottom position of the wheel. This foot both provides support and completes the rocking motion that is necessary to keep the unicycle balanced.\n\nMany other tricks can be done when riding a unicycle. This includes going backwards, riding up and down steps, pedaling with only one foot, hopping in place, wheel-walking (putting the feet on the tire instead of on the pedals) and riding over obstacles.\n", "id": "169296", "title": "Unicycle"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169405", "text": "Victoria line\n\nThe Victoria line is part of the London Underground network. It is a deep-level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in the south of London to the Walthamstow Central in the north-east. It started running in 1968. On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue colour. It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network. It is the only line on the Underground, other than the two-stop Waterloo & City line, which is completely underground. The only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from Seven Sisters to Northumberland Park.\n\nThe line has hump-backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations. The stations are on top of small hills, or humps. As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down. As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill, with gravity helping the train to speed up. This saves 5% energy and makes the trains run 9% faster. Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 132.6 metres long. 183 million people use the Victoria line each year.\n\nThe concept of a new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948. The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area. The Private Bill needed to build it was introduced into Parliament in 1955. The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow (Wood Street). There was also a proposal for an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line, but this was not included in the Bill.\n\nThe construction work on the Walthamstow–Victoria section began in 1962. It continued until 1972, when Pimlico station was opened. A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrated into the running tunnels. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the line during its construction. In July 1968, they visited the tunnels that were being built under Vauxhall Park.\n\nBarbara Castle, the Minister of Transport gave approval on 4 August 1967 to build the Brixton extension. Preparatory work started at a site on Bessborough Gardens near to Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967. On 28 June 1968, Richard Marsh, then Minister of Transport approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico.\n\nThe name \"Victoria line\" dates back to 1955. The other suggestions were \"Walvic line\" (Walthamstow Central station–Victoria station) and \"Viking line\" (Victoria station–King's Cross station). During the planning stages, it was known as \"Route C\". Later, it was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna. This suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot.\n\nThe Victoria line was designed to get rid of build-ups of traffic on other lines, such as the Piccadilly line. It was also designed to have as many interchanges as possible, and all stations except Pimlico have an interchange with at least one other London Underground or National Rail line. It had been intended to build the line past Walthamstow Central to Wood Street (Walthamstow), where it would come above ground to terminate next to the British Railways station. However, a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow Central station. Until 1968 this station was called Walthamstow (Hoe Street).\n\nEach Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station and several existing stations were re–arranged to allow for cross-platform interchange with it. In some cases this was achieved by placing the Victoria line platforms on either side of the existing station. In others the Victoria line uses one of the older platforms and the existing line was diverted into a new platform.\n\nAt Euston, northbound Victoria and Northern line (Bank branch) trains run along platforms next to each other, although they are travelling in opposite directions. \"Same-direction\" cross-platform interchanges are available at Stockwell (with the Northern line), Oxford Circus (with the Bakerloo line), Highbury & Islington (with First Capital Connect, originally the Northern City Line) and at Finsbury Park (with the Piccadilly line).\n\nAll Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a light blue colour. Each station was decorated with tiled motifs on seating recesses to differentiate them from each other. During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s, the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms.\n\nPlatform humps were installed on all Victoria Line stations, except for Pimlico, during late 2010 and 2011. This was done to provide step-free access to trains. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 created the need for the humps to be installed. The humps are a ramp type, similar to those being installed on some mainline stations. They are of a masonry construction.\n\nThe first section opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury & Islington. There was no opening ceremony for this. The normal timetable started on 1 September 1968. The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury & Islington at about 6.30 am. Later that year, the section between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street was opened. Again there was no ceremony.\n\nThe official opening ceremony for the line took place at Victoria station on 7 March 1969. Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse. After a short ceremony, she bought a 5d (old pence) ticket and travelled to Green Park. In new pence this would be about 2.08p.\n\nPrincess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on 23 July 1971. She made a journey from Brixton to Vauxhall.\n\nTrains run every two minutes during peak periods (when its the busiest). In normal service, all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters. About three out of five continue to Walthamstow Central.\n\nWhen the line first opened it was served by a fleet of 8-car 1967 tube stock trains. Each is made up of two four-car units. Later on, a number of cars of 1972 Mark I tube stock were adapted to work with the 1967 stock. This meant that there were finally 43 trains, each of which was made up of two four-car units. The 1967 tube stock was replaced by 2009 tube stock between 2009 and 2011 (see below).\n\nAt first, an articulated type of rolling stock was considered. This idea was not used because it would have been to difficult to move the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls. This is no longer a problem since train overhauls have been moved away from Acton Works to the builders' own works. The new 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriage. This prevents it from running on other deep-level tube lines.\n\nThe line has an Automatic Train Operation system (ATO). The train operator (driver) closes the train doors and presses a pair of \"start\" buttons. If the way ahead is clear, the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops there. This system has been in place since the line opened in 1968. This makes the Victoria line the world's first full-scale automatic railway.\n\nWhen the Victoria line was built, there were severe budget restrictions. As a result, the station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects. Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central, Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale. This also affects lighting levels. At most stations between the up and down escalators there is a concrete staircase where an additional escalator could be installed, but has not been fitted. It can cause severe congestion at peak times. This has been remedied at Brixton in 2004 and at Vauxhall in 2006 where an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway.\n\nIn addition, there have been station closures for safety reasons, when both escalators have been unserviceable. Over many years, heavy equipment has been installed in fenced-off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them. It is not clear from Transport for London's Five-Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied.\n\nThe 1967 stock was replaced bit by bit from July 2009 as part of Transport for London's 5-year £10 billion redevelopment project. The replacement for the line's 1967 tube stock is the 2009 tube stock built by Bombardier Transportation. The first train was built in 2006. Testing of the new trains began in 2008. The main fleet began to be introduced in 2009 and went into main service in 2010. The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011, after which the whole service was provided by 2009 stock.\n\nSupporters of Tottenham Hotspur (and the club itself) have campaigned for a surface station to be opened next to Northumberland Park Station, next to the line's depot. This would provide an improvement in transport links, seen as essential if the club's wish to redevelop their ground and increase crowd capacity is to become a reality. The idea was looked into but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans.\n\nIf the Chelsea–Hackney line is built then it will relieve a lot of congestion on the Victoria line. It will offer an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and King's Cross St. Pancras.\n\nFor many years there have been proposals to extend southwards from Brixton one stop to Herne Hill. This station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform. This would remove a critical capacity restriction by eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton. However, this would be expensive and cannot currently be justified on cost-benefit reasons. Given that the current line is heavily overcrowded, this is the only extension proposal that has any realistic possibility of ever existing. Even so, it would have to be seen to be effective at reducing overcrowding (by enabling trains to run more frequently) rather than adding to overcrowding to have any hope of being built.\n\nNorthumberland Park Depot is the service and storage area for trains on the Victoria Line. It is the only part of the line not in tunnel. It is located next to Northumberland Park railway station, on Tottenham Marshes, Tottenham in the London Borough of Haringey.\n\nThe Depot is connected to the Victoria Line by a tunnelled branch line to a junction to the north of Seven Sisters. It was opened with the first stage of the line in 1968.\n\nThere is a local campaign for platforms for the Victoria Line to be built at Northumberland Park station. This is supported by the Haringey Council and by Tottenham Hotspur F.C.; the platforms are seen as essential to the club's plans to increase capacity at their White Hart Lane ground.\n\n", "id": "169405", "title": "Victoria line"}

They are often used on subways and local train services. Before third rails, electricity was carried in overhead wires.\n\nElectricity as a method of giving power to a train came about during the 1800s. Scottish engineer Robert Davidson designed and built an electric locomotive in 1837 using batteries. Using batteries meant that the locomotive could not be used on the main railways due to the constant need to charge them. It was not until German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1879 that the first design of a reliable electric locomotive to carry passengers was made. Siemens' design used a 2.2kW electric motor and had a top speed of just over 13km/h. This new locomotive hauled three passenger cars along a 300 meter circular railway track and carried around 90,000 people in four months during its trail run at the Berlin Industrial Exhibition. Siemens' electric locomotive was the first train to utilize a third rail and power was provided via a dedicated dynamo. The early designs of electric trains were unable to access a widely available and reliable source of electricity. A network of electricity that went where ever the network of rail went was needed. Whilst many modern distance trains utilize an overhead wire system to provide power, the third rail was the first viable means of supplying power and is one that remains very much in use world-wide today. \n\nThe third rail is usually located outside the two running rails, but occasionally between them. The electricity is transmitted to the train by means of a sliding shoe, which is held in contact with the rail. On many systems an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track; sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side (called side running) or bottom (called bottom running) of the third rail, allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface. When the shoe slides on top, it is referred to as top running. When the shoe slides on the bottom it is not affected by the build-up of snow or leaves.\n\nThird rails typically carry hundreds of volts in high amperage current. This makes them very dangerous. In 2005 American James Maki fell onto the third rail at a Boston rail station and suffered extensive and disfiguring injuries. As part of his treatment he became the second American recipient of a face transplant. Many deaths occur around the world each year due to human contact with a third rail. In New York City there have been multiple cases of people dying because they have urinated on the third rail.\n\n\n", "id": "169438", "title": "Third rail"}

About half are photosynthetic, the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists. The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called 'algae'; the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called 'protozoa'. \n\nThey have been classified as an order, a class and a phylum by different authors. Active research is being done on their relationships.\n\nMost are marine plankton, but they are common in fresh water habitats as well. Their populations are distributed depending on temperature, salinity, or depth. The group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species.\n\nAbout 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater and parasitic dinoflagellates.\n\nSome dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae: endosymbionts of marine eukaryotes, and animals such as anthozoan corals. These reef-building corals largely depend on them. Other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include jellyfish, clams, foraminifera, sea slugs i.e. nudibranchs, and also ciliates and radiolaria.\n\nDinoflagellates are responsible for the 'red tides' which may poison fish. They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Some species produce neurotoxins, which in such quantities kill fish and accumulate in filter feeders such as shellfish, which in turn may pass them on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.\n\nAlthough classified as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei. In fact, Dodge termed the dinoflagellate nucleus as \"mesokaryotic\", due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as golgi complexes, mitochondria and chloroplasts.\n\nThe group contains many complex organelles and life styles. Some have structures rather like vertebrates eyes; some have nematocysts; some live as plasmodia (multinucleate forms); some have two flagella; photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain a \"bewildering array\" of plastid types; and the whole of their genetics and cell biology is eccentric.\n\nFossil dinoflagellates are important in \"stratigraphy\", the dating and correlation of strata. During their life, dinoflagellates have a mobile planktonic form and a resistant cyst phase which enables them to survive over winter in sediment. Only the cyst gets fossilised. Their first certain appearance is in the Silurian period, with a big radiation in the Mesozoic era. They are classified as \"Phylum Dinomastigota\" by Margulis and colleagues.\n\n", "id": "169441", "title": "Dinoflagellate"}

The term is also be used for bacteria, fungi, lichens and mosses which grow on plants. However, most epiphytes (89%) are flowering plants; and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes. \n\nAn epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, and sometimes from debris accumulating around it.

Parasitic and semi-parasitic plants, like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes.\n\nEpiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy; often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater (and moisture from the air) if they are not aquatic.\n\nEpiphytes are important for other species too, certain frogs live in the water reservoir of epiphytes.\n", "id": "169459", "title": "Epiphyte"}

Loons are found in most parts of North America and Eastern Europe. They enjoy cool climates in the summer and migrate to ocean coasts in the winter.\n\nLoons can dive up to 200 feet underwater for food. Their bodies are shaped for diving. To dive better, they have solid bones (most birds' bones are hollow) and feet placed far back for swimming under the water.\n\nThere are five North American loon species. They have black (or grey)-and-white heads, pale breasts, and striped back feathers. \n\nLoons can lay up to two eggs. They are brownish in color which helps them blend into their surroundings. Both the male and female parent take turns sitting on the eggs. After hatching, they fly south when the weather gets cool. The young loons spend three years in the south before returning to the north.\n\nThey are best known for their loud, trumpeting call. They also make melodic, wailing or laughing sounds. Loons communicate to each other through their sounds. They also communicate with humans and other animals through dance. Loons warn others to stay away from their nests by dancing on the water. Loons are protective parents and will dance to exhaustion and death to protect their eggs. Raccoons, gulls, and skunks have been known to devour loon eggs. \n\nLoons eat fish like sunfish, perch, and bullheads. Loons do not chew their food.

The crossbow is an invention in which the stock, a piece of wood is mounted on two other crossing pieces. Crossbows shoot short arrows called \"bolts\" which are similar to arrows. The crossbow was first created by the Chinese people in circa 6 B.C. The Greeks invented crossbow separately in 4th century B.C. The Romans called the weapon \"arcuballista\". Crossbow was a very popular weapon in the Middle Ages as it was strong and accurate and could be used as a sharpshooter weapon. The Arabs call crossbow \"qaws Ferengi\", \"European bow\", for this reason as the Crusaders used crossbow a lot. A good crossbow can shoot the bolt with such immense power that it may pierce armour. Against unarmoured light opponents, even a single bolt may be lethal.\n\nCompared to the ordinary bow, the crossbows have good and bad sides to them. They fire much stronger and much more accurately than ordinary bows, and shooting accurately with a crossbow is easier to learn than shooting with an ordinary bow. On the other hand, because the prod is short and therefore very stiff, a crossbow will take much longer time to load, and a crossbow does not have as good accurate range than an ordinary bow. Many crossbows have crank or windlass mechanisms to pull the string in drawn position. Also many crossbows do have safety mechanisms to prevent an accidental shot.\n\nCrossbow shooting is today a popular sport.\n", "id": "169493", "title": "Crossbow"}

If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten (for example, wheat), cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine. This means that they cannot digest (eat) food properly, making them unable to have enough energy, vitamins, or minerals. Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly. People with coeliac disease often lose weight. They are also frequently tired. \n\nPeople with coeliac disease often have diarrhoea (watery stools) or steatorrhea (fat in their stools). These symptoms can lead to flatulence. Their stomach also hurts and they might suffer from joint pains, seizures, rashes, loss of bone density and fertility issues.\n\nTo relieve the effects of coeliac disease, one must stop eating gluten. There are no medicines that can stop coeliac disease. To get fully better, it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten, during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover. They must remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of their life in order to treat this condition.\n\nCoeliac disease is genetic. This means that the person affected by it is born with genes that cause the immune system to react badly to gluten. However, coeliac disease is not always there during childhood. It can be triggered as an adult by an event such as pregnancy or illness.\n\nTo find out if a person has coeliac disease, doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten. The protien that attacks the intestine is called an antibody. Antibodies are produced by white blood cells, and they normally stop illnesses from growing in the body, but in the case of coeliac disease, one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness. Doctors can also look into the patient's intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope. This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged, because of coeliac disease.\n\n", "id": "169527", "title": "Coeliac disease"}

Because the Earth's poles are tilted at an angle of 23.42 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit, this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky. \n\nAlthough it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky (almost 26,000 years), even over the time period that humans have had writing, this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169659", "text": "Toronto subway and RT\n\nThe Toronto subway and RT is the main rapid transit (RT) railway system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is run by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). Since the first part under Yonge Street opened in 1954 with 12 stations, the system has grown to be Canada's biggest rapid transit rail system. It has four lines and 69 stations on 68.3 km of track. The subway system is used very often and has the most number of passengers of any system in Canada. It has an average of 948,100 passenger trips each weekday (as of 2010).\n\nThe system is being made bigger at the moment on the western part of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line with new tracks and stations being made north to York University, Steeles Avenue, and Vaughan Corporate Centre in York Region. The Government of Ontario said on March 23, 2006 that it will give $670 million for this new work, which is less than one-third of the total money needed. Once it is built, the new track will be about 8.6 km long and will be built with six new stations: Downsview Park, Finch West, York University, Pioneer Village, Highway 407 Transitway (highway), and the Vaughan Corporate Centre. It is expected to cost about $2 billion. An environmental study has been done up to Steeles Avenue.\n\nThe first part of the subway, replaced a very busy streetcar route, and followed Yonge Street from Eglinton Avenue south to Front Street, then turned west for one block to end at Bay Street, next to the city's main railway station Union Station and so the subway station was also called Union. This line was finished in 1954 and was 7.4 km long.\n\nIn 1963 another part was added, that went north from Union station, below University Avenue and Queen's Park to near Bloor Street, where it turned west to end at St. George and Bloor Streets.\n\nThe Bloor-Danforth Line opened up in 1966 along Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue from Keele Street to Woodbine Avenue, and was made longer in 1968 to run from Islington Avenue to Warden station at Warden and St. Clair Avenues. \n\nThe routing of the line across the Don Valley was possible because of a choice made more than forty years before. When the Prince Edward Viaduct was built across the Don River in 1919, its design included twin decks below the road to allow for future rail lines. This made it possible for the subway to cross the Don Valley to Danforth Avenue on the east side.\n\nThe Yonge-University line was extended north 8.7 km from Eglinton Avenue to Finch Avenue and Yonge in 1973 and 1974.\n\nMore track (9.9 km) was added to the Yonge-University Line in 1978 when it was extended from St. George and Bloor, north and northwest to Eglinton Avenue and Allen Road, then north along the middle of Allen Road to Wilson Avenue. \n\nIn October 1976, an arson (a fire set on purpose) destroyed subway cars and damage to Christie station. This caused the closure of the Bloor-Danforth Line for three days, and closed Christie station for some time for repairs. More track was added in 1980 at both ends of the Bloor-Danforth Line. These extensions each added one station, bus bays, and, on the eastern end, room to to the Scarborough RT.\nWith six stations on 6.8 km of track, the Scarborough RT is a line built almost all above the ground, and which has no direct tracks that connect to the other lines and uses a different trains. It uses the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) trains which are very different from subway trains. The route is fully separate from road traffic and pedestrians, the stations are fully covered, and the trains have many doors that use high platforms. \n\nAn extra 1.6 km was added to the north end of the Spadina part of the Yonge-University-Spadina Line, adding one station (Downsview), with parking for buses. \n\nIn August 1995, the TTC had a really bad subway accident in what it calls the Russell Hill accident, on the Yonge-University-Spadina Line south of St. Clair West station. Three women died and 100 people were injured, a few badly. \n\nThe subway's newest line, Sheppard, opened in 2002. It runs 5.5 km east, under Sheppard Avenue from Sheppard station on the Yonge line (now called Sheppard-Yonge), to Don Mills station at Sheppard and Don Mills Road. The Sheppard line has less users than the other two subway lines, and shorter trains run on it.\n\nIn its over fifty-year history, the first baby to be born on a TTC subway station platform only occurred recently on February 6, 2006. This incident occurred at Wellesley station and caused delays on the subway system. It was front-page news for many days.\n\nAn automatic voice system was added to each station (such as; \"The next station is Bloor, Bloor station.\") which ended the need for the train operator to announce each stop. The automated system is used in the whole subway and RT system.\n\nUntil recently, the TTC did not have plans to expand the subway during the last twenty years but only had plans to build new above-ground rapid transit lines based upon streetcars travelling in closed lanes on streets. Today there are plans to build new subway lines under the ground, including extensions to the Spadina-University line and two lines in the central section of the city south of Bloor-Danforth.\n\nLike most subways, the Toronto subway/RT trains get electricity from a third rail that runs next to the tracks. 'Shoes' (pieces of metal that touch the third-rail) mounted on both sides of each coach for contact. Power is supplied at 600 V DC.\n\nA train guard opens and closes the subway car doors, and makes sure no one is trapped in a door as the train leaves a station. The train guard tells the driver when it is okay to leave. The car carrying the guard can be identified by the white or the orange light outside the subway car. \n\nOn weekdays and Saturday, subway service runs from approximately 6:00 am to 1:30 am, but Sunday service begins at 9:00 am.

It is a natural substance, oozing out of the ground in places like the La Brea tar pits. Usually it is made by heating coal inside a chemical apparatus.\n\nMost tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production, but it can also be produced from petroleum, peat or wood. The \"destructive distillation\" of a ton of coal can produce 700 kg of coke, 100 litres of liquor ammonia, 50 litres of coal tar and 400 m of coal gas.\n\nIt used to be one of the products of gasworks. Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic. It causes cancer because of its high benzene content. In low concentrations, however, tar is used as a medicine on the skin. \n\nTar kilns are dry destillation ovens, used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitve holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole, to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss to stop air entering. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out, and continues to do so for a few days.\n\nTar is used in treatment of the skin disease psoriasis, where coal tar is the most effective. Tar is a general disinfectant. Petroleum tar was also used in ancient Egyptian mummification circa 1000 BC.\n\nTar was a vital component of the first sealed, or \"tarmac\", roads. The streets of Baghdad were the first to be paved with tar from the 8th century AD. It was also used as seal for roofing shingles and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have negated the need for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well painting exterior walls of log buildings. \n\nMixing tar with linseed oil varnish produces tar paint. Tar paint can be used to protect wood from weather. Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments, producing translucent colours and preserving the wood texture. \n\n\n", "id": "169672", "title": "Tar"}

In a simple example, water has a low viscosity, as it is \"thin\". Syrup and tar, on the other hand, has a high viscosity, as it is \"thick\". So next time you drink something think about the viscosity! A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope. Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly, whereas water would be a lot quicker.\n\nThere are two types of viscosity: \"dynamic viscosity\", measured in pascal seconds, and \"kinematic viscosity\", measured in metres per second squared.\n\nViscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt. When the lava comes out very thickly (viscous), there is more chance that it will erupt violently. This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can. If the lava is thin (low viscosity), then it just flows out like water.\n\nThe word \"viscous\" comes from the Latin \"viscum\", meaning sticky.\n", "id": "169683", "title": "Viscosity"}

It was started in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton. In 1967 Tim Horton joined with investor Ron Joyce, who quickly took over running the company and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar franchise. \n\nTim Hortons stores quickly spread and together with Subway, became bigger than McDonald's and is now Canada's largest chain of fast food restaurants. The company opened twice as many Canadian stores as did McDonald's and sales also are bigger than those of McDonald's Canadian restaurants as of 2002. The chain got 22.6% of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005. Tim Hortons also has 76% of the Canadian market for baked goods (based on the number of customers) and has 62% of the Canadian coffee market (compared to Starbucks, who is the second largest with 7%). Tim Hortons had 2,733 restaurants in Canada as of July 1, 2007. \n\nTim Hortons also has an international restaurants with 500 in the United States as of December 2008, with one opened in Detroit and owned by former NBA player Derrick Coleman and one on a Canadian military base outside Kandahar, Afghanistan. Tim Hortons' other international efforts include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo. Tim Hortons also made a deal with the SPAR store chain in the UK and Ireland, with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self service counters in 16 SPAR stores. \n\nThe companies first store opened in 1964 in Hamilton, Ontario under the name \"Tim Horton Donuts\" (the word donut would later be dropped and the company name ended up as just \"Tim Horton's\", and later was changed to \"Tim Hortons\" without the apostrophe). The business was started by Tim Horton, who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in a car accident in 1974.\n\nSoon after Horton opened the store, he met Ron Joyce, a former Hamilton police constable. In 1965, Joyce took over the Tim Horton Donut Shop on Ottawa Street North in Hamilton. By 1967, after he had opened up two more stores, he and Tim Horton became full partners in the business. After Horton's death in 1974, Joyce bought the company from the Horton family and took over as the only owner of the now forty stores. Joyce expanded the chain quickly in geography and in product selection, opening the 500th store in Aylmer, Quebec, in 1991.\n\nRon Joyce's very fast expansion of the Tim Hortons business brought about two major changes in the coffee and doughnut restaurant market: independent doughnut shops in Canada were almost wiped out, and Canada's per person ratio of doughnut shops rose past those of all other countries.\n\nBy the 1990s, the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd but the name of the restaurants are still called Tim Hortons. This was because the company wanted to also go into other types of business, and not just be seen as a doughnut company. In March 2006, shares of the company were first sold to the public.\n\nTDL Group had $1.48 billion in sales in 2005 and has expanded across Canada and also in New York, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Maine.\n\nTim Hortons has many stores on or near many Canadian Forces Bases. TDL Group said in March 2006, that because they were asked by Chief of the Defence Staff, General Rick Hillier, it would open a store at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar, Afghanistan. The new Kandahar store opened on June 29 2006, in a 40 ft trailer on the military base.\n\n\nTim Hortons' first stores only sold two products - coffee and doughnuts. As well as its coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and doughnuts, the Tim Hortons menu now includes a number of other baked goods, such as Timbits (small balls of doughnut dough), muffins, croissants, tea biscuits, cookies, rolls, danishes, and bagels (Tim Hortons now sells one out of every two bagels in the whole Canadian food industry). Cakes to take home are offered in some locations. \n\nSince the mid-1990s, the chain has moved into other areas, such as flavoured cappuccino, iced cappuccino, iced coffee, New York-style cheesecake, and lunch items such as soup, chili, and submarine sandwiches. In fall 2006, Tim Hortons began selling a breakfast sandwich. This is made of an egg patty, processed cheese slice, either bacon or sausage, and either a biscuit or bagel, it has sold well. In October 2007 Tim Hortons began to sell a Chicken Fajita Wrap, which has spiced chicken and sautéed vegetables. In December 2007, they began to sell Hash Browns and the Bagel B.E.L.T., (a breakfast sandwich that has lettuce and tomato.\n\nAlong with the expansion of stores and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods. Doughnuts, which used to be made at night so that they were ready for the next morning, are now fully cooked and then frozen and sent to every restaurant from Windsor Ontario. The restaurants now bake them during the day.\n\nThe company used to sell Coca-Cola products but Tim Hortons switched over to Pepsi in 2007.\n\nThrow away cups made by the company are one of the most common litter items in Canada. Company spokespersons claim that customers are the problem, not Tim Hortons.\n\nIn May 2008, the chain came under fire after an employee in London, Ontario was fired for giving away a single $0.16 Timbit to a baby. A manager was blamed for the . The employee was hired at a different nearby location.\n\n", "id": "169790", "title": "Tim Hortons"}

Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks, when the drink has the words \"on the rocks.\"\n\nIce cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer. Many freezers also have an icemaker. Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin. After that, they can be put in a glass.\n\nIce cubes are also made commercially and sold in big amounts. These ice cubes are usually cylindrical, and might have holes through the center. Commercially made ice cubes are very clear, as the water doesn't have much air dissolved in it.\n\nIce cubes can also be crushed into different-shaped flakes, which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better. Crushed ice is also used when it needs to be made fast, because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles.\n\nAmerican physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air. His refrigerator made ice, which he hung from the ceiling in a basin. Gorrie is the creator of ice cubes, even though he was not trying to cool drinks. Instead, he used the ice to cool the room's temperature. During that time, people thought that bad air quality made people sick. So, to help treat sickness, he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms.\n\nIce cube trays are designed to be filled with water, then put in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, thus creating ice cubes. Trays are often flexible, so the ice cubes can be removed easily by flexing the tray. Another design is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes up, moving them off of the tray. A motorized kind of this is in most automatic ice-making freezers.\n\nEven though ice cubes are usually shaped like cubes, there are trays that make spherical or cylindrical shapes. These are sometimes called ice tubes. Some novelty trays make blocks of ice in seasonal, festive, or other shapes.\n\nThe first flexible, stainless steel, all-metal ice cube tray was made by Guy L. Tinkham in 1933. The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes.\n\nThe first rubber ice cube tray was made by Lloyd Groff Copeman. One day in 1928, while walking through some woods getting sap for maple syrup, Copeman saw that slush and ice came off of his rubber boots instead of sticking to them. After talking about it with his patent attorney at lunch, he did experiments using rubber cups. Later, he made and patented several kinds of tray: a metal tray with rubber separators, a metal tray with individual rubber cups, and a tray made of only rubber.\n", "id": "169795", "title": "Ice cube"}
