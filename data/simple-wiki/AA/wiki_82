His is the first known model that put the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it (see Solar system).\n\nAristarchus was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but he identified the \"central fire\" with the Sun, and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favour of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy.\n\nHis name is \"Ἀρίσταρχος\" in Greek letters, which transliterates to Aristarchos. He was born on the island of Samos, in the eastern Aegean Sea.\n\nHeliocentrism is the idea of the Sun at the centre. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book \"The Sand Reckoner\" describes another work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis. Archimedes wrote:\n\nSo Aristarchus believed the stars were very far away, which is an important step. Therefore, there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other while the Earth moves around the Sun. The stars are much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times; and the tiny amount of stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes.\n\nThe old geocentric model explained planetary parallax, and was assumed to be the reason why no stellar parallax was observed. Rejection of the heliocentric view was common, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (\"On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon\"):\n\nThe only other astronomer of antiquity who is known by name and who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.\n\nThe heliocentric theory was successfully revived nearly 1800 years later by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton gave the theoretical explanation based on laws of physics, namely Kepler's laws for the motion of planets and Newton's laws on gravitational attraction and dynamics.\n\nThe Vatican library has preserved two ancient manuscripts with estimates of the length of the year. The only ancient scientist listed for two different values is Aristarchus. Both are close to the values later used by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and the precession indicated is almost precisely 1 degree per century, a value which is too low. 1 degree per century precession was used by all later astronomers until the Arabs. The correct value in Aristarchus's time was about 1.38 degrees per century.\n\n\n", "id": "361310", "title": "Aristarchus of Samos"}

It has a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. Its belly is white. The wings and its back are silver-gray with black-and-white bars that look like they are shining when the light reflects on it. During flight a V-shaped white rump patch and the silver-gray underwing linings can be seen.\n\nBarnacle Geese often build their nests high on mountain cliffs. This keeps them away from predators (mostly Arctic Foxes and Polar Bears) but also away from food. Like all geese, the goslings are not fed by the adults. Instead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings, the goslings are brought to the ground. Unable to fly, the three day old goslings jump off the cliff and fall. Their small size, feathery down, and very light weight helps to protect some of them from serious injury when they hit the rocks below. Many do die from the fall. Arctic foxes are attracted by the noise made by the parent geese during this time. They eat many dead or injured goslings. The foxes also stalk the young as they are led by the parents to wetland feeding areas.\n", "id": "361448", "title": "Barnacle goose"}

The wingspan is 135–170  (53–67 in) cm. It weighs 1.8–3.4 kg (4–7.5 lbs). It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, and pink feet. The body is grey-brown, the head and neck a richer, darker brown, the rump white, and the tail grey with a broad white tip. \n\nNesting is often on cliffs close to glaciers. This gives protection from mammalian predators (mainly Arctic Fox). Three to six eggs are laid in early to mid May in Iceland, late May in Svalbard. Incubation lasts 26–27 days. On hatching, the goslings go with the parents on foot to the nearest lake. They fledge after about 56 days. Southbound migration is from mid September to early October, and northbound from mid April to early May.\n\nThe diet is almost entirely vegetarian.

It can fly at speeds up to 113 km/h (70 mph). \n\nThe Common Eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe and in North America. It measures in length, weighs and spans across the wings. It has a bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird. It can be told apart from all ducks, except other eider species, because of size and head shape. This duck's call is a pleasant \"ah-ooo\". The species is often readily approachable.\n\nThis species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the Eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.\n\nEiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders often return to breed on the same island where they were hatched.

The existence of this ability is disputed.\n\nThe claims made differ somewhat, but stress the recall of visual information. Examples of the information include: pages from books, magazines, and license plate numbers. It is claimed that those with a photographic memory tend to have higher IQs than those without it. A person with this ability does not use mnemonics. \n\nThe ability is said to occur in the early childhood of a small number of children (between 2 percent and 10 percent) and generally is not found in adults. \n\nSome do not believe this skill exists. The American cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, in his book \"The Society of Mind\" (1988), thought that reports of photographic memory were an “unfounded myth”.\n\nAdriaan de Groot studied the ability of chess grandmasters to memorize the positions of chess pieces on a chess board. At first, people thought they had photographic memory because they could memorize far more information than nonexperts. However, arrangements of pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than nonexperts. This suggests that they only have an ability to remember certain types of information, rather than photographic memory.\n\nAround 1970, Charles Stromeyer studied his future wife, Elizabeth. He claimed that she could recall poetry written in a foreign language which she did not understand. She could remember the poetry years after she had first seen the poem. She also could, apparently, recall random dot patterns so as to combine two patterns into a stereoscopic image. She is the only person who is known to have passed such a test. The methods used in the testing procedures were not clear. Additionally, the tests have never been repeated (Elizabeth has consistently refused to repeat them).

He has won two Grammy Awards. \n\nAlthough he’s most known for his children’s poetry, he also was good at many other things. In the 1950s, while he was serving in the U.S. armed forces, Silverstein drew cartoons for the Pacific Stars and Stripes, an American military newspaper. He started writing and drawing cartoons for Playboy magazine in 1952. \n\nShel Silverstein also wrote plays. It was Ursula Nordstrom, a book editor, who suggested that he should write for children.\n\nSilverstein’s first book of poetry, \"Don’t Bump the Glump! and Other Fantasies\", was published in 1964. He’s most well-known for his books \"A Light in the Attic\", \"The Giving Tree\", and \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\". He has been compared to other writers, like A. A. Milne, Edward Lear, and Dr. Seuss. Shel Silverstein won multiple awards for his children’s poetry books. \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" won the Michigan Young Readers’ Award in 1981, and Silverstein also won the George C. Stone Center for Children’s Books Award twice in 1984. Two books of poetry were published after Shel Silverstein’s death, \"Runny Babbit\" and \"Every Thing on It\".\n\nSilverstein also had success writing songs. Some of his poetry was based off of songs he had written. \n\n\"A Boy Named Sue\" is a song written by Silverstein that was first made popular by Johnny Cash in 1969. That same year Silverstein also recorded it as a single on an album on RCA Records. It was produced by Chet Atkins.\n\nHe was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in both Chicago and in Florida. He died in Key West, Florida on May 10, 1999 after having a heart attack. He was 68 years old.

In 2006, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", published in 1998.\n\nTwo types of small RNA molecules – microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) – do the work.

RNA interference defends cells against foreign nucleotide sequences – viruses and transposons. Also, they control development, and gene expression in general.\n\nThe RNAi pathway is found in many eukaryotes including animals. RNAi is a valuable research tool, in cell culture and in living organisms. Synthetic dsRNA introduced into cells can suppress specific genes of interest.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362135", "text": "Lemma (linguistics)\n\nA lemma is word which stands at the head of a definition in a dictionary. All the head words in a dictionary are lemmas. Technically, it is \"a base word and its inflections\".\n\nA lemma is the word you find in the dictionary. A lexeme is a unit of meaning, and can be more than one word. A lexeme is the set of all forms that have the same meaning, while \"lemma\" refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme.\n\nIn English, for example, \"run\", \"runs\", \"ran\" and \"running\" are forms of the same lexeme, but \"run\" is the lemma. \n\nIn English, the lemma of a noun is the singular: e.g., \"mouse\" rather than \"mice\". In languages with gender, the head word of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular. If the language also has cases, the lemma is often the masculine singular nominative.\n\nIn many languages, the citation form of a verb is the infinitive: French \"aller\", German \"gehen\", Spanish \"ir\". In English it usually is the full infinitive (\"to go\") although alphabetized without 'to' (\"go\"). \n\nIn computational linguistics, a stem is the part of the word that never changes even when different forms of the word are used. A lemma is the base form of the verb. For example, from \"produced\", the lemma is \"produce\", but the stem is \"produc-\". This is because there are words such as production. When sound (phonology) is taken into account, the definition of the unchangeable part of the word is not so useful. Notice the sound of the words in the example: \"produced\" versus \"production\" .\n\nSome lexemes have several stems but one lemma. For instance \"to go\" (the lemma) has the stems \"go\" and \"went\". Here, the past tense is based on a different verb, \"to wend\". The \"-t\" suffix is equivalent to \"-ed\".\n", "id": "362135", "title": "Lemma (linguistics)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362249", "text": "Great Oxygenation Event\n\nThe Great Oxygenation Event (GOE) was the introduction of free oxygen into our atmosphere. It was caused by cyanobacteria doing photosynthesis. It took a very long time, from about three billion years ago to about one billion years ago.\n\nPhotosynthesis was producing oxygen both before and after the GOE. The difference was that before the GOE, organic matter and dissolved iron chemically captured any free oxygen. Dissolved iron (of which there was a great deal) became iron oxide and huge deposits of this are found as banded iron rock from the Archaean and Proterozoic eras. The GOE was the point when these minerals became saturated and could not capture any more oxygen. The excess free oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere.\n\nOxygen was toxic to most of the Earth's anaerobic inhabitants at the time. As cyanobacteria produced oxygen, and built their stromatolites, they changed the environment for other protists. Since the other protists had no way to deal with oxygen, most would have become extinct. Another consequence was the effect of free oxygen on atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas. The reaction removed the methane and caused the Huronian glaciation, possibly the longest snowball Earth episode ever. Free oxygen has been an important part of the atmosphere ever since.\n\nThe evidence is that free oxygen was first produced by photosynthetic organisms (prokaryotic, then eukaryotic) which emitted oxygen as a waste product. These organisms lived long before the GOE, perhaps 3500 million years ago (mya). The oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the 'mass rusting' which led to the deposition of banded-iron formations. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities shortly (~50 million years) before the start of the GOE. Without a draw-down, oxygen would accumulate very rapidly. At today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in the land-plant-free Precambrian), modern atmospheric O levels could be produced in around 2,000 years.\n\nSummary:\n", "id": "362249", "title": "Great Oxygenation Event"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362287", "text": "Toll-like receptor\n\nToll-like receptors (TLRs) are proteins which act in the innate immune system and the digestive system. They are membrane-spanning, that is, they reach from the outside of the cell to the inside. \n\nTLRs recognize molecules which come from microbes. Once microbes get through physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs. The TLRs set up an immune cell response.\n\nTLR signalling leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response. In all, thousands of genes are activated by TLR signalling, and the TLRs are one of the most important means of gene modulation.\n\nToll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.\n\nMost mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of Toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (TLR1 to TLR13) have been identified in humans and mice, and similar ones have been found in other mammalian species. TLRs are not identical in all mammals. For example, a gene coding for a protein like TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but seems to have been damaged at some time by a retrovirus. On the other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which is present in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs that are not found in humans. Non-mammalian species may have TLRs different from mammals.\n\nThey got their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the Toll gene identified in \"Drosophila\" in 1985 by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard. The gene in question, when mutated, makes the Drosophila flies look unusual. The researchers were so surprised that they spontaneously shouted out in German \"Das ist ja toll!\" which translates as \"That's great!\".\n\nToll-like receptors are now counted among the key molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of microbial infections. In 1996, \"Toll\" was found by Jules A. Hoffmann and his colleagues to have an essential role in the fly's immunity to fungal infection. It worked by activating the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. Plant homologues were discovered in 1995 (rice XA21), and 2000 (\"Arabidopsis\" FLS2).\n\nTLR 4 function as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing receptor was discovered by Bruce A. Beutler and colleagues. These workers proved that mice which could not respond to LPS had mutations which abolished the function of TLR4. This identified TLR4 as one of the key components of the receptor for LPS.\n", "id": "362287", "title": "Toll-like receptor"}

In the case of television commentary, the commentator is usually only heard and not often seen. In North American English, a commentator is also called an announcer or sportscaster. Often, the main commentator (called a play-by-play in North America) works with a color commentator and sometimes a sideline reporter. With big events, many sideline reporters are used. \n\nMost sports television broadcast have one play-by-play announcer and one color commentator. An example is NBC Sunday Night Football in the United States. It is called by Cris Collinsworth, a former American football receiver, and Al Michaels, a professional announcer. In the United Kingdom, there is not as much of a difference between play-by-play and color commentary. Two-man commentary teams usually have a person formal journalistic training but little or no sports experience leading the commentary, and an expert former (or current) competitor dealing with analysis. There are exceptions to this. All of the United Kingdom's major cricket and snooker commentators are former professionals in their sports. The well known Formula One racing commentator Murray Walker had no formal journalistic training and only a small amount of racing experience of his own.\n\nUsing a play-by-play announcer and one or more color commentators is standard . In the past it was much more common for a play-by-play announcer to work alone. \n\nAlthough sports broadcasts started in 1912, the first sports commentary was broadcast in April 1921. It was done by Florent Gibson of the Pittsburg Star newspaper. He was covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny \"Hutch\" Dundee at the Motor Square Garden, Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the United States, nearly all professional sports teams, most collegiate teams have their own Sports commentators. These people are usually thought of as the voice of the team on radio broadcasts. They are often considered a part of the team like the players or the coaches. Television networks and cable channels will also have their own group of play-by-play announcers that work with different teams.\n\n", "id": "362330", "title": "Sports commentator"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362382", "text": "Protein structure\n\nProtein structure describes how protein molecules are organised. This structure is what makes proteins work. \n\nProteins are important biological macromolecules present in all organisms. They are polymers formed from 20 possible amino acids by RNA translation. Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids.\n\nAfter translation, proteins fold into specific shapes. This is not done by chemical bonds but by weaker forces such as hydrogen bonds. To understand how proteins work, it is often necessary to discover their three-dimensional structure. To do this biophysics uses techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual polarisation interferometry.\n\nA protein may switch from one shape to another as it does its job. The alternative states of the same protein are called conformations. An enzyme, for instance, will have at least two conformations: one with its co-enzyme and one without. The form with its coenzyme will have two conformations: one with its substrate and one without.\n\nThere are four distinct levels of protein structure.\n\nProteins are molecules that consist of one or more chains of amino acids. Each different protein has a distinct set of amino acids in a particular order. The primary structure refers to the sequence of the amino acids of a single polypeptide chain from its start (N-terminus) to its end (C-terminus). The amino acids are held together by a specific type of covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which are made during the process of protein biosynthesis or translation. \n\nSecondary structure refers to parts of the protein chain that form regular structures. There are two main types of secondary structure: alpha helix and beta strand (beta sheet). Alpha helices are coils that turn in a clockwise rotation and beta strands form a beta sheet where the chains lie along side each other. The two types of secondary structure were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. Unlike the polypeptide chain, which is bonded through covalent peptide bonds, secondary structure is formed by hydrogen bonds.\n\nThis is the shape (spatial organization) of an entire protein molecule. Protein folding is largely self-organising. It is mainly done by the protein's primary structure its sequence of amino acids. This is called Anfinsen's dogma. However, the environment in which a protein is synthesized and folds also effect its final shape.\n\nIf proteins are built of sub-units this gives another level of structure. This, the quaternary structure, is how the subunits fit together. Haemoglobin, for example, has two alpha and two beta chains. Both the alpha chains and beta chains are coded for by a cluster of six or seven genes, which provide the code for different versions of the molecule.\n\n", "id": "362382", "title": "Protein structure"}

At the time it was called First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It was played on January 15, 1967 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California. The National Football League (NFL) champion Green Bay Packers defeated the American Football League (AFL) champion Kansas City Chiefs. The score was 35–10.\n\nSuper Bowl I was the only Super Bowl in history that was not a sellout in terms of attendance. Of the 94,000 seat capacity in the Coliseum, 33,000 went unsold.\n\nThe game was broadcast on NBC and CBS. It is the only Super Bowl to be on two television networks. Each network used its own announcers. Ray Scott, Jack Whitaker, and Frank Gifford were on CBS. Curt Gowdy and Paul Christman were on NBC.\n\nThe Chiefs entered the game after an 11-2-1 during the regular season. In the AFL Championship Game, they beat the Buffalo Bills, 31-7.\n\nKansas City's offense led the AFL in points scored (448) and total rushing yards (2,274). Their trio of running backs, Mike Garrett (801 yards), Bert Coan (521 yards), and Curtis McClinton (540 yards) all ranked among the top ten rushers in the AFL. Quarterback Len Dawson was the top rated passer in the AFL. He completed 159 out of 284 (56 percent) of his passes for 2,527 yards and 26 touchdowns. Wide receiver Otis Taylor had 58 receptions of 1,297 yards and 8touchdowns. Receiver Chris Burford added 58 receptions for 758 yards and 8 touchdowns. \n\nThe Chiefs also had a strong defense. All-AFL players Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan were on their line. Linebacker Bobby Bell was great at run stopping and pass coverage. The strongest part of their defense was their secondary, led by All-AFL safeties Johnny Robinson and Bobby Hunt, who each recorded 10 interceptions, and defensive back Fred Williamson, who recorded 4. Their Head Coach was Hank Stram.\n\nThe Packers were an NFL dynasty. They turned around what had been a losing team just eight years earlier. The team posted an NFL-worst 1–10–1 record in 1958. Then legendary head coach Vince Lombardi was hired in January 1959. Lombardi wanted to build a winning team. During the offseason, he signed Fred \"Fuzzy\" Thurston. Lombardi also made a big trade with the Cleveland Browns that brought three players to the team. These players became an important part of the defense: linemen Henry Jordan, Willie Davis, and Bill Quinlan.\n\nLombardi's hard work paid off. The Packers improved to a 7–5 regular season record in 1959. They surprised the league during the following year by making it all the way to the 1960 NFL Championship Game. The Packers lost 17–13 to the Philadelphia Eagles. But they showed that they were no longer losers. Green Bay went on to win NFL Championships in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967.\n\nPackers quarterback Bart Starr was the top-rated quarterback in the NFL for 1966. He won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award, completing 156 out of 251 (62.2 percent) passes for 2,257 yards, 14 touchdowns, and only 3 interceptions. His top targets were wide receivers Boyd Dowler and Carroll Dale. They combined for 63 receptions for 1,336 yards. Fullback Jim Taylor was the team's top rusher with 705 yards, and also caught 41 passes for 331 yards. The Packers offensive line was also big reason for the team's success. They were led by All-Pro guards Jerry Kramer and Thurston, along with Forrest Gregg.\n\nThe first Super Bowl halftime show had American trumpeter Al Hirt, and the marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling State University. \n\nThe postgame, trophy presentation ceremony was handled by CBS' Pat Summerall and NBC's George Ratterman. Summerall and Ratterman had to share a single microphone.\n", "id": "362692", "title": "Super Bowl I"}

Canyons, ravines, gullies and other such geological forms are common in badlands. They are very difficult to cross by foot, on horse, or by car. Dry badlands may have spectacular colour displays that range from dark black/blue coal strata to bright clays and sandstone.\n\nThe term 'badlands' is apt: badlands have steep slopes, loose dry soil, slick clay, and deep sand, all of which act against travel and other uses. They form in dry regions with infrequent but intense rain-showers, little vegetation, and soft sediments which get massive erosion.\n\nSome of the most famous fossil beds are found in badlands, where erosion rapidly exposes the sedimentary layers and the scant cover of vegetation makes surveying and fossil hunting relatively easy.\n\nCoal seams get exposed in some badlands, so some coal mining districts have developed in badlands areas. An example of this is the Drumheller district of the Red Deer River in Alberta, where the Atlas Coal Mine historical site shows the last of 139 mines which operated in the badlands.\n\nSome of the best-known badland formations can be found in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., Makoshika State Park in Montana, Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota and Badlands National Park in South Dakota together form a series of extensive badland formations. Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado and Utah are also badlands settings.\n\nThe Big Muddy Badlands in Saskatchewan, Canada, gained notoriety as a hideout for outlaws. There is a large badland area in Alberta, Canada, particularly in the valley of the Red Deer River (where Dinosaur Provincial Park is) and in Drumheller, Alberta where the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology is.\n\nA well-known badlands formation in New Zealand, the Putangirua Pinnacles – formed by the erosion of the conglomerate of an old river delta – are at the head of a small valley near the southern tip of the North Island.\n", "id": "363163", "title": "Badlands"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363216", "text": "The Jungle Book (1967 movie)\n\nThe Jungle Book is a 1967 American animated movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was released on October 18, 1967. It is the 19th animated movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. It was inspired by the stories about the feral child Mowgli from the book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling. It was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. It was the last to be produced by Walt Disney, who died during its production.\n\nThe early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely. There was a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone which Disney did not want in his family movie. The first writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson were replaced. The casting employed famous actors and musicians Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, George Sanders and Louis Prima, as well as Disney regulars such as Sterling Holloway, and the director's son, Bruce Reitherman, as Mowgli. \"The Jungle Book\" was released to positive reception., with much acclaim to its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, \"The Bare Necessities\". The movie made over $73 million in the United States in its first release, and as much again from two re-releases.\n\nAfter the movie's success, Disney later released a live-action remake and a theatrical sequel, \"The Jungle Book 2\".\n\nMowgli, a young orphan boy, is found in a basket in the deep jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. Bagheera, a black panther, discovers the baby. He takes him to a mother Indian Wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs. Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted with jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, playing with his wolf siblings.\n\nOne night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating Bengal tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the \"man village\" for his own safety. Bagheera volunteers to take him back.\n\nThey leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle. He and Bagheera rest in a tree for the night, when Kaa, a hungry Indian Python, appears and hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils and tries to devour him, but fails when Bagheera intervenes. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol led by Colonel Hathi and his wife Winifred. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue. This results in Bagheera leaving Mowgli on his own. Mowgli soon meets up with the laid-back, fun-loving sloth bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises to raise Mowgli himself and never take him back to the Man-Village.\n\nMowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shortly afterwards, Baloo is tricked and outsmarted by a gang of monkeys who kidnap Mowgli. They take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan, who makes a deal with Mowgli that if he tells him the secret of making fire like a human, then he will make it so he can stay in the jungle. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the following chaos, King Louie's palace is destroyed. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the man village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off on foot in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol to make a search party. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself. Meanwhile, Mowgli has encountered Kaa once again in a different tree. The hungry python exacts his revenge by hypnotizing Mowgli again, and tries to eat him, but thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan, Mowgli awakens again, tricks the snake again, and escapes.\n\nAs a storm gathers, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of puckish but friendly vultures who closely resemble The Beatles. They agree to be his friends as they too are outcasts, and feel that everyone has to have friends. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the Vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is injured. When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it on fire, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan while Mowgli gathers flaming branches and ties them to Shere Khan's tail. As fire is his only fear, the tiger panics and runs off.\n\nBagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. His mind soon changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she \"accidentally\" drops her water pot, and Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the man village. After Mowgli chooses to stay in the man village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.\n\n\nAsterisks mark actors listed in the opening credits as \"Additional Voices\".\nAfter \"The Sword in the Stone\" was released, storyman Bill Peet claimed to Walt Disney that \"we [The animation department] can do more interesting animal characters\" and suggested that Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" could be used for the studio's next movie. Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" and \"The Sword in the Stone\". However, after the disappointing reaction to \"The Sword in the Stone\", Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two movies, with his nephew Roy E. Disney saying that \"[he] certainly influenced everything about it. (...) With \"Jungle Book\", he obviously got hooked on the jungle and the characters that lived there.\"\n\nPeet decided to follow closely the dramatic, dark, and sinister tone of Kipling's book. The book is about the struggles between animals and man. However, the writer decided make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going back and forth from the jungle to the man village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the man village should be the ending for the movie. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: Shanti, the human girl with whom Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was originally a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from \"The Second Jungle Book\", gold and jewels under his ruins - after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not happy with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.<ref name=bare/\n\nDisney then assigned Larry Clemmons as his new writer and one of the four story men for the movie, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: \"The first thing I want you to do is not to read it.\" Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a movie script. Clemmons wanted to start in media res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - \"Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's estabilish the characters. Let's have fun with it.\" Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final movie. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple he and that the characters should drive the story. Disney took an active role in the story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most scenes. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other.\n\n\"The Jungle Book\" also marks the last animated movie from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.\n\nMany familiar voices inspired the animators in their creation of the characters and helped them shape their personalities. This use of familiar voices for major characters was a rarity in Disney's past movies. The staff was shocked to hear that a wise cracking comedian, Phil Harris was going to be in a Kipling movie. Disney suggested Harris after meeting him at a party. Harris improvised most of his lines, as he considered the scripted lines \"didn't feel natural\". After Harris was cast, Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louie Prima as King Louie, as he \"felt that Louis would be great as foil\". Walt also cast other famous actors such as George Sanders as Shere Khan and Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera. Additionally, he cast regular Disney voices such as Sterling Holloway as Kaa, J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Hathi's wife. This was her last movie before she died. David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the \"young innocence of Mowgli's character\" which the producers were aiming at anymore. Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\". The animators shot footage of Bruce as a guide for the character's performance. Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of Shanti's song \"My Own Home\". Carr's performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as Shanti.\n\nIn the original book, the vultures are grim and evil characters who feast on the dead. Disney lightened it up by having the vultures bearing a physical and vocal resemblance to The Beatles, including the signature mop-top haircut. It was also planned to have the members of the band to both voice the characters and sing their song, \"That's What Friends Are For\". However, scheduling conflicts, added to John Lennon reacting badly, lead to the idea being discarded. The casting of the vultures still brought a British Invasion musician, Chad Stuart of the duo Chad & Jeremy. In earlier drafts of the scene the vultures had a near-sighted Rhinoceros friend named Rocky, who was to be voiced by Frank Fontaine, however Walt decided to cut the character for feeling that the movie had already much action with the monkeys and vultures.\n\nWhile many of the later Disney movies had animators being responsible for single characters, in \"The Jungle Book\" the animators were in charge of whole scenes, since many have characters interacting with one another. The animation was done by xerography, with character design, lead by Ken Anderson, employing rough, artistic edges in contrast to the round animals seen in productions such as \"Dumbo\". Anderson also decided to make Shere Khan resemble his voice actor, George Sanders. Backgrounds were hand-painted - with exception of the waterfall, mostly consisting of footage of the Angel Falls - and sometimes scenery was used in both foreground and bottom to create a notion of depth. Following one of Reitherman's trademarks of reusing animation of his previous movies, the wolf cubs are based on dogs from \"101 Dalmatians\". Animator Milt Kahl based Bagheera and Shere Kahn's movements on live-action felines, which he saw in two Disney productions, \"A Tiger Walks\" and the \"Jungle Cat\" episode of \"True-Life Adventures\". Baloo was also based on footage of bears, even incorporating the animal's liking for scratching. Since Kaa has no limbs, its design got big expressive eyes, and parts of Kaa's body did the action that normally would be done with hands. The monkeys' dance during \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" was partially inspired by a performance Louis Prima did with his band at Disney's soundstage to convince Walt Disney to cast him.\n\nThe instrumental music was written by George Bruns and orchestrated by Walter Sheets. Two of the cues were reused from previous Disney movies. The scene where Mowgli wakes up after escaping King Louie used one of Bruns' themes for \"Sleeping Beauty\"; and the scene where Bagheera gives a eulogy to Baloo when he mistakenly thinks the bear was killed by Shere Khan used Paul J. Smith's organ score from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\".\n\nThe score features eight original songs: seven by the Sherman Brothers and one by Terry Gilkyson. Longtime Disney collaborator Gilkyson was the first songwriter to bring several complete songs which followed the book closely but Walt Disney felt that his efforts were too dark. The only piece of Gilkyson's work that made it to the final movie was his upbeat tune \"The Bare Necessities\", which was liked by the rest of the movie crew. The Sherman Brothers were then brought in to do a complete rewrite. Disney asked the siblings if they had read Kipling's book and they replied that they had done so \"a long, long time ago\" and that they had also seen the 1942 version by Alexander Korda. Disney said the \"nice, mysterious, heavy stuff\" from both works was not what he aimed for, instead going for a \"lightness, a Disney touch\". Disney frequently brought the composers to the storyline sessions.\nHe asked them to \"find scary places and write fun songs\" for their compositions that fit in with the story and advanced the plot instead of being interruptive.\n\n\"The Jungle Book\" was released in October 1967, just 10 months after Walt's death. Some copies were in a double feature with \"Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar\". The movie was a success, earning $73 million in just its domestic release, mostly due to the popularity of its musical numbers. The movie was re-released theatrically in North America three times, 1978, 1984, and 1990, and also in Europe throughout the 1980s. The total money made is $141 million in the United States and $205 million worldwide. The North American total, after adjustments for inflation, is estimated to be the 29th highest grossing movie of all time in the United States.\n\n\"The Jungle Book\" was released in the United States on VHS in 1991 as part of the Walt Disney Classics product line, and in 1997 as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection for the movie's 30th anniversary. A Limited Issue DVD was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1999. The movie was released once again as a 2-disc Platinum Edition DVD on October 2, 2007 in honor of its 40th anniversary. The Platinum DVD was put on moratorium in 2010.\n\n\"The Jungle Book\" received an outpouring of positive reviews upon release, undoubtedly influenced by a nostalgic reaction to the passing of Walt. \"Time\" noted that the movie strayed far from the Kipling stories, but \"the result is thoroughly delightful...it is the happiest possible way to remember Walt Disney.\" \"The New York Times\" called it \"a perfectly dandy cartoon feature,\" and \"Life\" magazine described it as \"the best thing of its kind since \"Dumbo\", another short, bright, unscary and blessedly uncultivated cartoon.\" Some negative reviews came from Judith Crist, who said the movie was \"devoid of mood or atmosphere.\" \"Variety\"s review was generally positive, but they said that \"the story development is restrained\" and that younger audiences \"may squirm at times.\"\n\nRetrospective reviews were also positive, with the movie's animation, characters and music receiving much praise throughout the years. In 1990, when the movie had its last theatrical re-release, \"Entertainment Weekly\" considered that \"The Jungle Book\" \"isn't a classic Walt Disney film on the order of, say, \"Cinderella\" or \"Pinocchio\", but it's one of Disney's liveliest and funniest\", while the \"Los Angeles Times\" thought the movie's crew was \"near the height of their talents\" and the resulting movie \"remains a high-spirited romp that will delight children--and parents weary of action films with body counts that exceed their box-office grosses.\" In 2010, \"Empire\" described the movie as one that \"gets pretty much everything right\", regarding that the vibrant animation and catchy songs overcame the plot deficiencies.\n\nThe song \"The Bare Necessities\" was nominated for Best Song at the 40th Academy Awards. It lost to \"Talk to the Animals\" from \"Doctor Dolittle\". Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president Gregory Peck wanted this movie to be nominated for Best Picture, but he was unsuccessful.\n\n\nIn 1968, Disneyland Records released the album \"More Jungle Book\", an unofficial sequel also written by screenwriter Larry Simmons, which continued the story of the movie, and included Phil Harris and Louis Prima voicing their film roles. In the record, Baloo (Harris) is missing Mowgli (Ginny Tyler), so he teams up with King Louie (Prima) and Bagheera (Dal McKennon) to take him from the man village. On February 14, 2003, DisneyToon Studios in Australia released a movie sequel, \"The Jungle Book 2\", in which Mowgli runs away from the man village to see his animal friends, unaware that Shere Khan is more determined to kill him than ever.\n\nElements of \"The Jungle Book\" were recycled in the later Disney animated movie \"Robin Hood\" due to that movie's limited budget, such as Baloo being inspiration for Little John (who not only was a bear, but also voiced by Phil Harris). In particular, the dance sequence between Baloo and King Louie was simply rotoscoped for Little John and Lady Cluck's dance. It has been widely praised by animators, with Eric Goldberg declaring \"The Jungle Book\" \"boasts possibly the best character animation a studio has ever done\". The animators of \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\" and \"Lilo & Stitch\" claimed to have taken some inspiration from the design and animation of the movie, and four people involved with Disney's animations, director Brad Bird and animators Andreas Deja, Glen Keane and Sergio Pablos, have declared the movie to be their inspiration for entering the business.\n\nMany characters appear in the 1990-91 animated series \"TaleSpin\". Between 1996 and 1998, the TV series \"Jungle Cubs\" told the stories of Baloo, Hahti, Bagheera, Louie, Kaa, and Shere Khan when they were children.\n\nDisney later made a live-action remake of the movie, which was more of a realistic action-adventure movie with somewhat-more adult themes. The movie, released in 1994, differs even more from the book than the animated version, but was still a box-office success. In 1998, Disney released a direct to video film called \"\".\n\nThere are two video games based on the film: \"The Jungle Book\" was a platformer released in 1993-4 for Master System, Mega Drive, Game Gear, Super NES, Game Boy and PC. A version for the Game Boy Advance was later released in 2003. \"The Jungle Book Groove Party\" was a dance mat game released in 2000 for PlayStation and PlayStation 2. Kaa and Shere Khan have also made cameo appearances in another Disney video game, \"Quackshot\". A world based on the movie was intended to appear more than once in the Square Enix-Disney \"Kingdom Hearts\" video game series, but was omitted both times, first in the first game because it featured a similar world based on \"Tarzan\", and second in \"\", presumably due to time constraints, although areas of the world are accessible via hacking codes in the latter.\n\nSince the movie's release, many of the movie's characters appeared in \"House of Mouse\", \"The Lion King 1½\", \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", and \"Aladdin and the King of Thieves\".\n\nAn artwork by British artist Banksy featuring the jungle book characters which had been commissioned by Greenpeace to help raise awareness of deforestation has gone on sale for the sum of £80,000 pounds sterling.\n\n", "id": "363216", "title": "The Jungle Book (1967 movie)"}

It was designed in 1925-1929 by the Scottish city planner Sir Patrick Geddes. This program designed the center of Tel Aviv and the area now known as \"Old North\".\n\nIn 1925 Patrick Geddes was commissioned to design a master plan for the city of Tel Aviv. The plan he produced was accepted in 1929. Tel Aviv turned out to be the only example of one of Geddes’ plans being built largely as he envisaged and is a good example of an early planned city. The area of Tel Aviv originally planned by Geddes makes up approximately 7.5% of the current day municipality of Tel Aviv and is now known as Tel Aviv’s “Old North”. It was designed to be an extension of the much older neighboring Arabic port town Jaffa to the south and a home for the increasing population of Jews emigrating from other parts of the world (predominantly Eastern Europe).\n\nGeddes, originally as biologist and sociologist was engaged to design a plan for the new city of Tel Aviv to be built adjacent to the ancient port town of Jaffa. The principles he employed for the city were strikingly similar to what we now know as New Urbanism ideas of planning - an emphasis was placed on pedestrians as opposed to motor car traffic, a sense of community and civic life was encouraged through the use of town squares and abundant planting of greenery provided significant focus on a minimal environmental footprint. Private automobile traffic was minimised and the city was envisaged on a pedestrian-scale. This neighborhood identity has been crucial in the success of Tel Aviv as a city.\n\nAnother important aspect of Geddes plan was the use of the “super block,” which was popular in the early to mid 20th century with its origins in the modernist movement. The main principles was to create extra large blocks bounded by major rather than minor roads, and have them threaded with narrow one way streets designed in such a way to discourage through traffic. The aim of these superblocks was to foster community and a sense of civic life within them. In order to achieved this it was planned that at the centre of each block was meant to be a central public space (a garden or public building). In reality the commercial factors resulted in few of these central squares being captured for public use.\n\nGeddes took part of his inspiration from the Garden City movement developed by Ebenezer Howard, he was keen to ensure that greenery was an integral part of the Tel Aviv landscame. To this end, under his plan buildings were restricted to taking up a maximum of only one third of any given site, these restrictions aimed to ensure maximum potential for neighborhoods well endowed with lush greenery.\n\nGeddes did not prescribe a certain architectural style for the area, traditionally a city planned of along the lines of the British Garden City Movement would aim for an architectural style based on the traditional style for the region. Geddes recognised that the majority of the population he was designing for would be immigrants from Europe and other parts of the world. He encouraged the development of a distinctly ‘Jewish style’. Interestingly Geddes provide little more that this style recommendations in his planning report.\n\nOver the following decades after Geddes plan was realised the area began to decay and theer was significant public lament and dissatisfaction with the decay of the city. This deterioration was later used as justification for the rapid redevelopment of the area in the 1950s. However it was noted that this disapproval of the decay of the city quickly changed to nostalgia when old buildings began being razed to make way for new development. Resultantly significant effort was made to preserve the historical neighborhoods planned by Geddes and in 1984 the Council for the Preservation of buildings and Sites was established to protect them.\n\nCritics of Tel Aviv’s layout have suggested it is not a beautiful city in the classic sense. A low standard of construction and of housing units (apartment buildings) has largely been blamed for this, citing that the buildings developed were ugly and akin to stacks of packing cases with shoeboxes for balconies.\n\nFurther criticism has been put that the city has not coped well with the increasing population and private car traffic not envisaged by Geddes at the time. Poor building construction and lack of proper maintenances have served as further critiques of the early city planning.\n\nNotwithstanding these criticisms of Geddes planning of Tel Aviv, while not immune to the modern problems of traffic and development that all cities today face, Tel Aviv is widely regarded as a successful city and symbol of modern day Israel.\n\n", "id": "363303", "title": "Geddes Plan for Tel Aviv"}

In many types of wood, the time rings were formed can be dated to the exact calendar year. \n\nDendrochronology has three main uses: \n\nIn some parts of the world, it is possible to date wood back a few thousand years, or even many thousands. The maximum for \"fully anchored chronologies\" is a little over 11,000 years from present. The term \"fully anchored chronology\" means the dates are absolutely certain.\n\nDendrochronology (word derived from Greek , \"dendron\", \"tree limb\"; , \"khronos\", \"time\"; and , \"-logia\") was developed during the first half of the 20th century originally by the astronomer A.E. Douglass, who founded the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. Douglass researched sunspot activity. He expected changes in solar activity would affect climate patterns on Earth. The climate would be recorded by tree-ring growth patterns.\n\nThe phenomenon of tree rings and their relationship with wet and dry years had been noticed before Douglass. There is a brief note in one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, and Charles Babbage in 1837 came up with the same idea.\n\nMany trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. Through a tree's life, a year-by-year ring pattern is formed which reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one. \n\nAlternating poor and favorable conditions, such as mid summer droughts, can result in several rings forming in a given year. Problems like this are fixed by comparing one part of the world with another. Missing rings are rare in oak and elm trees: the only recorded instance of a missing ring in oak trees occurred in the year 1816, also known as the Year without a Summer. \n\nTrees from the same region will tend to develop the same patterns of ring widths for a given period. These patterns can be compared and matched ring for ring with trees growing in the same geographical zone and under similar climatic conditions. Following these tree-ring patterns from living trees back through time, chronologies can be built up, both for entire regions, and for sub-regions of the world. Thus wood from ancient structures can be matched to known chronologies (a technique called cross-dating) and the age of the wood determined precisely. \n\nThe tree-ring dates can be extended back to 26,000 BP by using other methods. Those other methods use marine sediment layers and growth rings in corals.\n", "id": "363402", "title": "Dendrochronology"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=363539", "text": "Natural killer cell\n\nNatural killer cells (or NK cells) are a type of lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system. NK cells provide a rapid response to cells infected by viruses, or to bacterial cells. The response happens about 3 days after infection. NK cells also respond to tumour formation. \n\nNK cells are unique: they have the ability to recognise stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This allows for a much faster immune reaction.\n\nIn early experiments in cancer patients and animals, investigators found what was called a \"natural\" reactivity. That is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to kill tumour cells without previously being sensitized to them. At first many thought that these observations were artifacts. However, by 1973, 'natural killing' activity was established across a wide variety of species, and the existence of a separate line of cells with this ability was suggested.\n\nTo control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells have two types of surface receptors: activating receptors and inhibitory receptors. When the NK cell is activated, it destroys the cells which have switched it on. \n\nSmall granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins and enzymes called granzymes. They are released close to a cell which has triggered their action. A protein \"perforin\" forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating a channel through which enzymes and other molecules can enter. This kills the target cell. The details vary according to whether the target is a virus, a bacterium or a tumour cell.\n\nClass I MHC i can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and certain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing.These inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I molecules, which could explain why NK cells kill cells with low levels of MHC class I molecules. This inhibition is crucial to the role played by NK cells. MHC class I molecules are main way cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T-cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this seen in both intracellular microbes and tumours is a long-term down-regulation of these MHC I molecules. This makes the cells impervious to T-cell action. NK cells may have evolved as an evolutionary response: the loss of MHC would deprive these cells of the inhibitory effect of MHC and make them vulnerable to NK cell attack.\n\nThe \"adaptive\" immune response generates memory cells after a primary infection. Then there is a rapid response to later infections by the same antigen. Earlier it was thought that NK cells play no role in the adaptive immune responses, but now it seems they do.\n", "id": "363539", "title": "Natural killer cell"}

In August, German general Lothar von Trotha defeated the Herero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of thirst. In October, the Nama people also rebelled against the Germans only to suffer a similar fate.\n\nIn total, from 24,000 up to 100,000 Herero and 10,000 Nama died. The genocide was characterized by widespread death by starvation and thirst because the Herero who fled the violence were prevented from returning from the Namib Desert. Some sources also claim that the German colonial army systematically poisoned desert wells.\n\nIn 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South-West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century.

The oxygen removed the free methane, and used up carbon dioxide. This caused the temperature to crash. This slowed down the bacteria.

It was first known as \"zygaena lewini\", but is now known as \"Sphyrna lewini\". The word \"Sphyrna\" is a Greek word meaning \"hammer\", which refers to the \"hammer\" or \"cephalofoil\" on its head.\n\nIt is also known as the \"bronze hammerhead\", the \"kidney-headed hammerhead\", or the \"southern hammerhead\". It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46° N and 36° S. It is the most common Hammerhead shark.\n\nLike all other hammerhead sharks, the scalloped hammerhead has a \"hammer\", which is known as the \"cephalofoil\", on its head. The shark's eyes and nostrils are placed on the ends of the cephalofoil. Scalloped hammerheads usually grow to the length of 1.5 to 2.7 meters long, but the longest found was 4.3 meters long. The heaviest ever found weighed 150 kilograms. They are usually olive, bronze, light brown, grey-brown or even silver-grey in colour with a white belly. The edges of the fins are usually darker on the young, but as they grow older they become more lighter.\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead was first known as \"Zygaena lewini\". It was renamed \"Sphyrna lewini\" in 1834. It has also been known as \"Cestracion leeuwenii\" in 1865, \"Zygaena erythraea\" in 1871, \"Cestracion oceanica\" in 1913, and \"Sphyrna diplana\" in 1941. The word \"Sphyrna\" is a Greek word meaning \"hammer\". It refers to the shape of the shark's head.\n\nThe scalloped hammerhead is a coastal pelagic species. It is found in continental and insular shelves, and in nearby deeper water. It is found in warm temperate and tropical coastal waters all around the world, between latitudes 46° north and 36° south. It can be found down to depths of over 500 metres (1,600 ft) but is mostly found above 25 metres (82 ft).\n\nDuring the daytime, they are usually found close to shore. At night, they hunt further from the shore. Adults are usually found alone, in pairs or in small groups, The young are found in larger groups of up to one hundred or even more members. Although scalloped hammerheads are said to be harmless towards humans, there has been reports of attacks from this shark. These attacks could be caused from the great hammerhead shark.\n\nScalloped hammerheads feed on fish such as sardines, mackerel, and herring. They sometimes eat cephalopods like octopuses and squids. They have also been known to eat other smaller species of sharks like the Blacktip reef shark, \"Carcharhinus melanopterus\", and the Atlantic sharpnose shark, \"(Rhizoprionodon terraenovae)\".\n\nScalloped hammerheads are viviparous. Females are pregnant for 9 to 10 months before giving birth to 15 to 30 pups. Young ones grow slowly compared to other sharks. They also have darker fins than adults.\n\nIn 2008, the scalloped hammerhead was placed on the \"globally endangered\" list. Research has shown that in some parts of the Atlantic Ocean, populations have decreased by 95% in the last 30 years. The reason for this is because of over-fishing for shark fins. Their fins are made into shark fin soup. Researchers are calling for a ban on Shark finning, which is when the fin's of sharks are cut off and the rest of the animal is thrown back into the water to die. Hammerhead sharks are the most commonly caught sharks for finning.\n\n", "id": "364021", "title": "Scalloped hammerhead"}

It was designed by clergyman's daughter and children's author Anne Abbott. The game was published by W. & S. B. Ives in 1843. Parker Brothers republished the game in 1894. The firm claimed the game was the first board game published in America, but this claim is disputed. It was however the first mass-produced board game in America.\n\nThe game is didacticit is both entertaining and instructive. The theme of the game is Christian virtue. Players race about a track of 66 spaces. \"The Mansion of Happiness\" (Heaven, the center space) is their goal. Landing on a space marked with a vice (such as dishonesty) will send the player back several spaces and away from the goal. Spaces marked with virtues (such as honesty) send players forward and closer to the goal. The winner is the player who reaches the center space first.\n\nLike many Christian-themed games of the middle 19th-century, \"The Mansion of Happiness\" lost some of its popularity in the last decades of the 19th century. It was then that games with secular and materialistic themes such as Milton Bradley's \"The Checkered Game of Life\" rose in demand. In literature, \"The Mansion of Happiness\" is mentioned in the boys' book \"Shifting for Himself; or, Gilbert Greyson's Fortunes\" (1876) by Horatio Alger, Jr. In this story, the title hero plays the game with friends Laura and Fred Vivian to while away the evening hours. In 2012 the game board was available on-line in a color reprint of the original. \n\n", "id": "364062", "title": "The Mansion of Happiness"}

It likes to live in muddy habitats. Like all other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark has a \"hammer\" (also known as the \"cephalofoil\") on its head.\n\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark is a small member of the hammerhead shark group, reaching up to the length of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long, but ones which are 1.2-1.3 meters (3.9-4.3 ft) long are more common. They weigh around 9 kg. The cephalofoil is wide and long, measuring up to 28-32% of the body length. The eyes, which are placed at the ends of the cephalofoil, are smaller than the eyes of other hammerhead sharks and have a third eyelid. The nostrils are placed inside the eyes.\n\nYoung smalleye hammerhead sharks are grey on the top and are white below. When they reach the length of 45 cm (18 in) their undersides start turning yellow, which turns to orange when they are 50 cm (20 in) long. The golden colour then comes when they are 55–70 cm (22–28 in) long, but fades when they become mature.\n\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark is found along the eastern coast of South America, from Uruguay to Venezuela, but it is sometimes found further west than the Orinoco Delta southeast of Trinidad. They have been unconfirmed reports of this shark being found off Panama, Mexico, and western Florida. It is the most common shark of where it lives. The smalleye hammerhead shark also is found in inshore murky waters which are 5-40 meters (16-130 ft) deep. Newborns and young ones which are under 40 cm (16 in) long, are found in the shallowest waters, and move deeper as they grow older. Adult females are mostly found in water which is 9-18 meters (30-59 ft) deep, while adult males are mostly found at the depths of 27-36 meters (89–118 ft).\n\nThere are four other species of hammerhead sharks which live in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark lives: the scoophead, the bonnethead, the great hammerhead shark and the scalloped hammerhead shark. There is little competition between these sharks because of their different habitats and eating. Adult males and young ones of both genders come together and form groups, although these groups to not seem to be made for reproduction or migration. Adult females seem to live alone.\n\nYoung smalleye hammerhead sharks which are under the length of 67 cm (26 inches) feed mostly on penaeid shrimp, while larger ones feed mainly on bony fish, especially ariid sea catfish and their eggs. The shrimp and the surface mucus layer and eggs of the catfish contain carotenoid pigments which seem to cause the golden colour of the shark. Another shark which lives in the same area as the smalleye hammerhead shark, the Yellow smooth-hound (\"Mustelus higmani\"), also feeds on shrimp and has a yellowish colour on it, but it is not as bright as the colour on the smalleye hammerhead shark. The smalleye hammerhead shark is also known to eat swimming crabs, squid, and newborn scalloped hammerhead sharks.\n\nThe smalleye hammerhead shark has been known to be eaten by larger sharks such as the bull shark (\"Carcharhinus leucas\"), and sometimes it has been eaten by bony fishes.\n\nLike most other hammerhead sharks, the smalleye hammerhead shark is viviparous, meaning that it gives live birth. They mate in August and September and females are pregnant for around 10 months before giving birth to 5-12 pups in May and June. Males and females mature when they are 80 to 98 cm (31 to 39 inches) long. But male smalleye hammerhead sharks found off the northern Brazilian state of Maranhão mature when they are 92 cm (36 cm) long, while females mature when they are over 101 cm (40 in) long.\n\nShy and harmless towards humans, smalleye hammerhead sharks are fished throughout its range and is sold as food. Overfishing has now caused populations of the smalleye hammerhead shark to decrease. This has led the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to list it under Vulnerable.\n\n", "id": "364112", "title": "Smalleye hammerhead shark"}

It was the first portrait gallery in the world when it opened in 1856. \n\nThe gallery moved in 1896 to its current site at St Martin's Place, off Trafalgar Square, next to the National Gallery. It has been expanded twice since then. The National Portrait Gallery also has three regional outposts. It is not connected to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The NPG is a quango sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nThe gallery houses portraits of historically important and famous British people, selected on the basis of the significance of the sitter, not that of the artist. The collection includes photographs and caricatures as well as paintings, drawings and sculpture. \n\nOne of its best-known images is the 'Chandos portrait', the most famous portrait of William Shakespeare although there is some uncertainty about whether the painting actually is of the playwright.\n\nNot all of the portraits are exceptional artistically, although there are self-portraits by William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds and other British artists of note. Some, such as the group portrait of the participants in the Somerset House Conference of 1604, are important historical documents in their own right. Often, the curiosity value is greater than the artistic worth of a work, as in the case of the portrait of Edward VI by William Scrots, Patrick Brontë's painting of his sisters Charlotte, Emily and Anne, or a sculpture of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in medieval costume. Portraits of living figures were allowed from 1969. \n\nIn addition to its permanent galleries of historical portraits, the National Portrait Gallery exhibits a rapidly changing collection of contemporary work, stages exhibitions of portrait art by individual artists and hosts the annual BP Portrait Prize competition.\n\nThe Gallery has many portrait busts by sculptors.

His family is of French and Scottish heritage. In 1853 he went to Jefferson Medical college in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated in 1855. He finished his studies in Havana and in Paris. Later he moved to Havana and started a medical practice.\n\nFinlay continued his work in the 1870s. He was the first to come up with the idea that a mosquito was a carrier for a disease that causes yellow fever. He discovered that the spread and cause of yellow fever was from a mosquito. The mosquito would bite a person with the disease and would then bite and infect a healthy person. A year later Finlay identified the mosquito of the genus Aedes as the insect transmitting yellow fever. His research led to the control of the mosquito population as a way to control the spread of the disease.\n\nDr. Finlay was a member of Havana's Royal Academy of Medical, Physical and Natural Sciences. He was fluent in French, German, Spanish, and English, and could read Latin. He was interested in a lot of things but his main interest was yellow fever. He wrote 40 articles on this disease. His theory was that an intermediary host was responsible for the spread of the disease. As a result of his work, Dr. Finlay was nominated seven times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, but it was never awarded to him. He received the National Order of the Legion of Honour of France in 1908.\n\nIn 1990, the Walter Reed Commission confirmed what Carlos found. Reed was known to all as being the one that discovered the connection of yellow fever and the mosquito but he gave the credit to Finlay. He used Finlay's information to help with his research. Soon Finlay became the chief health officer of Cuba from 1902-1909. \n\nFinlay died from heart failure caused by pneumonia in his home in Havana, Cuba.\n", "id": "364241", "title": "Carlos Finlay"}

It is widely and successfully used for electricity transmission and distribution. It is lighter and stronger than copper wire, which helps prevent the cables from sagging. It is also less expensive than copper wire. It has also been successfully used in aircraft wiring. In the 1960s, with the rising price of copper, electricians started to use it to wire homes and other buildings. Aluminum wiring was not successful in this application and it is a major safety problem. Because of the safety problems with aluminum wiring, it was discontinued for building wiring in the mid-1970s. Over time, aluminum wiring can separate from the screws on electrical outlets, switches, or lights, creating a poor connection, which causes the wire to heat up. The heat can cause the aluminum to oxidize, creating an even worse connection and more heat, which can eventually start a fire. Incorrect repairs to aluminum wiring, such as connecting aluminum wire to copper wire with twist-on wire connectors, can make the problem even worse. Even twist-on connectors designed to connect aluminum to copper can be dangerous. The only proper way to repair aluminum wiring is to connect it to copper \"tails\" (short pieces of copper wire) with crimped or screw-on connectors specifically designed for this purpose.\n", "id": "364436", "title": "Aluminum wiring"}

Encouraged, Frobisher returned to Canada with an even larger fleet and dug several mines around Frobisher Bay. He carted 1,350 tons of the ore back where, after years of smelting, it was realized that both that batch of ore and the earlier one he had taken were worthless iron pyrite.

Smith was to retire after the maiden voyage of the Titanic, but he died when the ship sank. \n\nSmith was born on 27 January 1850 in Hanley, Staffordshire, England. He was married to Sarah Eleanor Pennington from 1887 until his death in 1912. They had one daughter.\n\nWhen the \"Titanic\" struck the iceberg, Smith knew within minutes that the ship was doomed and that people would die. During the evacuation, Captain Smith did all in his power to prevent panic and did his best to assist in the evacuation; Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club said \"He was doing everything in his power to get women in these boats, and to see that they were lowered properly. I thought he was doing his duty in regard to the lowering of the boats\". Robert Williams Daniel, a first class passenger also said:\n\nJust minutes before the ship started its final plunge, Smith was still busy releasing \"Titanic\"'s crew from their duties; he went to the Marconi operators room and released Junior Marconi Officer Harold Bride and senior wireless operator John \"Jack\" Phillips from their duties. He then carried out a final tour of the deck, telling crew members: \"Now it's every man for himself.\" Steward Edward Brown saw the captain approach with a megaphone in his hand. He heard him say \"Well boys, do your best for the women and children, and look out for yourselves.” He saw the Captain walk onto the bridge alone just seconds before the ship took its final plunge. This was the last reliable sighting of Smith. Just seconds later Trimmer Samuel Hemming found the bridge apparently empty.\n\nSmith died that night along with around 1,500 others, and his body was never recovered. \n\nThere are conflicting accounts of his death; Some claimed to have seen Smith in the water swimming towards a lifeboat, or near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\", others claimed saw shooting himself with a pistol. Other accounts describe him entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed. The actual fate of captain Smith will probably remain uncertain. His body was never recovered.\n\nSmith has been played by many actors during documentaries, movies, television series, or plays. The most well known actors to play Smith are George C.

When those miners arrived there without knowing that they won't be able to see their homes again, majority of them were 13 years old to 15 years old. They had work under in such a terrible conditions: wearing only under wear to go in the mine also, they never got paid for their work and for their meals, they had to eat the left overs from making bean oil. Only two out of over a hundred of the young workers survived. They said \"I could here my friend yelling that they are hungry all the time.\" and \"I want to eat a bowl of rice grown in my country with a bowl of warm soup\". These survivors described Hashima Island as \"a prison that I am forced to stay without frames\" Also, Japan has rapidly said that the young miners volunteered to come so it is not considered as \"forced to work\". However, the two survivors does not agree with that. Behind the this island of Hashima there is sad truth.\n\nSince 2005, the island has been part of the city of Nagasaki.\n\nHashima island is near the mouth of Nagasaki harbour.

He became pharaoh after the death of Amenhotep I. During his reign, he sent his armies into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt further than ever before. He built many temples in Egypt and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings. He is the first king known to have done this, though Amenhotep I may have done it first. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II, and then his daughter, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1506 to 1493 BC. Some scholars give his dates from 1526 BC to 1513 BC. This depends on where the astronomical observations used to calculate ancient Egyptian dates were made. If the observations were from the city of Memphis it would give the dates 20 years earlier than if it was Thebes.\n\nThutmose's father is unknown, but it may have been Amenhotep I. His mother, Senseneb, was not from a royal family and may have been a lesser wife or concubine of Amenhotep. Thutmoses's wife, Queen Ahmose, the Great Royal Wife, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I. There is some doubt, as she was never called a \"king's daughter.\" Some historians believe that she was Thutmose's own sister. Thutmose's first son with Ahmose was Amenmose. He was born long before Thutmose's coronation. He can be seen on a stela from about 1522 BC hunting near Memphis. He became the commander of the army. Amenmose died about the same time as Thutmose. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. Thutmose had a son by another wife, Mutnofret. This son, married to Thutmose's daughter Hatshepsut, succeeded him as Thutmose II. Hatshepsut said that Thutmose gave the kingship to them both. However, this is considered to be propaganda by Hatshepsut's supporters to support her claim to the throne when she later took over power.\n\nDuring the reign of Amenhotep I, the Egyptians recorded an astronomical event. This was the star Sothis appearing above the horizon at dawn. This is called a heliacal rising. Modern scientists believe that Sothis is the star that we call Sirius. If this observation was made at Thebes, it took place in 1517 BC. From this date, the date of Amenhotep's death, and Thutmose's coronation can be calculated to 1506 BC. But a few historians believe that the observations were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis. This would mean that Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC.\n\nAn Egyptian priest, Manetho, writing in the third century BC, said that Thutmose I's reign lasted 12 Years and 9 Months (or 13 Years). This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign with Thutmoses's cartouche found on a stone block in Karnak. Accordingly, Thutmose is usually said to have ruled from 1506 BC to 1493 BC, but some scholars date him from 1526 BC to 1513 BC\n\nAt the time Thutmose became king, Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule. Thutmose travelled up the Nile with his army and fought in the battle, personally killing the Nubian king. He returned to Thebes with the Nubian king's body hung from the front of his ship. In the third year of his reign he led a another expedition against Nubia. He ordered the canal at the first cataract to be made deeper to make it easier to get his ships upstream. The canal had been first built by Sesostris III of the 12th Dynasty. This helped make Nubia part of the Egyptian empire. This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king's son Thure:\nIn the second year of Thutmose's reign, a stele at Tombos records that he built a fortress there. This is near the third cataract. Before this the Egyptian army had stopped at Buhen, at the second cataract. This stele says that he already fought in Syria. His Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of the second year of his rule. The Syrian campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. Although it has not been found in modern times, he set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared loyalty to Thutmose. However, after he went back to Egypt, they stopped tribute and began building defences against future attacks. Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of Niy, near Apamea in Syria. He returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, \"that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream.\" The Euphrates was the first major river which the Egyptians had seen which flowed from the north. This would be downstream on the Nile, instead of the south which was upstream on the Nile. The river became known in Egypt as the \"inverted water.\"\n\nNubia rebelled against Egyptian rule again in his fourth year. He sent his army even farther south to stop it. An inscription from his reign has been found as far south as Kurgus, which was south of the fourth cataract. During his reign, he began a number of projects which effectively ended Nubian independence for the next 500 years. He enlarged a temple to Sesostris III and Khnum, opposite the Nile from Semna. There are also records of specific religious rites which the viceroy of El-Kab was to have performed in the temples in Nubia for the king. He also appointed a man, Turi, to the position of viceroy of Cush, also known as the \"King's Son of Cush.\" With a civilian representative of the king living in Nubia itself, Nubia did not dare to revolt as often as it had. It was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings.\n\nThutmose I organized great building projects during his reign, including many temples and tombs. His greatest projects were at the Temple of Karnak under the supervision of the architect Ineni. Before this, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar boats along the side of the road. Thutmose had the temple made much bigger. He had a fifth pylon built along the temple's main road. He built a wall around the inner temple and two flagpoles on either side of the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosing wall. He built a hypostyle hall between pylons four and five. This was made with columns of cedar wood. This was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built very large statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he built four more flagpoles and two obelisks. One of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside of Thutmose I's hypostyle hall.\n\nThutmose I also built statues of the Ennead at Abydos, buildings at Armant, Ombos, el-Hiba, Memphis, and Edfu, as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia, at Semna, Buhen, Aniba, and Quban.\n\nThutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the Valley of the Kings. The architect, Ineni, built the tomb, and his mortuary temple. This temple has not been found as it was probably destroyed by the building of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. \n\nThutmose I was buried in a tomb now called KV20 dug high into the cliffs of the Valley of the Kings. His daughter Hatshepsut had the tomb made bigger, with a room big enough for both of their stone coffins (sarcophagus). His grandson, Thutmose III had him reburied in KV38. KV20 was rediscovered during the Napoleonic expedition of 1799. In 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had explored its upper passage. However, many passageways were blocked by rocks, stones and other rubbish brought in during floods. In 1903-1904 Howard Carter, after two years of hard work, was able to clear the passages and enter the double burial chamber. He found broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages. He found parts of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari, which were part of the original funerary equipment of Thutmose I. On one vase was written that Thutmose II \"[made it] as his monument to his father.\" Other vessels which had the names and titles of Thutmose I had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II. There were parts of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king which had her royal name of 'Maatkare'.\nCarter, however, also discovered two separate coffins in the burial chamber. The beautifully carved sarcophagus of Hatshepsut \"was discovered open with no sign of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor.\" It is now in the Cairo Museum with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest. A second sarcophagus, was found lying on its side, with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall. This was given to Theodore M. Davis, who had paid for the excavation. Davis gave it to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of \"the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut.\" However, when the sarcophagus was complete, Hatshepsut decided to have a new one made for herself. She used the first sarcophagus for her father, Thutmose I. The stonemasons then tried to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Thuthmose I. The sarcophagus is seven feet long and three feet wide with walls five inches thick. It has text carved on it which records Hatshepsut's generosity towards her father:\nAfter Hatshepsut's death, Thutmose III, Hatshepsut's successor, moved his grandfather to a magnificent new tomb, KV38. This had another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I. It was covered with texts which spoke of this pharaoh's love for his dead grandfather. Thutmose I's remains were disturbed during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was robbed. The sarcophagus' lid was broken and all this king's valuable precious jewellery and grave goods were stolen. The original coffin of Thutmose I was taken over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. In 1994 a flood refilled KV20 with stones and debris.\n\nThutmose I's mummy has not been yet been identified. He was reburied during 21st dynasty when the bodies of the pharaohs of the 18th and 19th dynasties were rewrapped and buried in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. They were discovered in 1881. The mummies included Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun. Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, believed that unlabelled mummy #5283 was that of Thutmose I. The face had the same features as the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III. Later research proved that it was an 18th dynasty mummy..\n\nGaston Maspero wrote:\nThis mummy can be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, in 2007, Dr. Zahi Hawass announced that the mummy is that of a 30 year old man who had died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it could not be King Thutmose I.\n", "id": "365381", "title": "Thutmose I"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365412", "text": "Rodinia\n\nRodinia, meaning \"to give birth\", is the name of a supercontinent. It had most or all of Earth's landmass when the Neoproterozoic era began. \n\nRodinia existed between 1.1 billion and 750 million years ago. It formed from parts of the older supercontinent, Columbia. \n\nRodinia broke up in the first period of the Neoproterozoic, the Tonian. Later its continental fragments were re-assembled to form Pangaea 300250 million years ago. In contrast with Pangaea, little is known yet about the exact position and history of Rodinia. \n\nThe extreme cooling of the global climate around 700 million years ago (the so called Snowball Earth of the Cryogenian period) and the rapid evolution of primitive life during the following Ediacaran and Cambrian periods may have been triggered by the breaking up of Rodinia.\n\nThe break-up of Rodinia is better understood than its formation. Extensive flood basalt flows and volcanic eruptions of Neoproterozoic age are found on most continents. This is evidence for large scale rifting about 750 million years ago. As early as 850 and 800 million years ago, a rift developed, eventually becoming an ocean in the Ediacaran.\n\nIn a separate rifting event about 610 million years ago (halfway in the Ediacaran period), the Iapetus Ocean formed. It might be that all continental mass was again joined in one supercontinent between roughly 600 and 550 million years ago. This hypothetical supercontinent is called Pannotia.\n\nUnlike later supercontinents, Rodinia itself was entirely barren. It existed before life colonized dry land. It was before the formation of the ozone layer, so it was too exposed to the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight for any organism (except perhaps bacteria) to live on it. However, its existence probably did affect the marine life of its time.\n\nIn the Cryogenian period the Earth experienced large glaciations, and temperatures were at least as cool as today. Substantial areas of Rodinia may have been covered by glaciers or the southern polar ice cap.\n\nThe eventual rifting of the continents created new oceans, and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less-dense oceanic lithosphere. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere does not lie so deep as old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, the ocean floors come up, causing the sea level to rise. The result was a greater number of shallower seas.\n\nThe increased evaporation from the larger water area of the oceans may have increased rainfall, which, in turn, increased the weathering of exposed rock. This increased rainfall may have reduced greenhouse gas levels. When CO level dropped, the period known as Snowball Earth began. Increased volcanic activity also introduced nutrients into the seas. This may have played an important role in the development of the earliest animals.\n", "id": "365412", "title": "Rodinia"}

Yamanaka is also the current president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR).\n\nIn development, embryonic stem cells can turn into any tissue. Fibroblasts in the skin are one type of cell.\nIn 2006, Yamanaka and his team took adult mouse fibroblasts and turned them back into stem cells in tissue culture. The changed cells are known as 'induced pluripotent stem cells' (iPS cells). iPS cells are like embryonic stem cells from a blastocyst (the embryo a few days after fertilization).\n\nThe procedure used transfection of some stem cell-associated genes into the adult fibroblasts. The transfected genes include the master transcriptional regulators. Transfection is typically done with viral vectors, such as retroviruses.\n\nThe team could show that the iPS cells were pluripotent (capable of generating all cell lineages of the body). Soon they grew mice which included iPS cells. In 2007, he and his team generated iPS cells from \"human\" adult fibroblasts, again the first group to do so. The main medical application will be replacement of faulty or damaged tissues in humans. This is not available at present.

Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent Arctic and Antarctic expeditions. \n\nNansen studied zoology at the Royal Frederick University, and later worked as a curator at the Bergen Museum where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish modern theories of neurology. After 1896 his main scientific interest switched to oceanography; in the course of his research he made many scientific cruises, mainly in the North Atlantic, and contributed to the development of modern oceanographic equipment. As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the ending of Norway's union with Sweden, and was instrumental in persuading Prince Charles of Denmark to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.\nIn the final decade of his life Nansen devoted himself primarily to the League of Nations, following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of the First World War and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the \"Nansen passport\" for stateless persons, a certificate recognised by more than 50 countries. \n\nHe worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1930, after which the League established the Nansen International Office for Refugees to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1938. Nansen was honoured by many nations, and his name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions.\n\n\n", "id": "365746", "title": "Fridtjof Nansen"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365954", "text": "Robin Hood (1973 movie)\n\nRobin Hood is a 1973 American animated buddy musical adventure-comedy movie. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It was first released in the United States on November 8, 1973.\n\nIt is the 21st Disney animated movie. It is based on the legend of Robin Hood, but uses anthropomorphic animals instead of people. The story follows the adventures of Robin Hood, Little John and the inhabitants of Nottingham as they fight against the excessive taxation of Prince John, and Robin Hood wins the hand of Maid Marian.\n\nAlan-a-Dale introduces the story of Robin Hood and Little John, two outlaws living in Sherwood Forest. They steal from the rich and give to the poor townsfolk of Nottingham, despite the efforts of the Sheriff of Nottingham to stop them. Meanwhile, Prince John and his assistant Sir Hiss arrive in Nottingham on a tour of the kingdom. Knowing the prince is very rich, Robin and Little John steal from Prince John by disguising themselves as fortune tellers. The embarrassed Prince John then puts a bounty on their heads and makes the Sheriff his personal tax collector. He takes pleasure in taking money from the townsfolk including hidden money from the crippled blacksmith Otto and a single farthing from a young rabbit, Skippy, who had just received it as a birthday present. However, Robin Hood, disguised as a beggar, sneaks in and gives back some money to the family, as well as his hat and a bow to Skippy in honor of his birthday.\n\nSkippy and his friends test out the bow, but Skippy fires an arrow into the grounds of Maid Marian's castle. The children sneak inside, meeting Maid Marian and her attendant Lady Kluck. Skippy \"rescues\" Marian from Lady Kluck, who pretends to be Prince John. Later, when she is alone with Kluck, Maid Marian reveals she and Robin were childhood sweethearts but they have not seen one another for years, and Kluck tells her not to give up on her love for Robin. Meanwhile, Friar Tuck visits Robin and Little John. He explains that Prince John is hosting an archery tournament, and the winner will get a kiss from Maid Marian. Robin decides to participate in the tournament disguised as a stork whilst Little John disguises himself as the Duke of Chutney to get near Prince John. Sir Hiss discovers Robin's identity but is trapped in a barrel of ale by Friar Tuck and Alan-a-Dale. Robin wins the tournament, but Prince John exposes him and has him arrested for execution despite Maid Marian's pleas. Little John threatens Prince John in order to release Robin. This leads to a fight between Prince John's soldiers and the townsfolk. They all escape to Sherwood Forest.\n\nAs Robin and Maid Marian fall in love again, the townsfolk have a troubadour festival making fun of Prince John. They call him the \"Phony King of England\", and the song soon becomes popular with John's soldiers. Angered by the insult, Prince John triples the taxes, imprisoning most of the townsfolk who cannot pay. A paltry coin gets deposited into the poor box at Friar Tuck's church, but it gets taken by the Sheriff. Angered that government has meddled in his church, Friar Tuck lashes out at the Sheriff, to which he is quickly arrested for \"attacking a lawman, interfering with the Sheriff's legal duties and high treason to the Crown\". Prince John orders Friar Tuck hung, knowing Robin Hood will come out of hiding to rescue his friend and give the potential for Robin to be caught and a \"double hanging\".\n\nRobin and Little John, having learned of the plot, chose to sneak in during the night. Little John manages to free all of the prisoners while Robin steals Prince John's taxes, but Sir Hiss awakens to find Robin escaping. Chaos follows as Robin and the others try to escape to Sherwood Forest. The Sheriff corners Robin after he is forced to return to rescue Tagalong, Skippy's little sister. During the chase, Prince John's castle catches fire and the Sheriff figures he has Robin where he wants, either to be captured, burned, or make a risky jump into the moat. Robin Hood decides to jump. Little John and Skippy fear Robin is lost, but he surfaces safely after using a reed as a breathing tube. Sir Hiss says he \"tried\" to warn Prince John, and now look what he did to his mother's castle. This causes the Prince to exclaim \"Mummy!\" and suck his thumb and chase the scared snake into the burning castle.\n\nLater, King Richard returns to England, placing his brother, Sir Hiss and the Sheriff under arrest. He allows his niece Maid Marian to marry Robin Hood, turning the former outlaw into an in-law.\n\nThe alternate ending (included in the \"Most Wanted Edition\" DVD) is a deleted version of the story's ending. It is mostly made of still images from Ken Anderson's original storyboard drawings of the scene. As Robin Hood leaps off of the castle and into the moat, he is wounded (presumably by one of the arrows shot into the water after him) and carried away to the church for safety. Prince John, angry that he has once again been outsmarted by Robin Hood, finds Little John leaving the church, and suspects the outlaw to be there as well. Sure enough, he finds Maid Marian tending to an unconscious Robin Hood, and draws a dagger to kill them both. Before Prince John can strike, however, he is stopped by his brother, King Richard, having returned from the Crusades. King Richard is horrified to find that Prince John has left his kingdom bleak and oppressed. Obeying his mother's wishes, King Richard decides he cannot banish Prince John from the kingdom, but does grant him major punishment (which explained how Prince John, Sir Hiss, and the Sheriff ended up in the Royal Rock Pile). King Richard returns Nottingham to its former glory (before leaving for the Third Crusade), knights Robin Hood as Sir Robin of Locksley, and orders Friar Tuck to marry Robin Hood and Maid Marian. \nA short finished scene from the planned original ending, featuring King Richard and revealing himself to vulture henchmen Trigger and Nutsy, appeared in the Ken Anderson episode of the 1980s Disney Channel documentary series \"Disney Family Album\". This scene, at least in animated form, does not appear on the \"Most Wanted Edition\" DVD.\n\n\nAlthough at least five of the voice-actors used were British, the choice was made to cast quite a number of American character actors in the traditional medieval roles. Many of these people were veteran performers from Western-themed movies and television programs. This meant that characters like Little John, Friar Tuck, and the Sheriff of Nottingham have distinctly American accents and mannerisms. This effect was further reinforced by the choice of country singer Roger Miller as the movie's songwriter and narrator.\n\nAt first, the studio considered a movie about Reynard the Fox. However, due to Walt Disney's concern that Reynard was an unsuitable choice for a hero, Ken Anderson used many elements from it in \"Robin Hood\".\n\nRobin Allan wrote in his book \"Walt Disney and Europe\", that \"Ken Anderson wept when he saw how his character concepts had been processed into stereotypes for the animation on \"Robin Hood\".\" According to Ward Kimball and Ollie Johnston, one such disaster was the concept of making the Sheriff of Nottingham a goat as an artistic experiment to try different animals for a villain, only to be overruled by the director who wanted to keep to the villainous stereotype of a wolf instead. Additionally, Anderson wanted to include the Merry Men into the movie, which was again overridden by Reitherman because he wanted a \"buddy picture\" reminiscent of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", so Little John was the only Merry Man who remained in the film, while Friar Tuck was put as a friend of Robin's who lived in Nottingham, and Alan-a-Dale was turned into the narrator. Because of the time spent on developing several settings and auditioning actors to voice Robin Hood, production fell behind schedule. In order to meet its deadline, the animators decided to recycle dance sequences from \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", \"The Jungle Book,\" and \"The Aristocats\".\n\nThe movie premiered at the Radio City Music Hall on November 9, 1973. The movie was re-released on March 26, 1982. It was released to videocassette on December 4, 1984. It thus became the first installment of the Walt Disney Classics home video label. Disney thought the idea of releasing any of its animated classics (known as the \"untouchables\") might threaten future theatrical release money. However, \"Robin Hood\" was viewed as the first choice because it was not held in such high regard as some of the other titles, and was less likely to get another theatrical release as its 1982 reissue proved to be disappointing. It was later re-released in 1991 (as part of Walt Disney Classics Collection), 1994, and 1998 (as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection).\n\nIn January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Gold Classic Collection, with \"Robin Hood\" re-released on VHS and DVD on July 4, 2000. The DVD had the movie in its 1.33:1 aspect ratio, and was accompanied with special features including a trivia game and the cartoon short \"Ye Olden Days\". The remastered \"Most Wanted Edition\" DVD (\"Special Edition\" in the UK) was released in 2006. It featured a deleted scene/alternate ending, as well as a 16:9 matted transfer to represent its original theatrical screen ratio. On August 6, 2013, the movie was released as the 40th Anniversary Edition on a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo pack.\n\nWhen the movie was originally released, Judith Crist said it was \"nicely tongue-in-cheek without insult to the intelligence of either child or adult.\" She also said that it \"has class – in the fine cast that gives both voice and personality to the characters, in the bright and brisk dialogue, in its overall concept.\" Vincent Canby said that it \"should ... be a good deal of fun for toddlers whose minds have not yet shriveled into orthodoxy\" and he called the visual style \"charmingly conventional\". \"The Montreal Gazette\" said that when \"Disney cartoon films ... are good, they are very good\" and that \"there are not many films around these days which an entire family can attend and enjoy. \"Robin Hood\" is one of them.\" \"New York\" magazine called it \"a sweet, funny, slam-bang, good-hearted Walt Disney feature cartoon with a fine cast\" and said it was \"a feast for the eyes for kiddies and Disney nostalgics.\" Reviews written decades after the original release of the movie have been more mixed. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes said that the movie received a 52% approval rating with an average rating of 5.4/10 based on 25 reviews. The website's consensus states that \"One of the weaker Disney adaptations, \"Robin Hood\" is cute and colorful but lacks the majesty and excitement of the studio's earlier efforts.\"\n\nIn its original release, \"Robin Hood\" made $9.5 million in the United States. \n\nThe song \"Love\" was nominated for Best Original Song at the 46th Academy Awards but lost to \"The Way We Were\" from the movie of the same name.\n\nThe movie is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: \n\nThe music played in the background while Lady Kluck fights off Prince John's soldiers in an American football manner, following the archery tournament, is an arrangement of \"Fight On\" and \"On, Wisconsin\", the respective fight songs of the University of Southern California and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nA full soundtrack to \"Robin Hood\" has never been released on compact disc in the US. However, a record of the movie was made at the time of its release in 1973. It included its songs, score, narration, and dialogue. Both \"Oo De Lally\" and \"Love\" appear on the CD collection, \"\". \nThe song \"Love\" is featured in the 2009 animated movie \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\". The song \"Whistle-Stop\" was sped up and used in the Hampster Dance, one of the earliest internet memes, and later used at normal speed in the Super Bowl XLVIII commercial for T-Mobile. The song \"Oo De Lally\" is featured in a 2015 commercial for Android. It shows animals of different species playing together.\n\nIn December 2014, it was announced that Disney had bought a spec script for a live-action movie titled \"Nottingham & Hood\" with hopes that it would start a new movie franchise. The tone is said to be similar to the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie series.\n\n\n", "id": "365954", "title": "Robin Hood (1973 movie)"}

He entered the navy at the age of eleven, and was appointed junior lieutenant in July 1845. Later he studied at Uppsala University, where he distinguished himself in mathematics. On 13 December 1848, he was made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nFrom 1859, when his father died, he was first in line to the Swedish throne after his oldest brother King Charles, who then had no male heirs (his son had died in infancy in 1854). His middle brother Gustaf had died in 1852.\n\nHe succeeded his brother Charles XV and IV on 18 September 1872, and was crowned as king of Norway in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 18 July 1873.

It is also useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. \n\nThe Gumbel distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Gumbel distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their \"location\" and \"scale\" parameters: the mean (\"average\") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation (\"variability\") defines the scale.\n\nOne recognizes the Gumbel \"probability density function\" (PDF) and the Gumbel \"cumulative distribution function\" (CDF).\n\nIn the PDF, the probability P of a value V to occur between limits A and B, briefly written as P(A<VP(V \\leq A) = CDF(A) </math>.\n\nThe mathematical expression of the CDF is:\n\nwhere μ is the \"mode\" (the value where the probability density function reaches its peak), \"e\" is a mathematical constant, about 2.718, and β is a value related to the \"standard deviation\" (σ) :\n\nwhere π is the Greek symbol for Pi whose value is close to 22/7 or 3.142, and the symbol formula_3 stands for the square root.\n\nThe \"mode\" μ can be found from the \"median\" M, being the value of A where CDF(A)=0.5, and β:\n\nwhere \"ln\" is the natural logarithm.\n\nThe \"mean\", E(x), given by:\n\nwhere formula_6 = \"Euler constant\" formula_7 0.5772.\n\nIn a data series, the parameters \"mode\" (μ) and β can be estimated from the average, median and standard deviation. The calculation of the last three quantities is explained in the respective Wiki pages. Then, with the help of formulas given in the previous section, the factors μ and β can be calculated. In this way, the CDF of the Gumbel distribution belonging to the data can be determined and the probability of interesting data values can be found.\n\nIn hydrology, the Gumbel distribution is used to analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts.\nThe blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Gumbel distribution to ranked maximum one-day October rainfalls showing also the 90% \"confidence belt\" based on the binomial distribution. \n", "id": "366153", "title": "Gumbel distribution"}

They are the basis of cell membranes, and they surround most cell organelles. Lipid bilayers form automatically from phospholipids by self-assembly.\n\nThe phospholipids have heads which mix with water and tails which reject water. So the tails come together in the centre of the double layer, and the heads on the outside are surrounded by water. \n\nThe lipid bilayers stop most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules passing through. They also stop most ions.\n\nIn cells, proteins are put in the bilayer by enzymes. The proteins decide which molecules come in and which go out of the cell. For example, cells control salt concentrations and pH by pumping ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps. \n", "id": "366232", "title": "Lipid bilayer"}

Many people around the world have infections of \"M. tuberculosis\" without showing any signs of it.\n\nMycobacterial infections are difficult to treat.

He built some small monuments and began two small military campaigns but did little else during his rule and was probably strongly influenced by his wife, Hatshepsut. He ruled from 1493 BC to 1479 BC. Thutmose II's body was found in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut with many other pharaohs. It can be viewed today in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\n\nThutmose II was the son of Thutmose I and a minor wife, Mutnofret. He may married his fully royal half-sister, Hatshepsut, in order to secure his kingship. His armies stopped rebellions in Nubia and the Levant and defeated a group of nomadic Bedouins. But these campaigns were led by the king's Generals, and not by Thutmose II himself. This is often seen as evidence that Thutmose II was still a child at his when he became king. Thutmose II fathered Neferure with Hatshepsut, and a male heir, the famous Thutmose III, by a lesser wife named Iset before his death.\n\nSome archaeologists believe that Hatshepsut was the real power behind the throne during Thutmose II’s rule. Domestic and foreign policies were similar and she claimed that her father wanted them to rule together. She is pictured in several scenes from a Karnak gateway dating to Thutmose II's reign, both together with her husband and alone. She later had herself crowned Pharaoh several years into the rule of her husband's young successor Thutmose III. \"The queen's agents actually replaced the boy king's name in a few places with her own cartouches\" on the gateway.\n\nThe ancient historian Manetho wrote that Thutmose II ruled for 13 years. This figure is highly disputed among scholars. Some modern historians believe he ruled for only three years.\n\nMost pharaohs are remembered because of the number of monuments and buildings they created. However Hatsehput had his name removed replaced with her own. Thutmose III had Thutmose II's name added to all kinds of monuments. This makes it hard for people studying Thutmose II to know what he really created.\n\nThere are several surviving buildings built for the king at Semna, Kumma, and Elephantine. His biggest monument was a limestone gateway at Karnak that was once at the front of the Fourth Pylon's forecourt. But this monument was not completed in Thutmose II's reign but in the reign of his son Thutmose III. This suggests that Thutmose II did not rule for very long. The gateway was later pulled down and its building blocks used for the foundation of the Third Pylon by Amenhotep III.\n\nWhen Thutmose II became king, there was a rebellion by the Kush. The Egyptians retreated into the fort built by Thutmose I. Thutmose II was too young for battle, but he sent an army into Nubia. The rebellion was easily crushed with the help of his father's military generals. \n\nThutmose also seems to have fought against the Shasu Bedouin in the Sinai. This was a minor raid, but the army went as far as Upper Retenu, or Syria. This quite possibly indicates that the raid against the Shasu was only fought on the way to Syria.\n\nThutmose II's mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri cache, in 1881. He was in a tomb with other 18th and 19th kings including Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX.\n\nThe mummy was unwrapped by Gaston Maspero on July 1, 1886. The face and shape of the head was very similar to the mummy of Thutmose I, his likely father. The body of Thutmose II been badly damaged by ancient tomb robbers. His left arm was broken off at the shoulder-joint, the forearm separated at the elbow joint, and his right arm chopped off below the elbow. His abdomen and much of his chest looked as if it had been hacked with an axe. His right leg had been cut from his body. All of these injuries had taken place after his death. The body also showed signs that Thutmose II did not have an easy life:\n", "id": "366243", "title": "Thutmose II"}

In the year 1890, Robert Koch developed tuberculin, as a treatment for tuberculosis. The substance proved ineffective to treat the disease, today it is commonly used to detect it, though. Tuberculin is a substance based on the pathogen that causes tuberculosis. Charles Mantoux, a French physician, developed a test method, based on the work of Koch. \n\nA positive test result simply says that the immune system came in contact with Mycobacteria - this does not necessarily mean that people with a positive test result have been infected with tuberculosis. Such a result, which shows as positive, even though the outcome should be negative is called \"false positive\". \n\nThe test shows the reaction of the immune system to tuberculin. This requires an intact immune system: People whose immune system is weakened, for example those with a HIV infection, may also show a \"false negative\": Their immune system may simply be too weak to react.

He soon became the army chief of staff. In 1965 he led a second coup to be Prime Minister. Then in 1967 he established a presidential form of government headed by himself. As part of his program of “national authenticity,” Mobutu changed the Congo's name to Zaïre in 1971. He changed his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko in 1972. Mobutu established a one-party state and a cult of personality. \n\nDuring his reign, Mobutu built a highly centralized state. He amassed a large personal fortune through economic exploitation and corruption. Because of this some people called his rule “kleptocracy.” The nation suffered from uncontrolled inflation, a large debt, and massive currency devaluations. By 1991 economic deterioration and unrest led him to agree to share power with opposition leaders. He used the army to stop this change. In May 1997 rebel forces, led by Laurent Kabila, removed him from the country. \n\nMobutu Sese Seko is notorious for the corruption, nepotism, and embezzlement of billions of dollars that took place during his reign. He also had extravagances such as Concorde-flown shopping trips to Paris. Mobutu presided over the country for some four decades, despite many reports of abuses and human-rights violations.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366375", "text": "Mirage\n\nA mirage is an image that is distorted by the atmosphere so that its form and location can look very different from the actual object. It is caused by the way light bends as it passes through layers of air of different temperatures.\n\nThe words \"mirage\" and \"mirror\" come from the same root word, which means \"to look at.\"\n\nNormally, light travels in a straight line, but it will change direction depending on what it passes through. This bending is called \"refraction.\" Gases, such as air, become thinner as they get warmer. As a result, light tends to curve (or refract) towards the colder layer of air. This makes the image appear to come from a different direction than the original object.\n\nThere are two basic types of mirage, depending on which direction the temperature changes, inferior and superior.\n\nAn inferior mirage is arguably the most common type seen over land. Air near solid ground is typically warmer than the air above it. When light from the sky passes through it, a shimmering, fragmented image of the sky may appear to come from the ground, resembling water.\n\nSometimes a mirage can appear to come from higher up than the original object. When the colder air is lower (called an inversion layer), as it often is over large bodies of water or ice, the apparent direction of the mirage will be opposite that of an inferior mirage. For example, the distorted image of a ship or an island may appear on or above the surface, even if the original object is hidden below the horizon.\n\nA \"Fata Morgana\" is a complex superior mirage whose appearance can change quickly and dramatically. Its name refers to Morgan le Fay, a mythical enchantress strongly associated with Arthurian legends. In times past, the disturbing images seen as part of the mirage were attributed to illusions created by magic.\n\nA mirage-like effect can be achieved by allowing a soluble substance like sugar or salt to slowly dissolve in a deep container of water, so that there is more sugar in the water near the bottom than in the water above it. This can refract the image of an object seen through it in a similar manner as a superior mirage often seen over open water.\n\n", "id": "366375", "title": "Mirage"}

He was a manufacturer, politician and a phillanthropist in Bradford, West Yorkshire. \n\nHis father Daniel Salt was a dry salter and then he decided to become a farmer. His mother died when he was quite young. Titus Salt had 11 children. \n\nAfter working as a woolen stapler for two years at a mill near Wakefield he became his fathers business partner-Daniel Salt and son. The company used Russian Donskio wool, which was widely used in the woollens trade, but not in worsted cloth. Titus visited the millers in Bradford.\n\nAfter working for two years as a wool-stapler in Wakefield he became his father's partner in the business of Daniel Salt and Son. He set up as a spinner and manufacturer.\n\nIn 1836, Titus came upon some bales of Alpaca wool in a warehouse in Liverpool and, after taking some samples away to experiment, came back and bought the consignment. Though he was not the first in England to work with the fibre, he was the creator of the lustrous and subsequently fashionable cloth called 'alpaca'. (The discovery was described by Charles Dickens in slightly fictionalised form in \"Household Words\").\n\nIn 1833 he took over his father's business and within twenty years had expanded it to be the largest employer in Bradford. In 1848 Titus Salt became mayor of Bradford. Smoke and pollution came from mills and factory chimneys. Salt tried unsuccessfully to clean up the pollution using a device called the Rodda Smoke Burner.\n\nAround 1850, he decided to build a mill large enough to consolidate his textile manufacture in one place, but he \"did not like to be a party to increasing that already over-crowded borough\". So he bought land three miles from the town in Shipley next to the River Aire, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Midland Railway and began building in 1851. He opened it with a grand banquet on his 50th birthday, 20 September 1853, and set about building houses, bathhouses, an institute, hospital, almshouses and churches, that make up the model village of Saltaire. He built the Congregational Church which is now Saltaire United Reformed Church, at his own expense in 1858–59, and donated the land on which the Wesleyan Chapel was built.\n", "id": "366384", "title": "Titus Salt"}

Three policemen had been killed, and others wounded, and one of the gang was also killed. This event is known as the Houndsditch murders.\n\nThe gang were said to be international anarchists led by Peter Piatkow, a.k.a. \"Peter the Painter\". It is still not clear who their leader actually was.\n\nThe end took place at a house in Sidney Street, where word came that a gang of foreigners had moved in. In the fire that ended the siege, one fireman and two robbers died. The fates of other members of the gang, and its leader, are not known.\n\nOn 16 December 1910, a gang of Jewish immigrants attempted to break into the rear of a jeweller's shop at 119 Houndsditch. A nextdoor shopkeeper heard their hammering, and told the City of London Police (in whose area the shop was). Nine unarmed officers — three sergeants and six constables (two in plain clothes) — moved towards the jewellers.\n\nSergeants Bentley and Bryant knocked at the door of No. 11 Exchange Buildings, behind the jeweller's shop. The gang's leader, George Gardstein, opened the door, but when he did not answer their questions they assumed he did not understand English and told him to fetch someone who did. Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared.\n\nThe house had a single ground-floor room, into which the front door directly opened, with a staircase leading to the upper floors on the left, and a door to the open yard at the back on the right. \n\nGrowing impatient, the two sergeants entered the house to find the room apparently empty, before they became aware of a man standing in the darkness at the top of the stairs. After a short conversation, another man entered through the yard door, rapidly firing a pistol, while the man on the stairs also started shooting.\n\nBoth officers were hit, with Bentley collapsing across the doorstep, while Bryant managed to stagger outside. In the street, Constable Woodhams ran to help Bentley, but was himself wounded by one of the gang firing from the cover of the house, as was Sergeant Tucker, who died almost instantly.\n\nThe gang then attempted to break out of the cul-de-sac, Gardstein being grabbed by Constable Choate almost at the entrance. In the struggle Choate was wounded several times by Gardstein, before being shot five more times by other members of the gang, who also managed to hit Gardstein in the back. They then dragged Gardstein ¾ of a mile to 59 Grove Street, where he died the next day. Constable Choate and Sergeant Bentley died in separate hospitals the same day. An intense search followed, and a number of the gang or their associates were soon arrested.\n\nOn 2 January 1911, an informer told police that two or three members of the gang, possibly including Peter the Painter, were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, Stepney. The police were worried the suspects were about to flee, but expected heavy resistance to any attempt to capture them. On 3 January, two hundred police officers cordoned off the area and the siege began. At dawn the battle started.\n\nThe defenders, though heavily outnumbered, had better guns and stores of ammunition. The Tower of London was called for backup, and word got to the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. Churchill arrived on the spot to see the situation at first hand, and to offer advice. Churchill authorised calling in a detachment of Scots Guards to assist the police. \n\nSix hours into the battle, and just as the field artillery piece that Churchill had authorised arrived, a fire began in the building. When the fire brigade arrived, Churchill refused them access to the building. The police stood ready, guns aimed at the front door, waiting for the men inside to attempt their escape. The door never opened. Instead, the remains of two members of the gang, Fritz Svaars and William Sokolow (both were also known by numerous aliases), were later discovered inside the building. \n\nNo sign of Peter the Painter was found. Besides the three policemen, a London firefighter also died of his injuries.\n\n", "id": "366401", "title": "Siege of Sidney Street"}

This was seen as discriminatory and was the beginning of human rights protests and Tamil militancy.\n\nThe government's takeover of foreign businesses, particularly petroleum companies, upset Britain and the United States, who both ended aid to Sri Lanka. As a result, Bandaranaike made a closer relationship with China and the Soviet Union. In 1962, Christian officers of the military made an unsuccessful attempt at a coup d'état. Bandaranaike lost a vote of confidence in 1964, and her party was defeated in the resulting elections in 1965. Before she was replaced, Bandaranaike's government signed an agreement with India over the status of about one million Tamils: 600,000 were to be granted Indian citizenship and repatriated, and 375,000 were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship.\n\nBandaranaike became prime minister again in the 1970 elections. She led a coalition of three parties. Just over a year later, another group tried a coup d'état and created a brief insurgency. The government was saved by military aid from India and Pakistan.\n\nA new constitution was introduced in 1972. The monarchy was abolished, and the Commonwealth realm known as Ceylon was replaced by the modern republic of Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka replaced Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.\n\nDuring her second term, Bandaranaike became more and more intolerant of criticism. She forced critical media outlets to shut down. She also nationalised the country's largest newspaper, \"Lake House\". Bandaranaike was chosen chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1976. Despite success in foreign affairs, she was losing popular support in Sri Lanka very quickly. Her government was accused of corruption while the economy was quickly declining. Elections were scheduled to be held in 1975, but Bandaranaike used a clause of the new constitution to delay them indefinitely. The elections took place in 1977, and her party was defeated severely. In 1980, Bandaranaike was charged with abusing her power for delaying the elections. She was forced out of her seat in parliament and banned from public office for seven years.\n\nBandaranaike stayed as leader of the SLFP despite losing every general election in the next ten years. Her party led a coalition (the People's Alliance) to win the general elections in 1994. Bandaranaike's daughter, Chandrika, became prime minister, and was then elected president the same year. Bandaranaike became prime minister again, but the constitution had changed since her last term. As prime minister she was now subordinate to her daughter, the President. She stayed in office until a few months before her death, but had little real power. She resigned on 10 August 2000. Exactly two months later she died, aged 84, of a heart attack.\n\n", "id": "366481", "title": "Sirimavo Bandaranaike"}

It is mainly a self-organising process. Starting from a random coil, polypeptides fold into their characteristic working shape. The structure is held together by hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe stages are:\n\nWithout its correct three-dimensional structure a protein does not work. However, some parts of proteins may not fold: this is normal. \n\nIf proteins do not fold into their native shape, they are inactive and are usually toxic. Several diseases are believed to result from misfolded proteins. Many allergies are caused by the folding of the proteins, for the immune system does not produce antibodies for all possible protein structures.\n\nChaperonins are large proteins which help the folding of some proteins after synthesis. Chaperones in general were first discovered helping histones and DNA join up to form nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are the builing blocks for chromosomes. It is now clear that this is the way many cell organelles are built up.\n", "id": "366488", "title": "Protein folding"}

The idea is that a protein folding into its native structure is done automatically by the protein's amino acid sequence. It is only true for some proteins. For other proteins, chaperones are needed.\n\nAnfinsen shared the 1972 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the structure of the enzyme ribonuclease A. The dogma suggests that, in the conditions at which folding occurs, the native structure is a unique and stable state.\nThere are three conditions:\n\nHow the protein reaches this structure is the subject of the field of protein folding, which has a related dogma called Levinthal's paradox. The Levinthal paradox states that the number of possible conformations available to a given protein is astronomically large, such that even a small protein of 100 residues would require more time than the universe has existed to explore all possible conformations (10 seconds) and choose the appropriate one.\n\nPrions are an exception to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state. In Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease), native proteins re-fold into a different stable conformation, which causes fatal amyloid buildup. Other amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are also exceptions to Anfinsen's dogma.\n", "id": "366493", "title": "Anfinsen's dogma"}

Leafcutter ants \"cut and process fresh vegetation (leaves, flowers, and grasses) to serve as nutrition for their fungal cultivars\".\n\nThe \"Acromyrmex\" and \"Atta\" ants have much in common anatomically; however, the two can be identified by their external differences. \"Atta\" ants have three pairs of spines and a smooth exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax, while \"Acromyrmex\" ants have four pairs and a rough exoskeleton.\n\nNext to humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth. In a few years, the central mound of their underground nests can grow to more than across, with smaller, radiating mounds extending out to a radius of , taking up and containing eight million individuals.\n\nWinged females and males leave their respective nests \"en masse\" and engage in a nuptial flight known as the \"revoada\". Each female mates with multiple males to collect the 300 million sperm she needs to set up a colony.\n\nOnce on the ground, the female loses her wings and searches for a suitable underground lair in which to found her colony. The success rate of these young queens is very low, and only 2.5% will go on to establish a long-lived colony. To start her own fungus garden, the queen stores bits of the parental fungus garden mycelium in a pocket in her mouth. \n\nIn a mature leafcutter colony, ants are divided into castes, based mostly on size, that do different work. \"Acromyrmex\" and \"Atta\" show a high degree of biological polymorphism, with four castes in established colonies - minims, minors, mediae and majors. Majors are also known as soldiers. \"Atta\" ants are more polymorphic than \"Acromyrmex\", meaning there is comparatively less difference in size from the smallest to largest types of \"Acromymex\".\n\n\n\"Leaf-cutter ants are the major forest herbivores in Central America and consume more plant matter than all the vertebrate herbivores put together. Their subterranean nests can be vast and home to many millions of ants and they have a really neat defence system where minor workers ride shotgun on top of the leaf loads carried by the major workers and fend off the attacks of parasitic flies\".

Milne: \"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\" (1966), \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\" (1968), and \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too\" (1974). This is also the last movie in the Disney canon that Walt Disney was personally involved with, because one of the shorts (\"Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree\") was released during his lifetime, and he was involved in the production of \"Blustery Day\". A fourth and final short movie based on the original books, \"Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\", was released in 1983. It is included as a bonus feature on the VHS and DVD release of the movie.\n\nThe characters from the movie became very popular. There have been sequels, television programs, clothing, books, and toys based on the characters. The movie is different from the three individual shorts by having newly created material to link the stories together. It also has an ending to close the stories. The ending is based on the final chapter of \"The House at Pooh Corner\". It was always Walt Disney's intention to make a movie, but he decided to make shorts instead — after production had begun — to familiarize US audiences with the characters. All three shorts as well as future movies boast classic songs by the Sherman Brothers including \"Winnie the Pooh\" and \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\".\n\nThe movie also inspired an attraction of the same name at Disneyland, Walt Disney World, and Hong Kong Disneyland. A much more elaborate attraction, also based on the movie, opened in Tokyo Disneyland as \"Pooh's Hunny Hunt\".\n\n\n\nFor the character Piglet, hand gestures and other movements were used by the animators to make expressions, because he (and Pooh) had the look of dolls or stuffed animals with relatively simple button eyes. The scene where Rabbit deals with Pooh's being part of the \"decor of his home\" was not in the original book, but was reportedly made by Disney when he first read the book.\n\nMovie critic Leonard Maltin called the original Pooh featurettes \"gems\". He also noted that the artwork resembles the book illustrations, and that the particular length of these short movies meant that the moviemakers didn't have to \"compress or protract their script.\" The movie has a 91% \"fresh\" rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nRuth Hill Viguers, however, when writing in \"A Critical History of Children’s Literature\" during the 1960s, mentioned Disney’s Winnie the Pooh along with several other Disney adaptations as having “destroyed the integrity of the original books”.\n\nThe American Film Institute nominated \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" for its Top 10 Animated Films list.\n\n\"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\" was first released on VHS, Betamax, CED videorecord, and laserdisc in the early 1980s. In 1996, it was re-released on VHS as part of the Masterpiece Collection. It included video footage of the making which was shown before the movie starts. It was released on DVD for the first time in 2002 as a 25th Anniversary Edition, with digitally restored picture and sound. The separate shorts had also been released on their own on VHS in the 1990s.\n\nThe 25th anniversary edition DVD includes, among other bonus features, \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Story Behind the Masterpiece\", which documents the history of the books and their initial movie adaptations. It also features interviews with animators Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas, and Burny Mattinson, as well as the Sherman brothers, Paul Winchell, and others. Digital Media FX reviewer Shannon Muir said that the audio and video quality of the movie on this DVD was very high.\n\nThe \"Friendship Edition\" DVD was re-released on June 19, 2007. All of the special features from the previous \"25th Anniversary Edition\" DVD were recycled; the only new addition being an episode of Playhouse Disney's computer-animated series \"My Friends Tigger & Pooh\".

The movie is based on the characters created by Sharp.\n\nThis movie, along with \"Fantasia 2000\" and \"Winnie the Pooh\" are the only Disney sequels that are part of the Disney canon.

The clinics are called many names, including Children's Dental Clinic, Indian Springs Dental Clinic, Oklahoma Smiles, Small Smiles Dentistry, Texas Smiles, and Wild Smiles.\n\nThe clinic comes from a dental clinic in Pueblo, Colorado that was started in 1928. The DeRose family and Dr. William Mueller owned the company.\n\nIn 2003 Michael DeRose, one of the DeRoses, bought a very expensive house in Pueblo for $3.4 million. When they owned the clinics, they put children in \"papoose boards\" to stop them from moving so they could quickly do dental work. The State of Colorado made a law to limit how much they could use the papoose boards. The offices also did lots of dental work on the children and put a lot of crowns on the children's teeth, so the Colorado government said that the clinics could only place a specified number crowns for each day. In 2006 the DeRose family sold the company to new owners.\n\nIn 2007 a news reporter named Roberta Baskin filmed the inside of a Small Smiles clinic. The film showed children screaming as the dentists did work on them, as the children were held in papoose boards. The main dentist said that, in one time, they often did six or more baby root canals on a child. He also said the clinic had goals to do a certain amount of dental work so the clinic could make money. The news report went on television and people began filing lawsuits against Small Smiles. A woman from Kentucky named Debbie Hagan started a blog that was against Small Smiles and what it did. Journalists and people from the New York State government talked to Hagan to learn about what was happening. On November 14, 2008, Small Smiles sued Hagan, saying that she published their documents without their permission. On April 16, 2009 the company stopped the lawsuit.\n\nThe US government filed a lawsuit against Small Smiles for cheating it of money that was to be spent on dental work for poor children. Small Smiles agreed to pay $24 million to the US government so the lawsuit would be ended. In February 2012 Small Smiles asked for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection.\n\n\n", "id": "366692", "title": "Small Smiles Dental Centers"}

The county was sold in 1720. He did not sell it to pay any money he owed to others. It was sold so that a garden and a channel could be built in his palace.

Her father was Johann Baptist Pölzl and her mother was Johanna Hiedler. Either Hiedler's father, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, or his brother, Johann Georg Hiedler, was the biological father of Alois Hitler, the man she would later marry. It is presumed and accepted by most that the father was Johann Georg Hiedler. Klara and Alois were first cousins once removed. \n\nIn 1876, three years after Alois Hitler's first marriage to Anna Glasl-Hörer, Klara's uncle Alois had hired her as a household servant. She was 16 years old at the time. After the death of his second wife, Franziska Matzelsberger, in 1884, Alois and Klara were married on 7 January 1885 in a wedding held early in the morning at Hitler's rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn in Braunau. Alois then went to work for the day at his job as a customs official. Klara still called Alois \"uncle\" after the marriage. Their first son, Gustav, was born four months later, on 15 May 1885.

According to Smith, Alois had little understanding or interest in raising children. Historian Alice Miller later wrote, \"The family structure could well be characterized as the prototype of a totalitarian regime. Its sole, undisputed, often brutal ruler is the father. The wife and children are totally subservient to his will, his moods, and his whims; they must accept humiliation and injustice unquestioningly and gratefully. Obedience is their primary rule of conduct.\"\n\nKlara was very devoted to her children. According to William Patrick Hitler, she was a typical stepmother to her stepchildren, Alois Jr. and Angela.\n\nKlara was a devout Roman Catholic. She worshipped at church regularly with her children. Of her six children with Alois, only Adolf and Paula survived childhood.\n\nAlois's and Klara's children were:\n\n\nWhen Alois died in 1903, he left her a government pension.

Klara was buried in Leonding near Linz.\n\nAdolf Hitler had a close relationship with his mother. He was crushed by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his life. Bloch later recalled that, after Klara's death, he had seen in \"one young man never so much pain and suffering broken fulfilled\".

Normal transcription involves the synthesis of RNA from DNA; reverse transcription is the \"reverse\" of this.

It also synthesizes a second strand of DNA complementary to the reverse-transcribed single-stranded cDNA. \n\nWell studied reverse transcriptases include:\n\nReverse transcriptase was discovered by Howard Temin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in a cancer virus. It was independently isolated by David Baltimore in 1970 at MIT from two RNA tumour viruses. For their achievements, they shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Renato Dulbecco).\n\nThe idea of reverse transcription was very unpopular at first because it contradicted the central dogma of molecular biology. This states that DNA is transcribed into RNA which is then translated into proteins. However, in 1970 when Howard Temin and David Baltimore both independently discovered the enzyme responsible for reverse transcription, the possibility that genetic information could be passed on in this manner was finally accepted.\n\nOut of this work has come the idea that the first genomes were made of RNA genes. The RNA genes surviving today might be all that remain of this early condition. Reverse transcriptase might be the remnant of a stage when DNA genes were made by copying RNA genes. This theory is relevant to the earliest stages of evolution.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=366966", "text": "Antibiotic resistance\n\nAntibiotics can kill certain kinds of microorganisms. Over time, those microorganisms often develop resistance to the anitibiotics. Called antibiotic resistance, this is one of the most serious problems facing modern surgery and medicine. It is also one of the best examples of evolution in action.\n\nAntibiotic resistance spreads very quickly, far faster than microbiologists expected. \"As long as new drugs keep coming, resistance is not a problem. \"But there has not been a new class of antibiotics discovered since the 1980s\"\". It is now known that bacteria have a special mechanism, the integron, which speeds up the spread of resistance.\n\nA well-known example of natural selection in action is the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, antibiotics have been used to fight bacterial diseases. Natural populations of bacteria contain, among their vast numbers of individual members, considerable variation in their genetic material, as the result of mutations. When exposed to antibiotics, most bacteria die quickly, but some may have mutations that make them slightly less susceptible. If the exposure to antibiotics is short, these individuals will survive the treatment. This selective elimination of maladapted individuals from a population is natural selection.\n\nIn Fleming's 1945 Nobel Prize lecture he said:\n\nMaclyn McCarty explained what it was like before antibiotics:\n\nAll surgery that involves cutting open the body poses massive risks of infection. Antibiotics given before and after surgery allow surgeons to do operations that would have been deadly before. Open-heart surgery is one obvious example.\n\nCancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage the immune system. Antibiotics are prescribed to boost the body's natural defences. Patients with organ transplants always use drugs to suppress the immune system, otherwise it attacks the transplant. Therefore, antibiotics are used to protect the body. Without effective antibiotics, both sets of patients might die from infections which their immune systems could no longer control.\n\nMedical uses are also threatened. The number of tests coming back with resistance to carbapenems, one of the most powerful groups of antibiotics, has soared from a handful of cases in 2003 to more than 300 cases by 2010. \"My lab is seeing an increasing number of resistant strains year on year,\" said Prof Neil Woodford, of the Health Protection Agency's antimicrobial resistance unit. Most cases are resistant to some drugs. Even worse, there are a few cases of strains which \"no antibiotic can touch\".\n\nMany infections which were almost eliminated are coming back. The sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat. Around the world, multi-drug resistant and extremely-drug resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem. Only a couple of drugs still work.\n\nInfections that hit the elderly when they are in hospital are one of the main concerns. The greatest threat in the UK is opportunistic bugs which live in the gut such as \"E. coli\" and \"Klebsiella\".\nThey are now the most common form of infection which patients get in hospital. They show rising levels of resistance to antibiotics.\n\nThe UK Cabinet Office has issued a warning by the National Risk Register for Civil Emergencies. It says \"the number of infections complicated by antimicrobial resistance could increase markedly over the next 20 years\".\n\"Without effective antibiotics, even minor surgery and routine operations could become high-risk procedures, leading to increased duration of illness and ultimately premature mortality\".\n\nThe WHO has issued similar assessments:\n\nThe WHO has now listed the world's most threatening superbugs.\n\nGiven enough time, and repeated exposure to the antibiotic, a population of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will emerge. This leads to what is known as an evolutionary arms race, or co-evolution, in which bacteria continue to develop strains that are less susceptible to antibiotics, while medical researchers continue to develop new antibiotics that can kill them. In response, doctors use different, stronger antibiotics. However, new strains of Methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) have emerged that are resistant even to these drugs. A similar situation occurs with pesticide resistance in plants and insects, and with malarial resistance to quinine.\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. It is caused by various types of mycobacteria, usually \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\". The disease usually attacks the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. The pathogen can travel through the air, and spread from one person to the next. Experts believe that one third of the world population is infected with \"M. tuberculosis\". New infections occur at a rate of one per second.\n\nDrug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. \"Extensively drug-resistant TB\" is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.\n\nTotally drug-resistant TB was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012. It is resistant to all currently used drugs.\n\nMalaria infections are not caused by bacteria: they are caused by a protozoan parasite injected into the blood by a mosquito. They are normally treated by a \ncombination of two drugs, artemether-lumefantrine. Now four cases have occurred in Britain where the drugs have failed. The patients got the disease in Africa. A doctor said \"It is an early sign and we need to take it quite seriously as it may be snowballing into something with greater impact\".\n\n\"Teixobactin\" is an antibiotic discovered in 2015, the first new antibiotic discovered for forty years. It is not yet licensed for general use. It works against all gram-positive bacteria such as \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and against some other bacteria such as \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\".\n", "id": "366966", "title": "Antibiotic resistance"}

They can be found in the southern part of Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran; living mostly in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts.\n\nLeopard geckos are around 7-9 inches (17.8-22.9 cm) long, with large heads, big eyes with oval-shaped pupils, thin toes, and, unlike other reptiles, they have eyelids. They have thick tails that narrow to a point and, like their bodies and heads, are slightly flattened from top to bottom. Most of their scales are small and rough. Spaced rows of larger, bumpy scales give them a knobby, rough look, but they are actually soft when touched.\nBaby Leopard geckos are 85 mm long when they hatch, and when they hatch they have dark bands which go around their bodies.These bands lighten as the babies grow into adults which have spots instead of bands. Leopard geckos are normally lavender or yellow in colour, but pet Leopard geckos come in different \"colour morphs\" like albino, \"Banana blizzard\", \"Blizzard\", \"Ghost\", \"High Yellow\", \"Hyper Xanthic\", \"Jungle\", \"Leucistic\", \"Normal\" or \"Wild\", \"Patternless\", \"Red-stripe\", \"Snow\", \"Tremper Albino\" and many more.\n\nLike many lizards, the Leopard gecko has a tail that breaks off when grabbed by a predator. The tail breaks at a crack in the vertebra, and the surrounding muscles are arranged so that they separate neatly and instantly. A muscle closes around the artery in the tail at the point of the break and stops blood loss. Normally a new tail grows back. This method helps the Leopard gecko to escape when attacked. \nThe Leopard gecko is found in dry rocky regions, dry grasslands and deserts of southern Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Iran.\nThe temperatures of these areas during winter can be quite low, below , forcing the animals underground into semi-hibernation, called \"brumation\", and they live on fat reserves. Leopard geckos are crepuscular reptiles; during the day they hide in burrows, but they are active at dawn and dusk when the temperature is favorable.\n\nLeopard Geckos are friendly, docile creatures by nature, but they sometimes bite. If held in a human hand they will only bite if they mistake a finger for food, or if the person is holding the gecko too tightly.\n\nIn the wild, Leopard geckos feed mainly on insects, fruits, spiders, snails, small lizards, birds, and bird eggs. In captivity they feed on mealworms, crickets, and sometimes baby mice.\n\nLeopard geckos reach sexual maturity at the age of one to three years. Mating usually happens during the rainy season. During courtship, the male walks alongside the female, licking and lightly biting her side. He then grasps her neck in his mouth. If she accepts to mate with him, she lifts her tail allowing the male to insert one of his paired copulatory organs, called hemipenes. Female Leopard geckos can store sperm in their reproductive tracts for 15 months or more. They can lay up to five clutches of one or (usually) two eggs during the five month breeding season, and may use some of the stored sperm to fertilize each clutch. The eggs hatch after around 55 days.\n\nThere are five subspecies of the Leopard gecko:\n", "id": "367021", "title": "Leopard gecko"}

It has a chemical composition that is largely UO, but also contains UO and oxides of lead, thorium, and rare earth elements. It is known as pitchblende due to its black color and high density. It is also commonly referred to as Uraninite. The mineral has been known at least since the 15th century from silver mines in the Ore Mountains, on the German/Czech border. Pitchblende found in Germany was used by M. Klaproth in 1789 to discover the element uranium.\n\nPitchblende contains a small amount of radium as a radioactive decay product of uranium. Because the uranium isotopes U and U will decay to form the lead isotopes Pb and Pb, pitchblende also always contains small amounts of lead. Small amounts of helium are also present in pitchblend as a result of alpha decay. Helium was first found on Earth in pitchblende after having been discovered in the Sun's atmosphere.\n\nPitchblende is a major ore of uranium. Some of the highest grade uranium ores in the world were found in the Shinkolobwe mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the initial source for the Manhattan Project) and in the Athabasca Basin in northern Canada. Another important source of pitchblende is at Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada, where it is found in large quantities associated with silver. It also occurs in Australia, Germany, England, and South Africa. In the United States it can be found in the states of New Hampshire, Connecticut, North Carolina, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. \n\nUranium ore is generally processed close to the mine into yellowcake, which is an intermediate step in the processing of uranium.\n\n", "id": "367026", "title": "Pitchblende"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367030", "text": "Rare earth element\n\nRare earth elements (\"REEs\") are a set of seventeen chemical elements. They include the fifteen lanthanides plus scandium and yttrium. Scandium and yttrium are rare earth elements since they are often found in the same ore deposits as the lanthanides and have similar chemical properties.\n\nAlthough they are called rare, rare earth elements are not extremely rare on Earth. They were called this because they are spread very evenly over the Earth, so it is hard to find a lot in one place. Promethium is rare, because it is radioactive, and decays.\n\nCerium, one of the lanthanides, is the 25th most common element in the Earth's crust. However, most rare earth elements are not found concentrated or in pure forms.\n\nA table listing the seventeen rare earth elements, their atomic number and symbol, the origin of their names, and some of their uses is provided here. Some of the rare earths are named after the scientists who discovered them, and some are named based on where they were discovered.\nRare earth elements are heavier than iron. They are made by supernovae (exploding stars). In nature, fission of uranium-238 creates very small amounts of radioactive promethium. Most promethium is synthetically created in nuclear reactors.\n\nRare earth elements change through time in small quantities (ppm, parts per million). Their proportion can be used for geologic dating and dating fossils.\n\nThe rare earth elements are often found together. The longest-lived isotope of promethium has a half life of 17.7 years. Because of this, the element exists in nature in only very small amounts. Promethium is one of the two elements that do not have stable (non-radioactive) isotopes and are followed by stable elements (the other being technetium).\n\nBecause all lanthanides are close in size, the rare earth elements have always been hard to separate. Even with eons of geological time, separation of the lanthanides in nature has only rarely gone farther than the separation between light versus heavy lanthanides, otherwise known as the cerium and yttrium earths. This geochemical separation is shown in the first two rare earths that were discovered. These were yttria in 1794 and ceria in 1803. When first found, each was a mixture of all of the rare earths. Large ore bodies of the cerium earths can be found around the world and are being exploited. Ore bodies for yttrium are rarer. Also, they are usually smaller and less concentrated.\n\nUntil 1948, most of the world's rare earths came from sand deposits in India and Brazil. Through the 1950s, South Africa mined most of the world's rare earths. This happened after large veins of a rare earth bearing mineral were found there. Through the 1960s until the 1980s, a mine in California was the leading producer. Today, the Indian and South African deposits still make some rare earth concentrates, but they are very small compared to the amount being produced in China. China had produced over 95% of the world's rare earth supply. Most of this has been done in Inner Mongolia, even though it had only 37% of proven reserves. Although these numbers have since been said to have lowered to 90% and 23% by 2012. All of the world's heavy rare earths (such as dysprosium) come from Chinese rare earth sources such as the polymetallic Bayan Obo deposit. In 2010, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released a study which found that the United States had 13 million metric tons of rare earth elements.\n\nNew demand for these elements is higher than the supply of them. The world may soon face a shortage of the rare earths. In several years from 2009, worldwide demand for rare earth elements is expected to be more than the supply by 40,000 tonnes each year unless new sources are developed.\n\nThese concerns have gotten larger because of the actions of China. China has said it will put regulations on exports and work to stop smuggling. On September 1, 2009, China said it is going to lower its exports to 35,000 tons per year in 2010–2015. China said that this was done to conserve rare resources and protect the environment. On October 19, 2010 \"China Daily\" reported that China will \"further reduce quotas for rare earth exports by 30 percent at most next year to protect the precious metals from over-exploitation\". At the end of 2010 China said that the first round of exports in 2011 for rare earths would be 14,446 tons. This was a 35% decrease from the first round of exports in 2010. In September 2011 China said it was stopping production at three of its eight rare earth mines. These mines produced almost 40% of China's total rare earth production. In August 2012, China said there would be another 20% reduction in production.\n\nBecause of the increased demand and the restrictions on exports of the metals from China, some countries are stockpiling rare earth resources. Searches for new sources in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Tanzania, Greenland, and the United States are taking place. Mines in these countries were closed when China undercut world prices in the 1990s. It will take a few years to restart production.\n\nThe European Union has urged the Denmark protectorate Greenland to restrict Chinese development of rare-earth projects there, as China accounts for 95 percent of the world’s current supply. As of early 2013, the government of Greenlandhas said that it has no plans to impose such restrictions.\n\nNuclear reprocessing is another possible source of rare earth or any other elements. Nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium creates a many elements as well as all their isotopes. However, it is not likely that creating them can be done safely and economically because of the radioactivity of many of these isotopes.\n\nAnother source of rare earths is electronic waste and other wastes that have a large amount of rare earth components. New advances in recycling technology have made getting the rare earths from these materials easier to do. Recycling plants are currently operating in Japan, where there is about 300,000 tons of rare earths in unused electronics. In France, the Rhodia group is setting up two factories in La Rochelle and Saint-Fons. These factories will produce 200 tons a year of rare earths from used fluorescent lamps, magnets and batteries.\n\nChina has said that resource depletion and environmental concerns are the reasons for increased nationwide control of its rare earth mineral production. Non-environmental reasons have also been suggested to explain China's rare earth policy. According to \"The Economist\", \"Slashing their exports of rare-earth metals...is all about moving Chinese manufacturers up the supply chain, so they can sell valuable finished goods to the world rather than lowly raw materials.\"\n\nThe United States Department of Energy in its 2010 Critical Materials Strategy report identified dysprosium as the element that was most critical in terms of import reliance.\n\nA 2011 report issued by the U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of the Interior, “China’s Rare-Earth Industry,\" deals with industry trends in China. It looks at national policies that may guide the future of the country's production. The report says that China’s lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has grown over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons. China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: “Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota during the past several years.” In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. By 2011, there were only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers. The government’s future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: “According to China’s draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [metric tons] during the period from 2009 to 2015. The export quota for rare-earth products may be about 35,000 [metric tons] and the Government may allow 20 domestic rare-earth producers and traders to export rare earths.”\n\nThe United States Geological Survey is searching southern Afghanistan for rare earth deposits under the protection of United States military forces. Since 2009, the USGS has done remote surveys as well as fieldwork to verify Soviet claims that volcanic rocks containing rare earth metals exist in Helmand province near the village of Khanneshin. The USGS has found an area of rocks in the center of an extinct volcano with light rare earth elements including cerium and neodymium. It has mapped 1.3 million metric tons of useful rock. This is about 10 years of supply at current demand levels. The Pentagon has estimated its value at about $7.4 billion.\n\nRare earth elements are not exchange-traded in the same way that precious (for instance, gold and silver) or non-ferrous metals (such as nickel, tin, copper, and aluminium) are. Instead, they are sold on the private market. This makes their prices hard to monitor and track. However, prices are published periodically on websites such as mineralprices.com. The 17 elements are not usually sold in their pure form. They are usually distributed in mixtures of varying purity, e.g. \"Neodymium metal ≥ 99.5%\". because of this, pricing can vary based on the quantity and quality required by the end user.\n\n", "id": "367030", "title": "Rare earth element"}

He was Governor and then Premier of this province in British India.\nSikandar Hayat was the son of Nawab Muhammad Hayat Khan, CSI, of the Khattar tribe of Wah, in Northern Punjab.\n\nAfter initial education at the Aligarh school and the MAO College at Aligarh (later to become the Aligarh Muslim University), he went for higher education to the King's College London. On returning home, in 1915, he enrolled as an Assistant Recruiting Officer in the Punjab, to help the British Indian Army's efforts during the First World War; and was later one of the very first natives to receive the King's Commission, as a Captain of the 67th Punjabis (later the 1st Battalion of the 2 Punjab Regiment) in 1919. After the war he started his own business ventures and also entered grassroots politics in his area.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sikandar Hayat Khan slowly began to make his mark as a statesman, and in collaboration with Sir Fazli Husain and Sir Chotu Ram became one of the founders of the Unionist Party (Punjab). This was a secular party representing all Punjabis of different creeds mostly united by the \"zamindar\" (rural/agrarian) interest, and it soon became the most popular political group in the province. Due to his special services at this time, in various ways, the Government of British India granted a knighthood to Sir Sikandar. Between 1932 and 1934 he also had the unique honour of being the only native to be appointed acting Governor of the Punjab under British rule.\n\nThereafter, for a brief while, Sir Sikandar also worked as Deputy-Governor of the Reserve Bank of India but in July 1936, on the demise of Sir Fazli Husain, he returned to take on leadership of the Unionist party for the general elections held in Winter of the same year, winning by a simple majority and forming a coalition government along with the Indian National Congress and the Sikh Akali Dal. Sikandar was now chosen as Leader of the House and the Premier or Chief Minister of the Punjab. He remained in this position from 1937 to December 1942, when he died of a sudden heart failure.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1942, when he died, Sir Sikandar supported the British struggle against Nazi Germany and believed in cooperating with the British government in the Second World War. He believed that this support would be good for India and help it towards independence after the War ended. He was very active in maximizing recruitment of troops from the Punjab as part of the 'war effort' and even made morale-boosting tours of the Middle East where most Indian (especially Punjabi)troops where serving. The Muslim League leadership agreed with this perspective of his and also announced full cooperation with the British Raj, or government, to achieve their own ends.\n\nSoon after winning the general elections in 1937, Sir Sikandar felt conscious of the need to maintain a balanced stance in a volatile and divided Punjabi political system. He thus decided to also negotiate with the All India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. As a result, he and Jinnah signed the Jinnah-Sikandar Pact at Lucknow in October 1937, merging the Muslim elements of his powerful Unionist party with the Muslim League, as a move towards forming a common, united front for safeguarding their community rights and interests in India. He was also later one of the chief supporters and architects of the Lahore Resolution, March 1940, calling for an autonomous or semi-independent Muslim majority region within the larger Indian confederation—which demand later led to the demand for an independent Pakistan.\n\nAt the time of his sudden death in December 1942, Sir Sikandar was honoured by the people of Lahore and granted burial outside the old Badshahi Mosque there, on the other side from Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the poet. Much of his work was left half done, in particular his plan to help the British war effort towards eventual Indian freedom, and his attempts to weld the Punjab together and save it from communal friction. Many historians have opined that Sir Sikandar's early demise at the age of 50 was, arguably, a major blow to the Indian freedom movements, especially to the Punjab. He wished to preserve this intact, within a larger Indian Confederation whereby his own Muslim community could enjoy full and maximum freedom and self-governance without truncating India or the Punjab region. He was too well aware of the potential bloodbath and conflict resulting from any such division or separation which, alas, was witnessed on such massive scale at the time of the August 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan. It would thus not be wrong to say that Sir Sikandar's presence would certainly have been a 'moderating influence—and his death must be reckoned a great misfortune [at the time]\".\n\nIndirectly, however, in due course, his eldest son Shaukat Hayat Khan, would take on a significant role in assisting the All India Muslim League in winning an independent Pakistan, finally, in a somewhat different interpretation of the father's intentions.\n\n", "id": "367068", "title": "Sikandar Hayat Khan"}

Its head and body length is 45 – 62 cm (18 - 24\") and it weighs 2 – 5 kg (4 - 11 lb). \n\nGenetic analysis has shown that it is closely related with the Asian Golden cat and the Bay cat, which diverged from the other felids about 9.4 million years ago. Therefore, it may probably be transferred to the genus \"Catopuma\".\n\nIts tail is extremely long and bushy. The background color of its fur varies from dark gray-brown through yellowish gray to red-brown. The flanks and back are strikingly marked with large, irregular, dark-edged blotches. The legs and underparts are marked with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots and rings. There are spots on the forehead and crown, which merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck and irregular stripes on the back.\n\nThe marbled cat is found in northern India, Nepal, Guangxi and Yunnan provinces in China, and south through Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra (Indonesia), and Borneo. Throughout its range it is thought to be rare, although it has also been suggested that the perception of the marbled cat's rarity may be caused by its secretive nature and its preference for remote forest areas.\n", "id": "367106", "title": "Marbled cat"}

In the 1950s and 1960s, White farmers set up cattle stations around the town. Most of the Europeans left Finke when the railway line was moved westwards in the late 1970s. This was done because the track was damaged during huge floods in 1973 and 1974, so it was moved away from the river. The Aboriginal people living in the town did not move, and the town came to be known as Aputula. The name comes from a place called Putula near the town, which used to be the site of a water soak.
