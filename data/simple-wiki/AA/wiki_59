The players on the show are Geoff, Bridgette, Izzy, Trent, Gwen, Owen, Heather, Le-Shawna, Courtney, Beth, Lindsay, Justin, Harold, Duncan, DJ,\n\nLike the previous season, much of \"Total Drama Action\" chronicles the events of the eponymous fictional reality shows. The \"Total Drama\" series itself is an \"animated reality television series\", which stars the cast and crew of the fictional series, parodying many aspects of reality television in general.\n\nAfter last season's winner, Owen (Scott McCord), forgoes his prize money of C$100,000 for a challenge (open to all 22 of \"Total Drama Island\"'s contestants) in which the winner would receive C<nowiki>$</nowiki>1,000,000, the money was left in limbo after a situation resulted in a 14-way tie. As such, show host Chris McLean (Christian Potenza) had no choice but to commission a second competition with all 14 tied contestants. The contestants are told to arrive at an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto, where the new competition, titled \"Total Drama Action\", would take place. Because of its location, Chris tells the contestants that the challenges would all be in the form of various movie genres. The accommodations of the contestants are handled by Chef Hatchet (Clé Bennett) in a similar manner to how it was handled in the previous season.\n\nAfter a quick elimination of two contestants, the couple Geoff (Dan Petronijevic) and Bridgette (Kristin Fairlie), a second challenge determined the team captains of the two competing teams: the Screaming Gaffers, headed by Gwen (Megan Fahlenbock), and the Killer Grips, headed by Trent (Scott McCord). From then on, challenges would alternate between \"reward challenges\" where winners would receive a special prize, and \"elimination challenges\" where the losing team would vote off one of its own in an elaborate \"Gilded Chris Ceremony\". The pattern of reducing the contestants down was briefly interrupted on two occasions: once when Izzy (Katie Crown) was reinstated following a voting irregularity where her alter-ego, \"E-Scope\", was voted off, and another time when Courtney (Emilie-Claire Barlow), a contestant who did not originally qualify for \"Total Drama Action\", successfully sued the show. The players eliminated would make the \"walk of shame\" and into the \"Lame-o-sine\", where they leave the movie studio.\n\nOnce seven contestants were left, the Screaming Gaffers and the Killer Grips were dissolved, and the challenges became individual-oriented in nature. Chris hired Owen as his ringer to sabotage the other contestants and to create drama. Eventually, two contestants were left standing: Beth (Sarah Gadon) and Duncan (Drew Nelson). The Total Drama Action winner was Duncan. Beth wins in the alternate ending.\n\nSprinkled among the episodes (taking the place of reward challenges) is \"TDA Aftermath\", a show-within-a-show hosted by Geoff and Bridgette, commissioned shortly after their eliminations. On \"TDA Aftermath\", Geoff and Bridgette interview eliminated contestants on their \"Total Drama Action\" experiences. They are accompanied by the contestants of \"Total Drama Island\" that did not qualify for \"Total Drama Action\", as well as other previously-eliminated contestants. \"TDA Aftermath\" consisted of various \"never-before-seen footage\" sequences (purportedly taking place during the events of previous episodes), as well as two recurring segments, \"That's Gonna Leave a Mark\" (a segment of the contestants getting badly hurt), and \"Truth or...\" (in which a contestant is interviewed and are hurt if they lie to the hosts or the studio audience).\n\nWhen the field eventually narrowed down to two contestants, (Beth and Duncan), a final obstacle course challenge would lead the contestants into the Aftermath set, with the first one arriving winning the show's million-dollar grand prize. Unfortunately, Beth and Duncan had sufficiently cooperated enough though the final challenge to arrive at the same time, and what was meant as a season recap became a show in which the winner would be determined. After efforts by the eliminated and nonparticipant contestants to come up with an impartial way of determining the winner all fail, Chris (supposedly leaving on vacation) ultimately returns to the set and has the eliminated (but not the nonparticipant) contestants vote for the winner who was eventually Duncan.\n", "id": "240797", "title": "Total Drama Action"}

It turned out that there was an evil dragon living in a big cave under Wawel Hill. The dragon was stealing farm animals and young girls. Prince Krak said: \"The person who kills the dragon will get half of the country and will marry my daughter.\" Many brave soldiers tried to kill the dragon, but none of them could. Finally, a young shoe-maker came up with an idea! He filled a sheep's skin with salt and left it in front of the dragon’s cave. The greedy dragon saw the salt filled sheep and ate it in one bite. Soon he started to feel a burning pain in his stomach. The pain got worse. It burned more and more. Wanting water, he ran to the Vistula River and started to drink fast. He drank and drank but it was still burning. So he continued to drink, until he burst! The city was rid of the mean dragon, and the shoemaker got his prize from the ruler and married his daughter.\n\nIn 1970 a statue of the Wawel Dragon was placed in front of the dragon's den.

This is called nephrectomy. Sometimes, only part of the kidney has to be removed, and the rest can be left in. (This is called a partial nephrectomy). \n\nHowever, when renal cell carcinoma is more severe (this is called stage IV disease), it is much harder to treat. Current treatments include Interleukin-2, which Improves the cancer in about 5-10% of cases. Other treatments include Nexavar, Torisel, Sutent, Interferon, and Bevacizumab. In some cases, surgeons might remove both the original tumor in the kidney and the ones that spread to other parts of the body. carcinoma.\nIn patients whose cancer has spread to their liver, surgery to remove liver tumors may be helpful.\n\nOncophage cancer vaccine may also help treat renal cell carcinoma.\n\nKidney Cancer UK is a charity based in the UK, which can help, support and inform on all matter relating to kidney cancer www.kcuk.org.uk\n", "id": "240957", "title": "Renal cell carcinoma"}

It is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of mammals. It is an \"inhibiting\" neurotransmitter. Normally, when a neuron receives an impulse, it will make the signal stronger. In the case where there is an \"inhibiting\" neurotransmitter, the cell will no longer get the impulse, and the signal as a whole will be weakened. \n\nGABA regulates how much neurons in the central nervous system will be stimulated in humans, and other mammals. It plays a role in regulating neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. In humans, GABA is also directly responsible for the regulation of muscle tone. In insect species GABA acts only on excitatory nerve receptors.\n\nEven though chemically it is an amino acid, GABA is rarely referred to as such in the scientific or medical communities.

In ancient Roman times, this name was applied to several types of stone that would create sparks when struck against steel; Pliny the Elder described one of them as being brassy, almost certainly a reference to what we now call pyrite.\nBy Georgius Agricola's time, the term had become a generic term for all of the sulphide minerals.\n\nPyrite is usually found associated with other sulphides or oxides in quartz veins, sedimentary rock, and metamorphic rock, as well as in coal beds, and as a replacement mineral in fossils.

They are separated into two categories.\n\nLow-grade astrocytomas usually grow slowly and stay in one place. Because of this, many of them can be treated just with surgery. Once the tumor is taken out, often no other treatment is needed. As long as they get treatment, after five years, 90% of people with these astrocytomas are still alive.\n\nOne example of a low-grade astrocytoma is \"pilocytic astrocytoma.\"\n\nHigh-grade astrocytomas grow much more quickly and tend to spread throughout the body. Because of this, they are harder to treat and have worse prognoses than low-grade astrocytomas.\n\nOne example of a high-grade astrocytoma is \"anaplastic astrocytoma\".

It is in the Chicago neighborhood O'Hare. It is one of the largest airports in both the United States and the world. It is a \"hub\" for both United Airlines (its second largest hub) and American Airlines, meaning that flights from many cities come and go from the airport daily. It gets the most international flights of any American airport not on the East or West Coast.\n\nThe Federal government of the United States reduces the amount of delayed flights in the airport in order to shift the burden of domestic flights at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.\n\nUnited Airlines (including United Express) is the largest airline at O'Hare, carrying over 45% of passengers. O'Hare is the second-largest hub for United, after Houston-Bush. American Airlines (including American Eagle) has the second largest operation at O'Hare, carrying 37.08% of passengers. O'Hare is American Airlines' third-largest hub, after Dallas/Fort Worth and Charlotte-Douglas.\n\nO'Hare has been voted the \"Best Airport in North America\" for 10 years by two separate sources: Readers of the U.S. Edition of \"Business Traveler Magazine\" (1998–2003) and \"Global Traveler Magazine\" (2004–2007). Travel and Leisure magazine's 2009 \"America's Favorite Cities\" ranked Chicago's Airport System (O'Hare and Midway) the second-worst for delays, New York City's airport system (JFK, Newark Liberty, and LaGuardia) being the first. O'Hare currently accounts for over a sixth of the nation's total flight cancellations.\n\nThe O'Hare Airport is 668 feet (204 meters) above sea level.\n\nIt is operated by the City of Chicago Department of Aviation. Most of O'Hare Airport is in Cook County. However, a section of the southwest part of the airport is in DuPage County. The Cook County portion is located within a section of the city of Chicago contiguously connected to the rest of the city via a narrow strip of land about 200 feet (61 m) wide, running along Foster Ave. from the Des Plaines River to the airport. This land was annexed into the city limits in the 1950s to assure the massive tax revenue associated with the airport being part of the city. The strip is bounded on the north by Rosemont and the south by Schiller Park.\n\nThe airport was constructed in 1942–43. It was mad as a manufacturing plant for airplanes during World War II. The site was chosen for its proximity to the city and transportation. The two million square foot (180,000 m²) factory needed easy access to the workforce of the nation's then-second-largest city, as well as its extensive railroad infrastructure. Orchard Place was a small nearby farming community.\n\nDouglas Company's contract ended in 1945 and though plans were proposed to build commercial aircraft, the company ultimately chose to concentrate production on the west coast. With the departure of Douglas, the airport took the name Orchard Field Airport. That was the source of its three-letter IATA code ORD.\n\nIn 1945, the facility was chosen by the city of Chicago as the site for a facility to meet future aviation demands. Matthew Laflin Rockwell (1915–1988) was the director of planning for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and responsible for the site selection and design of O'Hare International Airport. He was the great grandson of Matthew Laflin, a founder and pioneer of Chicago. The architect of the airport was Gertrude Kerbis.\n\nThe O'Hare is currently undergoing the largest construction projects in the United States.\n\nIn March 2014, a Blue Line train was derailed and crashed at the O'Hare train station, injuring 32 people.\n\n\n1057 deaths have happened as a result of accidents to or from Chicago O'Hare.\n\nThe following airlines fly to O'Hare International Airport:\n\n\nThe following airlines used to fly to O'Hare International Airport:\n\n\n", "id": "241486", "title": "O'Hare International Airport"}

Gandhi used \"satyagraha\" in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggle in South Africa. \"Satyagraha\" helped shape Nelson Mandela's struggle in South Africa under apartheid, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s campaigns during the civil rights movement in the United States, and many other similar movements. Someone who does \"satyagraha\" is a satyagrahi.\n\nThe word \"Satyagraha\" is from the Sanskrit words \"satya\" (meaning \"truth\") and \"Agraha\" (\"insistence\", or \"holding firmly to\"). For Gandhi, \"Satyagraha\" went far beyond just \"passive resistance\" (resisting without taking action). His non-violence also became his strength. He said that he chose the name because Truth means Love, and Insistence means Force, and the Sanskrit name showed it was a force born from Truth and Love (non-violence).\n\nHe also wrote that he liked the term \"Civil Resistance\" better than \"Civil disobedience\". Gandhi also translated it as \"love force\" or \"soul force\".\n\nIn most conflict, the goal is to defeat the enemy, to stop him from meeting his goal, or to meet a goal that the enemy is trying to stop. But in \"Satyagraha\", these are not the goals. The goal, Gandhi said, is to change the mind of the wrong-doer, not to force him. Winning means getting along with the enemy to make what is wrong right again, which they might not realize is wrong. For this to happen, the enemy's mind must change to realize that he is stopping a goal that is right.\n\nGandhi asked those who did satyagraha (called \"satyagrahis\") to follow these rules:\n\n\nAnother time, Gandhi gave seven important rules: A satyagrahi:\n\n", "id": "241584", "title": "Satyagraha"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241636", "text": "Pluto\n\nPluto is a dwarf planet in the Solar System. Its formal name is 134340 Pluto. The dwarf planet is the ninth-largest body that moves around the Sun. At first, Pluto was called a planet. Now, it is the largest body in the Kuiper belt.\n\nLike other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice. It is quite small. It is about a fifth (⅕) of the weight of the Earth's Moon. It is only a third (⅓) its volume. It has an odd orbit and this orbit is very sloped. It takes Pluto to 30 to 49 AU (4.4–7.4 billion km) from the Sun. This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune. \n\nSince it was discovered in 1930, Pluto was thought to be the Solar System's ninth planet. In the late 1970s, the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small size.\nLater, in the early 21st century, the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered. Eris was initially believed to be 27% larger than Pluto, but was later found to be slightly smaller. On August 24, 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a definition to the word \"planet\" for the first time. By this definition, Pluto was not a planet anymore. It became a \"dwarf planet\" along with Eris and Ceres. After this, Pluto was put on the list of minor planets. It was given the number 134340. A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet.\n\nPluto and its largest moon, Charon, are sometimes called a \"binary system\". This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them. The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets, and until it passes such a ruling, they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto. Pluto has four known smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, discovered in 2005, Kerberos, discovered in 2011, and Styx, discovered in 2012.\n\nIn the 1840s, using Newtonian mechanics, Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed. He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus. Neptune was seen later in the late 19th century. Astronomers then felt that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet. In 1906, Percival Lowell, a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet. He called it \"Planet X\". By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be. Lowell continued the research till 1916. However, it fetched no good result. On March 19, 1915, his observatory had captured two images of Pluto. Lowell did not know this. The pictures were not recognized then for what they were.\n\nConstance Lowell, Percival's widow had a ten-year long legal battle for Percival's estate. For this reason, the search for Planet X again started in 1929. The director of the mission, Vesto Melvin Slipher, gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh, a 23-year-old Kansas man. Tombaugh had just come at the Lowell Observatory. Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings.\n\nTombaugh's had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks. Then, he had to look at each pair, to see whether any object had shifted. He used a machine called a blink comparator. He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates. This helped him to see whether any object had changed their position. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year. Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this. After the observatory did more research about it, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.\n\nThe discovery made headlines across the Earth. The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object. They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world. Some proposed Atlas as the name. Others wanted to name it Zymal. Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did. Constance Lowell proposed \"Zeus,\" then \"Lowell,\" and finally Constance. These suggestions were not used.\n\nThe name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney (later Venetia Phair). She was an 11-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England then. Venetia was interested in classical mythology and astronomy. The name was of the Roman god of the underworld. She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world. She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan. He was a former librarian at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Library. Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner. Turner told this proposed name to the astronomers in the United States.\n\nThe object was officially named on March 24, 1930. Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short-list of three names. The names were Minerva (which was already the name for an asteroid), Cronus, and Pluto. Pluto received all votes. The name was announced on May 1, 1930. Upon the announcement, Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward.\n\nThe name became popular in culture. The Disney character, \"Pluto\", was introduced in the same year. He was named in the object's honor. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto. This was to keep the tradition of naming new elements after newly discovered planets. For example, uranium had been named after Uranus, and neptunium after Neptune.\n\n", "id": "241636", "title": "Pluto"}

He lived in the Baroque period. He is especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas. He is thought of as the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. He was the father of the famous composer Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nScarlatti was born in Palermo. At that time it was part of the Kingdom of Sicily. We know nothing about his musical education. When his opera \"Gli Equivoci nell sembiante\" was produced in Rome in 1679 the Queen of Sweden, who was living in Rome at the time, was very impressed and gave him the job of being her Maestro di cappella. In February 1684 he became Maestro di Cappella to the viceroy of Naples. He wrote many operas for him, as well as some music for important state occasions. \n\nIn 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and went to Florence where he composed operas for Ferdinando de' Medici and for Cardinal Ottoboni, who made him his \"maestro di cappella\". In 1703 he also got a similar job in Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore. \n\nAfter visiting Venice and Urbino in 1707, Scarlatti went back to Naples in 1708, and stayed there until 1717. However, the audiences in Naples no longer seemed interested in his music. They liked their serious operas to include comic music. Some of his best operas were written for Rome where they were produced at the Teatro Capranica. He also wrote some church music and music for royal weddings. He died in Naples.\n\nScarlatti's music forms an important link between the early Baroque Italian vocal styles of the 17th century and the classical period of the 18th century, which led to the music of Haydn and Mozart. \n\nPerhaps his greatest work is \"Mitridate Eupatore\". Many of his later operas are full of music which allows the singers to show off. In his opera \"Teodora\" (1697) he was the first composer to use the orchestral \"ritornello\" (a tune which keeps coming back after sections of solo singing). \n\nSome of his later operas written for Rome make the orchestra sound much more modern. He uses horns in the orchestra. This was a new idea.\n\nAs well as operas, Scarlatti composed at least five hundred chamber-cantatas. These are works for solo voice accompanied by orchestra. Hardly any of them were published, but they contain a lot of good music.\n\nHe also wrote masses including the \"St Cecilia Mass\" (1721).\n\n", "id": "241641", "title": "Alessandro Scarlatti"}

The Italian irredentism was actively followed by many Italians in Istria (called Istrian Italians), like the Italian hero Nazario Sauro of Capodistria (actual Koper).\n\nIndeed, between 1918 and 1947 Istria was part of the Kingdom of Italy, but after WWII was part of Yugoslavia. Now the Istrian Italians are reduced to a small minority, who has survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII.\n\nFurthermore, after the war was created the \"Free Territory of Trieste\" in north-western Istria: in the years following the division of the territory between Italy and Yugoslavia, up to 40,000 Istrian Italians chose to leave the Yugoslav \"B zone\" and move to the \"A zone\" or Italy for various reasons - some were intimidated into leaving and some simply preferred not to live in Tito's Yugoslavia.\n\nSince the end of WWII the irredentism has totally disappeared in Istria, even because of the Istrian exodus.\n\nActually Istria is populated mainly by Slavs, but nearly 50,000 Italians still live there (divided between the areas of Istria belonging to Croatia, Slovenia and Italy).\n\nCapodistria (actual Koper) and Muggia were the centers of the irredentism in Istria. In these cities there was the main \"Comitato istriano\" (Istrian Committee for Union to Italy), the meeting place of the most famous istrian irredentists like Carlo Combi e Antonio Madonizza. From there sailed, in 1848, many Istrian Italians to fight for Venice against the Austrians with the Legione Istriano-dalmata.\n\nAfter 1866 - when Venice and the Veneto region were united to Italy - in all Istria there was full support for the irredentism. The Italian hero Nazario Sauro was born in Capodistria.\n\nActually only Muggia remains Italian, as part of the Province of Trieste.\n\n\n", "id": "241769", "title": "Italian irredentism in Istria"}

Most are protons and alpha particles, which are the nuclei of helium atoms. Some are electrons (beta particles), gamma rays or photons and a tiny fraction are even heavier particles.\n\nTheir origin is not exactly known. There is evidence that many primary cosmic rays come from the supernovae of massive stars. However, this is not thought to be their only source. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays. ...\n\nCosmic rays can have as much energy as 10 eV, far higher than the 10 to 10 eV that man-made particle accelerators can produce. \nWhen cosmic ray particles enter the Earth's atmosphere they hit other particles, like molecules of oxygen and nitrogen. This causes a shower of lighter particles, a so-called 'air shower'.\n\nThe number of particles made in an air shower event can reach billions. All of the particles in the shower stay within about one degree of the first particle's path. In a shower are x-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. \n\nTypical particles produced in such collisions are neutrons and charged mesons such as positive or negative pions and kaons. Some of these decay into muons. These are able to reach the surface of the Earth, and even penetrate for some distance into shallow mines. The muons can be easily detected by many types of particle detectors. The observation of a secondary shower of particles in different detectors at the same time shows that all of the particles came from that event.\n\nCosmic rays are responsible for the continuous production of certain unstable isotopes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon-14, by the reaction:\n\nCosmic rays kept the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere roughly constant (70 tons) for at least the past 100,000 years, until the beginning of above-ground nuclear weapons testing in the early 1950s. This is an important fact used in radiocarbon dating used in archaeology.\n\nCosmic rays are of great practical interest, because they can damage microelectronics and life outside the protection of the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. \n", "id": "241923", "title": "Cosmic ray"}

However, it can also be used to show disapproval. Claudia Johnson says that \"Janeitism\" is \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm (love) for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her (about her)\".\n\nJaneitism did not begin until after J. E. Austen-Leigh published \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1870. When this was published, Jane Austen became much more popular. This worried the literary elite. They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the \"masses\". The word \"Janeite\" was first begun by the literary scholar George Saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of \"Pride and Prejudice\". Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains, \"he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly (triumphantly, happily) pin\". In the early twentieth century, Janeitism was \"principally (mostly) a male enthusiasm shared among publishers, professors, and literati\". Rudyard Kipling even printed a short story called \"Janeites\" about a group of World War I soldiers who were fans of Austen's novels. \n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s,Austen's works were accepted at school, and the word began to change its meaning. It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the \"wrong\" way. The word, according to Lynch, is now \" and against \"other\" people\". \n\n", "id": "241979", "title": "Janeite"}

They are the chief protein components of chromatin, the active component of chromosomes. \n\nHistones act as spools around which DNA winds, and play a role in gene regulation. Without histones, the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long. For example, each human cell has about 1.8 meters of DNA, but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin, which, when duplicated and condensed during mitosis, result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes.\n\nHistones act as spools around which DNA winds. This packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei. The compacted molecule is 40,000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule.\n\nHistones undergo changes which alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. Long-term changes in histone/DNA interaction cause epigenetic effects. Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code, the so-called \"histone code\". Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation, DNA repair and chromosome condensation (mitosis).\n\nExamples of histone modifications in transcription regulation include:\n\nHistones were discovered in 1884 by Albrecht Kossel. The word \"histone\" dates from the late 19th century and is from the German \"Histon\", of uncertain origin: perhaps from Greek \"histanai\" or from \"histos\". Until the early 1990s, histones were dismissed as merely packing material for nuclear DNA. During the early 1990s, the regulatory functions of histones were discovered.\n\nThe discovery of the H5 histone appears to date back to 1970's.\n\nHistones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, and in certain Archaea, namely Euryarchaea, but not in bacteria. Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes, which suggests they are vital to the biology of the nucleus. In contrast, mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA, most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio.\n\nCore histones are highly conserved proteins, that is, there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species. Linker histone usually has more than one form within a species and is also less conserved than the core histones.\n", "id": "242006", "title": "Histone"}

During this time, a large number of impact craters formed on the Moon. By inference the same thing happened on Earth, Mercury, Venus, and Mars as well.\n\nThe evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples, which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time. Many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroidal or cometary material got into the inner solar system, but no consensus yet exists. One popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time, causing objects in the asteroid belt and/or Kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planets. \n\nSome think that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling.\n", "id": "242278", "title": "Late Heavy Bombardment"}

Certain benzodiazepines can be used as drugs that increase the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA. The resulting drug has sedative effects. Depending on the drug, the effect may be stronger or weaker. The first benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche.\n\nIn general taking benzodiazepines is safe and effective in the short term. Longer term use is controversial: In the long term, the drug may become less effective and problems of dependency may show. \n\nBenzodiazepines may not be safe to be taken during pregnancy. They are not teratogens, which cause birth defects, but they may cause cleft palate in a small number of babies. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are much less toxic than the drugs they replaced, the barbiturates. Death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates, the potential for toxicity increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.\n\n", "id": "242342", "title": "Benzodiazepine"}

In November 1863, when the military cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania was dedicated, Everett was the main speaker. His two-hour speech was before the much shorter, but now more famous Gettysburg Address by President Lincoln.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242394", "text": "NBA draft\n\nThe NBA draft happens every year in June. It is where teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA) choose players who have never played in the NBA before. If a team chooses a player, that player cannot sign a contract to play for any teams other than that team.\n\nPlayers must be at least 19 years old at some point during the year of the draft. If the player's 19th birthday will be the next year, they are too young. If a player is from the United States, it must be at least one year after the graduation of his high school class. Some players who are star players go to college and play college basketball for just one year (because they cannot enter the draft right out of high school), then enter the NBA draft. These players are called \"one and dones\". Other players enter the draft after two or three years in college, and other players are drafted after playing in college for all four years that they can.\n\nIf a player has not played in college for four years, they must enter the NBA draft by declaring themselves eligible. \n\nTeams take turns choosing players. When a team chooses a player, it is called a \"pick\". For example, if a player is the second player chosen, people will say that he was taken with the second pick in the draft. There are two rounds in the draft. Both rounds have 30 picks, so there are 60 picks in the whole draft. Each team gets one pick per round, but sometimes, a team will pick more than once in a round or not at all. This is because teams can trade draft picks for players, for money, or for other draft picks.\n\nThe NBA allows teams who had worse records (which means that they won fewer games) the previous season to pick before better teams. This lets bad teams draft good players and become better. The first fourteen teams to pick are the fourteen teams that did not make the playoffs the previous season. (There are thirty teams in the NBA, and sixteen teams qualify for the playoffs every year, so fourteen teams do not.) The teams that do make the playoffs and who get picks 15 through 30 in the first round pick in reverse order of how good their records were (so the best team gets the 30th pick, the second best team gets the 29th pick, and so on). However, the first fourteen picks are given out differently so that teams will not lose games on purpose to get higher picks. These picks are given to teams in a process called the \"draft lottery\".\n\nSince 1985, all teams that have missed the playoffs have participated in a lottery system to see who gets the first pick. The lottery system has changed a few times since then, but the system that the NBA uses right now uses ping pong balls that have numbers written on them. A machine picks four balls at a time, and every possible combination of numbers is assigned to a team. Teams with worse records get more combinations of numbers, which means that they have a better chance to win. The machine picks three teams, and these teams get the first three picks in the draft. The other eleven teams will pick in order of how bad their records are, so the worst team that was not selected will pick fourth, and so on.\n\nMany star NBA players who helped their teams a lot were selected early in the NBA Draft. For example, with the first pick in the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs chose Tim Duncan. Duncan would help the San Antonio Spurs win several NBA Championships. Other star players who were chosen with the first pick are Shaquille O'Neal (chosen by the Orlando Magic in 1992), Dwight Howard (chosen by the Magic in 2004), and LeBron James (chosen by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. However, not all players who have been chosen with the first pick have gone on to become star players. Some players have not had as much success as the teams who drafted them expected, and have been called \"draft busts\". A few players chosen with the first pick who have been called \"draft busts\" include Joe Smith (chosen by the Los Angeles Clippers in 1995), Michael Olowokandi (chosen by the Clippers in 1998), and Kwame Brown (chosen by the Washington Wizards in 2001.) On the other hand, some very successful players have been chosen very late in the draft, and have been called \"draft steals\". One such player is Manu Ginóbili, Duncan's longtime teammate with the Spurs, who was chosen with the next-to-last pick in the 1999 draft.\n", "id": "242394", "title": "NBA draft"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242398", "text": "Radiometric dating\n\nRadiometric dating (often called radioactive dating) is a way to find out how old something is. The method compares the amount of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope and its decay products, in samples. The method uses known decay rates. \n\nIt is the main way to learn the age of rocks and other geological features, including the age of the Earth itself. It may be used to date a wide range of natural and man-made materials. Fossils may be dated by taking samples of rocks from above and below the fossil's original position. Radiometric dating is also used to date archaeological materials, including ancient artifacts.\n\nRadiometric dating methods are used to establish the geological time scale. Among the best-known techniques are radiocarbon dating, potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating.\n\nAll ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements, each with its own atomic number, indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus. Elements exist in different isotopes, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide. Some nuclides are naturally unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously change into a different nuclide by radioactive decay. The decay may happen by emission of particles (usually electrons (beta decay), positrons or alpha particles) or by spontaneous nuclear fission, and electron capture.\n\nThe mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is: \n\nwhere\n\nThis equation uses information on the parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material solidified. This is well known for most isotopic systems. Plotting an isochron (straight-line graph) is used to solve the age equation graphically. It shows the age of the sample, and the original composition.\nThe method works best if neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product enters or leaves the material after its formation. Anything which changes the relative amounts of the two isotopes (original and daughter) must be noted, and avoided if possible. Contamination from outside, or the loss of isotopes at any time from the rock's original formation, would change the result. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration. \n\nMeasurements should be taken on samples from different parts of the rock body. This helps to counter the effects of heating and squeezing, which a rock may experience in its long history. Different dating methods may be needed to confirm the age of a sample. For example, a study of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland used five different radiometric dating methods to examine twelve samples and got agreement to within 30 million years on an age of 3,640my. \n\n", "id": "242398", "title": "Radiometric dating"}

It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium (K) into argon (Ar). \n\nPotassium is a common element found in many materials, such as micas, clay, tephra, and evaporites. In these materials, the decay product Ar is able to escape the liquid (molten) rock, but starts to build up when the rock solidifies (recrystallises). Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of Ar to the amount of K remaining. The long half-life of K is more than a billion years, so the method is used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years.\n\nQuickly cooled lavas make nearly ideal samples for K–Ar dating. They also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field at that time. The geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using K–Ar dating.\n", "id": "242430", "title": "K–Ar dating"}

Precision is in the 0.1-1 percent range. \n\nThe method relies on two separate decay chains, the uranium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 4.47 billion years and the actinium series from U to Pb, with a half-life of 704 million years.\n\nThe existence of two 'parallel' uranium-lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U-Pb system. \n\nThe term 'U-Pb dating' normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes. However, use of a single decay scheme (usually U to Pb) leads to the U-Pb isochron dating method, analogous to the rubidium-strontium dating method. \n\nFinally, ages can also be determined from the U-Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone. This is termed the lead-lead dating method. Clair Cameron Patterson, an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium-lead radiometric dating methods, is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth.\n\nUranium-lead dating is usually performed on the mineral zircon (ZrSiO), though it can be used on other minerals. Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystalline structure, but strongly rejects lead. Therefore, we can assume that the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic. Where this is not the case, a correction must be applied. Uranium-lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcite/aragonite and other carbonate minerals. These minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating, but are more common in the geologic record.\n", "id": "242441", "title": "Uranium-lead dating"}

He was born in Ankhtowe on the 16th day of Epiphi. Epiphi is the third month of the Egyptian harvest season. His mother was Khreduonkh and father was Kanofer an architect. Imhotep also became famous as an architect. After his death, because of his attachment with the god Ptah during his work at Ptah's temple stories were spread that said that Ptah was his father. As a god he was often pictured seated, wearing a long kilt robe and a skull cap or a shaven head. He had a papyrus scroll spread on his lap to show his scholarly nature and scribal assistance. \n\nAs an architect Imhotep was most famous because he was the designer of the step pyramid. Before the step pyramid, pharaohs were buried in flat topped structures called mastabas. The term mastaba comes from the word meaning bench because they look like the benches most Egyptians placed outside their door. An average mastaba had four walls, a flat top and an underground burial chamber, reached by a vertical shaft or stairwell. There were also a couple of small rooms above the burial chambers containing various items for the afterlife. The step pyramid was actually just a number of mastabas placed one on top of the other, each one smaller than the previous one.Imhotep was the architect, physician, scribe, and grand vizier of the IIIrd Dynasty pharaoh Zoser. It was Imhotep who conceived and built the Step Pyramid at Sakkara. In the Late Period, Imhotep was worshipped as the son of Ptah and a god of medicine, as well as the patron (with Thoth) of scribes. The Greeks considered him to be Asklepios.\n\nImhotep’s best-known writings were medical scrolls. He is thought to have written the Edwin Smith papyrus. The papyrus consists of 48 injuries of which 27 are head trauma, and six are spine trauma. Here’s an example for treatment of a head injury:\n“Examination: If thou examinest a man having a wound in his head, while his wound does not have two lips, penetrating to the bone of his skull, (but) not having a gash, thou shouldst palpate his wound (or, thou shouldst lay thy hand upon it); shouldst thou find his skull uninjured, not having a perforation; a split, or a smash in it. Treatment: Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day (and) treat afterwards with grease, honey (and) lint every day until he recovers wound in the head” \n\nAround 100 years after his death Imhotep was deified (made into a god). He became the god of medicine and healing. Small temples were built in honor of him. People with injuries would sleep near his temple hoping to be healed. As a god, Imhotep was also worshiped by scribes. Scribes would offer a couple drops of water in libation to him before starting to write. Even when the Greeks took over, he was identified with another deified man called Asclepius and the Greeks continued to honor and build temples for him. \nThis continued until the Arab invasion in North Africa in the 7th century AD. Imhotep did many things that boosted Egyptian society to amazing heights. He was the architect that changed Egyptian funeral architecture from mastabas to the phenomenal structures we today call pyramids. As a physician he healed many people and saved many lives, which after his death lead to him becoming a medicine god. \n\n", "id": "242516", "title": "Imhotep"}

Events include shot accuracy, fastest skater, puck control relay, hardest shot, breakaway challenge, and an elimination shootout. Players are put into teams in the same way the All-Star Game is done, which is by conferences. After each event, the winning conference is given points.\nThis event is to show who is the fastest skater while also moving the puck through pylons. Two races happen; the first one has three skaters on each team race against each other, and the second has the best single racers from each team. One point is given out to the winner of each of these two events.\nThis event is to see who can skate the fastest around the rink once. Two races are held; one for the team, and one for the faster single person.\n\nThis event shows who has the hardest shot. Two points are given out; one for the team that has the highest average shot, and one for the player with the hardest shot.

Al Iafrate had the old record, which was 105.2 mph\n\nThis event sees who can shoot four targets best. Each target is put in a corner of the net. Two points are given out; one point is for the team that hits the targets in the least amount of shots, and one point for the player who hits the targets in the least amount of shots. A player has hit all four targets in only four tries seven times: Ray Bourque in 1992 and 1993, Mark Messier in 1996, Jeremy Roenick in 2004, Tomas Kaberle in 2008, and Dany Heatley, and Evgeni Malkin in 2009.\n\nThis event has players shoot on a goalie.

The fruit grows on trees that are native to India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. Star fruit is common in the south of Asia, Australia and all of the islands around Australia. The tree is also grown in tropic islands. \n\nThe carambola has been growing in parts of Asia for hundreds of years. It may have first been in Sri Lanka and Moluccas. Malaysia grows the most carambola in the world and it also grows in Bangladesh.\nBecause of insects and disease, whole carambolas cannot be taken into the USA. In the USA, star fruit is grown in Florida, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, California, Texas, Arizona, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. \n\nStar fruit tastes best ripe (yellow with a little green). It will also be brown on the five edges and feel hard. If the star fruit is overripe it will be yellow with brown spots.\nYou can eat all of the fruit, even the skin. It is sweet and very juicy. The taste is a little bit like a subtle mix of papaya, orange and grapefruit.\n\nThe Carambola is a tropical fruit. In Northern India, it grows up to 4,000 feet in elevation. It prefers a total exposure to the sun but requires high humidity and a total of 70 inches or more of rainfall a year. It requires good drainage of the soil\nCarambola trees are planted 20 feet or more from each other. They grow fast and makes fruit when they are four or five years old. The rain during Spring makes the amount of fruit lower. In perfect conditions, Carambola can make from 200 to 400 pounds of fruit a year. The fruit is picked mainly during the months of June, July, and August.\nMajor pests are fruit flies, ants, and birds. In the United States, they are also vulnerable to frosts. \n", "id": "242629", "title": "Carambola"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242678", "text": "Super Mario\n\nThe \"Super Mario\" series is the biggest and most important sub-series of the \"Mario\" series. It started in 1985 with the creation of Super Mario Bros. on the Famicom and later on the Nintendo Entertainment System (also called NES). It has been followed by many sequels released in almost every Nintendo video game console to date, except the Game Boy, the Game Boy Color, and the Game Boy Advance, where only remakes, ports, or other spin-offs games where released.\n\nMost of these games, except \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", \"\", and the \"Super Mario Land \"series\", \"are about Mario and, normally, his brother Luigi and sometimes his best friend Yoshi, in their adventure to search for and save Princess Peach from Bowser, who wants to takeover the Mushroom Kingdom, or another place, depending on the game. The Mario brothers' adventure is not easy, however, as they need to face Bowser's troops all over, who try to stop the brothers' attempts to save the princess.\n\nAll the games, and even some remakes, have been started by the Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (also called Nintendo EAD) branch but not by the same area.\n\nIn 2010, the series celebrated the twenty-fifth of the release of \"Super Mario Bros.\". The celebration included a series of videos showing various tricks throughout the series' games on the Wii's Nintendo Channel, as well as releasing a Wii port of \"Super Mario All-Stars\", which included a history booklet of the \"Super Mario\" series and a CD containing several songs from games in the series.\nSuper Mario Bros.\n\nThis game is the first in the \"Super Mario\" series. It was made for the Famicom and the NES in 1985. This game set the way for the later games, and it was later re-released for many newer systems, including the Game Boy Advance and the Virtual Console for the Wii. This game marks the first appearance for many new heros, species, and villains. These characters include Bowser, Princess Peach (then called Princess Toadstool), Toad and the Mushroom Retainers, Goombas, Koopa Troopas, and many more.\n\nA year after \"Super Mario Bros.\", Nintendo put out this game. It was made for the Famicom Disk System. It uses a slightly different form of \"Super Mario Bros.\"'s engine, with different levels and new features including different graphics and the enemies acting a different way. This game is called Super Mario Bros. 2 in Japan; Nintendo of America originally thought this game was too hard and too much like the first to sell well in the United States. However, this game came in United States as part of \"Super Mario All-Stars\", and recently, this game was on the Virtual Console on the Wii.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. 2\n\nAfter seeing that the Lost Levels was too hard, they did not release it in North America and Europe. Instead they remade Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters. You can play as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, each with their own powers and abilities. They need to free Subcon from the evil frog Wart. The game has been included in remakes, such as Super Mario All-Stars and on Virtual Console.\nSuper Mario Bros. 3\n\nThis is the fourth \"Super Mario\" game. It was made for the Famicom and the NES. Many new species appear, including main ones like Boo and Spike. Boom Boom, Dry Bones, and the Koopalings also first appear here. New power-ups also appear such as the Super Leaf, the Hammer Suit and the Frog Suit. It has been believed to be one of the greatest games of all time. Its hard and tricky levels made it a huge success. It has new power ups, new moves, items, and enemies. It also has special non-level parts of each world, including Toad Houses where lives are gotten and Spade Panels, as well as some secret parts, such as the White Toad House and the Treasure Ship.\n\nSuper Mario World\n\nThis game was released in 1990 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also called SNES). It was also re-released as the second game in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series. In this game Mario and Peach go on a trip to Dinosaur Land but things go wrong when Bowser kidnaps Peach. This game was special for creating Yoshi and the species. It is the fifth game in the \"Super Mario\" series.\n\nSuper Mario 64\n\nThis game has its own special gameplay and story to the \"Super Mario\" series. It was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64. In this game, Mario uses Power Stars to bring back the kidnapped Peach. Mario jumps into paintings trying to find Peach. Unlike games before, the way to win the levels in this game is not to find the end of the level; instead, Mario needs to find Power Stars by finishing missions in each course. This is also the first 3D game in this series. Though it was not the first 3-D platforming game, it transformed the genre, with many games soon following its formula, using it as a sort of guide. It is widely celebrated as one of the greatest games of all time. A remake for this game came out in 2004 for the Nintendo DS called \"Super Mario 64 DS\". This game brought in new bosses, such as King Bob-omb and Eyerok.\n\nSuper Mario Sunshine\n\nThis game was released in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube. Its gameplay is almost like \"Super Mario 64\"; however, it has a different storyline. Mario, Princess Peach, and Toadsworth are taking a vacation to Isle Delfino, when they find that the island has been ruined and the Shine Sprites stolen by a strange enemy that looks like Mario himself. Mario is then taken into custody and has to get a job cleaning up the entire island. Instead of collecting Power Stars, the player collects Shine Sprites. This game also introduced many recurring characters and bosses in the Mario series, including Toadsworth, Bowser Jr., Petey Piranha, Gooper Blooper, Piantas, Nokis, Shadow Mario, and FLUDD. \"Super Mario Galaxy\" is the sequel to this game. This is the second 3D game in the series.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros.\n\nThis game is the eighth in the \"Super Mario\" series. It starts out when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach during a strange accident. Luigi can be played in this game, too. Luigi could not be played since \"Super Mario World\". This is the first game since \"Super Mario World\" (1990) that features the classic 2D play-style of the \"Super Mario Bros.\" games. The game features a solo story mode with Mario or Luigi, a two-player wireless game Mario vs. Luigi, as well as a mini-game mode for up to four players. It was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS. \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is the sequel, though that game is not thought to be a direct sequel to the DS game.\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy\n\nThis game is the ninth in the \"Super Mario\" series and the third 3D game in the series. It is different than the first two 3D games for the \"Mario\" series, this game takes place in deep space. Mario goes to the Star Festival because Princess Peach asks him, when the town comes under attack by Bowser's air forces. He steals Peach's castle and sends it to the center of the universe, making Mario have to save her. Most of the game's levels includes many small planets and asteriods, while others have bigger planets. A new popular species and character appear, Luma and Rosalina. It was released in 2007 for the Wii. This game has a direct sequel, called \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\". It is the only 3D game that has a direct sequel.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. Wii\n\nThis game is the tenth in the \"Super Mario\" series and the second for the Wii. It is an indirect sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros.\". In this game, Yoshis are can be ridden and the Koopalings return. It has single-player and multiplayer mode for up to four players at the same time. This is the first time more than one player can play at the same time in a \"Super Mario\" game. Two new characters that can be played appear, Yellow Toad and Blue Toad. New power-ups also appear including the Propeller Suit and the Penguin Suit.\n\nSuper Mario Galaxy 2\n\nThis is the eleventh in the \"Super Mario\" series. It is also the fourth 3D game in the series. The sequel contains many things from the first game, such as the story, the adventure being in outer space, objects such as Launch Stars, recurring items including the Bee Mushroom, and things about gravity. The game shows new things such as the use of Yoshi and new power-ups such as the Cloud Flower. Rosalina reappears and new characters of the Luma species appear including Lubba. This is the third game for the Wii in the \"Super Mario\" series.\n\nSuper Mario 3D Land\n\nThis is the fifth 3D game in the series, and the twelfth game in the \"Super Mario\" series. The levels of this game are much more straight and flat than the other 3D games, almost like side-scrolling games. Many past power-ups and characters return, such as False Bowsers, the Super Leaf and Boom Boom. There are new power-ups, such as Boomerang Mario, and White Tanooki Mario. There are also new enemies and a female partner of Boom Boom named Pom Pom.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. 2\n\nThis game is another side-scroller in the series released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. It's the third game in the \"New Super Mario Bros. \"series and a direct sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros.\". The game has lots of coins, and Raccoon Mario is back after not being in a game for a long time. A new power-up called the Gold Flower turns Mario into Gold Mario.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. U\n\nThis game is a side-scroller for the Wii U. The game uses some things from \"Super Mario World\" like Baby Yoshis, Sumo Bros., Bony Beetles, and diagonal pipess. The game is very much the same as \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" with its four-player mode, what is different is a player with a Wii U GamePad can make platforms in what Nintendo calls \"Boost Mode\". It is the first \"Super Mario\" game (and \"Mario\" game) in high-definition. Flying Squirrel Mario is new.\n\nSuper Mario 3D World\n\nThis game is the console sequel to \"Super Mario 3D Land\". The game lets the player turn into Cat Mario by picking up a Super Bell. Everyone who could be played in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" can be played again, with the same exact power. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad try to save the Sprixie Princesses that Bowser has kidnapped and save the Sprixie Kingdom.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. (handheld)\n\nIn 1987, an easier \"Super Mario Bros.\" was released for the Game & Watch. It is a sidescroller where Mario had to move over many platforms while keeping away from Lakitus and Bullet Bills.\n\nSuper Mario All-Stars\n\nThis game (called Super Mario Collection in Japan) was released in 1993 also for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a remake of the first four \"Super Mario\" series games. \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", and \"\". This game changed the four games' graphics and sound to make them better.\n\nSuper Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World\n\nThis game is an America/Europe-only remake of \"Super Mario All-Stars\" that also has \"Super Mario World\" for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second remake of the series.\n\nSuper Mario Bros. Deluxe\n\nThis game is a Game Boy Color remake which includes the first two \"Super Mario\" games ever released: \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\" (Super Mario Bros.: For Super Players). It also has many other collectibles, like images that could be printed with the Game Boy Printer, a calendar, and a fortune teller. Unlike other remakes, it was not developed by Nintendo EAD, but by Nintendo Research & Development 2 (also called Nintendo R&D2).\n\nSuper Mario Advance\n\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" made for the Game Boy Advance, and released in 2001. Like \"Super Mario All-Stars\", this game had changed graphics.\n\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario World\" made for the Game Boy Advance. It was the second in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series and was released in 2002. There are many differences between \"Super Mario World\" and this game. The game was a gigantic hit for Nintendo and the Game Boy Advance, selling 3,290,000 copies in the United States and 5,460,000 copies worldwide. Luigi's sprite (video game graphic) has been changed and made taller than Mario, like how he looks now, and \"Mario Bros.\" has been put in the game.\n\nn 2003, the fourth in the \"Super Mario Advance\" series, was released for the Game Boy Advance. It is much the same graphics and sound to the \"Super Mario All-Stars\" form, and made use of the e-Reader. A few e-cards came with new copies of the game, while two sets (called \"series\") of cards, were released and sold with the game. By scanning special cards into the e-Reader, players were able to send items, videos, and most importantly, new levels into the game. One important item was the Cape Feather from \"Super Mario World\", which let Mario change into Cape Mario. There were also two Switch cards that the player could turn on (and turn off) the effects of by scanning them; the Orange Switch and the Blue Green Switch. Scanning these switches set off small uses in the game. The e-Reader item is still available in the European form, but has been turned off and cannot be used anymore.\n\nThe NES form of \"Super Mario Bros.\" was released for the Game Boy Advance as part of the \"Classic NES\" series of games in celebrating and remembering for the 20th anniversary of the release of the first Famicom and NES. It does not have any new additions, all of the errors were left in the game, and the graphics were shrank to fit the GBA screen size.\n\nIn Japan, the \"Classic NES\" series was called Famicom Mini. Super Mario Bros. 2 (\"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels\") was released only in Japan. Much like \"Super Mario Bros.\", it did not have any new items, the errors were the same, and the graphics shrank.\n\nSuper Mario 64 DS\n\nThis game is a remake of \"Super Mario 64\". It was released in 2004 for the Nintendo DS. It is also the first \"Mario\" game released for the Nintendo DS. Though it is a remake, there are many differences between it and the first. One difference is that there are many secret stars, making 150 Power Stars instead of 120. Wario, Luigi, and Yoshi can be played, and mini-games were added.\n\nSuper Mario All-Stars Limited Edition\n\nReleased for the Wii in 2010, this game celebrates the 25th anniversary of Mario by having the same games as \"Super Mario All-Stars\".\n\nNew Super Luigi U\n\nThis is a game released to praise the Year of Luigi. It keeps many of the same things from \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", such as the story and world map. It has also been released as a DLC title for \"New Super Mario Bros. U\". However all of the levels have been changed, and Mario is gone, making Luigi the main character. Nabbit can be played, taking the place of Mario. The boxed form was for sale until the end of the Year of Luigi (2013).\n\nNew Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U\n\nA collection of both \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" and \"New Super Luigi U\" on the same disc, released with the Mario & Luigi Deluxe Wii U set (known as the Premium Pack in Europe) only. This game has changes to the originals, including a new title screen and over 200 videos included as a present.\n\nSuper Mario Land\n\nIt plays much the same to the games on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game to have Princess Daisy instead of Princess Peach. The goal of the player is to beat Tatanga and save Princess Daisy. Mario can beat enemies by jumping on their head, but some cannot be beaten this way. It released on Virtual Console in 2011 on 3DS.\n\nThis is the second in the \"Super Mario Land\" series, released in 1992, three years after \"Super Mario Land\". This is the first game to have Wario, the main rival of Mario. In this game, it is made known that what happened in \"Super Mario Land\" was made by Wario so that he could take over the castle Mario owned. He uses the power of six magic coins to lock the castle, leaving them to the care of eight of his assistants (including Tatanga) so that Mario cannot get inside. Now, Mario needs to travel through six different worlds to get those coins and his castle back from the money-grabbing anti-hero. This game has better graphics, as well as a save feature, which is not present in \"Super Mario Land\" because of its short length. However, it keeps the same Mario-style gameplay and even brings back the Fire Flower power-up. There is also a new power-up, which is a carrot that lets Mario slide across certain areas. Like \"Super Mario World\", Mario now has the spin jump ability, which can be used to kill certain enemies quickly.\n\nTaking place after his loss in \"Super Mario Land 2\", Wario makes a decision to go on a hunt to get himself enough money to get a castle of his own. During his hunt, he discovers many treasures as he fights Captain Syrup and her army, the Black Sugar Pirates. The gameplay in Wario Land differs slightly from the previous Super Mario Land installments. For example, if the player holds down the B button, then Wario does not run. His momentum does increase, however, if Wario is using the Jet Wario power-up, which lets him fly through the air for a short amount of time at super speed. His other power-ups are Bull Wario, which gives him super strength and the power to stick to ceilings and conveyor belts, and the Dragon Wario power-up, which lets him blow fire. Wario is also able to hold and cast enemies (as well as coins, which are normally needed to go out of a stage).\n\nVB Mario Land\n\nThis was a \"Super Mario Land\" game planned for the Virtual Boy which ended up called off because of the short time the system was out. The game was going to use all of the powers of the system and would have dungeons much the same to \"The Legend of Zelda\" games. Not much is known about this game, but it is known Wario was set to show up, as would a three-dimensional (also called 3-D) Mario Bros.. It is thought that some ideas were taken from this game and put into \"Mario Clash\".\n", "id": "242678", "title": "Super Mario"}

It is the only historically black college in the state. It is the westernmost historically black college in the United States. Though in a rural setting just 10 miles east of Guthrie, Langston also serves an urban mission with University Centers in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City.\n\nThe school was started in 1897. Tbe school was first known as the Oklahoma Colored Agricultural and Normal University. Langston University was created because of the second Morrill Act in 1890. The law made states with land grant colleges (such as Oklahoma State University, then Oklahoma A&M) to either allow African-Americans in as students, or provide an alternative school for them to attend. This was required in order to receive federal money. Langston University is named for John Mercer Langston (1829-1897). He was a civil rights pioneer. He was the first African American member of Congress from Virginia. Langston started the Howard University Law School. He also served as American consul-general to Haiti.\n\nPoet Melvin B. Tolson taught at Langston from 1947 until 1964. Tolson was portrayed by Denzel Washington in the film \"The Great Debaters\".\n\nThe University offers associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in a variety of disciplines. It is known as a leader in the field of agricultural research. It hosts the internationally known E (Kika) de la Garza Institute for Goat Research. The School currently has an open doors admissions policy.\n\nThe university was accredited with a Doctorate of Physical Therapy program in 2005.\n\nThe student life at Langston University got the attention of BET and the second season of the reality television show College Hill was filmed there. The Langston University Quiz Bowl team won games against Spelman and an all-star team from the City Colleges of Chicago on the 2009 nationally televised \"Black College Quiz\" show airing nationally throughout Black History Month in 2009 to make the championship game.\n\n", "id": "242719", "title": "Langston University"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242720", "text": "Marques Haynes\n\nMarques Haynes (March 10, 1926 – May 22, 2015) was an American professional basketball player. He was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters. He is known for his ability to dribble the ball and keep it away from defenders. According to the movie \"Harlem Globetrotters: Six Decades of Magic\", Haynes could dribble the ball as many as six times a second.\n\nHaynes learned to dribble the basketball from his sisters. His skills may have been helped by handling the ball on the dirt courts of his hometown. A native of Sand Springs, Oklahoma, he played basketball for Langston University from 1942-1946. While at Langston, he once dribbled out the clock in a conference tournament game to taunt an opponent, Southern University. Southern had just run up the score against a weaker team (Sam Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University). The Sam Huston team was coached by a young Jackie Robinson. Haynes' own coach, the famous Zip Gayles, punished him for the taunting, but it helped draw the attention of the Globetrotters. They were always on the search for trick ballhandlers. Langston was invited to play an exhibition game against the Globetrotters in Oklahoma City. In that game, Haynes led Langston to a 4-point win. He was immediately invited to join the Globetrotters. He returned to Langston to complete his degree. Then he began his long professional career.\n\nHaynes played with the Globetrotters from 1947-1953. Upon leaving in 1953, he turned down a $35,000 a year offer from the Philadelphia Warriors that would have made him the second-highest paid player in the NBA. Instead, he started his own barnstorming team, the Harlem Magicians. Boxing legend Sugar Ray Robinson sometimes played games with this team. Haynes later rejoined the Globetrotters as a player/coach. He also played for the Harlem Wizards. \n\nHe retired in 1992 after a 46-year professional career, and was inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame on October 2 1998. He lived in Dallas, Texas.

It is made up of historically black universities in the Southern United States. It participates in the NCAA's Division I for all sports. In football, it participates in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). \n\nThe SWAC is one of two conferences (the other being the Ivy League) which do not take part in postseason play in the FCS football tournament. It is the only one of the two whose members offer a full range of scholarships for football. The SWAC instead splits its schools into two divisions, and plays a conference championship game. Furthermore, one SWAC game, the Bayou Classic between Southern and Grambling State, is positioned on the schedule after the NCAA tournament has begun. In addition, Alabama State plays Division II rival Tuskegee annually on Thanksgiving Day (The Turkey Day Classic). \n\nIn 1920, athletic officials from six Texas HBCUs – C.H. Fuller of Bishop College, Red Randolph and C.H. Patterson of Paul Quinn College, E.G. Evans, H.J. Evans and H.J. Starns of Prairie View A&M, D.C. Fuller of Texas College and G. Whitte Jordan of Wiley College – met in Houston, Texas, to discuss common interests. At this meeting, they agreed to form a new league, the SWAC.\n\nPaul Quinn became the first of the original members to leave the league when it did so in 1929. When Langston University of Oklahoma was allowed into the conference two years later, it began the migration of state-supported institutions into the SWAC. Southern University entered the league in 1934. Arkansas AM&N entered in 1936 and Texas Southern University in 1954. \n\nAs the state-supported schools became bigger, it became difficult for the church-supported schools to pay for their sports teams. Soon the church-supported schools started to leave the conference. Bishop withdrew from the conference in 1956, Langston in 1957 and Huston-Tillotson (formerly Samuel Huston) in 1959. That happened one year after two more state-supported schools entered the league (Grambling College and Jackson State College). The enter-exit cycle continued in 1961 when Texas College withdrew, followed by the entrance of Alcorn A&M in 1962. Wiley left in 1968, the same year Mississippi Valley State College entered. Arkansas AM&N exited in 1970 and Alabama State University entered in 1982. Arkansas-Pine Bluff (formerly Arkansas AM&N) rejoined the SWAC on July 1, 1997, regaining full-member status one year later. Alabama A&M University became the conference’s tenth member when it became a full member in September, 1999 after a one year period as an affiliate SWAC member.\n\nCurrent championship competition offered by the SWAC includes competition for men in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field and tennis. Women’s competition is offered in the sports of basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track & field, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.\n\nThere are currently 10 members in the SWAC.\n\n\nAll games at were played at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n", "id": "242721", "title": "Southwestern Athletic Conference"}

Since 1931, it has been awarded by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The winner receives the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award. The award is named in honor of the first MLB commissioner. Landis served from 1920 to 1944. MVP voting takes place before the postseason. The results are not announced until after the World Series. The BBWAA began asking three writers in each league city in 1938. They made that number two per league city in 1961.\n\nFirst basemen, with 34 winners, have won the most MVPs among infielders. This is followed by second basemen (16), third basemen (15), and shortstops (15). Of the twenty-four pitchers who have won the award, fifteen are right-handed while nine are left-handed. Walter Johnson, Carl Hubbell, and Hal Newhouser are the only pitchers to win more than once. Newhouser won his in back-to-back seasons, 1944 and 1945. Stan Musial, Alex Rodriguez, and Robin Yount have won at different positions. Rodriguez is the only player to win the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often (seven times). He has also won it the most times in a row (2001–2004). Jimmie Foxx was the first player to win more than once. Nine players have won three times and 19 have won twice.\n\nThe award's only tie occurred in the National League in 1979 when Keith Hernandez and Willie Stargell received the same amount of points. There have been 17 unanimous winners, meaning they received all the first-place votes. The New York Yankees have the most winning players with 22. The St. Louis Cardinals have the second most with 17 winners. Five teams have not had a winner. The most recent winners are Mike Trout in the American League and Clayton Kershaw in the National League.\n\nBefore the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile announced he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball at the end of the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway. Chalmers ended up giving cars to both players.\n\nThe following season, Chalmers created the Chalmers Award. A committee of baseball writers were to come together after the season to determine the \"most important and useful player to the club and to the league\". Since the award was not as useful at advertising as Chalmers had hoped, it was discontinued after 1914.\n\nIn 1922 the American League created a new award to honor \"the baseball player who is of the greatest all-around service to his club\". Winners, voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by James Crusinberry, received a bronze medal and a cash prize. Voters were required to select one player from each team. Player-managers and prior award winners were could not win. These problems resulted in the award's being dropped after 1928. The National League award, without these restrictions, lasted from 1924 to 1929.\n\nThe BBWAA first awarded the modern MVP after the 1931 season, took the format the National League used to distribute its league award. One writer in each city with a team filled out a ten-place ballot. Ten points were given for the recipient of a first-place vote, nine for a second-place vote, and so on. In 1938, the BBWAA raised the amount of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first-place vote. The only significant change since then happened in 1961, when the number of voters was lowered to two per league city.\n\n", "id": "242724", "title": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}

The custom of gold-silver-bronze for the first three places dates from the 1904 games. It has been copied for many other sports events. Creating the medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928-1968 the design was always the same. One side showed a design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city. The other side showed another design of an Olympic champion. From 1972-2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the one with a custom design by the host city on the other. Because Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek games, a new design was create for the Athens 2004 Games.

For functions that act on the real numbers, it is the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. The derivative is often written using \"dy over dx\" (meaning the difference in y divided by the difference in x. The \"d\"'s are not variable, and therefore cannot be cancelled out.\n\nThe derivative of y with respect to x is defined as the change in y over the change in x, as the distance between formula_2 and formula_3 becomes infinitely small (infinitesimal). In mathematical terms,\nThat is, as the distance between the two x points (h) becomes closer to zero, the slope of the line between them comes closer to resembling a tangent line.\n\nDerivatives of linear functions (functions of the form \"a\" \"x\" + \"b\" with no quadratic or higher terms) are constant. That is, the derivative in one spot on the graph will remain the same on another.\n\nWhen the dependent variable y directly takes x's value (y=x), the slope of the line is 1 in all places, so formula_5 regardless of where the position is.\n\nWhen y modifies x's number by adding or subtracting a constant value, the slope is still one because the change in x and y do not change if the graph is shifted up or down. That is, the slope is still 1 throughout the entire graph, so its derivative is also 1.\n\nPower functions (e.g. formula_6) behave differently than linear functions because their slope varies (because they have an exponent).\n\nPower functions, in general, follow the rule that formula_7. That is, if we give a the number 6, then formula_8\n\nAnother possibly not so obvious example is the function formula_9. This is essentially the same because 1/x can be simplified to use exponents:\n\nIn addition, roots can be changed to use fractional exponents where their derivative can be found:\n\nAn exponential is of the form formula_15 where formula_16 and formula_17 are constants and formula_18 is a function of formula_19. The difference between an exponential and a polynomial is that in a polynomial formula_19 is raised to some power whereas in an exponential formula_21 is in the power.\n\nformula_22\n\nFind formula_23.\n\nformula_24\n\nformula_25\n\nformula_26\n\nformula_27\n\nTherefore,\n\nformula_28\n\nThe derivative of logarithms is the reciprocal:\nTake, for example, formula_30. This can be reduced to (by the properties of logarithms):\nThe logarithm of 5 is a constant, so its derivative is 0. The derivative of log(x) is formula_32. So,\n\nThe cosine function is the derivative of the sine function, while the derivative of cosine is negative sine (provided that x is measured in radians):\n\nDerivatives can be broken up into smaller parts where they are manageable (as they have only one of the above function characteristics), for example:\n\nA function's derivative can be used to search for the maximums and minimums of the function by searching for places where its slope is zero.\n\nDerivatives are used in Newton's method which helps find zeros (roots) of a function.\n\n\n", "id": "242760", "title": "Derivative (mathematics)"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=242761", "text": "Ruminant\n\nA ruminant is a mammal that eats and digests plant-based food such as grass. Ruminating mammals include cattle, goats, sheep, giraffes, bison, yaks, water buffalo, deer, camels, alpacas, llamas, wildebeest, antelope, pronghorn, and nilgai. The word \"ruminant\" comes from the Latin word \"ruminare\" which means \"to chew over again\".\n\nRumination works by chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semi-digested cud to re-chew it and so get the most food value out of it.\n\nRumination makes the half-digested food particles smaller, before they can go through the process of digestion.\n\nThe primary difference between a ruminant and non-ruminants (such as people, dogs, and pigs) is that ruminants have a four-compartment stomach. \n\nThe four parts of the stomach are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud or bolus. \n\nThe cud is then regurgitated (brought up to the mouth) and chewed slowly. Fiber, especially cellulose, is broken down by microbes (bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi).\n\nEven though the rumen and reticulum have different names, they are the same functional space, as the digesta (food material) can move back and forth between them. \n\nThe digesta then passes into the next chamber, the omasum, where water and many of the mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. \n\nAfter this the digesta is moved to the true stomach, the abomasum. Digestion takes place here. \n\nThe digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. Water is absorbed in the large intestine, leaving the waste.\n\nAlmost all the glucose produced by breaking down the cellulose is used by microbes in the rumen, and so ruminants usually absorb little glucose from the small intestine. Rather, ruminants' requirement for glucose (for brain function and lactation if appropriate) is made by the liver.\n\nThere are 3.5 billion domestic ruminants, with about 95% being cattle, goats and sheep.\n\nThere are also about 75 million wild ruminants. They can be found anywhere except for the continents Australia and Antarctica. Most of them are in Europe, Africa and Asia.\n", "id": "242761", "title": "Ruminant"}

Today, the collection of texts that is called \"The Bible\" is written in one language only. For this reason, at least some texts need to be translated. Versions of the Bible are also different in the texts they include, some texts are not part of some Bible versions. One of the first such translations is the Septuagint, which is Ancient Greek. Another well-known translation is the Vulgate, which is Latin. From about the 14th century, the Bible was also translated into other languages.\n\nTranslating a text is also always linked to looking at its meaning, and to interpreting it. A word in one language cannot be translated into a word in a different language, with exactly the same meaning. \nOne such method of translation is called \"literal translation\" or \"formal equivalence\". Literal translation tries to be as close as possible to what is written in the original language. Often this means translating each word separately. There are a number of problems with literal translations: First, words must be added, to get a valid grammar in the target language. These words are not in the source text. The second problem is that the reader must be familiar with the subject, to understand some of the translation.\n\nAnother way is to look at the thoughts and ideas of the source text and to get these into the target language. This is called \"dynamic equivalence\". A translation that uses dynamic equivalence may use other words and phrases, but tries to keep the meaning intact.\n\nA third way is called \"paraphrasing\". It tries to explain the concepts that are found in the text, and does not even use dynamic equivalence. That way, paraphrasing may leave out sections of text, or add other sections that explain these concepts. A paraphrased text may be very easy to understand, but is not suited for in-depth study.\n\nAnother problem that can occur with translation is that the meaning of some words may not be known. This is often the case with words that only occur once in a text. Such words are known as Hapax legomena. Their meaning must be guessed from the context.\n\nBefore the invention of the printing press, texts had to be copied by hand. This introduced errors. After a certain time there were different versions of the same text. Comparing such versions is known as textual criticism. The translation of two different versions of the same text may result in two different texts.\n\nSome translators also translate the names, others simply write the name as it occurs in the original.\n\n", "id": "242798", "title": "Bible version debate"}

For many years he was professor at the University of California, San Diego. In 1957 he published a famous paper, together with three other physicists, about the origin of elements. Many scientists disagreed with ideas that he had later in his life, because he did not believe in the Big Bang theory.\n\nHe started to study history at the University of Bristol, but soon changed to physics because he could then get financial help from the government (World War II was on, so science was very important to the government). He went to London and got a doctorate from University College London in 1951. He met the astronomer Margaret Peachey. He became very interested in astronomy and he married her in 1948. From then on they always worked together in several places. They worked at Harvard, the University of Chicago and Cambridge University. Then Margaret got work at the California Institute of Technology, while Geoffrey worked at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory. They both got jobs at the University of California, San Diego, in 1962.\n\nIn 1957 he and his wife, together with William Fowler, the American physicist, and Fred Hoyle, the British astronomer, wrote a 104-page paper about stellar nucleosynthesis. The paper became known as the B2FH (because of their initials). It talked about nuclear reactions inside stars, showing how these reactions tear apart blocks of matter and put it together again differently. It was a similar idea to what Charles Darwin had written about 100 years earlier in the “Origin of Species”, where he had described how creatures had evolved. Scientists saw this paper as the most important paper ever written about astrophysics. \n\nLater in his career Burbidge refused to accept the Big Bang theory which describes the start of the universe. Quasars are very bright objects with a very high redshift. The Big Bank theorists say that they come from places extremely far away in the universe. But Burbidge thought that quasars come from nearby galaxies, travelling near the speed of light, which explains their redshift. He thought they produced new matter as old matter was destroyed by reactions.\n\nAlthough many scientists disagree with Burbidge’s later ideas, he is still thought of as an extremely important scientist. He was given many honours. In 2005 he and his wife were awarded the British Royal Astronomical Society Gold Medal.\n\n", "id": "242859", "title": "Geoffrey Burbidge"}

It is typically used in the treatment of cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy may help cure several different types of cancer if they are limited to one area of the body. Doctors also use it to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy works together with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in cancers known to be affected by radiation.\n\nRadiation therapy is used on tumors because of its ability to control cell growth. Ionizing radiation works by damaging the DNA of exposed tissue thus killing it. To spare normal tissues (such as skin or organs which radiation must pass through in order to treat the tumor), doctors aim weaker radiation beams from several angles of exposure to intersect at the tumor, providing a much larger absorbed dose there than in the surrounding, healthy tissue. Besides the tumor itself, the target for the radiation may also include the lymph nodes that drain the area. Doctors include the lymph nodes if they are clinically or radiologically involved with tumor, or if there is thought to be a risk of that individual cancer cells will spread. It is impossible to aim the radiation beam exactly because the tumor moves as the patient breathes. So, doctors also expect to include some healthy tissue around the tumor to make sure that the entire tumor is hit by radiation.\n\nRadiation oncology is the medical specialty concerned with prescribing radiation. This is different than radiology, the use of radiation in medical imaging and diagnosis). Radiation may be prescribed by a radiation oncologist with intent to cure (\"curative\"). It may also be used as palliative treatment (where cure is not possible and the aim is for local disease control or symptomatic relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy has survival benefit and it can be curative). It is also common to combine radiation therapy with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, Immunotherapy or some mixture of the four. \n\nMost common cancer types can be treated with radiation therapy in some way. The precise treatment intent will depend on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure of healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs.\n\nRadiation therapy can also be used in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. Doctors limit the use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions because they worry about the radiation could start new cancers. \n", "id": "242868", "title": "Radiation therapy"}

There are many definitions of waste, and so there are also different definitions of food waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines food waste for the United States as \"Uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and [shops] such as grocery stores, restaurants, and produce stands, institutional cafeterias and kitchens, and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms\".\n\nThe definitions of food waste can vary in the following ways:\nThe definitions are made more complex, because certain kinds of waste are defined in reference to other kinds of waste. Certain groups have not considered food waste to be waste, because it still has applications.\n\nLarge amounts of food waste can occur at any stage in the process of producing food. In subsistence agriculture, the amounts of food waste are unknown. Very likely, very little food is wasted, because food is produced because of a need for food. In the developed world, the food industry produces food for a global marketplace demand.\nResearch has been done to see where food waste occurred. The researchers looked at the food industry of the United States and found that food was wasted at the beginning of the food production. From planting, crops can be subjected to pest infestations and bad weather, which cause losses before harvest. Natural forces such as temperature and rainfall are the main influences on the growth of crops. For this reason, all forms of outdoor agriculture is subject to losses beecause of these influences. The use of machinery in harvesting can cause waste, as harvesters may be unable to discern between ripe and immature crops, or collect only part of a crop. Food is also wasted because it does not meet certain standards or regulations for quality and appearance As a result, certain crops that do not meet these standards are not harvested; left in the field, they can provide fertilizer, or food for animals.\n\nIt is unknown how much food waste occurs during food processing. When food is stored, considerable amounts are wasted because of pests and microorganisms. This problem occurs in countries where it is both relatively hot, and humid. These conditions boost the growth of pests and microrganisms. Extreme temperature, humidity, or microoganisms also influence the nutritional value, caloric value and edibility of crops and account for food waste. The \"qualitative losses\" are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones. More losses occur because the food is not handled correctly, or because it loses weight or volume.\n\nIt is difficult to reduce some of the food waste produced by processing without affecting the quality of the product. Certain regulations concerning the safety of foods cause food to be wasted, before it even reaches the market.\nSafety regulations are in place to protect the health of the consumer. They are very important, especially where foodstuffs of animal origin are processed. Contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards.\n\nPreventing health issues is more important than preventing food waste, or the reuse of foods that do not meet the standards.,\n", "id": "242910", "title": "Food waste"}

They are the simplest in structure of all metazoa. \n\nThe Placozoa is usually considered to have only one species, Trichoplax adhaerens, but there is enough genetic diversity that it is possible that there are multiple, morphologically similar species. \n\nAlthough they were first discovered in 1883, a common name does not exist for the taxon. The scientific name literally means \"flat animals\".\n\n\"Trichoplax\" is a small, flattened, animal around a millimetre across. Like an Amoeba, it has no regular outline, although the upper surface is always flattened. The body consists of an outer layer of simple epithelium enclosing a loose sheet of cells. The epithelial cells bear flagella, which the animal uses to help it creep along the seafloor. Between these layers is the fiber syncytium, a liquid-filled cavity strutted open by star-like fibers.\n\n\"Trichoplax\" feed by absorbing food particles—mainly microbes—with their underside. They generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Though \"Trichoplax\" has a small genome in comparison to other animals, nearly 87% of its 11,514 protein-coding genes are similar to known genes in other animals.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s renewed interest among researchers led to the discovery that the animals people had been studying are adults, not larvae. This newfound interest also included study of the organism in nature (as opposed to aquariums).\n", "id": "243188", "title": "Placozoa"}

The introvert is retractable into the trunk. \n\nSipunculans have a coelom (body cavity), and a body wall somewhat similar to that of annelids. The body wall is strong and muscular. When threatened, Sipunculids can retract their body into a shape resembling a peanut kernel – a practice that has given rise to the name \"peanut worm\".\n\nThe most recognizable part of Sipunculan worms is their mouth, which is surrounded by a mass of 18–24 ciliated tentacles, all of which may be inverted into the body. The tentacles are used to gather organic detritus from the water or substrate, and are probably also function as gills.

It requires a medium, such as writing or print on paper, or a computer monitor. It is both a mode of visual communication and also a way to set out data. \n\nA table consists of an orderly arrangement of rows and columns. The columns and rows usually have names or labels. Tables may include notes, headers, footers or other features. Like other graphic forms such as diagrams and illustrations, tables are often used together with prose. In books and articles, tables are often given numbers and captions. \n\nTables were the first way to print social and scientific data, before any other kind of graphics like graphs and charts. All the information about a modern society was recorded and published first as tables. Marriage certificates were written tables. Census results were recorded as tables, and later analysed in printed tables. All weather observations were published as printed numerical tables. Many kinds of reports to Parliament contained tables of data. Many of these methods were invented in Britain, because the government collected statistics about the population, and then published the results.\n\nThe use of tables is widespread in all types of communication, research and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs and many other places. The details vary according to circumstances. Tables are extremely flexible, and can easily be constructed on computer and in print.\nTables are not always easy to understand, and there is a whole industry which takes table information and turns it into other forms, such as graphs and charts, for the benefit of the reader.\n\n", "id": "243271", "title": "Table (information)"}

Every region in Japan has its own tradition about cooking. Foods eaten in Japan also reflect the history of the cultural exchange between Japan and other culture. Since the modern times, the influence of the West inspired Japanese culinary tradition to invent new dishes, some of which have become popular not only inside Japan but also outside. However, most of the culinary traditions of Japan commonly think that seasonality is important. \n\nSoya beans are a very important ingredient in Japanese cooking; it is used in soya sauce, miso and tofu. Soya milk is also used as a drink. One example of a dish with soya beans in it, is tofu. Tofu is made from pressing soybeans into cubes and then boiling them. Tofu is often in soups and stews. Deep fried tofu is also used in many popular Japanese dishes, for example as kitsune udon and inari sushi.\nSoya beans also have omega 3 fatty acids, that can also be found in salmon.\n\nNoodles (like in most Asian foods) are used often in Japanese foods. The dishes usually come originally from China; nevertheless they have reached a unique development in Japan.\n\nJapan is surrounded by the ocean so there is a rich variety of seafood which is an important part of Japanese cooking.\nJapanese people did not eat meat until the Europeans first came. Fish was the most common food. \n\nWasabi is Japanese horseradish. It is often a green paste used with sashimi and sushi. Wasabi is also used with many other Japanese foods. \nWasabi is sold as a paste or in powder form. Wasabi powder has to be mixed with water to be turned into a paste. Wasabi has a strong, very spicy (hot) taste.\nSashimi is very thinly cut raw seafood. Many different kinds of fresh fish and other seafood are served raw in Japanese dishes. Sashimi is one of them. It is almost the same as sushi, but it has no vinegar rice. When the slices of fish are put on small pieces of rice they are called \"Nigiri Sushi\".\nSashimi is artistically arranged and put on the plate on top of shredded daikon and shiso leaves. The fish pieces are dipped into soya sauce before being eaten.\nSeaweed has been a very important part of Japanese dishes for a long time. Today, many different types of seaweed are used in soups, seasonings and other forms of Japanese cooking. These are the three seaweeds used the most:\n\n", "id": "243421", "title": "Japanese cuisine"}

In 1944 it was part of the biggest sea invasion in history. During World War II, Allied military commanders were planning how to attack France, which had been captured by the Nazis. While planning, the Allied commanders noticed the massive coastal guns at Pointe du Hoc. There were six 155mm cannons in heavily armoured bunkers that could be very dangerous to Allied ships. \n\nAllied planes, flying from English airstrips, bombed Pointe du Hoc. However, the heavy artillery guns at Pointe du Hoc were moved and there was no damage inflicted to them. \n\nPointe du Hoc was surrounded by steep cliffs that dropped down into the sea. A very narrow beach would appear at the bottom of the cliffs, but only at a certain part of the day. For about five months, the U.S. Rangers had been training with British commandos to prepare for their attack on France. They had been climbing British coastal cliffs for training. \n\nOnce the Allied commanders decided to attack France, they used flat-bottomed landing boats made to carry troops onto the beach at the French coastal cliffs. These special landing boats were called LCA and LCVP's or Higgins boats, and were driven British navy sailors. The boats were lowered into the sea a few kilometers away from the cliffs. The British had added some extra armour to the sides of the landing crafts to protect them. This meant that the boats were better protected, but not as fast or easily moved in different directions.\nThe nearly 100m high cliff at Pointe du Hoc was attacked by the American 2nd and 5th Army Ranger Divisions. Colonel James Earl Rudder led the attack. The attack started at 06.30am, when the battleship USS Texas stopped bombarding Pointe du Hoc. Due to bad weather, the Rangers drifted off course and spent an extra half hour reaching the beach. By then, the Germans had come out of their bunkers and set up defensive positions along the ridge of the cliff. \n\nOnce the landing boats reached the beach, their doors were opened and the Army Rangers ran up the beach to the cliffs. The soldiers used ropes attached to rocket-propelled grappling hooks to climb the cliffs. Two soldiers carried the ropes and grappling hooks in a wooden box. The soldiers also used ladders that were attached to landing boats and grappling hooks that were shot up from the boats.\n\nWhen the Rangers reached the top of the cliffs, small groups of soldiers attacked the German positions. After reaching the German bunkers, where the Germans' guns were, the Rangers found that the guns were no longer there. Than the rangers were forced inland in witch they searched for the guns once they found the guns they used thermite fire grenades to melt important parts of the guns. \n\nOut of 225 soliders onley 90 were able to fight when reinforcements came. \n", "id": "243422", "title": "Pointe du Hoc"}

Smith was a leader of the first settlements at the Virginia Colony in 1608-1609. He explored the rivers of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay and drew a map of the Chesapeake Bay area and New England.\n\nSmith's books and maps were very important in supporting Englishmen living in the New World. He wrote, \"Here every man may be master and owner of his own labour and land and if he has nothing but his hands, he may still grow rich.\"\n\nAt Jamestown Smith trained the people to farm and work so they would have food to eat. He told them \"he who shall not work, shall not eat.\" Smith's strength of character and his determination overcame many problems including the harsh weather, lack of water, living in a wilderness, with people who did not want to work, and attacks from the Powhatan Indian tribes.\n\nSmith was born in January 1580 at Willoughby, Lincolnshire where his parents rented a farm. He claimed descent from the ancient Smith family of Cuerdley.\n\nSmith left home at the age of 16 and went to sea. He served as a soldier in the army of Henry IV of France against the Spaniards, fought for Dutch revolt from the Spanish King Philip II of Spain. He went to the Mediterranean Sea where he worked in both trade and piracy. He then fought against the Ottoman Empire in the Ottoman wars and for the Austrian Habsburgs in Kingdom of Hungary in 1600 and 1601.\n\nSmith is reputed to have defeated, killed and beheaded Turkish commanders in 3 duels. He was knighted by the Transylvanian Prince and was given a horse and Coat of arms showing 3 Turks' heads. In 1602 he was wounded in a skirmish, captured and sold as a slave. Smith wrote that his Turkish master sent him as a gift to his Greek mistress in Constantinople, who fell in love with Smith. He then escaped from the Ottoman lands and returned to England in 1604.\n\nIn 1606 the Smith was hired by the Virginia Company to settle in Virginia Colony for profit. They set sail in three ships, in December 1606. Smith had a servant named Samuel Collier.\n\nThere were problems on the voyage and Smith was charged with mutiny. Captain Newport planned to execute him. The Captain opened a letter of orders from the Virginia Company which stated that Smith was to be one of the leaders of the new colony, so Smith was not killed.\n\nThe English arrived in April 1607 and Captain Wingfield chose Jamestown to be the location for the colony. In summer the settlers were still living in temporary housing. After the four-month ocean trip, food supplies were only enough for each person to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day. Due to the weather and lack of food disease spread through the people and by September, more than half died.\n\nIn December 1607, Smith was looking for food and was captured by Native Americans. He was taken to meet the Chief of the Powhatan tribe. The village was about 15 miles from Jamestown. Smith was released without harm and gave credit in part to the chief's daughter, Pocahontas, who threw herself across his body. Seeing this, her father took mercy on Smith and he was safely taken back to Jamestown. This encounter began a friendly relationship between the natives, Smith and the colonists at Jamestown.\nIn early January 1608, nearly 100 new settlers arrived with Captain Newport, and through carelessness the village was set on fire. That winter the James River froze over, and the settlers were forced to live in the ruins. During this time, Newport and his crew wasted much time loading their ships with iron pyrite (fool's gold). Food supplies ran low and although the Native Americans brought some food, Smith wrote that “more than half of us died.” \nIn April 1608 a ship brought supplies and 50 new settlers, whom Smith set to build housing and to plant crops.\n\nIn the summer of 1608, Smith left Jamestown to explore the Chesapeake Bay region and search for badly needed food. He made a map that would be of great value to Virginia explorers for over a century. In his absence, Smith left his friend Matthew Scrivener, as governor in his place. Scrivener would later drown in a storm in an ill-fated voyage to Hog Island. Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608 and instituted strict rules.\nIn October 1608, a ship arrived with 70 new settlers, including the first women. Some German and Polish craftsmen also arrived, but they brought no food supplies. After that, Smith tried to get food from the Native Americans and it took threats of military force for them to obey. Powhatan was frightened by the great number of white men coming into the area and was trying to starve them.\n\nSmith found that there were those among both the settlers and Native Americans who did not like his rules and were planning to kill him. Smith wrote that he was warned by Pocahontas. He called a meeting and told the men who did not work that “he that will not work shall not eat…” After that the situation improved.\nFor three months in early 1609, February, March and April all was well at Jamestown with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared and much other work done. Then in April, rats and dampness destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or they would have to leave the safety of the fort. Some left and went to the Native American villages, but Powhatan’s people also went by Smith’s law that he who works not, eats not. This was in effect until they were near starved and they returned home.\n\nAt some point an unexpected ship arrived, captained by Samuel Argall. He had food and wine which Smith bought with a promise to pay back. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company was sending more supplies and settlers to Jamestown along with a new governor, Lord De la Warr.\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Sir Thomas Smith, Virginia Company treasurer, arranged for about 500 colonists, including women and children to come along. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbor. The \"Sea Venture\" was shipwrecked on the Bermuda islands with the admiral and Stephen Hopkins on board. One year later, in May 1610, they had arrived at Jamestown in small boats they had made. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor, Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.\n\nIn August 1609 John Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive. London was sending new settlers with no planning as to how or where they would live.\n\nCapt. John Smith was severely injured by an accidental gunpowder explosion in his canoe. Smith sailed to England for treatment in October 1609. He had spent two and a half years trying to do his best for Jamestown. He never returned to Virginia. History has confirmed his great contribution at Jamestown in its earliest years.\n\nColonists would continue to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 of the 500 surviving that winter. In spite of this, the Virginia Company continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown. For the next five years, Governors Gates and Sir Thomas Dale continued to keep strict discipline, with Sir Thomas Smith in London attempting to find skilled craftsmen and other settlers to send to Jamestown.\n\nIn 1614, Smith returned to the northeast coast of America and named the region \"New England\". In that same year a storm destroyed his ship. In 1615, Smith was captured by French pirates off the coast of the Azore Islands. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he wrote an account of his two voyages as \"A Description of New England\". He never left England again. He died in the year 1631 in London at the age of 51. He is buried in the church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate in the City of London.\n\nThe Captain John Smith Monument currently lies off the coast of New Hampshire on Star Island, part of the Isles of Shoals. Built in 1864 to honor the 250th anniversary of John Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles.\n\nIn 1914, the New Hampshire Society of Colonial Wars partially restored and rededicated the monument for the 300th anniversary celebration of his historic visit. The monument had weathered so badly in the harsh coastal winters that the words carved in the granite had worn away.\n\n\n", "id": "243487", "title": "John Smith (explorer)"}

Mature individuals are goblet-shaped, on relatively long stalks. They are filter-feeders, with a crown of tentacles whose cilia generate water currents towards the mouth. Both the mouth and anus lie inside the crown. The superficially similar Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) have the anus outside a 'crown' of hollow tentacles. Most families of entoprocts are colonial, and all but 2 of the 150 species are marine. A few solitary species can move slowly.\n\nSome species eject unfertilized ova into the water while others keep their ova in brood chambers until they hatch, and some of these species use placenta-like organs to nourish the developing eggs. After hatching, the larvae swim for a short time and then settle on a surface. There they metamorphose, and the larval gut generally rotates by up to 180°, so that the mouth and anus face upwards. Both colonial and solitary species also reproduce by cloning.\n\nSome species of nudibranchs (sea slugs) and flatworms prey on entoprocts. A few entoproct species have been found living in close association with other animals. \n\nFossils of entoprocts are very rare and the earliest specimens that have been identified with confidence date from the Upper Jurassic. Most studies from 1996 onwards have regarded entoprocts as members of the Trochozoa, which also includes molluscs and annelids. However, a study in 2008 concluded that entoprocts are closely related to bryozoans.\n\n'Entoprocta' means 'anus inside'. The alternative name 'Kamptozoa', means 'bent' or 'curved' animals. Some authors use \"Entoprocta\", while others prefer \"Kamptozoa\".\n", "id": "243492", "title": "Entoprocta"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243545", "text": "Oakwell\n\nOakwell is a sports development in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. It is used mostly by Barnsley Football Club for playing their home games, It is also used by their reserve team.\n\nWhile the name \"Oakwell\" is usually used for the main stadium, it also includes several neighbouring venues which form the facilities of the Barnsley F.C. academy. This includes an indoor training pitch, a smaller stadium with seating on the south and west sides for around 2,200 spectators, and several training pitches used by the different Barnsley FC squads.\n\nUntil 2003 the stadium and the large amount of land that is around it was owned by Barnsley Football Club. However, after falling into administration in 2002 the council purchased the main Oakwell Stadium. This allowed the club to pay its creditors and remain participants in The Football League.\n\nThe West Stand is the only original part of Oakwell Stadium left standing, however it was made 'all-seater' in 1995.\n\nThe stand is made up of two tiers, only the upper tier is covered but at the expense of several supporting columns for the roof structure, the seats are the originals from the early 1900s, from here you get a decent view with moderate legroom. In spite of the restricted views and modest facilities, the West Stand remains a popular vantage point for many fans. The lower tier of the West Stand is uncovered and offers a great view of the action.\n\nThe roof of the West Stand is corrugated iron this also houses the main television gantry which is accessed from the upper level seating area by a temporary ladder.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, the then-stadium owners Barnsley Football Club were considering re-developing the West Stand after several seasons of high attendances. However, with the rapid decline in fortunes of the football club, and sale of the stadium and new club ownership these plans are unlikely to happen in the near future.\n\nThe stand also has a traditional players tunnel in the centre. This is used for access to some of the facilities underneath the stand. The main players tunnel now comes out from the north-west corner following the moving of the changing rooms to the North Stand.\n\nThe West Stand has a total seating capacity of 4,752.\n\nThe East Stand is a two level development completed in 1993. Funded in part by the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects,as was the North Stand and the Corner Stand. With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to add 'executive boxes' into their stadium. The East stand is very modern, and has plenty of legroom.\n\nDue to the sloped land on which Oakwell Stadium is built, the rear of the East Stand is much taller than it is from the pitchside. This means a climb to the upper level seating area requires many more steps than a spectator may anticipate. However several lifts are available.\n\nBuilt in 1995, CK Beckett is the current name for what is traditionally known as the 'Pontefract Road End' or 'Ponty End'. Some fans continue to call it the 'ORA Stand' - in reference to the original sponsors of it. Also, known as the Van Damme Stand.\n\nWith a capacity of 4,508, The CK Beckett Stand is a large covered single tier seating area behind the goal on the south side of the stadium.\n\nThis part of the stadium also houses the players gym, the club superstore, box office, and general administration offices.\n\nIt is understood that this stand had been designed specifically with future development in mind, therefore should the club ever have the need to increase the grounds capacity then it would be fundamentally possible to add a second tier without making any major alterations to the existing structure.\n\nThe North Stand is the most recent addition to Oakwell Stadium and is a large covered singled tiered seating area with a capacity for 6,000 spectators.\n\nAs this stand is generally reserved for away supporters its capacity is rarely utilized, although during the 2006/07 season, Sheffield Wednesday, Derby, Birmingham and Sunderland fans all filled the end, Sunderland also took up half of the West Stand. In the 2009/10 season, Newcastle United filled the stand.\n\nAt a cost of £4.5 million (including several academy facilities that it accommodates), it has been a cause for debate ever since its construction. However at the time it was built, Barnsley FC had only just been demoted from the FA Premier League and were planning for a possible return.\n\nThe Corner Stand was built in the summer of 1998. It was originally known as 'The Welcome Windows Stand'. It is an unusual three level structure. It provides further executive areas and disabled facilities for viewing an event.\n\nAccess to this area was also added into the neighbouring East Stand on several levels. The spectator capacity of the structure is 202.\n\nIn recent years Oakwell Stadium has rarely been used by anyone other than Barnsley FC. The occasional celebrity charity football match has been played there.\n\nWakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby League Club used the stadium for their first game in the Super League (Europe) in 1998.\n\nNon-league football club Wakefield and Emley used the stadium for an FA Cup tie against Rotherham in 1998, choosing a larger neutral venue as opposed to the traditional option of 'switching' the tie to the home of the team which was drawn away.\n\nPremier League side Manchester City used the stadium for their first qualifying round UEFA Cup game in July 2008. This was because the pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium was not ready for football games after the summer's boxing and music concerts.\n\nIn March 2008, club secretary Don Rowing revealed that the West Stand would be demolished and rebuilt. Given that the average gate at Barnsley accounts for less than 50% of capacity this appeared to be a strange announcement, however there are a number of structural concerns with the roof and the wooden floor of the upper tier and it would seem that a new structure is more financially viable than maintaining the existing one.\n\nNo firm timescales or details of the structure have yet been released. Plans for a replacement stand were submitted to the local council several years ago, in this particular case the stand was to have around 9,000 seats - it remains to be seen whether such a large stand would be built. Given the current attendance figures then a new stand with around the same capacity as the existing West Stand would be more than viable.\n\nOn 27 December 1920, Horace Fairhurst, a young full-back for the visiting Blackpool, received a blow to the head during a league game.

Much of the council and local civil service is located at Manchester Town Hall and the Town Hall Extension, in the city's commercial centre.\n\nManchester was incorporated in 1838 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 as the Corporation of Manchester or Manchester Corporation. It gained city status in 1853. It was only the second such grant since the Reformation. Under the Local Government Act 1972 the council was reconstituted as a metropolitan borough council in 1974. The area included in the city has been increased many times.

It is woven on a special loom that weaves two pieces of velvet at the same time. The two pieces are then cut apart and the two lengths of fabric are wound on separate take-up rolls. Velvet is difficult to clean due to its pile, but modern dry cleaning methods perform well.\n\nVelvet is made, ideally, from silk. More recently, synthetic velvets have been developed, mostly polyester, nylon, viscose, acetate, and mixtures of different synthetics, or synthetics and natural fibers (e.g. viscose and silk). A small percentage of lycra is used sometimes to give stretch.\n\nThe art of velvet-weaving probably originated in medieval Kashmir around the beginning of the fourteenth century. King Richard II of England directed in his will that his body should be clothed \"in velveto\" in 1399.\n\nThe earliest sources of European artistic velvets were weavers in Lucca, Genoa, Florence and Venice.\n", "id": "243675", "title": "Velvet"}

Most of the 1,400 or so species are marine, with a few living in fresh water and a small number of terrestrial forms. They live in all marine habitats, and throughout the world's oceans. Alternative spellings for the phylum have included \"Nemertini\" and \"Nemertinea\". \"Rhynchocoela\" is a name used primarily in North America but gradually abandoned since the 1980s.\n\nNemertean worms are long, thin, animals without segments. They have no true head, although the anterior end is often slightly wider than the body. They are distinguished by the presence of an eversible proboscis. This is kept inside the body, but pushed out to catch prey. \n\nNemerteans collect food with their proboscis, which is closely associated with the digestive system. At rest, the proboscis is inside a long tube that may take up a considerable portion of the worm's length, lying just above the gut. It is attached to the posterior end of this tube by a muscle that pulls it back inside after feeding. At the anterior end, the tube opens into a small cavity close to the brain, and then to the outside through a pore at the anterior tip of the animal.\n\nNemerteans range in size from 5mm (0.2 in) to over 30 m (100 ft) long in the case of the European \"Lineus longissimus\", with most species being 20 cm (8 in) or less. There are reports of specimens up to 50 or 60m long, which would make it the longest animal in the world. The longest animal on record is a female blue whale, 29.9m long.\n", "id": "243687", "title": "Nemertea"}

There are different ways to improve reading speed, but they are all similar. A trained reader is able to read and understand between 200 and 300 words per minute, for a text that is not very difficult to understand. Better training can improve this speed to over 1000 words per minute. Using a lot of exercise, it is possible to increase reading speed further. The best readers can read between 3000 and 4000 words per minute, and understand about 80% of them. \n\nIn general, only a small part of the letters read are seen clearly. The brain guesses what the rest of the word is, based on a small part of the word. This also applies to groups of words, which are treated the same way. Known groups are handled faster, because the reader knows them, and also has an \"image\" for them. \n\nWhat is very important when reading text is the ability to recognize words and word groups. The reader will then add the known image to the context. A known font can help this. \n\nWhat is bad for speed reading is having a bad short term memory. Another factor is a small vocabulary. People who only know few words, need more time to \"scan\" unknown words, simply because fewer words in the text are known.\n", "id": "243764", "title": "Speed reading"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243771", "text": "Maine Road\n\nMaine Road was a large football stadium in Moss Side, Manchester, England. It was home to Manchester City F.C. from when it was built in 1923 until 2003. It takes its name from the street it was built on which also had a remarkable history. The street was first known as Dog Kennel Lane. It formed part of an ancient route south of Manchester.\n\nWhen first opened, the stadium was the largest club ground in England and the second largest in the country after Wembley Stadium. Maine Road's record attendance was set in 1934, when 84,569 people attended an FA Cup tie between Manchester City and Stoke City. It is the record for an English club ground (the 1923 FA Cup Final holds the world record). The following February the stadium recorded the highest Football League attendance. This stood at 79,491 for a game against Arsenal. The record has since been beaten for the League, but it is still Manchester City's largest League crowd. The design of the ground changed several times over its 80-year history. Before it closed, Maine Road was an all-seater stadium, with a capacity of 35,150.\n\nThe 2002-03 season was Manchester City's last at Maine Road. The last match was played on 11 May 2003. The following season Manchester City moved to City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester. Maine Road was torn down in 2004.\n\nPlans to build Maine Road were first announced in May 1922. It came after a decision by Manchester City F.C. to leave their Hyde Road ground. Hyde Road did not have room for expansion and had been damaged by fire in 1920. Two sites in Belle Vue, East Manchester were suggested, but neither was considered good enough. To many City fans east Manchester was thought of as City's home. Many were disappointed when a site in south Manchester was chosen. A City director, John Ayrton, resigned from the Board later in the decade and helped to form an alternative MCFC, Manchester Central F.C., playing at Belle Vue.\n\nA sixteen and a quarter acre former brickworking on Maine Road was purchased for £5,500. Maine Road had first been known as Dog Kennel Lane. It was renamed Maine Road during the 1870s because of pressure from the Temperance Movement.\n\nStadium construction began late in 1922. Plans by architect Charles Swain proposed a 120,000 capacity ground based on the design of Hampden Park. These plans were reduced to give a capacity of 80,000. However, this figure was still the second largest in the country, behind Wembley Stadium, leading to a label of \"The Wembley of the North\". Wembley had opened in London only a few months earlier. This made a source of rivalry between the northern and southern divisions of builders Sir Robert McAlpine, who built both stadia. During construction, the stadium was supposedly cursed by a gypsy when Manchester City officials evicted a gypsy camp from the area. This curse was allegedly removed on 28 December 1998. However, the gypsy curse is likely to be an urban myth, as such stories are endemic to a number of football league grounds. Construction took 300 days. The total cost £100,000. The first layout of the ground was one covered stand with a seating capacity of 10,000. It had uncovered terracing on the other three sides, with gentle curves connecting the corners.\n\nThe first match at Maine Road took place on 25 August 1923, and saw 58,159 fans watch the home side beat Sheffield United 2-1.\n\nThe first changes to the ground took place in 1931, when the corner between the Main Stand and the Platt Lane end at the south of the ground was rebuilt to incorporate a roof. The highest attendance at an English football game of any type at a club ground was at Maine Road on the March 3, 1934, when Manchester City played Stoke City in front of 84,569 fans in the 6th round of the FA Cup. Changes at the Platt Lane end took place in 1935, extending the terracing and providing a roof for the full stand. This marked the peak capacity of the ground, estimated at around 88,000. Further changes were planned, but were suspended when Manchester City were relegated from Division One in 1938, and abandoned when World War II broke out.\n\nThe stadium was shared by Manchester United for a period after the Second World War, since Manchester United's Old Trafford ground had been partially destroyed during the Manchester Blitz. United paid City £5,000 per season, plus a share of gate receipts. The highest attendance for a League game at Maine Road occurred during this period, when 83,260 people watched Manchester United play Arsenal on January 17, 1948. This figure is a national record for a League game.\n\nFloodlights were installed in 1953, and in 1957, prompted by the hosting of two FA Cup semi-finals in successive years, the side facing the Main Stand (which until that time was generally known as the \"Popular Side\") was redeveloped and named \"The Kippax Stand\" after a nearby street. Over the course of the 1960s and 1970s, the Kippax became the part of the ground where the club's most vociferous fans congregated. In 1963, benches were installed at the Platt Lane end, meaning that Maine Road had more seats than any other English club ground of the time. The next major redevelopment came in the 1970s, with the construction of the North Stand, a cantilevered stand which remained in place until the closure of Maine Road. The 1980s saw ambitious plans for improvements: however, these plans were shelved due to financial pressures after the Main Stand roof had been replaced at a cost of £1 million. \nBy 1990, some areas of the ground looked antiquated, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992. Its place was taken by the all-seater \"Umbro Stand\" that also incorporated executive boxes, and was opened in March 1993. The stand was renamed back to the \"Platt Lane Stand\" in the late 1990s.\n\nThe era of standing accommodation at Maine Road came to an end in May 1994 as the stadium became all-seater to comply with the requirements of the Taylor Report with the demolition of the \"Kippax Street Terrace\". The final match where standing was permitted took place on 30 April 1994, Chelsea the visitors for a 2–2 draw. Immediately prior to demolition the capacity of the Kippax terrace was 18,300. A three-tier stand was built in its place, holding nearly 14,000 spectators, and on its completion in October 1995 it was the tallest stand in the country.\n\nThe new stand was an impressive modern facility, but it also emphasised the haphazard nature in which the ground had been redeveloped, as all four sides were of differing heights and construction styles. There were further plans for expansion which would have taken the stadium's capacity to 45,000, but these were put on hold following City's relegation from the Premier League in 1996.\n\nThere were plans for further expansion at Maine Road to take the capacity to 45,000 all-seated, but these were abandoned in favour of a move to the City of Manchester Stadium that was being constructed for the Commonwealth Games in 2002.\n\nThe final competitive match before the closure of the stadium took place on 11 May 2003. Manchester City ended the Maine Road era with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton, with Michael Svensson scoring the stadium's last goal. The final match was followed by short performances by musical acts Badly Drawn Boy and Doves.\n\nCity's final goal at the stadium was scored on 26 April 2003 by Marc-Vivien Foe, who died on 26 June that year from an undetected heart condition while representing the Cameroon national football team.\nToward the end of Maine Road's lifespan there were proposals for other sports teams to make use of the stadium following City's relocation; Stockport County once expressed interest in moving there from Edgeley Park, and in December 2000 Sale Sharks rugby union club was offered a lease for the stadium. However, none of the proposals came to fruition.\n\nAn auction of the ground's fixtures and fittings took place in July 2003, raising £100,000, which was donated to community projects in the Moss Side area, which was undergoing a lengthy regeneration process. Demolition began in late 2003, taking seven months. Two years later the go-ahead was given for a new housing development to take part on the site, consisting of 474 homes.\n\nFor long periods of its history Maine Road had the widest pitch in England. However, the width was changed several times by managers wishing to alter the pitch size to suit their style of play. In the final season before the ground was closed, the pitch size was 107 x 71 metres (116.5 x 78 yards).\n\nMaine Road hosted two England internationals, the first was a 3-0 defeat of Wales on November 13, 1946 and the second a 9-2 win over Northern Ireland on November 16, 1949, England's first ever World Cup qualifier. In addition, A number of wartime internationals were held at the ground. Maine Road was also the venue for a number of rugby league matches, hosting the rugby league championship final eleven times between 1938 and 1956.\n\nThe stadium was used for several scenes in the 1948 motion picture \"Cup-tie Honeymoon\". More recently, it was featured in the 2000 film \"There's Only One Jimmy Grimble\" and the 2003 ITV drama \"The Second Coming\", which starred Christopher Eccleston.\n\nMaine Road has also played host to a number of rock concerts, including The Rolling Stones, Simple Minds, Queen, Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd, Bryan Adams, Jean Michel Jarre, Dire Straits, David Bowie & Guns N' Roses.\n\nIn 1974, teen idol David Cassidy played the stadium.\n\nThe most high profile concert held at Maine Road was that of Mancunian band Oasis (themselves avowed Manchester City fans) in April 1996, a performance which was later released as a video, \"Oasis:...There and Then\".\n\nPrince also played the stadium twice in the early 1990s.\n\nMaine Road also gives its name to a non-league football club, Maine Road F.C.. The club, who currently play in the North West Counties Football League Division One, was founded by a group of Manchester City supporters in 1955. The club previously based its headquarters at the social club adjoining Maine Road.\n\n\n", "id": "243771", "title": "Maine Road"}

It is UEFA's second tier club football tournament. The match was played at the City of Manchester Stadium. It is the home stadium of Manchester City F.C., in Manchester, England, at 20:45 CEST (19:45 local time) on 14 May 2008.\n\nThe match was played by Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia and Rangers of Scotland. It was called a battle of Rangers coaching staff, with ex-boss Dick Advocaat, currently the manager of Zenit against current boss Walter Smith. Smith has had two times as manager of Rangers. Both coaches led the Rangers to the Scottish domestic treble; Smith in 1993 and Advocaat in 1999.\n\nZenit won the match 2–0. They had goals from Igor Denisov and Konstantin Zyryanov. It was their first UEFA Cup title. It made them only the second Russian side to win the competition, after CSKA Moscow in 2004–05.\n\nThe logo of the final shows a picture of the City of Manchester Stadium, created by English artist Liam Spencer. It was first shown at a ceremony in the stadium on December 6.\n\nZenit and Michel Platini asked the British government to ease visa procedures for Russian fans, despite Russia having cancelled visas for British fans travelling to 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow. However, the Director for British Visa Services for the CIS, Mandy Ivemy, said that \"for the U.K. government, visas and biometric checks are a vital part of immigration policy, and we are not prepared to waive them\".\n\nMeanwhile, there was a mass flow of Rangers fans into Manchester. Over a hundred thousand supporters 'invaded' the city despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans to stay at home. The influx of people resulted in there being no vacant hotel rooms in a twenty-mile radius of the city and the total amount of money that was ploughed into the local economy was estimated to be around £25 million.\n\nRangers' home ground, Ibrox, was opened to show a live beamback of the match to approximately 30,000 spectators. Fans queued overnight for a seat in the stadium. The capacity was reached more than two hours before kick-off.\n\nZenit St. Petersburg were without the competition's top scorer, Pavel Pogrebnyak, who had picked up two bookings in the knockout stages of the tournament and was therefore suspended. However, they were able to call upon their other star names such as attacking midfielders Andrei Arshavin and Konstantin Zyryanov, as well as holding midfielder Anatoliy Tymoschuk.\n\nRangers manager Walter Smith started with Jean-Claude Darcheville on his own up-front, with a five-man midfield supporting him comprising Steven Davis, Kevin Thomson, Steven Whittaker, Barry Ferguson and Brahim Hemdani. Neil Alexander was making only his tenth start in goal for Rangers, first choice keeper Allan McGregor was injured.\n\n\nThe event was marred by fans rioting in Manchester city centre; these riots started after a big screen that was due to show the match had failed. BBC News 24 interrupted normal programming to broadcast the riots live on television. ITN's flagship News at Ten programme gave a lot of coverage to the riots.\n\nA Zenit fan was also attacked and stabbed.

Later that year they released their first single, \"First Day,\" on August 4.\n\nThe Futureheads released their self-titled debut album in September, 2004 on 679 recordings. Five tracks of the tracks were produced by Andy Gill of Gang of Four. The rest of the album was produced by Paul Epworth. The song \"Decent Days And Nights\" from the album was featured in the video game soundtrack to \"\" on PlayStation 2 and Xbox as well as EA's \"Rugby 2005\".\n\nOn February 21, 2005, \"Hounds of Love\", a cover of a Kate Bush song, was released as a single. It reached number eight in the UK Singles Chart in its first week. It was named Best Single of 2005 by \"NME\". The band toured the United States. They later supported the Pixies, Foo Fighters and Snow Patrol.\n\nThey performed at BBC Radio One's One Big Weekend, held in their home town of Sunderland over the weekend of May 7-8, 2005. On May 8, 2005 Sunderland A.F.C. picked up the Coca-Cola Championship trophy. In tribute, the Futureheads performed a set live at the Stadium of Light as pre-match entertainment.\n\nThe stand-alone EP, \"Area\" was released in November, 2005 while the band was working on their second album \"News and Tributes\". According to \"NME\" in February, 2006, it took only five weeks to make. The first single from the album was \"Skip to the End\" released on May 15. The album \"News and Tributes\" was first released on May 29, 2006.\n\nThe band became bothered by major label music business and being under contract were very lucky to be set free by 679 Recordings. Hyde said \"we were desperate to get out of the record deal, they could easily have kept us and made us try and make more records but we didn't want that'\n\nThroughout the rest of 2006, The Futureheads started their own independent record label, Nul Records, and started working on songs for their next album.\n\nIn June, 2007, they reportedly completed work on their third album, \"This Is Not the World,\" which was released in May, 2008. Millard said that he expected the new album to be punkier than the last album. He also said that the band was close to splitting during the time after the second album was released. \n\nThe band made a free download called \"Broke Up The Time\" available from their website on November 9, 2007. They also announced three gigs in the UK followed by a full UK tour. They now have their own label, Nul Records, set up exclusively to distribute Futureheads material. In December, 2007 the band released a video of them walking around Carnaby Street, London to the single \"The Beginning of the Twist.\" It was also accompanied by a free download of a song called \"Crash.\"\n\nThe second single from their album \"Radio Heart\" was released on May 19, 2008 from their album \"This Is Not The World\" followed by the release of the music video for the single on April 16. A third single from the album, \"Walking Backwards,\" was released on August 4, 2008.\n\nTheir latest single, \"I Wouldn't Be Like This If You Were Here,\" was released on December 8, 2008. In 2009 the band played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe (400,000 - 500,000 rock fans every year) - Przystanek Woodstock in Poland. In November, 2009, the band allowed fans to download a new free track, \"Struck Dumb,\" for a period of two weeks. The band released their new album, entitled The Chaos, on 26th April 2010 in the UK. The overall sound is a little darker and punkier than that of its predecessor. The Chaos will be released in the USA on 1 June 2010, on Dovecote Records.\n\nThe band is influenced by New Wave and Post-punk bands such as Devo, XTC, Wire, and the Post-hardcore Fugazi. They are also strongly influenced by 1990's singer Lou Bega.\n\n\n", "id": "243804", "title": "The Futureheads"}

They were built like small tanks, with sturdy legs at each corner. They were not fast movers, but were obviously strong and lived in groups rather as many herbivores do today. Their body shape was similar to certain types of modern mammals such as pigs and rhinoceros. \n\nFossils discovered in Poland indicate that dicynodonts survived at least until the latest Upper Triassic. Six fragments of fossil skull bone discovered in Australia (Queensland) may indicate that dicynodonts survived into the Cretaceous in southern Gondwana.\n\nThe dicynodonts were a group of therapsids, but were not ancestors to the mammals.

Siri had won acclaim for designing major civic buildings hroughout South America, including offices and hospitals. He also had a passion for the ocean, and even used his talents to design racing yachts. \n\nSiri’s spirit and originality did not disappoint. From its earliest days, architects and passersby alike were intrigued by surprises in the buildings' construction. Rising dramatically from the shore of the historic Potomac River, two distinct structures dominated the triangular block of land: a circular council chamber and an 11-story crescent-shaped secretariat. By December 1964, texture and pattern had begun to emerge, giving each building a distinct character. Geometric diamond shapes decorated the outside of the council chamber, visually played off against the elegant vertical lines of the larger secretariat building. Gradually, other elements were added: reflecting pools, white columns, and slim concrete fins that gave the buildings a soaring quality. \n\nJust over two years after work began, the completed secretariat was ready to house hundreds of staff members in approximately 170,000 square feet of space, furnished with marble, paintings, sculptures, and other gifts from PAHO member nations. \nThe council chamber alone could accommodate 400 delegates within its circular walls.

Marine species are found mostly in between sediment particles, while terrestrial species live in the water films round grains of soil. Adults have a fixed cell number. About 700 species have been described.\n\nGastrotrichs are bilaterally symmetric, with a transparent body and a flat underside. Many species have a pair of short projections at the rear end. The body is covered with cilia, especially about the mouth and on the lower surface. Its two end projections have cement glands. This is a double-gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de-adhesive. Like many microscopic animals, their movement is mainly powered by hydrostatics.\n\nGastrotrichs develop to a particular number of cells; further growth comes only from an increase in cell size. As is typical for such small animals, there are no respiratory or circulatory organs. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one on either side of the pharynx. Each ganglion gives rise to a single nerve cord, which runs the length of the body and includes further, smaller ganglia. The main sense organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface. Some gastrotrichs also possess light sensitive cells in the brain that work as primitive ocelli (eye spots).\n\nGastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites: they have both male and female sex organs. Once the sperm are produced, they are picked up by an organ on the tail that functions as a penis, and transferred to the partner. Fertilisation is internal, and the eggs are released by rupture of the body wall.\n\nMany species reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis. In these species the male portions of the reproductive system are non-functional or entirely absent. \n\nSome species can lay eggs that can remain dormant during times of desiccation (drought) or cold. These species produce regular eggs during good environmental conditions, which hatch in one to four days. The eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult. The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days, and gastrotrichs can live up to ten days under laboratory conditions.\n\nGastrotrichs are eutelic: each species has a genetically fixed number of cells as adults. Cell division stops at the end of embryonic development and further growth is only by cell enlargement.\n", "id": "243998", "title": "Gastrotrich"}

It was a bifacial, similar on both sides, and held in the hand, not with a handle like a modern axe. It was held directly in the hand, perhaps wrapped in a piece of leather. \n\nThis kind of axe is typical of the Acheulean and the Mousterian cultures, and is the longest-used tool of human history. Hand axes were certainly used for at least a million and a half years. They were made by earlier species of man, such as \"Homo erectus\" and \"Homo neanderthalensis\" (Neanderthal Man); it was one of their most important tools. The hand axe culture \n\ns were preceded by an even older Oldowan culture of primitive stone tools (2.6 to 1.7 million years ago) in Africa. Now it is known that the first stone tools were probably made by Australopithecines. They are found in the Great Rift Valley of Africa from about 3.3 million years ago. \n\nNew archaeological evidence from Baise, Guangxi, China shows that there were occasional hand axes in eastern Asia. However, as the reference shows, the artifacts were overwhelmingly choppers and flakes. The authors say \"The stone tool assemblage shows close associations with the pebble tool industry... in South China\".\n\nA line known as the Movius Line divides the Old World into two parts: to the west are the hand axe areas, and to the east are the chopper or flak-and-chip areas. It is supposed that there were at least two different cultural traditions.\n\nOlder hand axes were produced by direct percussion with a stone hammer and can be distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Later Mousterian handaxes were produced with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border.\n\nAn experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality hand axe. A simple hand axe can be made from a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.\n\nHand axes are mainly made of flint, but rhyolites, phonolites, quartzites and other rather coarse rocks were used as well. It depends what rocks were available in the vicinity. Obsidian was rarely used, because it is not widely found. It produces a brilliant blade, but shatters more easily than flint.\n\nSeveral basic shapes, like cordate, oval, or triangular have been distinguished, but their significance is not agreed upon.\n\nHand axes were no doubt a multi-purpose tool. Research on their cutting edges has shown that, in many cases, they were used for butchering meat. This would include extracting bone marrow (which would explain the pointed end) and general hacking through bone, muscle and tendons. Experiments at Boxgrove quarry would appear to back this up. We know for sure that Neanderthals, at least, were hunters of large mammals such as mammoths, and that may be true of other hand axe cultures. The need for such a heavy tool is thus easily understood. Wielding a hand axe requires considerable strength, but Neanderthals were stronger than us in their upper bodies.\n\nStudies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a hand axe, showed that the hand axe was perfect for getting at the bone marrow, which is high in protein and vitamins and thus was highly prized as a food source.\n\n", "id": "244025", "title": "Hand axe"}

At the age of 14, after being spotted by songwriter Jimmy Webb's father, he was signed to a recording contract, and seemed to be destined for stardom. Scarbury's first single, \"She Never Smiles Anymore,\" flopped, and he was soon without a record label. \n\nScarbury, undaunted by what happened, stayed in music up through the 1970s singing backup for artists like Loretta Lynn, and occasionally recording his own material. Although he had a minor chart single with \"Mixed Up Guy\" in 1971, real chart success eluded him for the rest of the decade. This was to change when he started working for record producer and composer Mike Post. Post was hired along with Stephen Geyer to write the theme tune for a new TV series dubbed \"The Greatest American Hero\", about a high school teacher who comes into possession of a superhero outfit, and Scarbury was chosen to record it. An extended version of the song (3:15 compared to the television theme's minute-long length), released by Elektra Records, shot up to #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. \n\nScarbury could not follow it up however, and after charting at #49 with the single \"When She Dances\", Scarbury disappeared again from the charts. Scarbury went on to work with Post again in the mid 1980s to record the song \"Back to Back\", for the television series \"Hardcastle and McCormick\" and teamed up with Desiree Goyette to record \"Flashbeagle\" for the Peanuts special \"It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown\". He also performed the opening theme for the television series \"Jennifer Slept Here\".\n\nIn 1990, Scarbury found success again as a songwriter. This time, his co-written song \"No Matter How High\" was recorded by The Oak Ridge Boys and was a number one country music hit. His co-writer on this song was Even Stevens who previously had found success with co-writing songs for country star Eddie Rabbitt, as well as the Kenny Rogers hit \"Love Will Turn You Around\" from the motion picture \"Six Pack\".\n\nHis hit song from \"The Greatest American Hero\" appeared in Michael Moore's film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" on the scene when President George W. Bush declares the Iraq Mission Accomplished.\n\nIn 2008, Joey was back on the radio after a long absence. His single \"How Do You Sleep At Night\" broke the top 40.\n\nScarbury has released several singles starting in 1969 on Dunhill, followed by releases on Reena, Playboy, Bell, Columbia, RCA, Big Tree, Lionel, and Elektra labels.<br>\n1 ALBUM: (1981) \"America's Greatest Hero\"\n\n", "id": "244068", "title": "Joey Scarbury"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244070", "text": "Kenny Rankin\n\nKenny Rankin (February 10, 1940 - June 7, 2009) was an American pop and jazz singer and songwriter. He was originally from the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City, New York.\n\nRankin was raised in New York and was introduced to music by his mother, who sang at home and for friends. The area of Washington Heights, Manhattan was becoming heavily Latino during his youth, and exposure to street music may have played a part. He began recording at age 17 (1957), eventually working as a songwriter contracted to Columbia Records. Rankin's earliest composition, \"My Carousel\" was written for Carmen McRae, followed by \"A Happy Guy\" for teen idol Rick Nelson. He had already developed a serious amphetamine problem by that time.\n\nHe taught himself classical guitar, at age 24, inspired by the playing of Don Costa, who had started on that instrument before becoming one of the most important arrangers in popular music. He played rhythm guitar on some tracks on Bob Dylan's album Bringing it All Back Home (1965). Rankin developed a considerable following during the 70s with a steady flow of albums, three of which broke into the Top 100 of the Billboard Album Chart. His liking for jazz was evident from an early age, but the times were such that in order to survive his career had to take a more pop-oriented course, and he cited singer-songwriter Laura Nyro consistently as a major influence. \n\nRankin appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson more than twenty times. Carson was so impressed by him that he wrote the liner notes to Rankin's 1967 debut album \"Mind Dusters,\" which featured the single \"Peaceful.\" Rankin's friend Helen Reddy would reach #2 Adult Contemporary and #12 Pop in 1973 with a cover of it, released as her follow-up single to \"I Am Woman\". Georgie Fame also had a hit with this song in 1969, his only songwriting credit to hit the British charts reaching number sixteen and spending 9 weeks on the chart. \n\nRankin's original song \"In the Name of Love\" frequently featured wordless improvisational singing and showed his range and command of articulating lyrics at a blistering waltz tempo, but performed more slowly it had a distinctly Brazilian flavor. Similar to later singer Mandy Patinkin, Rankin's speaking voice was a rich baritone, but his tessitura was an octave higher, with an occasional start at near his speaking timbre, as in \"What Matters Most.\" The timbre of his singing voice most frequently resembled that of a clarinet. His remarkably quick mastery of the guitar allowed him to appear, along with Randy Newman and Joni Mitchell, as one of the few self-sufficient solo acts conveying original material with harmonic richness beyond that of folk and early rock music.\n\nHe was extremely private in his early televised interviews, once stating that personal information distracted from musical performance, and thus even his date of birth was considered anecdotal information. Later, he became more open and stated in interviews that in the 60s and 70s he had suffered from serious addictions which affected his career, and he credited his family, and a period of spiritual study while undergoing rehabilitation sessions, for helping him to overcome his drug and alcohol problems by the early 80s. Some recorded songs on the Little David record label (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records) featured his wife Yvonne and his daughters singing background, as the Rankin Family Band. His album \"Family\" featured cover art of Rankin holding his two young daughters. The Rankins also had a son. \n\nOccasionally criticised for poor choice of material, considering his talents, by the 90s, he was able to angle his repertoire to accommodate his own musical preferences and to please a new audience while still keeping faith with the faithful. Rankin's warm singing style and his soft, nylon-stringed guitar sound might suggest an artist more attuned to the supper-club circuit than the jazz arena, but his work contains many touches that appeal to the jazz audience, especially as he introduced more \"standards\" from the 30s and 40s into his performances. Reviews in the periodical Down Beat and later print media increasingly reinforced his jazz credentials.\n\nRankin's song \"Haven't We Met\" was performed by Mel Tormé and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was \"a horn with a heartbeat\". Rankin's accompanists have from time to time included pianists Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and trombonist Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. But Don Costa's full orchestral arrangements were used to back his voice to critical acclaim, following a trend in the wake of Harry Nilsson with Gordon Jenkins and Linda Ronstadt with Nelson Riddle, to emulate the lush soundscape that some say reached its apogee with Frank Sinatra's Capitol recordings. Rankin was also deeply interested in Brazilian music and his \"Here In My Heart,\" on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio de Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles' \"I've Just Seen A Face\" and Leon Russell's \"A Song For You.\"\n\nRankin's own unique gift for reworking classic songs such as The Beatles' \"Blackbird,\" which he recorded for his \"Silver Morning\" album, so impressed Paul McCartney that he asked Rankin to perform his interpretation of the song when McCartney and John Lennon were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nRankin was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in May 2009. He died in Los Angeles, California - where he had resided for many years - from the disease on June 7, 2009. He was 69 years old.\n\n\n\nYanow, Scott, The Jazz Singers: The Ultimate Guide, Backbeat Books, 2008.\n\nKort, Michael, Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro, Thomas Dunne Books / St. Martin's Press, 2002.\n\n", "id": "244070", "title": "Kenny Rankin"}

He is a former Olympic, Commonwealth, European and World champion. He has held the world record in the event since 1995.\n\nAfter his retirement as an athlete, Edwards has worked as an athletics commentator and presenter for BBC television. He was a devout Christian. He presented episodes of the BBC Christian worship programme \"Songs of Praise\". He lost faith in 2007. He is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games.\n\nEdwards attended West Buckland School where his ability in the triple jump was seen at an early age. He was a strong all-rounder and on leaving received the school's top award for sporting and academic excellence, the Fortescue Medal. Other students with Edwards at West Buckland School included Victor Ubogu and Steve Ojomoh. Both are former Bath and England Rugby international players. Edwards now has a Sports Hall at West Buckland named after him; \"The Jonathan Edwards Sports Centre\". Edwards then read Physics at Durham University, attending Van Mildert College.\n\nBecause of his strong Christian beliefs, he refused to compete on Sundays at first. Eventually he decided to do so in 1993. This decision proved important, since the qualifying round at that year's World Championships took place on a Sunday. He went on to win the bronze medal.\n\nIn his breakthrough year of 1995, he produced a jump of 18.43 m (60 feet 5½ inches) at the European Cup. The leap was wind assisted and did not count for record purposes. But it was a sign of things to come as he capped an unbeaten year. He had a historic gold medal performance at the World Championships. There he broke the world record twice in the same meet. On his first jump, he became the first man to legally pass the 18-metre barrier (18.16 m/59 feet 7 inches). That record lasted for about 20 minutes. His second jump of 18.29 m made him the first to jump 60 feet. During his commentary for the 2008 Summer Olympics, Edwards said that during the 1995 World Championships, he felt as if \"he could jump as far as he needed to\". Later the same year Edwards became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\nDuring 1996 Edwards went into the Olympic games as favourite and world record holder. But it was American Kenny Harrison who took the gold with a jump of 18.09 m. Edwards walked away with the silver after a leap of 17.88 m (the longest ever jump not to win gold). Edwards won the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games. He was awarded the CBE shortly afterwards. He also won golds at the 2001 World Championships and 2002 Commonwealth Games. At one point in 2002, Edwards held all the gold medals for the \"four majors\" (Olympic Games, World Championships, Commonwealth Games & European Championships). He retired after the 2003 World Championships as Great Britain's most successful medal winning athlete.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Edwards pursued a media career as a television presenter. He worked mainly for the BBC as a sports commentator and on programmes such as \"Songs of Praise\". He gave up this programme, due to his loss of faith, in February 2007.\n\nIn 2004 Edwards joined with Paula Radcliffe on an \"Olympic Special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\". The pair raised £64,000 for charity with half of that sum going to the British Olympic Association and a quarter of the sum going to Asthma UK.\n\nHe is a member of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. He represents athletes in the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nAn honorary doctorate was conferred upon him at a ceremony at the University of Exeter on 21 January 2006.\n\nLater in the same year, an honorary doctorate of the university (DUniv) was conferred upon him at the winter graduation ceremony of the University of Ulster (19 December 2006).\n\nEdwards lives with his wife Alison in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne. He has two sons, Nathan and Sam.\n\nHe initially refused to compete on Sundays due to his devout Christian beliefs. This decision cost him a chance to compete in the 1991 World Championships. However, in 1993, after much thinking and discussion with his father (a vicar), he changed his mind. He decided that God gave him his talent in order for him to compete in athletics.\n\nOn 2 February 2007 it was widely reported that Edwards had lost his faith in God despite him once saying \"My relationship with Jesus and God is fundamental to everything I do. I have made a commitment and dedication in that relationship to serve God in every area of my life.\"\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" described Edwards as a \"man deeply troubled by the collapse of his Christian faith\".

A period that is deeply personal to him and his family such that he does not wish to comment on.\n\nEdwards presented episodes of the Christian praise show Songs of Praise until 2007.\n\nIn an interview in \"The Times\" on 27 June 2007, Edwards said: \"If there is no God, does that mean that life has no purpose? Does it mean that personal existence ends at death? They are thoughts that do my head in. One thing that I can say, however, is that even if I am unable to discover some fundamental purpose to life, this will not give me a reason to return to Christianity. Just because something is unpalatable does not mean that it is not true.\" Furthermore, in the interview with \"The Times\" he also stated \"When you think about it rationally, it does seem incredibly improbable that there is a God.\" In the same interview he also said \"I feel internally happier than at any time of my life.\" Edwards confirmed his rejection of Christianity in an interview on BBC Five Live Sportsweek on 29 July 2007.\n\n<br>\n", "id": "244128", "title": "Jonathan Edwards (athlete)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244219", "text": "B of the Bang\n\nB of the Bang was a sculpture in Manchester, England. It was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity. The work was designed by Thomas Heatherwick. It was taken apart in 2009 due to structural problems.\n\nCommissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games, it was one of the tallest structures in the City of Manchester. It was the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of \"Aspire\" in 2008. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie. In the quotation he said that he started his races not at the \"bang\" of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'.\n\nThe sculpture was commissioned in 2003. Construction went longer than planned and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems. The tip of one of the spikes came off and fell to the ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7m.\n\nIn February 2009 Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be taken apart and placed in storage, as the \"only practical alternative\". The council said it was committed to working closely with the design team in order to \"determine whether there is a robust and affordable strategy for the re-construction of the structure on the site\". Despite the promise of storage and potential reassembly, the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal.\n\n\"B of the Bang\" originally stood tall. It had 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes coming out of a central core. It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five long, tapered steel legs. These connected to the spikes above the ground. The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes. The concrete in the foundations weighed over 1,000 tonnes, including a reinforced concrete slab. The foundations are deep.\n\nThe sculpture was made from the same weathering steel (also known as Cor-Ten) as the Angel of the North sculpture. This slowly develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements. This layer prevents further corrosion by reducing its permeability to water. As part of the design, the spikes moved slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts over . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture. It contained children's poems and paintings, due to be opened around 2300. The location of the time capsule after being taken apart is currently unknown.\n\n\"B of the Bang\" was next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road; coordinates . It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed \"KerPlunk\" by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.\n\nPrior to the construction of Aspire at the University of Nottingham, \"B of the Bang\" was Britain's tallest sculpture. It stood at twice the height of the Angel of the North. Angel of the North is tall. It was designed to look like an exploding firework. It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002. The sculpture was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\nThe sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas Heatherwick Studio, Packman Lucas, Flint and Neill and Westbury Structures. It was approved at the start of 2003, with the central core arriving in Manchester on the 13 June 2004. This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory, and required a police escort. This central core was lifted into place in August 2004, after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached. Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003, which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname \"G of the Bang\".\n\nThe official unveiling by Linford Christie took place on 12 January 2005.\n\nIn total the sculpture cost £1.42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate, as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs. Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £700,000, the North West Development Agency, contributing £500,000, and Manchester City Council providing £120,000.\n\nThe tip of one of the spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on the 6 January 2005, only six days before the official unveiling. After inspection, the event went ahead as planned.\n\nFour months later, in May 2005, a second spike had to be cut off by firefighters after it was discovered hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 170 of the spikes.\n\nDespite these modifications, \"B of the Bang\" remained fenced off, prompting a local newspaper campaign to 'Get It Sorted'. In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for metallurgical analysis, to discover the stresses being placed on the steel.\n\nIt was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture, with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture. In November 2008 this culminated in an out-of-court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council, the project's designers Thomas Heatherwick Studio Ltd, and the engineering and construction subcontractors Packman Lucas Ltd, Flint and Neill Partnership and Westbury Structures Ltd. The agreement was to pay the council £1.7m in damages for breach of contract and negligence.\n\nActing on a report in January 2009, the city council recommended that \"B of the Bang\" should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the necessity for extensive testing.\n\nIn January 2009, Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North — to which \"B of the Bang\" is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture, stating that, \"\"It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground-breaking work was commissioned. To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council's nerve.\"\" \n\nDespite Gormley's plea, removal of \"B of the Bang\" began in April 2009. More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm Connell Bros Ltd. began removing the spikes with oxyacetylene cutting equipment.\n\nAlthough the council had earlier promised to store the complex central core and legs, these too were cut apart during removal, casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture's return.\n", "id": "244219", "title": "B of the Bang"}

For example, given the set { -7, -3, -2, 5, 8}, the answer is \"yes\" because the subset { -3, -2, 5} sums to zero. The problem is NP-Complete. It can be reformulated to the 3SAT. \nAn alternative statement of this problem is, given a set of numbers and an integer x determine whether or not there exist a subset that sums up to x.\nEg. given a set {1, 4, 6, 7} and x = 10 the answer is \"yes\" because {4, 6} sums to 10. \nRemember that the subsequence need not to be contiguous.

In 1842 his father brought home a \"great piece of news\". Young John Lubbock thought it might be a new pony, and was disappointed that the news was that Charles Darwin was moving to Down House in the village. He was soon a frequent visitor to Down House, and became the closest of Darwin's younger friends.\n\nLubbock was educated at Eton College from 1845 and afterwards was taken into his father's bank, where he became a partner at the age of twenty-two. In 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy. \n\nIn 1870, 1874, and 1880 he was elected to Parliament, where he promoted a number of laws. Lubbock was elected the first president of the Institute of Bankers in 1879; in 1881 he was president of the British Association, and from 1881 to 1886 president of the Linnean Society of London. In March 1883 he founded the Bank Clerks Orphanage, which in 1986 became the Bankers Benevolent Fund – a charity for bank employees, past and present and their dependants. In January 1884 he founded the Proportional Representation Society, later to become the Electoral Reform Society.\n\nLubbock received honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin and Würzburg; and in 1878 was appointed a trustee of the British Museum. From 1888 to 1892 he was president of the London Chamber of Commerce; from 1889 to 1890 vice-chairman and from 1890 to 1892 chairman of the London County Council.\n\nIn February 1890 he was appointed a Privy Councillor, and was chairman of the committee of design on the new coinage in 1891. In January 1900 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Avebury, his title commemorating the largest Neolithic site in Europe.\n\nIn 1865 Lubbock published what was possibly the most influential archaeological text book of the 19th Century, \"Pre-historic times, as illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of modern savages\". He invented the terms Palaeolithic and Neolithic to denote the Old and New Stone Ages respectively, but more notable was his introduction of a Darwinian view of human nature. \n\nLubbock was also an amateur biologist of some distinction, writing books on hymenoptera, on insect sense organs and development, on the intelligence of animals, and on other natural history topics. He was a member of the famous X Club founded by T.H. Huxley to promote the growth of science in Britain. He discovered that ants were sensitive to the ultraviolet range of the spectrum. The Punch verse of 1882 captured him perfectly:\n\nHe carried out extensive correspondence with Charles Darwin, who lived nearby in Downe. In addition to their shared interest in natural history, both men were active advocates of spelling reform, and members of the Spelling Reform Association. When Darwin died in 1882, Lubbock suggested the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey, and was one of the pallbearers.\n\n", "id": "244351", "title": "John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury"}

In propositional logic, a formula is \"satisfiable\" if the variables it uses can be given values so that it becomes true. It is important to know that for a given formula, no numbers exist so that the formula becomes true. In other words, the formula will always be false no matter what values its variables have. The formula is called \"satisfiable\" in the first case. It is called \"unsatisfiable\" in the second case. \n\nThis problem is also known as \"Boolean or propositional satisfiability\". Computer scientists usually call it SAT. Complexity theory believes that the formula should be in a special form, known as conjunctive normal form. A formula that is in this form has clauses. Clauses are joined by a \"logical and\". Each clause has several literals. They are joined by a \"logical or\". A literal and its complement cannot appear in the same clause. The problem may also have other names. The names depend on what the logical formula looks like. The names also depend on how many variables are used per clause.\n\nA formula that satisfies 3SAT looks like the following:\n\nIn this case \"(\"A\" OR \"B\" OR \"C\")\" is an example for a clause, and \"B\" is one of the literals of this clause.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin showed that the problem is NP-complete. This is known as the Cook–Levin theorem. \n\nThe problem 3SAT uses three variables per clause. It is one of the 21 NP-complete problems.

They are tiny worm-like marine animals. They inhabit sand and mud beneath shallow coastal waters and can survive in relatively anoxic environments. \n\nMost gnathostomulids measure 0.5 to 1 millimetre (0.02 to 0.04 in) in length. They are slender to thread-like worms, with a transparent body. The neck region is slightly narrower than the rest of the body, giving them a distinct head. \n\nLike flatworms they have a ciliated epidermis, but are unique in having but one cilium per cell. The cilia allow the worms to glide along in the water between sand grains, although they also have muscles that allow the body to twist or contract. \n\nThey have no circulatory or respiratory system. The nervous system is very simple, and restricted to the outer layers of the body wall. The only sense organs are modified cilia, which are especially common in the head region.\n\nThe mouth is just behind the head, on the underside of the body. It has a pair of muscular jaws supplied with minute teeth, and a plate on the lower surface that bears a comb-like structure which they use to scrape smaller organisms off of the grains of sand that make up their anoxic seabed mud habitat. The mouth opens into a blind-ending tube in which digestion takes places; there is no anus. \n\nThere are approximately 100 described species and certainly many more as yet undescribed. Gnathostomulids have no fossil record.\n\nGnathostomulids are simultaneous hermaphrodites. Each individual possesses a single ovary and one or two testes. After fertilisation, the single egg ruptures through the body wall and adheres to nearby sand particles; the parent is able to rapidly heal the resulting wound. The egg hatches into a miniature version of the adult, without a larval stage.\n", "id": "244705", "title": "Gnathostomulida"}

Moving toward land, Tropical Storm Agatha peak as a weak tropical storm with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Tropical Storm Agatha had made landfall near the Mexico and Guatemala border. Agatha had quickly died over land on May 30 after moving northward.\n\nTropical Storm Agatha killed about 146 people in Central America.\n\nTropical Depression Two-E started on June 16 from a tropical wave.

It began to weakened slowly as it headed into colder waters. The next day, Blas weakened to a tropical depression and died the following day, June 21. Tropical Storm Blas remained far enough from land to cause no affects. \n\nCelia formed from an area of low pressure on June 19, and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. On June 21 Celia became a Category 2 hurricane and on June 23 strengthened further to become a Category 3 for a little while before weakening again due to bad conditions. After these bad conditions disappeared, Celia strengthened again and became a Category 5 hurricane on June 24, and the strongest storm of the season so far. However Celia moved into a part of the ocean with dry air above it and Celia weakened to a tropical storm quickly, before dying out completely. Celia was far enough away from land to not cause any damage.\n\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in East Pacific in 2010.

It is a group of nerve cells which act as a junction between different parts of the nervous system. \n\nWith invertebrates, ganglia often do the work of a brain. In these cases, like the earthworm, there is a ganglion above the gut at the front. This is linked to another under the gut by nerve fibres running down each side of the gut. The rest of the central nervous system runs under the gut. This type of arrangement in found in a number of invertebrate phyla, and contrasts with the vertebrates, who have their spinal cord above (dorsal to) their gut.\n\nIn another usage, ganglion cells are found in the retina of the vertebrate eye.\n", "id": "245196", "title": "Ganglion"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245203", "text": "Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\n\nObsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a personality disorder. People with OCPD are with rules and order, and can feel worried or angry when things do not seem right. This can lead to routines and rules for ways of doing things, for themselves and the people around them.\n\nPeople with OCPD pay an unusual amount of attention to details, rules, lists, order, organization, and schedules. It is very hard to get them to change their minds. They are perfectionist and want themselves to always be working and doing it right. Because of this, they are afraid to let other people do things in case they do it wrong.\n\nSome people with OCPD, but not all of them, have a strong need to be clean. Those that do not show this tendency are sometimes good at setting up systems to keep clean, but may not follow through with the need to clean because of other \"more important\" things. For example, the need to finish a project at work might cause the OCPD person to have a quite unorganized home. But if that same person was suddenly unemployed or finished with other things, they could very well start becoming more concerned about being clean as they have more free time.\n\nOCPD people sometimes do not finish things on time because too much time is used in getting it to be just right. Friends and family are often under serious strain because the OCPD individual must be in charge and the only one who knows what is right. Not being clean or tidy enough is seen by some OCPD individuals as not being perfect enough. They may regularly spend a lot of time putting things in exactly the right place in exactly the right way. OCPD sufferers can be worried about things going wrong in their lives, and hoard money just in case.\n\nFor a person with fully developed OCPD, actions and beliefs are either completely right or completely wrong, and they are always right. Because of this, interpersonal relationships are difficult as the person demands too much of their friends, partners, and children. When people do not do what they want, sometimes people with OCPD turn to anger and even violence. They often suffer from depression. This can sometimes be so serious that they might commit suicide. One study suggests that disorders like OCPD can make people more depressed than actually having major depressive disorder.\n\nPeople with OCPD, when anxious or excited, may have tics, pull faces, or make noises like people with Tourette syndrome, or do and surprising things.\n", "id": "245203", "title": "Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder"}

It was released in May 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by Rockstar Games. It is a spiritual successor to 2004's \"Red Dead Revolver\".\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption\" gives the player a big and open world environment. This allows the player to move freely. Players on foot can walk, talk, shoot, kill, ride, run, interact with the environment. Players may also fight enemies with firearms. Different breeds of horses is how the player mainly gets around. Players cannot go swimming, because the main character John Marston cannot swim and will drown if the player goes too far into the water (though he is able to go where the water is shallow).\n\nThe open world environment allows players to choose how they want to play. Storyline missions are for progress. Players can also take part in many events they come across as they explore the world. Some examples are public hangings, ambushes, cries for help, and animal attacks. Players can also take part in optional side activities ranging from standoffs, five fingers fillet game, gambling, and hunting animals for pelts and meat.\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption\" makes use of an honesty system. This is when players have the chance to get good or bad 'honor'. Some of the ways to get good honor are like taking an outlaw alive instead of killing him, or saving a kidnapped person. Bad honor can be gotten for doing crimes like killing and/or robbing people. This works along with another system, 'fame,' showing and governing how people react based on Marston's honor status.\n\nA trailer of the game was sent to a select number of people at a Sony meeting in 2005. It helped the release of the PlayStation 3 system. The trailer was a tech demo of Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. It was set in a western setting thought to as \"Old West Project\" and a sequel to \"Red Dead Revolver\". The trailer flowed throughout the internet. In the April edition of \"Game Informer\", \"Red Dead Redemption\" was listed as being for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.\n\nOn February 3, 2009, Rockstar Games showed the first official trailer. Resulting trailers had many characters, gameplay features, and multiplayer modes that will be shown in the final release. The game was shown on NASCAR driver Joey Logano's number 20 Toyota Camry in the Nationwide Series running of the O'Reilly 300. This took place at the Texas Motor Speedway on April 17, 2010. In North America, television network Fox plans to show a half-hour in-game special. It will be directed by John Hillcoat on May 29, 2010.\n\nIn North America, GameStop and Rockstar worked with each other on a pre-order bonus. This bonus would let customers vote for one of three outfits that Marston could unlock in the game. Each outfit came with a different bonus. For example, the \"Deadly Assassin\" outfit allows Marston to restart slow-mo \"Dead-Eye\" targeting twice as fast. The \"Savvy Merchant\" outfit would cut in half the purchasing price of ammunition and guns and double the selling price for ammunition and guns. And the \"Expert Hunter\" outfit would double the amount of money the player could get from selling hides of animals. Voting was open to all, but only those who pre-ordered the game through Gamestop will get the winning outfit, the \"Deadly Assassin\".\n\nAlong with the GameStop pre-order special, there are many other pre-order bonuses through other game stores. These game stores are throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. These are the \"War Horse\" and the \"Golden Guns\". The \"War Horse\" is a black horse with a white mane, tail and markings thought as \"rare\" as well as being \"faster\" and having \"more health\" than any other horse in the game. The \"Golden Guns\" reward increases fame with each kill. This allows users to progress much faster up the ladder of fame. The official online Rockstar Games store, the \"Rockstar Warehouse,\" offers a \"Red Dead Redemption\" T-shirt as the pre-order bonus. With some countries getting the \"Golden Guns\" and the \"War Horse,\" all will have the Deadly Assassin outfit along with the first soundtrack.\nLimited additional showings such as a new gang hideout and a walton gang outfit, is available for the PlayStation 3 version of the game. Plus, some awards in the game unlock rewards for PlayStation Home, PlayStation 3's online social gaming network.\n\n\"Red Dead Redemption Original Soundtrack\" is the soundtrack of video game music from the game \"Red Dead Redemption\". The music was mostly made by Friends of Dean Martinez member Bill Elm and ex-member Woody Jackson along with some other people from many musicians like Swedish folk musician José González.\n\nThe game has been met with worldwide cheering. It also got a lot of good reviews from the views of the open world, story, and soundtrack. The game has gotten a 95/100 on both Metacritic and GameRankings. On Metacritic, it is the 5th best rated Xbox 360 game of all time and the 3rd best rated PlayStation 3 game of all time. On GameRankings both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are on the \"All-Time Best\" video game list.\n\n\"The New York Times\" game review reporter said, \"\"In the more than 1,100 articles I have written for this newspaper since 1996, I have never before called anything a tour de force. Yet there is no more succinct and appropriate way to describe \"Red Dead Redemption\".\"\n\nIGN gave good reviews on the game giving it a 9.7/10. They said, \"\"What is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie\".\" In the end they said \"\"Red Dead Redemption is a must-play game. Rockstar has taken the Western to new heights and created one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around. You can expect the occasional bug or visual hiccup, but you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for\".\" GameSpot awarded the game 9.5/10 and said that it \"raises the bar for open world action games\".\n\nhttp://www.change.org/petitions/rockstar-games-port-red-dead-redemption-on-pc\n\nGameSpy gave it 5/5 stars saying \"\"With Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar succeeds in creating one of the most impressive open worlds I've ever seen in a game, and it's telling that — even after playing for over 30 hours — all I want to do is get back on my horse and gallop back into the wilderness\".\" VideoGamer gave it a 10/10 saying \"\"The game itself is absolutely spectacular... The sheer quality of Red Dead Redemption is evident right from the word go.\" They also said \"it's a magnificent piece of work that everybody should play\".\"\n\nEurogamer gave Red Dead Redemption an 8/10, saying \"\"successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario\"\".\n", "id": "245294", "title": "Red Dead Redemption"}

Spiritual successors still have the same elements, themes, and styles as the first.\n\nThe nature of the publisher/maker system are basic in almost all computer games. As well as the purchase and takeovers by many companies. These are reasons why creative teams often lose to keep the copyright and trademark rights of what they made. This often makes attempts to make sequels for a product not possible for many reasons. One of the reasons it the \"core\" of the studio being fired or taken over after finishing a project while the parent company keeps control of the copyrights and trademarks. A good example of this strategy is Electronic Arts. They have closed many studios while keeping their copyrights and trademarks, such as Bullfrog Productions, Origin Systems, and Westwood Studios.\n\nTo get around this, creative teams will make a product that is kind of like the first game in some way, without copying the first directly. For example, the video games \"TimeSplitters\" and, \"Perfect Dark\" are often thought to be the spiritual successors to the hit video game \"GoldenEye 007\".\n\nOther times, a spiritual successor is made when the first products were either poor commercial sellers and/or forgotten by the people that would purchase the product. By leaving the first product's name and maybe its baggage as a forgotten product, the spiritual sequel can be loved by fresh eyes. An example of this would be \"BioShock\", which has been named to by its makers as the spiritual successor to \"System Shock 2\". \"System Shock\" and \"System Shock 2\" both got good reviews, but both failed to get the expected commercial success. Unlike \"BioShock\", which was both a reviewer and commercial success.\n\n\n", "id": "245306", "title": "Spiritual successor"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245347", "text": "William Gibson\n\nWilliam Gibson (born March 17, 1948) writes science fiction. He is one of the most important people in the part of science fiction called Cyberpunk. His most famous book is \"Neuromancer\".\n\nWilliam Ford Gibson was born in Conway, South Carolina on the Atlantic coast. He spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia. Whytheville is a small town in the Appalachians. His parents had been born and raised there.\n\nGibson was shy and awkward as a teenager. He grew up in a place and time where most people thought and acted alike. This was a problem for him. He chose not to believe in religion. He read science fiction and writers such as William S. Burroughs and Henry Miller. Gibson was not doing well in school and his mother was frustrated. She threatened to send him to a boarding school. She was very surprised when he liked this idea very much.\n\nGibson's mother died when he was eighteen years old. He left school and did not graduate. He traveled a lot. He became very interested in the counterculture. He left the United States and moved to Canada during the Vietnam War draft.\n\nGibson finished a graduate degree about science fiction. He stopped writing for one year. He did not like the trends he saw in SF. He was more interested in punk rock. He met other writers such as Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, and Rudy Rucker. These writers became the important members of the cyberpunk movement in SF.\n\nGibson's first published short story was \"Fragments of a Hologram Rose\" (1977). He wrote other short stories for magazines such as Omni. He was often compared to J. G. Ballard. Some of the characters and places in his short stories are also in his Sprawl novels.\n\nTerry Carr asked Gibson to write \"Neuromancer\" for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials. The purpose of the series was to give attention to first-time novelists.\n\n\"Neuromancer\" was a success and Gibson kept writing SF. \"The Sprawl trilogy\" continued the story of Neuromancer, even though Gibson did not plan to write any sequels. Then he explored other ideas. \"The Difference Engine\" was alternate history. In \"The Bridge trilogy\", Gibson wrote about new problems. He paid less attention to large corporations or artificial intelligence. He wrote more about mass media and celebrity.\n\nGibson's later books are more realistic. They include Pattern Recognition, Spook Country, and Zero History.\n\nHe has written short stories and novels with others, especially other cyberpunk authors John Shirley and Bruce Sterling.\nThere have been many attempts to make films based on Gibson's writing. Most of these have never been completed.\nGibson has written poems too. He has also worked with artists, architects, and musicians.\n\nIn 1990, Gibson was part of an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art called \"Visionary San Francisco\". He wrote a short story, \"Skinner's Room\", that took place in San Francisco. In the story, the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and became a community for homeless people. Architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts were interested in the story and imagined a future San Francisco. Their idea of the future showed rich people living in high-tech towers above a city that was falling apart. Gibson was part of the architects' exhibit. Visitors could watch a video of him discussing the future and reading from the story \"Skinner's Room\". Another version of the short story appeared a year later in \"Omni magazine\".\n\nIn 1993, Gibson wrote some lyrics for the album \"Technodon\" by the Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra. He was the vocalist on the track \"\"Hi-Tech Hippies\"\". He wrote lyrics to the track \"\"Dog Star Girl\"\" on Deborah Harry's \"Debravation\".\n\nGibson sometimes writes nonfiction for newspapers or magazines. He has written essays, opinion-editorials, and commentary for publications such as: \"Wired\", \"The New York Times\", \"The Observer\", \"Addicted to Noise\", \"New York Times Magazine\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Details Magazine\".\n\nIn his fiction and non-fiction, Gibson often writes about cities. He thinks many cities are losing variety. One way of describing this is \"Disneylanding\".\nMany writers believe that Gibson helped science fiction become cool. \nHis work seemed did not just predict the future of technology such as the World Wide Web. The ideas in his books were important to the people who created Internet technology.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "245347", "title": "William Gibson"}

The capital city is Hanga Roa. \n\nIt is famous for its 887 huge statues called Moai, made by the early Rapa Nui people. Easter Island also has a huge crater called Rano Kau at the edge of the island. In the crater there is a natural lake and it is one of only three bodies of fresh water on the island. \n\nEaster Island a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Much of the island is protected in the Rapa Nui National Park. \n\nThe introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding devastated the population in the 1800s. Introduced animals, first rats and then sheep, were largely responsible for the island's loss of native flora.\n\nThe history of Easter Island is rich and controversial. Its inhabitants have suffered famines, civil war, slave raids, and near total loss of forests. The population has declined steeply more than once. The islanders have left a cultural legacy that is famous. \n\n300–400 AD was thought to be the date of the first settlement of Easter Island, which is about the same time as the arrival of the first settlers on Hawaii. However, new results in radiocarbon dating show that Polynesia and Rapa Nui were settled between 700 to 1,100 AD. \n\nThe island was most probably settled by Polynesians who navigated in canoes or catamarans from the Marquesas Islands, 3,200 km (2,000 miles) away, or the Gambier Islands (Mangareva, 2,600 km (1,600 miles) away. When Captain Cook visited the island, one of his crew members, who was a Polynesian from Bora Bora, was able to communicate with the Rapa Nui. \n\nAccording to oral traditions written down by missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had a very clear class system, with an ariki, high chief, who had great power over nine other clans and their chiefs.\nA French navigator, Jean-Francois de Galaup, comte de La Perouse, found 2,000 people on the island when he arrived in 1786. A major slave raid from Peru in 1862, followed by epidemics of smallpox, reduced the population to only 111 people by 1877. By that time, Catholic missionaries had settled on Easter Island and begun to convert the population to Christianity, a process that was completed by the late 19th century. In 1888, Chile annexed Easter Island, leasing much of the land for sheep raising. The Chilean government appointed a civilian governor for Easter Island in 1965, and the island’s residents became full Chilean citizens.\n\nThe high chief was the eldest descendent, through firstborn lines, of the island's legendary founder, Hotu Matu'a. The most visible part of the culture was the making of very large statues called moai that represented deified ancestors. It was believed that the living had a relationship with the dead where the dead provided everything the living needed. Most settlements were on the coast and moai were erected all along the coastline, watching over their descendants in the settlements before them, with their backs toward the spirit world in the sea. \n\nThe most important myths are:\n\nThe climate of Easter Island is subtropical maritime. The lowest temperatures are in July and August (18 °C) and the highest in February (maximum temperature 28 °C), the summer season in the southern hemisphere. Winters are quite mild. The rainiest month is April, though the island has year-round rainfall.\n", "id": "245424", "title": "Easter Island"}

It is situated about 16 kilometres south of Campbelltown and 35 kilometres north west of Wollongong. In 2006 there were 1,423 people living in Appin. The fifth village settled in Australia, it is now on the fringe of the Sydney urban area.\n\nThe town was named by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1811 after a small village on the coast of Scotland where his wife was born. One of the first settlers was John Hume, whose son Hamilton Hume became a famous Australian explorer. Hamilton Hume explored the local area and was given a grant of 300 acres of land at Appin as a reward. When he made his famous journey to Victoria with William Hovell in 1824, they started the journey from Appin.\n\nAppin is the birthplace of John Fuller (1830-1865), the Australian bushranger also known as Dan Morgan.\n\nCataract Gorge is about 10km south east of Appin. It is now has a dam built in 1906 which is the oldest dam in the Sydney water supply system. On 17 April, 1816 the British army killed many Aboriginal men, women and children, of the Dharawal Nation at the gorge. They had been fighting the European settlers who were moving into the area.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church at Appin, St. Bede's, was built from 1837-1843. The design was by Father John Therry (1790-1864), who became Australia's first Catholic priest in 1820. St. Bede's is the oldest Catholic church still in continuous use. It was named after St. Bede, the founder of the Benedictines.\n", "id": "245426", "title": "Appin, New South Wales"}

The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries.\n\nHistorically, the word \"constable\" comes from the Latin, \"comes stabuli\", count of the stables. It came from the Eastern Roman Empire. Originally, the constable was the person who kept the horses of a lord or monarch. The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe. In many countries, the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as, the Constable of France.\n\nIn modern times, constables are law enforcement officers. In the United Kingdom, Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries, a constable is the lowest rank of police officer. In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer, with less powers than a sheriff. However, in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office-holder at the parish level.\n\nHistorically, a constable could also be someone in charge of the defence of a castle. Even today, there is a Constable of the Tower of London.\n\nIt is a similar position to Marshal, which comes from Old High German \"marah\" \"horse\" and \"schalh\" \"servant\", and originally meant \"stable keeper\", which has a similar etymology.\n", "id": "245432", "title": "Constable"}

It also includes a small area of Victoria near Snowy River National Park. The Australian Capital Territory is often considered part of the region. Most towns in the region have very close links with Canberra.\n\nThe Monaro region is a large plateau about above sea level. It lies between the valley of the Murrumbidgee River in the north, and the Errinundra Plateau in the south. It drops steeply to the coast on its eastern side. Much of the region is an ancient highland, but there is basaltic bedrock near Cooma and Nimmitabel. This produces the only true chernozems in Australia. These are some of the best soils in the whole country. Elsewhere on the Monaro the granitic soils are very infertile. They supported dry forest vegetation before clearing for farming.\n\nBecause it is located east of the Snowy Mountains, the rain-bearing westerly winds drop rain and snow on the mountains leaving the Monaro region in a rain shadow. Annual rainfall ranges from around Dalgety to at the eastern edge of the plateau. Occasional storms can produce very heavy rainfall. On one day in June 1975, Nimmitabel received of rain. Temperatures in summer are warm to very warm. The average maximum temperatures range from around Canberra and Queanbeyan to on the highest parts of the plateau. Nights in summer can be cool, but in winter the region is the coldest part of mainland Australia outside the Alps The with July minimum temperatures averaging in Canberra and in Bombala.\n\nThe Monaro region features rolling hills that rise to very rugged peaks in the Tinderry Mountains. There are shallow valleys in the upper Murrumbidgee. The basaltic Monaro Range separates the Snowy and Murrumbidgee drainages. Because the climate in the basaltic areas is too cold for crops, the main industry is raising sheep and beef cattle.\n\nThe Monaro Highway is the main State highway from Canberra to the Monaro region. The main towns in the region are Cooma and Bombala, others include Berridale, Adaminaby, Delegate, Dalgety, Nimmitabel and Jindabyne.\n", "id": "245436", "title": "Monaro (New South Wales)"}

Until 2010 the Halifax was also an estate agent.\n\nThe Halifax started in 1853 as the Halifax Permanent Benefit Building and Investment Society at the Old Cock Inn in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The building society was created to allow working-class people in Halifax to invest their money in a local and 'mutual' organisation.\n\nIn 1928 it merged with the Halifax Equitable Building Society and changed its name to the Halifax Building Society. In 1973 the Halifax built its headquarters on Trinity Road in Halifax.

Both brands were kept although some Halifax branches in Scotland became 'Bank of Scotland' and Bank of Scotland branches in Ireland became 'Halifax' branches. This was done because the Bank of Scotland was much larger in Scotland than the Halifax, while Halifax was much larger in Ireland than the Bank of Scotland and had spent a lot of money advertising of Irish television.\n\nIn January 2009 HBOS was acquired by Lloyds TSB which subsequently became Lloyds Banking Group.

It opened in September 1994 and is the United Kingdom's leading indoor Olympic-standard track. Today it is home to the National Cycling Centre, and the headquarters of British Cycling, the national governing body. It is open to the public.\n\nIt hosted the track cycling in the 2002 Commonwealth Games, and the UCI world championships in 1996, 2000 and 2008.\n\nThe track has a reputation for speed. By 30 March 2008, more than 15 world records had been set there. The records include Chris Boardman's 1996 and 2000 hour records and the 4000 metre team pursuit record set by the Great Britain men's team at the 2008 World Championships.\n\nThe track is 250 metres long. Its bankings reach 42 degrees in the middle. The track is as steep at the top as it is on the black (racing) line. On 21 May 2007 the velodrome closed to be re-surfaced. The old track was relaid with Siberian pine. It reopened on 16 July 2007, and is now considered smoother to ride.\n\nThe Revolution Series was introduced in 2003 to make track cycling more popular. Its goal was to try and build on the success of the well attended events like the World Championships and World Cup Classics Meetings. It was also to provide more regular events for fans to go to. The series started with 4 events over the winter season and quickly built up good regular crowds. The first close to sell out crowd came at the 7th meeting, in 2005, when all seats were sold with a further number of fans standing. The first official complete sell out came at Revolution 14 and is now a regular occurrence.\n\nAlongside the senior racing, the Future Stars competition also runs at each Revolution event. This series involves young riders, usually 15-16 year olds, and puts them through a number of races each night to test both their sprint and endurance skills.\n\nAn incomplete list of events which Manchester Velodrome has hosted:\n\nThe velodrome is not just solely for the use of professional riders. Cycling fans can also have the opportunity of riding around the famous boards as well. Regular sessions are run every week at the velodrome, starting from taster sessions right up to serious training. A taster session involves some basic training and an hour riding the track.\n\nOn 2 July 2009 cycling fans Kraftwerk performed at the Manchester Velodrome as part of the 2009 Manchester International Festival.

There were also elections for the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Barack Obama and his running mate Joe Biden won re-election for a second term.\n\nBy November 6, 2012, 11:30 PM ET (5:30 AM UTC), many broadcast networks said that Obama and Biden won the election. Mitt Romney of the Republican Party conceded the election to Obama around 1 AM ET on November 7. Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party came in third.\n\nBetween the 2008 and 2012 elections the Electoral College changed because of the 2010 Census. As a result, several states have lost electoral votes, and several states have gained electoral votes. Here are the states that have gained or lost electoral votes:\n\nGaining Votes\n\nLosing Votes\n\nThe Republicans will hold their national convention the week of August 27 at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa. The Democrats will hold their convention the week of September 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina..\n\nBoth parties choose who to nominate and then the two nominees face each other.\n\nBarack Obama declared that he was running for re-election in 2012 on April 4, 2011. He had challengers in 7 states, but still managed to win all 57 democratic primaries and therefore the democratic nomination. \n\n\nIn the middle of 2011, there were many Republicans running: Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachmann, Businessman Herman Cain, Speaker of the House of Representatives (in the 1990s) Newt Gingrich, Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Ambassador to China and Governor of Utah Jon Huntsman, Texas Governor Rick Perry, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, Buddy Roemer, Thaddeus McCotter, and Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty.\n\nScott Brown, Sarah Palin, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, and Rudy Giuliani were considered possible candidates. All of them said that they were not going to run for president.\n\nIn May, a series of debates began between the Republicans. \nIn August 2011, the Ames Straw Poll was conducted. It was won by Bachmann, with Paul coming in second. During the poll, Perry entered the race. After not placing in the top 2 in the poll, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty dropped out. Thaddeus McCotter dropped out a short time later.\n\nRick Perry became the frontrunner (person with the highest amount of support who is expected to win, according to polls) of the party, ahead of Romney in the polls. Rick Perry then had several bad debates and in one of them he said he wanted to remove 3 government departments, but forgot one of them. After these mistakes, Perry's poll numbers went down.\nIn the fall, Herman Cain became the new frontrunner for several months. He had an economic plan called 9-9-9 that would replace the entire tax system with a 9% income tax, a 9% national sales tax, and a 9% corporation tax. During foreign policy debates, he was not as successful. On December 3, 2011, Cain left the Presidential race. This was after several women said that he had sexually harassed them.\n\nNewt Gingrich and Mitt Romney were the two main competitors after that, but soon after Newt Gingrich lost much of his support. Gary Johnson withdrew on December 28, 2011 to run for the nomination of the Libertarian Party.\n\nIn January 2012, after not doing well in the primaries, Bachmann, Huntsman, and Perry dropped out of the Presidential race. Rick Santorum, however, picked up a surprise win in Iowa, as did Gingrich in South Carolina.\n\nFor February, March and the beginning of April, Rick Santorum was Mitt Romney's main competitor. On April 10, However, with only 11 (primary) victories to Romney's 23, Rick Santorum announced that he was going to drop out of the race. Buddy Roemer dropped out on February 22nd to run for the nominations of americans elect and the reform party, before ending his campaign completely on May 31.\n\nAfter Santorum dropped out, most people thought that Mitt Romney would win the most primaries, and therefore the most pledged delegates, and ultimately the nomination. His two remaining opponents, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, decided to stay in the race. Gingrich dropped out on May 2 after a disappointing showing in the Delaware primary that left his number of victories at 2 to Romney's 28. Paul, despite having only 1 victory to Romney's eventual 42 victories, did not end his campaign until after the 2012 republican national convention.\n\nSantorum and Gingrich released their delegates ahead of the convention to vote for Romney.\n\nAt the republican national convention, with support from many pledged and unpledged delegates, Romney won the nomination in a landslide. The convention chose Paul Ryan as Romney's running mate.\n\nOther candidates for nomination included Virgil Goode, Roseanne Barr, Rocky Anderson, and Tom Hoefling.\n\nFour other parties nominated candidates that had ballot access or write-in access to at least 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election to win the presidency through a majority of the electoral college.\n\n\n\n\nMany polls have been taken about the presidential election. Most polls show Obama beating Romney, aside from polls taken between the first and second presidential debates. In polls taken state-by-state, Obama usually wins states he won in 2008, and Republicans usually win states that McCain won in 2008. Indiana, North Carolina, and Nebraska's second congressional district are the main exceptions to the rule.\n\nPopular vote count is preliminary, and does not include all precincts.\n\nWhen you read \"Consensus\", it means that many news programs have said they believe Obama/Romney will win a particular state. A projection is when someone expresses their belief of something, in this case about the outcome of the election. An EV is an Electoral vote, from the Electoral college.\n\nNote: Florida was not called until November 10 due to an extremely close race.\n", "id": "245824", "title": "United States presidential election, 2012"}

The aims are achieved through the organized efforts and informed choices of society, public and private organizations, communities and individuals. \n\nIt bases on health analysis of a handful of people or all the inhabitants of several continents rather than on an individual. Public health includes such parts as epidemiology, biostatistics, health services, environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health. \n\nPublic health intervention prevents rather than treats a disease through surveillance of cases and promotes healthy behaviors such as hand washing, vaccination programs and distribution of condoms. In outbreaks of an infectious disease, treating a disease may be vital to preventing it in others. \n\nMost countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in the developing world and in developed countries, through local health systems and through international non-governmental organizations. In the developing world, there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide a basic level of medical care and disease prevention. \n\nPublic health has roots in antiquity. From the beginning, human civilization recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases. Early religions attempted to regulate behavior related to health, from types of food eaten, to behaviors, such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations. Governments placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programs in order to gain some understanding of the causes of disease, ensure social stability prosperity, and maintain order. \n\nThe Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. The practice of vaccination did not become prevalent until the 1820s. During the 14th century Black Death in Europe, burning parts of cities resulted in benefit, since it destroyed the rodent infestations. The development of quarantine in the medieval period restricted effects of other infectious diseases. \n\nLater they started build of sewers, the regular collection of garbage, incineration or disposal, providing clean water and draining standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitos. The industrial revolution initially caused the spread of disease through large conurbations around workhouses and factories. \n\nThe increase in average life span in the 20th century is credited to public health achievements, such as vaccination programs and control of infectious diseases, effective safety policies of motor-vehicle and occupational safety, improved family planning, chlorination of drinking water, smoke-free measures, and programs on decreasing chronic disease such as cancer, heart disease and more physical exercise.\n\nSometimes, the developing world is plagued by largely preventable infectious diseases, due to malnutrition and poverty. The focus of public health has moved from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality, poverty, and education. There is recognition that our health is affected by where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships. \n\nSchools of public health offer: \n\nMost governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. In recent years, public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of smallpox. \n\nAn important public health issues facing the world currently are HIV/AIDS, antibiotic resistance, leading to the re-emergence of diseases such as Tuberculosis, diabetes. As non-communicable diseases caused by smoking have been threatening public health, public health started controlling smoking. The global health system needs to find a way to even out communicable and non communicable diseases. Many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. \n\n", "id": "245876", "title": "Public health"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245908", "text": "Epidemiology\n\nEpidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of populations. It aims to act in the interest of public health and preventive medicine. It also important in public health research. It identifies risk factors for disease and suggests best treatment methods in clinical practice. \n\nEpidemiologists start from outbreak investigation to study design, data collection and analysis. They use statistical models to test hypotheses and they document results. Epidemiologists also study the interaction of diseases in a population. Epidemiologists use biology (to better understand disease processes), statistics (to design and understand good studies), computers (to store data and map disease patterns) and social science disciplines, to understand \"big picture\" causes.\n\nEpidemiology means \"the study of what is upon the people\". The word derived from the Greek terms \"epi\" = upon, among; \"demos\" = people, district; \"logos\" = study, word, discourse. It applies only to human populations. But the term is used in studies of zoological populations 'epizoology', and plant populations.\n\nHippocrates was the first who has looked at the relationships between disease and environmental influences. He drew the distinction between 'epidemic' and 'endemic': diseases that are 'visited upon' a population (epidemic) as contrasted with those that 'live within' a population (endemic). \n\nThe Persian physician Avicenna in the 1020s, discovered the contagious nature of tuberculosis and sexually transmitted disease. He noted the distribution of disease through water and soil. Avicenna said that bodily secretion is contaminated by foul foreign earthly bodies before being infected. He introduced the method of quarantine to limit the spread of contagious disease. \n\nThe Black Death (bubonic plague) reached Al Andalus in the 14th century. Ibn Khatima thought infectious diseases were caused by \"minute bodies\" which enter the human body and cause disease. Another Andalusian-Arabian physician, Ibn al-Khatib (1313–1374) in his treatise \"On the Plague\" stated how infectious disease can be transmitted through bodily contact and \"through garments, vessels and earrings\". Girolamo Fracastoro from Verona suggested these very small, unseeable, particles that cause disease were alive. They were able to spread by air, and multiply. They could be destroyed by fire. He refuted Galen's miasma theory (poison gas in sick people). In 1543, Fracastoro's book \"De contagione et contagiosis morbis\" suggested personal and environmental hygiene to prevent disease. The development of a sufficiently powerful microscope by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1675 provided visual evidence of living particles consistent with a germ theory of disease.\n\nIn 1662 John Graunt analysed the mortality rolls in London before the Great Plague. This gave statistical evidence for and against various theories of disease. Dr. John Snow investigated the causes of the 19th Century Cholera epidemics. He noticed the significantly higher death rates in two areas supplied by Southwark Water Company. He showed the Broad Street pump was the origin of the Soho epidemic, a classic example of epidemiology He used chlorine in an attempt to clean the water and had the pump handle removed. This stopped the outbreak. It was a major event in the history of public health, and the founding event of the science of epidemiology.\n\nThe term 'epidemiology' was first used in 1802 by the Spanish physician Villalba. The term is used now for the description and causation of epidemic diseases, and of disease in general. It can be used for many non-disease health-related conditions, such as high blood pressure and obesity.\n\nIn 1847 Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis brought down infant mortality at a Vienna hospital by disinfection. Unfortunately, disinfection did not become widely practiced until British surgeon Joseph Lister 'discovered' antiseptics in 1865 after Louis Pasteur's work. In the early 20th century, mathematical methods were introduced into epidemiology by Ronald Ross and others. In 1954 came the results of a study led by Richard Doll. This gave very strong statistical support to the suspicion that tobacco smoking was linked to lung cancer.\n\nMany epidemiologists are physicians, or hold appropriate graduate degrees. Some epidemiologists work in the community, commonly in a public health/health protection service. They are at the forefront of investigating and combating disease outbreaks. Others work for non-profit organizations, universities, hospitals and larger government entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Protection Agency, The World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nEpidemiological studies are aimed, where possible, at revealing unbiased relationships between exposures such as alcohol or smoking, biological agents, stress, or chemicals to mortality or morbidity.\n\nEpidemiological studies only prove an agent could have caused disease in a population. It does not prove that it did cause an effect in any particular case. \n\nAs a public health discipline, epidemiologic evidence is often used to advocate personal measures like diet change and corporate measures like removal of junk food advertising. Study findings go to the general public to help people to make informed decisions about their health. \n\nOften the uncertainties are not communicated well. News articles often report the latest result of one study with little mention of its limitations or context. Epidemiological tools have proved effective in establishing major causes of diseases like cholera and lung cancer. They have problems with more subtle health issues. Several recent epidemiological results on, for example, the effects of hormone replacement therapy) have been refuted by later randomized controlled trials.\n\nEpidemiological practice and the results of epidemiological analysis make a significant contribution to health management\n\nModern population-based health management is complex. Epidemiological practice and analysis is a core component. This task requires the forward looking ability to guide how a health system responds to current health issues, and how a health system can respond to future potential population health issues.\n\n", "id": "245908", "title": "Epidemiology"}

Such devices often have a bag or bag attachment. The ‘poop bag’ is usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. The person performing the cleanup might also be called a pooper-scooper.\n\nA number of places, including New York City, have laws telling pet owners to clean up after their pets after the pet has pooped on a sidewalk or any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public. Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care & Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets.\n\nPet droppings contaminate the environment with bacteria, parasites and stench. The droppings are one of the leading sources of \"E. coli\" (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution: one gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 \"E. coli\" cells. Coliform bacteria and \"E. coli\" are commonly-used field indicators of fecal contamination by animals (including human). Pet droppings contain eggs of Toxocara canis and Neospora caninum parasitic worms. In adult dogs infection with T.canis usually asymptomatic but can be fatal in puppies.T. canis can cause parasitic worm infection and rarely blindness in humans. N.caninum causes severe losses in livestock breeding. While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area creates serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creates health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in Germany, where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs.\n", "id": "245932", "title": "Pooper-scooper"}

The general idea, however, is that something is metastable if it is not changing, yet given a small force (\"nudge\") it will transition to another, more stable state. \n\nFor example, a block is sitting on a slope (an \"inclined plane\"). It keeps sitting there until it is nudged, or the slope is gently struck, setting up vibrations. Then the block starts to slide. At that point it keeps sliding until it reaches the bottom. The block sitting at the bottom is stable. The block sitting on the slope but not moving is metastable. And the block as it is moving is unstable. \n\nA real life example of this is an avalanche of snow. The avalanche is unstable (the snow is sliding down the mountainside). When the avalanche is over the snow is stable. Before the avalanche starts, the snow is metastable, since some small perturbation is enough to cause it to lose what might have seemed to be stability, but in fact was only metastability.\n", "id": "245949", "title": "Metastability"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245986", "text": "Planck constant\n\nThe Planck constant (Planck's constant) links the amount of energy a photon carries with the frequency of its electromagnetic wave. It is named after the physicist Max Planck. It is an important quantity in quantum physics.\n\nThe Planck constant has dimensions of physical action: energy multiplied by time, or momentum multiplied by distance. In SI units, the Planck constant is expressed in joule seconds (J⋅s) or (N⋅m⋅s) or (kg⋅m⋅s).\nThe symbols are defined here.\n\nIn SI Units the Planck constant is about J·s. Scientists have used this quantity to calculate measurements like the Planck length and the Planck time.\n\nBetween 1670 and 1900 scientists discussed the nature of light. Some scientists believed that light consisted of many millions of tiny particles. Other scientists believed that light was a wave.\n\nIn 1678 Christiaan Huygens wrote the book \"Traité de la lumiere\" (\"Treatise on light\"). He believed that light was made up of waves. He said that light could not be made up of particles because light from two beams do not bounce off each other.\nIn 1672 Isaac Newton wrote the book \"Opticks\". He believed that light was made up of red, yellow and blue particles which he called corpusles. Newton explained this by his \"two prism experiment\". The first prism broke light up into different colours. The second prism merged these colours back into white light.\n\nDuring the 18th century Newton's theory was given the most attention. In 1803 Thomas Young described the \"double-slit experiment\". In this experiment light from two narrow slits interfere with each other. This caused a pattern which showed that light was made up of waves. For the rest of the nineteenth century wave theory of light was given the most attention. In the 1860s James Clerk Maxwell developed equations that described electromagnetic radiation as waves.\n\nThe theory of electromagnetic radiation treats light, radio waves, microwaves and many other types of wave as the same thing except that they have different wavelengths. The wavelength of light is between 400 and 600 nm, the wavelength of radio waves varies from 10 m to 1500 m and the wavelength of microwaves is about 2 cm. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is given by:\n\nThe symbols are defined here.\n\nAll hot bodies give off radiant heat. Radiant heat is electromagnetic radiation. Normally this radiation is in the infra-red range, but if the body is very hot (1000 °C or more), it is in the visible range. In the late 1800's many scientists studied wavelength of electromagnetic radiation from black-body radiators at different temperatures.\n\nLord Rayleigh first published the basics of the Rayleigh-Jeans law in 1900. The theory was based on the Kinetic theory of gasses. Sir James Jeans published a more complete theory in 1905. The law relates the quantity and wavelength of electromagnetic energy given off by a black body radiator at different temperatures. The equation describing this is: \n\nFor long-wavelength radiation, the results predicted by this equation corresponded well with practical results obtained in a laboratory. However, for short wavelengths (ultraviolet light) the difference between theory and practice were so large that it earned the nickname \"the ultra-violet catastrophe\".\n\nin 1895 Wien published the results of his studies into the radiation from a black body. His formula was:\n\nThis formula worked well for short wavelength electromagnetic radiation, but did not work well with long wavelengths.\n\nIn 1900 Max Planck published the results of his studies. He tried to develop an expression for black-body radiation expressed in terms of wavelength by assuming that radiation consisted of small quanta and then to see what happened if the quanta were made infinitely small. (This is a standard mathematical approach). The expression was:\n\nIf the wavelength of light is allowed to become very large, then it can be shown that the Raleigh-Jeans and the Planck relationships are almost identical.\n\nHe calculated \"h\" and \"k\" and found that\n\nThe values are close to the modern day accepted values of and respectively. The Planck law agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance was only appreciated several years later.\n\nIt turns out that electrons are dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches a threshold frequency. Below this no electrons can be emitted from the metal. In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper explaining the effect. Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy. Einstein said that the effect was due to a photon striking an electron. This demonstrated the particle nature of light.\n\nEinstein also found that there electromagnetic radiation with a long wavelength had no effect. Einstein said that this was because the \"particles\" did not have enough energy to disturb the electrons.\n\nEinstein realized that the energy of each photon was related to the photon frequency by the Planck constant. This could be written mathematically as:\n\nIn 1921 Einstein received the Nobel Prize for linking the Planck constant to the photoelectric effect.\n\nThe Planck constant is of importance in many applications. A few are listed below.\nIn 1913 Niels Bohr published the Bohr model of the structure of an atom. Bohr said that the angular momentum of the electrons going around the nucleus can only have certain values. These values are given by the equation\n\nwhere\n\nThe Bohr model of the atom can be used to calculate the energy of electrons at each level. Electrons will normally fill up the lowest numbered states of an atom. If the atom receives energy from, for example, an electric current, electrons will be excited into a higher state. The electron will then drop back to a lower state and will loose their extra energy by giving off a photon. Because the energy levels have specific values, the photons will have specific energy levels. Light emitted in this way can be split into different colours using a prism. Each element has its own pattern. The pattern for neon is shown alongside.\n\nIn 1927 Werner Heisenberg published the uncertainty principle. The principle states that it is not possible to make a measurement without disturbing the thing being measured. It also puts a limit on the minimum disturbance caused by making a measurement.\n\nIn the macroscopic world these disturbances make very little difference. For example, if the temperature of a flask of liquid is measured, the thermometer will absorb a small amount of energy as it heats up. This will cause a small error in the final reading, but this error is small and not important.\n\nIn quantum mechanics things are different. Some measurements are made by looking at the pattern of scattered photons. One such example is Compton scattering. If both the position and momentum of a particle is being measured, the uncertainty principle states that there is a trade-off between the accuracy with which the momentum is measured and the accuracy with which the position is measured. The equation that describes this trade-off is: \nwhere\n\nIn the electric circuit shown on the right, the voltage drop across the light emitting diode (LED) depends on the material of the LED. For silicon diodes the drop is 0.6 V. However for LEDs it is between 1.8 V and 2.7 V. This information enables a user to calculate the Planck constant.\n\nThe energy needed for one electron to jump the potential barrier in the LED material is given by \nwhere\n\nWhen the electron decays back again, it emits one photon of light. The energy of the photon is given by\nthe same equation used in the photoelectric effect. If these equations are combined, the wavelength of light and the voltage are related by\n\nThe table below can be calculated from this relationship.\n\nSince its discovery, measurements of h have become much better. Planck first quoted the value of h to be erg·sec. This value is within 5% of the current value.\n\nAs of 3 March 2014, the best measurements of h in SI units is  J·s. The equivalent figure in cgs units is  erg·sec. The is relative uncertainty of h is .\n\nThe reduced Planck constant (ħ) is a value that is sometimes used in quantum mechanics. It is defined by\n\nPlanck units are sometimes used in quantum mechanics instead of SI. In this system the reduced Planck constant has a value of 1, so the value of the Planck constant is 2π.\nPlancks constant can now be measured with very high precision. This has caused the BIPM to consider a new definition for the kilogram. They have proposed that the international prototype kilogram is no longer used to define the kilogram. Instead the BIPM will define the Planck constant to have an exact value. Scientists will use this value and the definitions of the metre and the second to define the kilogram.\n\n", "id": "245986", "title": "Planck constant"}

It influences the architecture, food, music, and overall \"feel\" of the restaurant. The food usually takes a backseat to the presentation of the theme. These restaurants generally attract customers only because of the theme itself.\n\nOne example is the \"Rainforest Cafe\" restaurants which have the obvious theme of a \"Tropical Rainforest\". \"Medieval Times\" has its theme of \"Medieval Europe\". The \"Jekyll & Hyde Club\" has an atmosphere of Jack the Ripper and Victorian horror novels. One strange but famous theme restaurant in Berlin, Germany is called \"das Klo\" (German for \"The toilet\"). It shows the insides of a toilet.\n\nMany people consider the Rainforest Cafe to be biggest example of a theme restaurant. They also consider it the restaurant which kicked off the theme restaurant trend. Theme restaurants may be experiencing a decline in popularity, given the closings of several Planet Hollywood, Jekyll & Hyde Club, and Wilderness Cafe locations in recent years. Theme restaurants often depend on tourist business, since the theme soon becomes stale to locals. The focus is not necessarily placed on good food and service. Certain tourist destinations such as the Mall of America or Orlando, Florida have better chances of supporting theme restaurants. Theme restaurants are generally common at theme parks, such as Universal Studios.\n\n", "id": "245992", "title": "Theme restaurant"}

Before being bought by Henderson Private Equity in December 2006, John Laing plc was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was part of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nThe business started in 1848. James Laing (born in 1816), along with his wife Ann Graham, and some employees whom they had hired, built a house on a plot of land that they had bought for £30 in Cumberland. The £150 proceeds from the first house financed the building of the next two houses on the same plot of land. One of these houses was kept by the Laing Family to live in. The family and the business later moved near Carlisle.\n\nWhen James Laing died in 1882, his son, John Laing (born in 1842) took over the running of the company. John began to take larger contracts but kept the business in the Carlisle area.\n\nJohn's son, John William Laing, (born in 1879) was working for the business before he was 20 years old, and so it became John Laing and Son. By 1910, John William Laing was running the business. More employees were recruited and larger projects were undertaken, including factory construction.\n\nIn 1920 the firm became a limited company, and two years later moved its headquarters from Carlisle to a thirteen acre (5 ha) site at Mill Hill in north-west London.\n\nWilliam Kirby Laing and John Maurice Laing, the fifth generation of the founding family, joined the company in 1950.\n\nJohn Laing & Sons (Holdings) Ltd was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1952. The family and its trusts and charities held the majority of the shares. John William Laing became the chairman, and his sons became joint managing directors. By this time, the number of employees was around 10,000, and every site had a quality supervisor. John William Laing retired in 1957.\n\nUnder William Kirby Laing and James Maurice Laing, the company continued to expand. They gained contracts for power stations. They also worked on road construction while continuing to build houses. In 1985, Martin Laing, of the sixth generation of the founding family, became chairman.\n\nMartin Laing determined that the company should begin to diversify. Home construction in the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Spain, and California was now one of the major sources of the company's growth.\n\nAs the company celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1998, it faced falling profits caused by cost overruns on the Millennium project and continuing problems within its construction division, related to competition and overcapacity.\n\nIn 1999 John Laing plc purchased a controlling interest in the Chiltern Rail franchise and by 2002 had structured itself into two main divisions, namely Homes and Investments. It underwent yet another change when Sir Martin Laing retired in early 2002. Bill Forrester took over as executive chairman. For the first time in its history Laing did not have a member of the founding family at the head of the company.\n\nThe business expanded rapidly in the late 1990s, such that for the year ended 31 December 2001 its turnover was in excess of £1 billion. Following significant losses on certain construction contracts it adopted a new policy of having the PPP / PFI businesses, in which it had been quite successful, as core activities. As a consequence it disposed of its construction division, which was sold to O'Rourke in 2001, its property developments divisions, which were sold to Kier Group, and its house building arm which was sold to George Wimpey in 2002.\n\nIn December 2006 John Laing plc was acquired by the Private Equity arm of Henderson Group.\n\nThe Laing Rail division - operators of Chiltern Railways and London Overground (with MTR Corporation), and holders of a stake in the open-access railway operator Wrexham & Shropshire - was put up for sale by in September 2007. The division was purchased by German rail operator Deutsche Bahn in January 2008, subject to approval by authorities.\n\nIn June 2008 John Laing formed a consortium with Hitachi and Barclays Private Equity called Agility Trains to bid for the contract to design, manufacture, and maintain a fleet of long-distance trains for the Intercity Express Programme. The bid was successful and the contract was awarded to the consortium on the 12 February 2009.\n\nJohn Laing now has operations in the UK, North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nJohn Laing’s former construction division, Laing Construction, undertook a number of landmark projects including:\n\nThe M1 motorway completed in 1959, Coventry Cathedral completed in 1962, Clifton Cathedral completed in 1973, the Sizewell B nuclear power station completed in 1995, the Second Severn Crossing completed in 1996, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff completed in 1999 and Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital completed in 2001.\nThe subsidiary Laing Rail owned and operated Chiltern Railways and was joint operator of London Overground (with MTR Corporation) and Wrexham & Shropshire (with Renaissance Trains). In 2008 Laing Rail was sold to Deutsche Bahn.\n\n", "id": "245994", "title": "John Laing plc"}

He made his debut for the Denmark national team in March 2010, and was the youngest player of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.\n\nIn 2011, Eriksen was named Danish Football Player of the Year, Dutch Football Talent of the Year, Ajax Talent of the Year (Marco van Basten Award), and made the UEFA Euro U-21 Team of the Tournament. He won the Eredivisie with Ajax in 2010–11, 2011–12, and in 2012–13 before signing with Tottenham Hotspur in August 2013. He won the Tottenham Hotspur Player of the Year award for the 2013–14 season and in 2015, he won the Danish Football Player of the Year award for the second year in a row.\n\nEriksen started playing football in his hometown Middelfart before his third birthday. In 2005 he switched to Odense Boldklub, who competed in the Danish youth championships. His team lost the semi-final against Brøndby IF, but afterwards he was named \"Best Technical Player\" of the tournament. The following year OB won the tournament, when Eriksen scored the only goal in the final. After some good performances for OB's U-16 team and later on U-19 team and the Danish U-17 team, major European football clubs including Chelsea and Barcelona began to take notice. The player had trials with Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Milan, but finally decided to move to Ajax, stating \"\"My first step should not be too big. I knew that playing in the Netherlands would be very good for my development. Then Ajax arrived and that was a fantastic option\"\".\n\nOn 17 October 2008 it was announced that Eriksen had signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Amsterdam-based Ajax. The transfer fee received by OB was estimated at €1 million (£847,199). He worked his way through the youth teams, and was promoted to the first team squad in January 2010, where he was given the number 51 shirt. Within the month, he made his first team debut for the Dutch team in the Eredivisie on 17 January 2010 against NAC Breda. Ajax manager Martin Jol compared him to the likes of Ajax youth products Wesley Sneijder and Rafael van der Vaart and described him as a good reader of the game in the traditional \"number 10\" role like the two Dutch internationals and Danish legend Michael Laudrup, who also played for Ajax.\nOn 25 March 2010 he scored his first goal for Ajax in a 6–0 win against opponent Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Cup. On 10 April 2010, Eriksen extended his contract with Ajax until the summer of 2014, stating \"\"I can still learn a lot here, I'm not finished yet and I hope I can mean a lot for the club.\"\" On 6 May 2010, Eriksen played in the second match of the final of the 2009–10 Dutch Cup as Ajax beat Feyenoord 1–4, with 1–6 on aggregate. At the end of his first professional season at Ajax, Eriksen had played 21 competitive matches, scoring one goal, and had made his international debut for Denmark. For his second season in the first team of Ajax, Eriksen was given the number 8 shirt.\n\nEriksen started the 2010–11 season well, scoring his first Ajax league goal on 29 August 2010 in an away victory over De Graafschap. On 11 November 2010, Eriksen scored his first goal at the Amsterdam ArenA a 3–0 Cup victory over BV Veendam. In December, Eriksen was named Danish \"Talent of the Year\". Several days after receiving this award, Eriksen once again proved his value to Ajax by scoring the only goal in a 0–1 away league victory over Vitesse. On 17 February 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in a European tournament, the Ajax goal to 2–0, when Ajax beat Anderlecht 3–0 in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. On 13 March 2011, Eriksen scored a solo goal, running from the half way line to finish it off with a strike to secure a 3–1 win over Willem II.\nDuring the rest of the season, Eriksen became more and more important for Ajax, due to his growing capabilities as the team's playmaker, providing many assists. After a good season during which he developed himself into an undisputed starter in the side that won the 2010–11 Eredivisie (Ajax's first Eredivisie title in seven years), he was named Ajax's Talent of the Year. On 23 May 2011 he was named Dutch Football Talent of the Year, the second Danish player to win the award since Jon Dahl Tomasson in 1996. He was elected by a jury under command of Holland's all-time best player Johan Cruyff. \"\"He's a player I really like with all my heart,\"\" Cruyff praised Eriksen. \"\"This prize is just the beginning, a stimulus to get the maximum out of his career. The talent is there, the recognition also; now it is up to the player himself. He is a typical product of the Danish school. You can compare him with Brian and Michael Laudrup. Only time will tell if Eriksen can reach the same level as them.\"\".\n\nOn 18 October 2011, Eriksen scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League when Ajax beat Dinamo Zagreb 2–0 in the group stage, making him the 2nd youngest player to score in the 2011–12 season. In the second match versus Dinamo Zagreb on 2 November he provided assists to Gregory van der Wiel and Siem de Jong as well as being involved with the third goal, as Ajax cruised to a 4–0 victory. He was named Danish Football Player of the Year on 7 November after helping Ajax win the Eredivisie the previous year and guiding the national team to a successful Euro 2012 qualification campaign, after receiving the award Eriksen said, \"\"I am extremely honoured to be standing here tonight. I did not expect it, it really means a lot to me. I would like to thank my team-mates in the national team as well as my team-mates at Ajax\"\". Following the success of Eriksen's third consecutive Eredivisie title in the 2012–13 season, he opted not to renew his contract with Ajax, and with one year still remaining on his current contract he was permitted to search for a new club. Having come to terms with Tottenham Hotspur in England, Eriksen left Ajax having appeared in 113 league matches, scoring 25 goals and 41 assists. He played in 16 matches for the KNVB Cup, scoring four goals and making four assists. He made 30 appearances on the continental stage for Ajax, scoring three goals, and making 9 assists all together. Having also competed in the Johan Cruijff Shield three years in a row.\n\nOn 30 August 2013, Tottenham Hotspur announced that they had completed the transfer of Eriksen from Ajax, in a deal believed to be worth £11 million (€13.5 million), after Eriksen passed a medical at the club. Eriksen joined the club on the same day as Erik Lamela, who joined from Roma, and Vlad Chiricheș, who joined from Steaua București, and took the club's total spending for the 2013 summer transfer window to £109.5 million.\n\nOn 14 September 2013, he made his Premier League debut against Norwich City, providing an assist for Gylfi Sigurðsson. \"Spurs\" manager André Villas-Boas commented: \"\"It was a great debut for Christian, he is a pure number 10, a creative player and his individual quality made all the difference.\"\"\n\nOn 19 September 2013, Eriksen \"clipped a wonderful dipping shot\" over the goalkeeper to score his first Tottenham goal and complete a 3–0 win over Tromsø IL in the Europa League. He added to his Tottenham goal tally with a goal from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day 2013, and the second goal in \"Spurs\"' 2–1 win against Manchester United on 1 January 2014. On 23 March, after goals from Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana had given Southampton a 2–0 lead against Tottenham at White Hart Lane, Eriksen scored twice to level the score and assisted Gylfi Sigurðsson to score the winning goal.\n\nOn 12 April 2014, he scored a stoppage-time equalizer as \"Spurs\" came from 3–0 down to draw 3–3 at West Bromwich Albion. By the end of the season, Eriksen had scored 7 goals in the Premier League.\n\nThroughout the 2014/15 campaign, Eriksen played an integral part in many Spurs victories. The Danish international had a habit of scoring late winners, most notably against Swansea City, Sunderland, Hull City and many others.\n\nOn 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.\n\nOn 28 January 2015, Eriksen completed his greatest performance of the campaign in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Sheffield United to send Tottenham into the League Cup Final. His first goal, a 30-yard curling free kick, was plauded by the likes of Michael Owen and Gary Neville among others on Twitter. Despite a late threat from the Blades, Eriksen then scored a second late-on to send Spurs to Wembley.\n\nEriksen completed the 2014/15 campaign having featured in every Premier League game for Mauricio Pochettino. The Dane became the third Spurs player to reach double figures in the league, alongside Nacer Chadli and Harry Kane, scoring 10 goals.\n\nOn 9 June 2015, Eriksen confirmed to Danish media whilst on international duty that he would stay at Tottenham for the foreseeable future. Eriksen was quoted as saying: \"I feel right at home at Tottenham and I haven't thought about leaving yet.\"\n\nEriksen was called up to the Denmark national under-17 football team in July 2007, and impressed in his debut for the team on 31 July. In 2008, he scored 9 goals in 16 games for the U-17s, and was named Danish \"U-17 Talent of the Year\" by the Danish FA. He was also one of four nominees for the 2008 Danish \"Talent of the Year\" award, which was won by Mathias Jørgensen. He played 27 games for the under-17 team until February 2009. He played a total of 8 games for the Denmark U-18 and Denmark U-19 teams during 2009. Eriksen was also called up for the Danish U-21 squad to the European championship in Denmark in 2011, the Danish team only participated in the group stage and Eriksen scored a goal against Belarus.\n\nHe received his first senior Denmark call-up in February 2010, making his debut in Denmark's friendly match against Austria in March, to become Denmark's fourth youngest full international, being the youngest debutant since Michael Laudrup.\n\nOn 28 May 2010, Denmark coach Morten Olsen announced that Eriksen would be part of the final squad of 23 participating in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He was the youngest player participating in the tournament. At the World Cup, Eriksen played two matches, against the Netherlands and Japan, but Denmark were unable to progress beyond the group stage.\n\nOn 9 February 2011, in a 1–2 friendly loss at home against England, Eriksen was named Man of the Match, and was praised for his performance by a number of prominent footballing figures, including Chelsea star Frank Lampard, Man Utd star Rio Ferdinand (on Twitter), manager Morten Olsen and several media experts in Denmark and England. On 4 June 2011 Eriksen scored his first national team goal, to give Denmark a 2–0 lead over Iceland in their Euro 2012 qualifier. In doing so, he became the youngest Danish player ever to score a goal in European qualification, being 9 days younger than Michael Laudrup when he scored his first goal in 1983.\n\nOn 10 January 2015, Eriksen was voted Danish Football Player of the Year twice in a row, making him the first player to do so since William Kvist.\n\nIn 2012, Eriksen signed a sponsorship kit deal with American sportswear and equipment supplier, Nike. He appeared in an advert for the new Nike Green Speed II alongside Raheem Sterling, Stephan El Shaarawy, Mario Götze, Eden Hazard and Theo Walcott in November 2012.\n\nChristian then transitioned from Nike's Mercurial range, to the more 'creative' orientated Magista.\n\n\n\n", "id": "245995", "title": "Christian Eriksen"}

His company, Foster and Partners, has an international design practice. He is the United Kingdom's biggest builder of landmark office buildings.\n\nHe is one of Britain's most prolific architects of his generation. In 1999, he was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize, often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the Arts category.\n\nEarly life in Manchester\n\nFoster was born to Robert Foster and Lilian Smith in 1935 in Reddish, Stockport, Cheshire. They moved, soon after his birth, two miles to 4 Crescent Grove in Levenshulme, Manchester, which they rented for fourteen shillings (70p) a week: Foster has no recollection of Reddish. Foster's parents were diligent, hard workers – so diligent that Foster, as an only child, felt their heavy workload restricted his relationship with them and he was often looked after by neighbours or other family members. He attended Burnage Grammar School for Boys in Burnage. In a \"Guardian\" interview in 1999, Foster said he always felt 'different' at school and was bullied and he retired into the world of books. He considered himself quiet and awkward in his early years often making faux pas.\n\nFoster described Manchester as \"one of the workshops of the world\" and \"the embodiment of a great city\", his father, Robert, worked at Metropolitan-Vickers, Trafford Park which fuelled Foster's interest in engineering and design. He was fascinated with engineering and the process of designing. He says that caused him to pursue a career designing buildings. Specific interests included aircraft, a hobby he maintains today; and trains, generated by viewing passing trains on the railway outside his terraced home during his childhood.\n\nHe left school at 16 and worked in the Manchester City Treasurer's office. Next, he joined the National Service in the Royal Air Force. After he was discharged, in 1956 Foster attended the University of Manchester's School of Architecture and City Planning. He graduated in 1961. Later, Foster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he earned his Master's degree Foster also met Richard Rogers at Yale. He then travelled in America for a year. He returned to the UK in 1963. Then he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams. This allowed them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.\n\nEducation\n\nFoster took a job as assistant to a contract manager with John Bearshaw and Partners, a local architectural practice.  The staff advised him, that if he wished to become an architect, he should prepare a portfolio of drawings using the perspective and shop drawings from Bearshaw's practice as an example. Bearshaw was so impressed with the drawings that he promoted the young Foster to the drawing department of the practice.\n\nIn 1956 Foster won a place at the University of Manchester School of Architecture and City Planning. Foster was not eligible for a maintenance grant so took up a number of part-time jobs to fund his studies, becoming an ice-cream salesman, night-club bouncer and working night shifts at a bakery to make crumpets. He combined these with self-tuition via visits to the local library in Levenshulme. Foster took a keen interest in the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer and graduated from Manchester in 1961.\n\nFoster won the Henry Fellowship to the Yale School of Architecture, where he met future business partner Richard Rogers and earned his master's degree. Vincent Scully encouraged Foster and Rogers to travel in America for a year. After returning to the UK in 1963 he set up an architectural practice as Team 4 with Rogers and the sisters Georgie and Wendy Cheesman. Georgie (later Wolton) was the only one of the team that had passed her RIBA exams allowing them to set up in practice on their own. Team 4 quickly earned a reputation for high-tech industrial design.\n\nAfter Team 4 went their separate ways, Foster and Wendy Cheesman founded Foster Associates, which later became Foster and Partners in 1967. A long period of collaboration with American architect Richard Buckminster Fuller began in 1968 and continued until Fuller's death in 1983. They collaborated on several projects that became catalysts in the development of an environmentally sensitive approach to design – including the Samuel Beckett Theatre project.\n\nOriginally they concentrated on industrial buildings. The turning point was the 1969 administrative and leisure center for Fred. Olsen Lines in London Docklands, where workers and managers are not separated any more. Foster and Partners' breakthrough building in the UK was the Willis Faber & Dumas headquarters in Ipswich, of 1974. The client was a family run insurance company which wanted to restore a sense of community to the workplace. Foster created open plan office floors long before open-plan became the norm. In a town not over-endowed with public facilities, the roof gardens, 25 metre swimming pool and gymnasium enhanced the quality of life for the company's 1200 employees. The building has a full-height glass façade moulded to the medieval street plan and contributes drama, subtly shifting from opaque, reflective black to a glowing backlit transparency as the sun sets. The design was inspired by the Daily Express Building in Manchester a work Foster admired in his youth. The building is now Grade I* listed.\n\nThe Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, an art gallery and museum on the campus of the University of East Anglia, Norwich, was one of the first major public buildings to be designed by Foster, completed in 1978, and became grade II* listed in December 2012. In 1990 Foster's design for the Terminal Building at London Stansted Airport was awarded the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award.\n\nFoster gained a reputation for designing office buildings. In the 1980s he designed the HSBC Main Building in Hong Kong for HSBC. The building is marked by its high level of light transparency, as all 3500 workers have a view to Victoria Peak or Victoria Harbour. Foster said that if the firm had not won the contract it would probably have been bankrupted. Foster believes that attracting young talent is essential, and is proud that the average age of people working for Foster and Partners is 32, just like it was in 1967.\n\nToday, Foster + Partners works with its engineers to use computer systems. They pay attention to basic physical laws such as convection. They have created efficient buildings like the Swiss Re London headquarters in London. The walls let in air for passive cooling and then let it out as it warms and rises.\n\nFoster's earlier designs reflected a sophisticated, machine-influenced high-tech vision. His style has evolved into a more sharp-edged modernity. In 2004, Foster designed the tallest bridge in the world, the Millau Viaduct in Southern France, with the Millau Mayor Jacques Godfrain stating; \"The architect, Norman Foster, gave us a model of art.\"\n\nIn January 2007, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Foster had called in Catalyst, a corporate finance house, to find buyers for Foster + Partners. Foster does not want to retire, but wants to sell his 80-90% holding in the company valued at £300M to £500M.\n\nFoster is a member of the board of Trustees for the architectural charity Article 25. They design, construct and manage safe, sustainable buildings in dangerous parts of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.\nThe reason for his wealth is he receives 15% of the building cost.\n\nIn 2007, he worked with Philippe Starck and Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group for the Virgin Galactic plans.\n\nFoster designed the Apple Campus in Cupertino and is currently designing most of their Apple stores. He is also designing Bloomberg's headquarters in London. He also recently designed the Monaco Yacht club and the McLaren technology centre. \n\nFoster currently sits on the Board of Trustees at architectural charity Article 25 who design, construct and manage innovative, safe, sustainable buildings in some of the most inhospitable and unstable regions of the world. He has also been on the Board of Trustees of the Architecture Foundation.\n\nHe has recently set up the Norman Foster Foundation which promotes interdisciplinary thinking and research to help new generations of architects, designers and urbanists to anticipate the future. \n\nFoster recently set up his personal Instagram account under the username @officialnormanfoster where he publishes photos of his everyday life\n\nFoster was knighted in 1990 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1997. In 1999, he was created a life peer, as Baron Foster of Thames Bank, of Reddish in the County of Greater Manchester. He is a Crossbencher.\n\nNorman Foster is the second British architect to win the Stirling Prize twice: the first for the American Air Museum at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 1998, and the second for 30 St Mary Axe in 2004.\n\nFoster was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999.\n\nHe is also a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal, the Society's highest award. In Germany Lord Foster received the Order Pour le Mérite.\n\nMost recently, in September 2007, Foster was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture, the largest architectural award in the world, for the University of Technology Petronas, in Malaysia.\n\nIt was announced in January 2008 that Foster was to be awarded an honorary degree from the Dundee School of Architecture at the University of Dundee. In 2009 Foster was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award in the category \"Arts\".\n\nIn 2012, Foster was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork – the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover – to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\n\nIn 2017, he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London for his contribution to contemporary architecture. \n\nFoster married business partner Wendy Cheesman. She died in 1989, leaving him with four sons. He next married Indian-born Begum Sabiha Rumani Malik. Sabiha was married to Andrew Knight when she and Foster met. Knight was Chairman of News International. Foster and Sabiha divorced in 1998. Foster is now married to Elena Ochoa, Chairman of the Tate International Council, and founder of Ivory Press. He has five children and three grandchildren.\n\nFoster flies his own private jet and helicopter between his homes in London, France, Switzerland, Marthas Vineyard, New York and Madrid.\n\nFoster has established an extremely prolific career in the span of four decades. The following are some of his major constructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoster's other design work has included the Nomos desk system for Italian manufacturer Tecno, and the motor yacht \"Izanami\" (later \"Ronin\") for Lürssen Yachts.\n\n\n", "id": "246001", "title": "Norman Foster (architect)"}

He is known for innovative use of engineering and materials in public monuments and sculptures. He heads the Heatherwick Studio, which he founded in 1994.\n\nBorn in London, he studied three dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic and at the Royal College of Art, winning several prizes. Shortly after graduating from the Royal College of Art after a two-year furniture MA course in 1994, he was commissioned by Harvey Nichols department store in Knightsbridge to design a temporary structure for the shop's facade. His design was a ribbon of laminated wood that wound through the storefront windows. The design was widely acclaimed and won him a D&AD yellow pencil (the gold award) in 1997.\n\nHe founded Thomas Heatherwick Studio (now called just Heatherwick Studio) in 1994. His aim was \"to bring architecture, design and sculpture together within a single practice\". Originally based at Camden Mews, the studio moved to larger premises in Kings Cross in 2000. It presently comprises a thirty-strong team which includes architects, landscape architects, designers and engineers. Work is carried out from a combined studio and workshop where concept development, detailing, prototyping and small scale fabrication take place. The studio's work spans commercial and residential building projects, masterplanning and infrastructure schemes as well as high profile works of public art. \nHeatherwick is a Senior Fellow and external examiner at the Royal College of Art. He is a fellow of the Royal Academy and was recently chosen to become a Royal Designer for Industry. He has served on numerous judging and advisory panels and has given talks at various institutions including the RIBA, Bartlett School of Architecture, the South Africa Design Indaba conference and the Royal Academy. \n\nIn 2004 he curated an exhibition at the Design Museum consisting of 1,000 'every day' design objects that he had collected.\n\nThe \"B of the Bang\" was a £1.42 million 56m-high sculpture of 180 giant spikes, erected outside the City of Manchester Stadium to celebrate the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Safety problems happened soon after it was completed in 2004 when one spike came apart. Eventually 22 more were removed as a safety measure. The object was rewelded and fenced off. It continued to cause concern and debate over its future. Finally Manchester City Council took legal action against Heatherwick studio and their subcontractors, who in November 2008 agreed to pay £1.7 million in damages. The installation was removed in 2009.\n\nThe 'East Beach Café' is a building on Littlehampton Sea Front, West Sussex, UK created by Heatherwick. Commissioned in 2005, the large steel structure houses a Café by daytime and restaurant in the evening. The concept allowed the steel to rust and the colours to develop over time before being fixed in a transparent oil. It won the 2008 RIBA Award in the South East region.\n\n\nThomas Heatherwick was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Arts by Manchester Metropolitan University - his alma mater - on July 21, 2007. It is in recognition of his design work across a broad spectrum of architecture, engineering and public art, achieving national and international acclaim for his innovative use of materials, his eclectic range of projects, and the resolution of them in new and exciting ways.\n\n", "id": "246019", "title": "Thomas Heatherwick"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246022", "text": "Louver\n\nA louver (American English) or louvre (British English), from the French \"l'ouvert\"; \"the open one\") is a window, blind or shutter with horizontal or, less often, vertical slats. They are angled to allow light and air in. They also keep out rain, direct sunshine, and noise. The angle of the slats may be adjusted.\n\nLouvers come from the Middle Ages as lantern-like constructions in wood that were fitted on top of roof holes. They were put in large kitchens to allow ventilation while keeping out rain and snow. They were originally rather rough constructions consisting only of a barrel. Later they became more elaborate designs made of pottery. They took the shape of faces where the smoke and steam from cooking would pour out through the eyes and mouth. They also became more like modern louvers, with slats that could be opened or closed by pulling on a string.\n\nMore modern louver windows are made of slats of glass, opened and closed with a metal lever. They may also be shutters of wood, plastic or other material.\n\nSome modern louver systems serve to improve indoor daylighting. Fixed mirrored louver systems can limit glare and of redirect diffuse light. Such louvers may be put in between two panes of double glazing.\n\nLouvers are rarely seen as primary design elements in the language of modern architecture. They are rather simply a technical device. However, there are examples of architects who use them as part of the overall aesthetic effect of their buildings. The most well-known example is Finnish modernist architect Alvar Aalto who would create aesthetic effects in the facades of his buildings through the combination of different types and sizes of louvers. Some are fixed and some are moveable. They are made mostly from wood (e.g. the various buildings of the Helsinki University of Technology). A second example, taking influence from Aalto, is the second-generation modernist architect Juha Leiviskä. \n\nAdditionally, louvers are used as semi-passive means of thermal control on spacecraft. They are also available as an accessory for some automobiles.\n\n", "id": "246022", "title": "Louver"}

In the final 18 TV episodes, the writers showed the fate of the remaining survivors, and explained the powers which the Island held in their lives. The sixth-season premiere was the first to climb in the ratings year-over-year since the second season, drawing 12.1 million viewers. The series finale aired on May 23, 2010. The final episode ran 2.5 hours starting at 9/8 CDT, pushing the late-night news back a half-hour. It was followed by the previously announced post-finale special, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live: Aloha to Lost\", at 12:05 a.m. (11:05 CDT). The season continued the stories of the survivors of the fictional September 22, 2004 crash of Oceanic Airlines Flight 815, on an unknown island in the South Pacific. The survivors must deal with two outcomes of the explosion of a nuclear bomb on the island in the 1970s. While the on-island story continues, a set of \"flash sideways\" scenes show a second timeline, in which Flight 815 never crashes. The season is scheduled to be released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 24, 2010, alongside a complete series boxset.\nFor a summary of the final season's storyline, see below: \"\"Season 6 plot summary\"\".\n\nOn May 7, 2007, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that \"Lost\" would end during the 2009–2010 season with a \"highly anticipated and shocking finale\". \"We felt that this was the only way to give \"Lost\" a proper creative conclusion,\" McPherson said. Beginning with the 2007–2008 television season, the final 48 episodes would have been aired as three seasons with 16 episodes each, with \"Lost\" concluding in its sixth season. Due to the 2007-2008 writers' strike, the fourth season featured 14 episodes, and season 5 had 17 episodes. Season six was planned to have 17 episodes, too. However, on June 29 it was announced that the final season would feature an additional hour, making the number of episodes 18.\n\nExecutive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse stated that they \"always envisioned \"Lost\" as a show with a beginning, middle, and end,\" and that by announcing when the show would end that viewers would \"have the security of knowing that the story will play out as we've intended.\" Lindelof and Cuse stated that securing the 2010 series-end date \"was immensely liberating\" and helped the series rediscover its focus. Lindelof noted, \"We're no longer stalling.\" The producers also planned to wrap up long-standing mysteries, such as the nature of the smoke monster, the reason the Dharma periodic resupply drops continue after the purge, and the \"bird\" from \"Exodus Pt. 2\" and \"Live Together, Die Alone Pt. 1\". While the destruction of the four-toed statue of Taweret was revealed in the ninth episode of the final season, Lindelof hinted that the identity of the statue's builders would not be addressed. The producer also indicated that Walt's unusual abilities may be explained, although not necessarily with the character's direct involvement. In a podcast, Cuse and Lindelof stated that they would explain the \"Rules\" first stated in an episode in season four, but only those that are \"important for the narrative they are telling.\" Matthew Fox said in an interview that in the final season, the characters of Jack Shephard and John Locke \"will come head to head.\" It was also claimed that a third of the way through the final season, the two timelines would be \"solidified into one\" and \"will be very linear – no more flashbacks, nothing;\" however this was still not the case by the season midpoint. He also claimed to be the only cast member to know the ending of the series, though Lindelof has clarified that Fox only knew things that were relevant to his character.\n\nDuring Comic-Con 2009, numerous sixth-season reports were made. Carlton Cuse stated both the time travel and flash-forward seasons were over, and they were moving into something different for the sixth season. Josh Holloway stated his character Sawyer would revert to his old self after the loss of Juliet. Though Cuse and Lindelof stated that the Dharma Initiative would no longer play a large role in the show, they have said that the \"Dharma-Michigan connection\" would play a significant role in season six. Lindelof stated that the producers had a direct hand in the production of the season six promotional poster that was first displayed at Comic-Con, and that everything in it was intentional; he also made a reference to the Abbey Road cover in connection to the poster. Season six was the first and only season of Lost ever to not feature any kind of preview or official promotional material such as sneak peeks and promo pictures for future episodes since the Lost producers considered any single frame from the first episodes to be too revealing. According to Lindelof, \"even a single scene from the show would basically tip what it is we're doing this year, and what it is we're doing this year is different than what we've done in other years.\" Lindelof has also emphasized that the flashes-sideways are important, stating \"People are saying [they] don't need these stories and all we can say is they're absolutely 100 percent necessary to tell the story of Lost, and hopefully by the end of the season it will be more obvious as to why.\" He also noted that the term \"flash-sideways\" was deliberately used instead of \"alternate reality\" because viewers might otherwise \"infer that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real.\" When asked to describe the last three episodes, Lindelof said \"Water.\" \n\nABC charged advertisers $900,000 USD for a 30-second commercial during the series finale, in contrast to the standard 2010 season price of $214,000.\n\nThe cast features fifteen major roles with star billing: eleven return from the fifth season, one returns from the fourth season after a year's absence, and three are new regular cast members. Unlike the latter half of the previous season, in which the cast was divided into two groups following two separate storylines, Season Six features an alternate universe scenario which the producers call \"flash-sideways,\" and almost all the main characters participate in both storylines. Returning from the fifth season are the survivors' leader Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox); former fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly); millionaire Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia); former torturer Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews); con artist James \"Sawyer\" Ford (Josh Holloway); medium Miles Straume (Ken Leung); former mob-enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) and his privileged wife Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim); leader of the island's native population (known as the \"Others\") Ben Linus (Michael Emerson); and deceased crash survivor John Locke, who lives on in the sideways timeline but has been possessed in the original timeline by the mysterious Man In Black. Emilie de Ravin returns in her role as Claire Littleton, a new mother who was absent for one season after disappearing on the Island, and Henry Ian Cusick also returns as Desmond Hume, who starts the season off the Island. The new main cast roles go to pilot Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), an ageless advisor to the Others, and mysterious Flight 316 leader Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Carbonell was named a main cast member by the executive producers at Comic-Con 2009, after guest starring in the previous three seasons, and Fahey and Robinson were confirmed after appearing in recurring roles in the fourth and fifth seasons.\n\nSeveral former cast members are scheduled to return to the show, or have been asked back. Elizabeth Mitchell returns as fertility specialist Dr. Juliet Burke. Mitchell has stated that her return is \"instrumental to the story\". Dominic Monaghan returned as rock star Charlie Pace in four episodes. Jeremy Davies returned as physicist Daniel Faraday in multiple episodes. Ian Somerhalder also returned as Flight 815 crash survivor Boone Carlyle in several episodes. Rebecca Mader, who portrays anthropologist Charlotte Lewis, also returned. The producers have also confirmed that Harold Perrineau and Cynthia Watros, who portray Michael Dawson and Libby Smith, respectively, returned in the second half of the season. About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, \"Finally, all of your questions [about Libby] will be answered\", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, \"No, they will not\". Michelle Rodriguez, another second season star, returned as police officer Ana Lucia Cortez, following a brief cameo in the fifth season. Maggie Grace, who portrays Shannon Rutherford, Boone's stepsister, was asked to return at the beginning of the season, but Grace was unable due to her schedule; she appeared later in the season, instead. Furthermore, the producers wished to bring back the character of Walt Lloyd, however Malcolm David Kelley, who portrays Walt, has aged significantly and the producers are working to overcome this obstacle.\n\nRecurring characters who returned include: Jack and Claire's father, Dr. Christian Shephard (John Terry), wealthy industrialist and former Other Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's wife Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), former Other Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan), Locke's ex-girlfriend, Helen Norwood (Katey Sagal), Hurley's former boss, Randy Nations (Billy Ray Gallion), mysterious Flight 316 passenger Bram (Brad William Henke), Sayid's wife, Nadia (Andrea Gabriel), deceased Frenchwoman Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan), science teacher Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), the Others' doctor Ethan Rom (William Mapother), Ben Linus' father Roger (Jon Gries), mercenaries Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and Omar (Anthony Azizi), and Vincent, a dog who survived the crash of Flight 815 and lives on the island. Mark Pellegrino returns in his role as Jacob, the mysterious figure in charge of the island, while Titus Welliver also reprises his role as the mysterious unnamed character, known only as \"The Man in Black\", who appeared to be antagonistic to him in the season 5 finale. L. Scott Caldwell and Sam Anderson returned in their roles as Rose and Bernard respectively, as does Kimberley Joseph who plays 815 stewardess-turned-Other Cindy. Also, Academy Award-winner Fisher Stevens returns as communications officer George Minkowski from the first few episodes of the fourth season in the eleventh episode. Kevin Tighe returns as Anthony Cooper, Locke's father.\n\nSeveral new recurring characters were introduced in the sixth season. \"Deadwood\" actor John Hawkes was cast to portray a character named Lennon and Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada obtained the role of ; both men are Others stationed at the temple. Also, William Atherton was cast in a guest role as the principal of the school where Ben works. Sheila Kelley has been cast in a recurring role that was initially described as \"Kendall\" and later confirmed to be \"Zoe\".\n\nThe season premiered on February 2, 2010, with a double-length episode (two hours including commercials) preceded by a one-hour clip show, entitled \"Lost: Final Chapter\". The show continued from February 9 at its new timeslot of Tuesdays at 9 pm, with a total of 18 episodes airing in 16 broadcasts, ending with a two and a half hour, two-part series finale, the latter part of which aired Sunday, May 23, 2010. Additionally, the first hour of the premiere episode was screened to an estimated 15,000 fans on Waikiki Beach on January 30. In the following table, \"Series #\" refers to the episode's number in the overall series, whereas \"Season #\" refers to the episode's number in this particular season. \"U.S. viewers in millions\" refers to the number of Americans in millions who watched the episodes live or recorded them and watched them within seven days of broadcast.\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe sixth season followed two timelines, each an outcome of the explosion of a hydrogen bomb in the previous season finale. In the first timeline (referred to as \"flash sideways\"), Oceanic Flight 815 never crashes but lands with all leaving the airplane at Los Angeles LAX airport. In the second timeline, the remaining survivors return to the present day (on the Island) and must deal with the demise of \"Jacob\", whose death has been caused by the mysterious Man in Black, the Smoke Monster. According to show producer Damon Lindelof, the term \"flash-sideways\" was deliberately used instead of \"alternate reality\" because it might then imply \"that one of them isn't real, or one of them is real and the other is the alternate to being real.\"\n\nOn the island, it is revealed that, long long ago, infant \"Jacob\" and his brother were stolen, from their birth mother, by a woman who raised them to become protectors of the island, after her. At the hidden center of the island, is a waterfall cave containing a bright power source. \"Jacob\" (with blond hair) and his brother (with black hair, symbolizing white and black) grow up with opposing viewpoints. \"Jacob\" stays loyal to his adoptive mother, but his brother joins with outsiders on the island. When the brother reveals that they have dug into the core of the island, tapping an underground power to escape, the mother hits the brother with a rock, and she destroys the people in their village. She then chooses \"Jacob\" to drink the water of immortality. His brother awakens to see the burned village, and seeking revenge, he finds and kills his adoptive mother. \"Jacob\" discovers her dead body, and in turn, throws his brother into the waterfall cave, transforming him into the black Smoke Monster.\n\nNow centuries later, among the survivors, the Smoke Monster assumes the form of \"John Locke\", returned to the island in a coffin. This \"Locke\" had convinced \"Ben\" to enter the seaside cave and stab \"Jacob\", who fell into the fire and died. With many survivors believing that \"Locke\" has been resurrected, they follow him in various plans to leave the island. In one plan, they overthrow the guards at \"Widmore's\" submarine, and leave the island, unaware that a time bomb is inside the submarine. \"Jack\" (the doctor) discovers the time bomb, advising them not to disarm it while reasoning that the Smoke Monster cannot kill anyone directly. Instead, \"Sawyer\" (Ford) refuses to listen and pulls the bomb wires, which, instead, causes the bomb to count down faster. \"Sayid\" grabs the bomb and runs through the submarine, sacrificing himself to shield the others from the bomb blast. However, the bomb splits the submarine walls, and while sinking, \"Sun-Hwa\" is trapped in the wreckage, but \"Jin\" stays with her, vowing to never leave her side again, as they both die underwater.\n\n\"Jack\" swims, with a breathing tube, to the surface and back to shore. He tells the rest that \"Sun\" and \"Jin\" did not escape. In anger, \"Kate\" vows to kill \"John Locke\", for what he has done to their friends. \"Sayyid\" (the Iraqi guard), \"Richard\", and \"Miles\" (son of the DHARMA leader) go to the other island to destroy the airplane. However, crossing at sea, they find the pilot adrift, who convinces them to repair the airplane to escape later.\n\nThe spirit of \"Jacob\" asks who among them would become Protector of the island, and \"Jack\" volunteers. At the waterfall cave, \"Jack\" drinks the water of immortality and returns to the group. \"Jack\" says they must meet with \"Locke\" and \"Desmond\" to settle the dispute and kill \"Locke\". The 2 groups meet on the hilltop, and just the 3 proceed toward the waterfall cave. There, \"Desmond\" descends on a rope into the cave, but pulls a rock from the bottom, which puts out the light of the power source. The island begins a series of earthquake tremors, to fall into the sea, with rocks tumbling into the water. \"Locke\" flees the area, now needing to get the sailboat to the other island: he has lost his immortality when the light source was put out. \"Jack\" chases him to the sea cliffs to stop him from leaving, and a long fight begins. \"Locke\" grabs a knife and stabs \"Jack\" in the side, then forces the knife up to \"Jack's\" neck. Before plunging the knife, a gunshot is heard: \"Kate\" as promised, has shot \"Locke\" (the Smoke Monster) in the back, and \"Jack\" pushes him off the sea cliff, to die on the rocks below.\n\n\"Jack\" tells them he must return to the island core, as he promised Jacob, to restore the light at the waterfall cave. He instructs \"Kate\" to leave with \"Sawyer\" to get \"Claire\" into the airplane on the other island. \"Kate\" in turmoil kisses \"Jack\" goodbye, fearing it will be the last time. \"Kate\" and \"Sawyer\" jump into the sea and swim to the sailboat at anchor.\n\n\"Hurley\" and \"Ben\" help \"Jack\" return to the waterfall cave. They lower \"Jack\" into the cave, where he revives and ties \"Desmond\" to the rope. \"Jack\" then puts the missing stone back into the floor, and restarts the light power source. When \"Hurley\" and \"Ben\" pull the rope, they find only \"Desmond\". They call below, but \"Jack\", overcome by the knife wound and rushing water, never answered, so they take \"Desmond\" away from the area. Some time later, Jack awakens, alone, outside the cave, as if lifted from the depth of the cave by an unseen force. Dazed, he wanders through the jungle, but he is losing strength. Just as with \"Locke's\" death, \"Jack\" also lost his immortality, and protection, at the first time the light source was put out. \"Jack\" falls to the ground, looking up to the blue sky. At that point, he sees \"Kate's\" plane flying far overhead, and then closes his eyes, for the last time.\n\nMeanwhile, in the \"flash-sideways\" view of events, everyone has returned on Oceanic Flight 815, and all have resumed their original lives:\nSoon after returning on Flight 815, \"Desmond\" has been tasked to ensure that bandmember \"Charlie\" stays sober to appear at a benefit concert for Charles Widmore. \"Charlie\" keeps talking about some imaginary, profound romance with a blonde girl, as if in some dream. Trying to rebel against \"Desmond\", he grabs the steering wheel, and the car goes into the harbor. Underwater, looking back inside the car to save \"Charlie\", he remembers seeing \"\" written on \"Charlie's\" hand, but not actually, then pulls him to the surface. They get rescued to the hospital, and Desmond asks, \"Who is Penny?\". Some memories come back, and Desmond begins to orchestrate a plan: at the school, he hits \"John Locke\" with his car, causing him to need surgery, led by \"Jack Shephard\" at the hospital. \"Desmond\" turns himself in to the police station for \"Sawyer\", who puts him in a jail cell near \"Kate\" and \"Sayid\".\n\nMeanwhile, \"Hurley\" has been hired to free \"Kate\", \"Sayid\" and \"Desmond\" by paying Officer \"Ana Lucia\" to detour the prison van to the harbor. They get in 2 cars, and make plans to attend the benefit concert. \"Desmond\" and \"Kate\" drive to the church, where \"Desmond\" meets the funeral van, to accept the casket of \"Christian Shephard\" (\"Jack's\" father) into the chapel. This same day, \"John Locke\" has a 2nd spinal surgery, by \"Jack\", and regains feeling in his legs. Coming to the hospital to visit \"Sun-Hwa\", the police officer \"Sawyer (Ford)\" meets \"Juliet\" at the snack machines, where they both suddenly remember their parallel life, 3 years together on the island.\n\nNow nighttime, \"Hurley\" drives \"Sayid\" to a backstreet, saying that he knows he is really a good guy: a fight breaks out in the alley, and a girl shouts, \"Don't hurt my brother!\" \"Sayid\", instinctively, jumps out to rescue her. When he sees her face, he remembers her: \"\"Shannon?\"\" Her stepbrother, \"Boone\" goes to the van and tells \"Hurley\", he is glad \"Sayid\" finally arrived because he was getting tired of staging the alley fight for them. \"Desmond\" attends the concert, where \"Daniel Faraday's\" mother talks to \"Desmond\" about the secret plan. While performing on stage, \"Charlie\" recognizes \"Claire\" in the audience, as the girl of his dreams, when she leaves to give birth to her son, assisted by \"Kate\" to get to the hospital.\n\nFinally, \"Kate\" has convinced \"Jack\" (only partially aware of his parallel memories) to drive to the church, intended for his father's funeral. There, he enters the chapel, and upon touching his father's casket, he too begins to remember \"everything\" from the Island, all of them, including his years spent with \"Kate\". However, upon opening the casket, he finds it empty: his father has assumed a spirit form, and reminds him that he, too, died on the island, in his other life, which was as real as the present day.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246051", "text": "Weather map\n\nA weather map is a tool. It is used to show facts and study of many kinds of meteorological amounts at different levels of the atmosphere quickly. They have been used from the mid-19th century. Weather maps have been used both for study and for weather forecasting purposes. Some maps show differences of temperature. This can help find weather fronts. \n\nPeople first began using weather charts in a modern way in the mid-19th century. They began using them to make a theory about storm systems. When a telegraph network developed by 1845, it was possible for people to collect information about the weather. They could get the information from many different places far away quickly enough for the information to be useful. In the 1840s, Joseph Henry took charge. He helped the Smithsonian Institution focus most of its observers on the center and the eastern part of the United States during the 1840s and 1860s. The U.S. Army Signal Corps kept up this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress. It later expanded to the west side.\n\nAt first, all the data on the map was not taken from these analyses. This was because there was not enough time standardization. People first tried to standardize time in Great Britain in 1855. The entire United States was not influenced by time zones (areas with different times) until 1906. This was when Detroit had made the standard time at last. Over all the earth, other countries began taking weather observations at the same time. This started in 1873.\n\nA station model is a symbolic picture showing the weather at a reporting station. Meteorologists made the station model to put down many weather elements in a small space on weather maps. Maps thickly filled with station-model plots can be hard to read. However, they help meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns. A computer draws a station model for every place of observation. The station model is mostly used for surface-weather maps. It can also be used to show the weather in the sky, though. A complete station-model map lets people study patterns in air pressure, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and precipitation.\n", "id": "246051", "title": "Weather map"}

He has consistently ranked among the world's top players since the early 1990s, and reached a ranking as high as number four in 1998. Shirov is also a well-regarded chess author.\n\nShirov became the World Champion (under 16) in 1988, and achieved the title of grandmaster in 1990. He is the winner of numerous international tournaments.\n\nIn 1998 Shirov's ranking rose to number four in the world. On the basis of his rating, he was invited to play a ten-game match against Vladimir Kramnik to select a challenger for World Champion Garry Kasparov. Shirov won the match with two wins, no losses and seven draws. However the plans for the Kasparov match fell through when funds could not be raised. When Kasparov played Kramnik for the world title in 2000, Shirov maintained that the match was invalid and he was the rightful challenger.\n\nIn 2000, Shirov reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship, losing to Viswanathan Anand.\n\nIn May/June 2007 he played in the Candidates Tournament of the FIDE World Chess Championship. He won his first round match against Michael Adams (+1-1=4, won in rapid playoff), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Levon Aronian (+0-1=5). In November/December 2007 Shirov played in the Chess World Cup. He lost in the final 2.5-1.5 to Gata Kamsky.\n\nIn May 2009, Alexei Shirov achieved the greatest triumph of his career by placing 1st in the high Category 21 M-Tel Masters 2009 tournament, a double round tournament held in Sofia, Bulgaria. He was undefeated, and scored 6.5/10—seven draws and three victories, two against Vassily Ivanchuk and the other against Magnus Carlsen in the final round. By this success he was given entry to the Grand Slam Chess Final 2009 in Bilbao where he met Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin (winner of Corus 2009), and Alexander Grischuk (winner of Linares 2009).\n\nIn 1994 Shirov married, and later divorced, Verónica Alvarez, moved to Tarragona, and became a citizen of Spain. He married, then later divorced, Lithuanian IM/WGM Viktorija Čmilytė from 2001 to 2008. Although he still plays for Spain, he now lives in Latvia.\n\nShirov is noted for his attacking style and for seeking complications, a tendency which has led to comparisons with fellow Latvian and former world champion, Mikhail Tal, under whom he studied in his youth.\n\nDuring the 1998 Linares chess tournament Shirov played black against future FIDE world champion Veselin Topalov and won with a piece sacrifice in a bishop and pawn ending.\n\n1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7 7.Bb5+ c6 8.Ba4 O-O 9.Ne2 Nd7 10.O-O e5 11.f3 Qe7 12.Be3 Rd8 13.Qc2 Nb6 14.Bb3 Be6 15.Rad1 Nc4 16.Bc1 b5 17.f4 exd4 18.Nxd4 Bg4 19.Rde1 Qc5 20.Kh1 a5 21.h3 Bd7 22.a4 bxa4 23.Ba2 Be8 24.e5 Nb6 25.f5 Nd5 26.Bd2 Nb4 27.Qxa4 Nxa2 28.Qxa2 Bxe5 29.fxg6 hxg6 30.Bg5 Rd5 31.Re3 Qd6 32.Qe2 Bd7 33.c4 Bxd4 34.cxd5 Bxe3 35.Qxe3 Re8 36.Qc3 Qxd5 37.Bh6 Re5 38.Rf3 Qc5 39.Qa1 Bf5 40.Re3 f6 41.Rxe5 Qxe5 42.Qa2+ Qd5 43.Qxd5+ cxd5 44.Bd2 a4 45.Bc3 Kf7 46.h4 Ke6 47.Kg1 Bh3!!

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246234", "text": "Lactase\n\nLactase is an enzyme which acts on lactose, breaking it down so it can be digested. \n\nMammals in their infancy usually make lactase: they need it for digesting the lactose found in their mother's milk. Mammalian adults usually lose the capacity to produce lactase. Thus, if you give milk to an adult cat it causes discomfort and diarrhea.\n\nHumans are somewhat different. Some humans continue to produce lactase, and some do not. It is a type of polymorphism.\n\nThe ability to digest lactose into adulthood ('lactase persistence') was useful to humans after the development of animal husbandry. This created a system providing a consistent supply of milk. \n\nHunter-gatherer populations before the Neolithic revolution were overwhelmingly lactose intolerant. So are modern hunter-gatherers. \n\nA mutation on chromosome #2 stops the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk (and eating other dairy products) throughout their lives.\n\nThis appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy consumption. It has occurred independently in both northern Europe and East Africa in populations with a pastoral lifestyle. Lactase persistence, allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood, is a dominant allele, making lactose intolerance a recessive trait. \n\nGenetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence only reached appreciable levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years.

The network is financially backed by the National Basketball Association (NBA), which also uses NBA TV as a way of advertising their out of market package NBA League Pass, and partner channel TNT.\n\nStarted in 1999 as nba.com TV, the channel, which had its studios at NBA Entertainment in Secaucus, New Jersey, began a multi-year deal with American television companies Cox Communications, Cablevision, and Time Warner on June 28, 2003, allowing the network to expand to 45 million American homes, and 30 different countries. NBA TV replaced Time Warner's CNN/SI on many cable systems after that network shut down a year earlier.\n\nNBA TV offers basketball news every day, as well as programming showcasing basketball players' individual lifestyles, life as a basketball team during an NBA season, famous games of the past, and live games typically four days a week during the NBA season. Live games on NBA TV are subject to local blackout restrictions, since NBA TV does not have exclusive broadcast rights to any of its games. Games carried by NBA TV are always also carried by each team's local rights holder.\n\nThe channel also shows international games, typically on Saturday evenings, with special emphasis on the Euroleague and the Maccabi Tel Aviv team from Israel. In April 2005, the channel televised the Chinese Basketball Association finals for the first time.\nNBA TV carries at least 90 regular-season games per season, all broadcast in high definition, as well as some first-round playoff games. It also broadcasts WNBA games nationally (subject to local blackout).\n\nThe channel's flagship program is \"NBA Gametime Live\", a show in which a host and studio analysts go over the latest news, highlights, and look in at games in progress. The show is live six days a week, not airing on most Thursdays due to NBA's coverage of \"The NBA on TNT\". An edited one hour/thirty minute version of the broadcast is repeated throughout the late night/early morning hours.\n\n\nThe studio host and analysts vary every night on NBA Gametime Live.\n\n\n\nOn October 8, 2007, it was reported that Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner, was to take over the channel's operations, according to\nHoopsworld:\n\"NBATV: Surprisingly there has been little said about the NBA's decision to sell off NBATV to one of its media partners. Talks had gone on for as ESPN/ABC and Turner both explored scenarios with the league. Ultimately it seems Turner has won out, and will take over operation of the league's flagship cable channel, that reaches some 12 million subscribers. The exact changeover date is not clear, but several months ago a Bloomberg report cited sources saying senior level producers were offered contract buyouts in September.\"\n\nTurner Sports relaunched the channel on October 28, 2008, using analysts carried over from NBA on TNT.\n\nIn 2001, Raptors NBA TV begin airing in Canada. Although quite similar to NBA TV, there is a larger focus on the Toronto Raptors basketball team, due to Canadian content requirements and restrictions on foreign ownership (the channel is owned by Raptors parent company Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, not the league).\n\nAs of 2010, NBA TV coverage can be seen in 40 countries via the following partners:\n\nNBA TV HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast of NBA TV.

Both are in black and gray\n\nOn April 16, 2009, it was announced that DirecTV and the NBA reached a new carriage agreement. NBA TV was moved from the satellite television provider's add-on Sports Pack (and premium subscription package NBA League Pass) to its lower priced base package Choice Xtra on October 1, 2009. DirecTV believes the move will make the channel available to an additional 8 million subscribers.\n\nOn June 4, 2009, it was announced that the NBA and Comcast have reached a deal to move the channel from the cable company's add-on Sports Entertainment Package to its basic level Digital Classic package, by the start of the 2009-10 NBA season. Comcast believes an additional 8 million customers will now have access to the channel.\n\nVerizon FiOS added the channel and NBA League Pass for the first time on September 23, 2009.\n\nThe channel also signed new multiyear agreements with Time Warner Cable, Cablevision, and Dish Network on October 22, 2009.

Their biggest success was during the 1990s.\n\nThe band were originally a four piece band: lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards mysteriously vanished on 1 February 1995. In November 2008, 13 years after his disappearance, he was officially declared presumed dead.\n\nThe Manics released their debut album \"Generation Terrorists\" in 1992. Their combination of androgynous glam punk imagery, outspoken\ninvective and songs about \"culture, alienation, boredom and despair\" soon gained them a loyal following and cult status. The band's later albums kept a politicized and smart lyrical style. They also adopted a broader alternative rock sound. Enigmatic lyricist Richey Edwards gained early notoriety by carving the words \"4 REAL\" into his arm with a razor blade (narrowly missing an artery and requiring seventeen stitches) in response to the suggestion that the band were less than authentic.

If the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as for pumping water, cutting lumber or grinding stones, the machine is called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is instead converted to electricity, the machine may be called a wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), or aerogenerator.\n\nThe wind turbine's blades are turned by the wind. This turns a shaft turning at about 10-20 rpm with a high torque. The shaft goes into a gearbox with a ratio of about 1:50, although more recent wind turbine gearboxes can have a ratio of 1:100 or more. This is then creating an output of around 1000 rpm but at a low torque. It is connected to a generator which uses magnetic fields and wire to create electricity. This electricity is combined with any other wind turbines that may be in the same wind farm, and this combined electricity is conditioned to be the same as the power grid and then the electricity is sent to the power grid.\n\nAlthough wind turbines are a renewable source of energy and don't pollute the environment, they have an environmental impact.\nSome people think that wind turbines create a lot of noise and look ugly. However they don't produce as much noise as some people think. Wind turbines are placed no closer than 300 meters to residential homes. At that distance, a wind turbine is no louder than an average household air conditioner.\n", "id": "246358", "title": "Wind turbine"}

The speech was delivered by Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 - 404 BCE). He was a famous Athenian politician. The speech was a part of the yearly public funeral for the people who died in the war.\n\nAt that time, people in Athens had a custom of holding a public funeral for the people who died in war. The bodies of the dead were left out for three days in a tent, where offerings could be made for the dead.\n\n\"Funeral Oration\" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his \"History of the Peloponnesian War\". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his \"History\" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech.\n\nThe Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as \"a eulogy (description) of Athens itself...\". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people.\n\nAmerican Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.\n", "id": "246390", "title": "Pericles' Funeral Oration"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246401", "text": "Gorgoneion\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion (Greek: Γοργόνειον) was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism). \nThe gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo.\n\nHomer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that \"Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask.\" The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her.\n\nThe direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus.\n\nGorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman.\n\nGorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that \"the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates\".\n\nIn the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of \"lion mask\" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century.\n\nAs well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents.\n\nThe Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company.\n\nGimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to \"dynamic life energy\". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him.\n\n\n", "id": "246401", "title": "Gorgoneion"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246423", "text": "Gustave Courbet\n\nJean Désiré Gustave Courbet (10 June 1819–31 December 1877) was a French painter. He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet is very important in French painting for two reasons. Firstly, he was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. Secondly, his paintings made social comment on the world around him. In other words, he was not afraid to show \"real life\" in a way that was not always beautiful and nice. \n\nCourbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters. \n\nCourbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting. \n\nWhen Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life.\n\nIn 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did. He did not want to paint scenes from literature, history or mythology like most other artists in France at that time. \n\nCourbet painted a large picture of everday-life at Ornans. The painting, called \"After Dinner at Ornans\", shows four men who have just finished a meal at a little table, which is perhaps in an inn. One man is playing his violin, one man is lighting his pipe. Courbet sits listening, with his head leaning on his hand. A large dog is curled under a chair. Courbet showed the painting at the Salon Exhibition in Paris. It was a great success. It won a Gold Medal and was bought by the French Government. Because of the gold medal, Courbet could hang his pictures at the Salon Exhibitions without having them checked by a jury first. (This rule was changed in 1857.) Courbet's work, along with the work of Honoré Daumier and Jean-François Millet, became known as \"Realism\". Like the Dutch painters that he admired, Courbet often painted in broad, rough brush strokes. He often used dark earthy colours, particularly brown, in his paintings.\n\nIn 1849 Courbet saw two people working by the roadside, using small hammers to break large rocks into gravel. One was an old man and the other was a young boy. Courbet painted a picture of this scene. He explained it to a friend \"\"It is not often that one meets with so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning.\"\" \n\nThe picture soon became one of the most famous scenes of the life of poor people that has ever been painted. It was destroyed during World War II in Dresden.\n\nCourbet's other important painting that was shown at the Salon of 1850 was a scene of life at his village. Beginning in 1849, he painted the funeral of his great-uncle who had died the previous year. Courbet got all the village people who had been at the funeral to come to his studio and pose for him, one by one, until the painting was complete. The painting was very large, 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters). The famous artist Jacques Louis David had once painted a very large picture in the same way. David's picture was of the \"Coronation of Napoleon\" and showed all the people who were present. \n\nSome people praised \"The Funeral at Ornans\" but other people were very angry about it. They thought that it was wrong to show the burial of an ordinary man in a huge painting, as if he was as important as an emperor. They thought that it was wrong to show the poor people of a village, with their old clothes and dirty boots, as if they were all as important as lords and ladies. Some of the critics said that Courbet was deliberately trying to paint ugliness. Many people came to see the picture and liked the new Realist way of painting. Courbet said: \"\"The Burial at Ornans was ... the burial of Romanticism.\"\" \n\nCourbet became a celebrity. (He became famous and written about in the newspapers- like a film star.) People said he was a genius, a \"terrible socialist\", and a \"savage\". \nCourbet wrote to a friend in 1850:\nDuring the 1850s Courbet painted many other pictures using common folk and friends as his subjects, such as \"Village Damsels\" (1852), the \"Wrestlers\" (1853), \"Bathers\" (1853), \"The Sleeping Spinner\" (1853), and \"The Wheat Sifters\" (1854).\n\nCourbet then painted another huge picture. This painting is called \"The Artist's Studio\" and is about seven years in his life as a painter. He shows himself at the centre of the picture, working on a large landscape painting. Behind him is an artists' model, who is naked. All around Courbet are his friends and people from his village. His mother stands to one side of the picture. Another woman is sitting on the floor feeding her baby. A little boy watches the artist, while a white cat plays on the floor. \n\nIn 1855 Coubet took this picture, with \"Burial at Ornan\" and twelve other paintings to be shown in a big international exhibition in Paris called \"Exposition Universelle\". The two biggest paintings and another one were sent away because there was not enough room. Courbet was angry. He had his own building put up, and showed forty of his paintings. Many other artists praised Courbet, but some people laughed at him, and the public did not buy very many of his pictures. Because of what he had done, younger artists heard about him and admired him. These included James McNeill Whistler in the United States as well as Édouard Manet in France.\n\nIn 1857 Courbet showed six pictures in the Salon exhibition. One was a hunting scene and one was a picture of two prostitutes lying under a tree on the banks of the River Seine in Paris. Many people came to see the exhibition and to buy his paintings. The hunting scenes were very popular for decorating the halls and dining rooms of large houses. \n\nFor the rest of his life, Courbet painted erotic (sexy) pictures like the picture of the prostitutes, and also many more hunting scenes. His last erotic painting was called \"The Origin of the World\" and was a close-up painting of female genitals. This painting was not shown in a public exhibition until 1988. He also painted very many landscapes, which he began by doing outdoor sketches, then made into big paintings in his studio. By the 1870s Courbet was thought of as one of the leading artists in France. The emperor offered to make Courbet a member of the Légion d'honneur which was the highest honour in France, but Courbet refused to accept it. He believed that he belonged to the poor and ordinary people, not to the high and mighty.\n\nAt this time, there were many political problems in France. Courbet became involved in the political problems. In 1871, he was blamed because a public monument called the Vendôme Column had been demolished. He was put in prison for six months. In 1873, the new government expected him to pay to have the monument restored and put back. He did not have enough money so left France to live in Switzerland. The government decided to make terms so that Courbet could pay for the column in yearly payments of 10,000 francs for 33 years. Courbet died at La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland, on 31 December 1877, one day before the first payment was due. He was 58 and died of liver disease, made worse by heavy drinking.\n\n\n\n", "id": "246423", "title": "Gustave Courbet"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246500", "text": "Dispute\n\nA dispute is a continuing disagreement carried on between two or more parties. The parties may be people, or they may be organisations or countries. Disputes can last a long time, and they can have serious results. Dispute may happen from controversy. Disputes may become conflicts. Disputes between individual people may lead to violence. Disputes between organisations may lead to legal action. Disputes between countries may lead to war.\n\nSeveral factors make disputes more serious. Serious disputes may do a lot of damage to the people involved, and to their societies. \n\nDisputes may last for long periods, and the longer they last, the more damage they may do. Where disputes involve religions, or hostile countries, they may last for more than a lifetime. Generations of children may be taught that their side is completely right, and the other wrong. \n\nDisputes arise when there are conflicting needs, values or ideas. Differences of religion and culture are a common cause of disputes. Self-interest is a common cause of disputes between individuals. \n\nA second factor is the use of books, newspapers, radio and television by each side to promote their side of the argument. This propaganda helps to continue and spread the dispute.\n\nLaws may prevent freedom of speech, and prevent discussion in print or other media. This makes it difficult for either side to see merit in the other point of view. In turn, this makes it difficult for compromise or tolerance to dissolve the dispute.\n\nThe study of disputes and conflicts reached its peak during the Cold War. Then the West versus East conflict seemed to threaten world peace, and many ideas were put forward to use negotiation as a tool to calm the tension. Negotiation about the reduction of nuclear weapons was successful.\n\nThe tension was finally reduced by the unexpected end of the Soviet Union, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe. This was not achieved by negotiation. The reasons for the end of the Soviet Union are still being debated.\n\nProfessional help may be available. Between people, there are counsellors; between organisations there are specialists in conflict resolution; between countries there is the United Nations. \n\nSome disputes do fade with the passage of time, though the time may be much longer than a human lifetime. Conflict between religions may fade only after centuries, and there is no known process of mediation.\n\nAll legal systems have provisions for making decisions in disputes. Usually the cases are based on claims about money, between individual people or between 'corporate entities'. These are companies or other organisations. Usually, the law can only be used if it can reach a decision based on evidence. Law textbooks list which disputes which may be addressed by law, and which can not.\n\nForce has been used many times to enforce one side of the other to submit. Wars have been based on disputes, or disputes have been used as an excuse for wars. However, force has also been used to keep warring groups apart, and calm people down. Both the European Union and the United Nations have used peace-keeping forces in areas under violent dispute.\n\nEducation may be used to harden opinion and make a dispute worse, or it may be used to open people's minds to unpopular ideas. Education which helps people to think for themselves and keep an open mind is thought to reduce prejudice and conflict.\n\nDemocracy is one way of easing conflict within a country. It is not a perfect solution, for small groups may feel they are permanently excluded from power. Free speech and freedom from censorship exist to some extent in democracies. These freedoms are valuable to minority groups inside a country. Countries that have these freedoms are called open or liberal democracies. \n\nOf course, there are many disputes between individual people, but disputes between large groups or nations are of very great importance.\n", "id": "246500", "title": "Dispute"}

Webster's \"Second Reply to Hayne\" (1830) was widely seen as \"the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress.\"\n\nWebster described the US government as \"made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people\". This influenced Abraham Lincoln later. He spoke the words \"government of the people, by the people, for the people\" in his Gettysburg Address.\n", "id": "246641", "title": "Webster-Hayne debate"}

It is now a part of the Croajingolong National Park.\n\nPoint Hicks is where, on 19 April 1770, the continent of Australia was first sighted by the men on Captain Cook's \"Endeavour\" voyage. Cook wrote that it was Lieutenant Zachary Hickes who first saw land, and Cook named the point after him. Hickes spelt his name with an \"e\", Cook wrote both \"Hicks\" and \"Hickes\" in different places. The spelling \"Hicks\" is now in use for the point.\n\nWhen George Bass sailed past the area at the end of 1797 he did not locate the point. It did not appear on the charts Matthew Flinders made of their voyages, and the name fell into disuse.\n\nThe point came to be known as Cape Everard. The first use of that name is said to be by hydrographer John Lort Stokes who surveyed the coast in the \"Beagle\" in 1843. It is thought he named it after fellow naval officer John Everard Home, but his maps do not use the name.\n\nThe first map showing Cape Everard was by surveyor George Douglas Smythe, made in 1852 and published in 1853. If he thought of the name, he may have named it after William Everard, commissioner of crown lands.\n\nThe name Cape Everard was used until 1970. There has been doubt and arguments about exactly what Cook saw. The actual latitude and longitude he gave () is a location many miles out to sea.\n\nPoint Hicks was renamed as part of Cook's bicentenary. Victorian Premier Henry Bolte announced the new name in a ceremony at the point on 20 April 1970 (this was the 200th anniversary; Cook's 19 April was by nautical time, i.e. not adjusted for the International Date Line).\n\nA lighthouse was built on the point in 1887/8 and started operation in 1890. It was built from concrete and with wooden lighthouse keepers houses. It was connected to mains electricity in 1965, and then to solar power recently. The keepers' cottages are today used as holiday houses. With 37 metres of height it is the tallest lighthouse on Australia's mainland. Its light is a double white flash every ten seconds, from a height of 56 metres above sea level.\n\n\n\n", "id": "246652", "title": "Point Hicks"}

The Thracians were an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe.\n\nThe indigenous population of Thrace was a people called the Thracians, divided into numerous tribal groups. \n\nThracian troops accompanied neighbouring ruler Alexander the Great when he crossed the Hellespont (which abuts Thrace) and took on the Persian Empire of the day. \n\nDivided into separate tribes, the Thracians did not manage to form a lasting political organization until the Odrysian state was founded in the 4th century BC. Like Illyrians, Thracian tribes of the mountainous regions had a warrior tradition, while the tribes based in the plains were more peaceable. Recent funeral mounds in Bulgaria suggest that Thracian kings did rule regions of Thrace with distinct Thracian national identity. \n\nThrace was conquered by Alexander, and later regained its freedom. It was conquered after several attempts by the Romans in 46 , in the reign of Claudius. They became a province, and later four provinces, of the Roman Empire. Finally, as the Empire crumbled, Thrace suffered more than a thousand years of strife and conquest by stronger forces.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246774", "text": "Human penis size\n\nHuman penis size is described by length and circumference of penis. It is larger than in any other primate. \n\nThe size depends on arousal level, time of day, room temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and unreliability of the measurement methods. Average measurements are applied. The length is measured along the top, from the base to the tip with the man standing and the penis held parallel to the floor. The circumference is measured on erect penis: just below the glans penis, in the middle of the shaft, and at the base. Self-measurements report a higher average length than those which used medical or scientific methods. Doctors induce erection or stretch the flaccid penis as far as possible. Flaccid length is not a reliable indication of erect length. \n\nThe arithmetic mean human penis is approximately in length, the circumference is approximately . There is no scientific relation between either penis size or race, and shoe size or stretched penis size. At birth the penis is between 2.4 and 5.5 cm long, at the beginning of puberty, it is 6 cm. Penis size does not change much during adulthood.\n\nAncient Romans admired the large penis of Priapus. Ancient Greek art was not obsessed with penis size. A passage from Aristophanes lists broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks, and a little penis as the most desirable masculine features. In medieval Arabic literature, a longer penis was preferred, but Afro-Arab author Al-Jahiz wrote: \"If the length of the penis were a sign of honor, then the mule would belong to the (honorable tribe of) Quraysh\". \n\nMales may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis compared to that of others because of looking down and the accumulation of fat at the base of the penis. Studies found that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises. Sex education of penis measurements was helpful and relieving for men who were concerned about small penis size. \n\nAn Internet survey found only 55% of participating men were satisfied with their penis size, whereas 85% of participating women said they were \"very satisfied\" with the size of their partner's penis, and only 6% of women rated their partner as smaller than average. A study concluded that penis width rather than length was a more important factor of sexual stimulation probably because a wider penis provides more friction to the clitoral area while a longer penis reaches a less sensitive area. At Utrecht University was found that the majority of homosexual men regarded a large penis as ideal, and having one was linked to self-esteem.\n\nWidespread private concerns have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size. There is belief that it is possible to predict the size of someone's penis by observing other bodily features such as the hands, feet, nose or height. The media has equated a man's penis size with both power and masculinity. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.\n\nMany men exaggerate the importance of deep vaginal penetration in stimulating a woman to orgasm. \nThe most sensitive area of the female genitals includes the vulva, clitoris, and the section of vagina closest to the outside of a woman's body, which is roughly 10 centimetres in length. The majority of penises are likely of sufficient length to fully satisfy their partners.\n\nSome women find stimulation of the cervix by penis as uncomfortable or painful, others report it to be key to orgasm. The cervix may be confused with the deepest point of the vagina, above and below the cervix, respectively making it possible for there to be indirect and/or simultaneous stimulation between them. During arousal, the vagina lengthens rapidly to an average of about 10 centimetres, but can continue to lengthen in response to pressure. The walls of the vagina are composed of soft elastic folds of mucous membrane skin which stretch or contract (with support from pelvic muscles) to the size of the penis. With proper arousal, the vagina stretches or contracts to accommodate virtually any size penis, from small to large.\n\nAn adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm but otherwise formed normally is referred to as having the micropenis condition. Some of the causes are deficiency of pituitary growth hormone and/or gonadotropins, mild degrees of androgen insensitivity, a variety of genetic syndromes, and variations in certain homeobox genes. Some types of micropenis can be addressed with growth hormone or testosterone treatment in early childhood. Roughly 0.6% of males suffer from the macropenis condition.\n\nIt has been suggested that penis size differences between individuals may also be caused by environmental factors such as culture, diet, chemical/pollution exposure, etc. Endocrine disruptor resulting from chemical exposure has been linked to genital deformation in both sexes (among many other problems). Chemicals from both synthetic (e.g. pesticides, anti-bacterial Triclosan, plasticizers for plastics, etc.) and natural (e.g., chemicals found in tea tree oil and lavender oil)) sources in the blood of pregnant women have been linked to various degrees of endocrine disruption.\n\nVarious studies have examined condom breakage, which looked, among other things, at penis size as a factor for breakage or slippage. Although the most common type of condom, those made of latex, have great ability to stretch, they are vulnerable to dry friction (i.e., the dry rubbing motion of sexual activity when there is tight pressure or a lack of smooth lubricated movement) as well as other mistakes of usage. In a separate study of people practicing anal sex, condom breakage was linked more to excessive friction (in this case due to low usage of a sexual lubricant) than to penis size.Penis size did not influence slippage, but penis circumference and broken condoms were strongly correlated, with larger sizes increasing the rate of breakage.\n\n4.

Specifically, the first four feet can either be dactyls or spondees more or less freely. The fifth foot is frequently a dactyl (around 95% of the time in Homer). \n\nBecause of the strong pause at the end of the line, it is traditionally regarded as a spondee.

These include their character, their vision for the country, their relations with congress, their relations with foreign leaders (diplomacy), how they managed the economy, how they managed the military, and their overall political skill.\n\nTo make sure the rankings are fair, many surveys equally balance the opinions of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to accurately rank a president because all of the presidents faced completely different challenges and lived in different times.\n\nHistorical opinions of U.S. presidents often change over time. For example, Harry Truman had very low approval ratings right after he left office, but many historians now consider him among the greatest presidents.\n\nThe following presidents are usually ranked highly:\n\nSome presidents have mixed ratings. For example, Andrew Jackson is considered to be a leader who stood for the common man, but at the same time historians criticize him because of the Indian Removal Act. Ulysses S. Grant is thought to be a bad leader since he hired corrupt friends for government jobs, but at the same time he helped African-American to have more rights in the Reconstruction Era. Another example is Lyndon B. Johnson, who passed civil rights bills and President during the Great Society, but also escalated the Vietnam War.\n\nJimmy Carter, Chester Arthur, William Howard Taft, Benjamin Harrison, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Rutherford B. Hayes, Martin Van Buren, and Richard Nixon are considered to be below average.\n\nJohn Tyler, Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce, and James Buchanan are often considered to be among the worst because they failed to prevent the growth of the slavery which resulted in the Civil War. \n\nAndrew Johnson is often ranked among the worst because he was against the Reconstruction.\n\nWarren G. Harding is often considered to be the worst because he hired corrupt friends to become government officials. \n\nBoth historian polls and popular opinion polls consider George W. Bush among the worst U.S. presidents, although some would argue that it is too early to rank him because his term ended recently in 2009.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison and James Garfield are often not ranked because they both died shortly after becoming presidents. When they are included, they are usually low in the list.\n\nAlso, Donald Trump is not ranked because his presidency has not ended yet. For the same reason, George W. Bush and Barack Obama are not ranked in some polls because their presidencies ended less than ten years ago.\n\n", "id": "246926", "title": "Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States"}

It was the remaking of the Southern United States, after it had lost its war of rebellion and slavery was ended. The southern states were occupied territory. Andrew Johnson became President of the U.S. after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. He wanted to make it easy to restore local rule in the previously rebellious states, and he permitted some of them to hold elections in 1865. Former leaders of the Confederate States of America who ran as Democrats were elected to Congress, and states passed laws that denied rights to former slaves.\n\nMany members of the Republican Party wanted stricter terms before local rule was returned to the South. After the Republicans won a large majority of the Congressional seats in the 1866 elections, they refused to let former Confederate leaders take seats in the United States Congress. The Republicans then passed laws that former leaders of the rebellion were temporarily not allowed to hold office or vote in elections. Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution were passed that ended slavery, made former slaves citizens, and gave them the right to vote. Some newly freed black slaves won elected offices.\n\nMany white people resisted having former slaves having equal rights and being able to vote. The Ku Klux Klan was formed to force black people out of political and economic power. After Reconstruction ended in 1877, white people in the South used their regained political rights to pass Jim Crow Laws. These laws enforced segregation (keeping blacks and whites separate) and took the vote away from African Americans whose parents or grandparents were slaves. After Reconstruction, white Southerners voted mostly against the Republican Party for about 80 years.\n\n", "id": "246929", "title": "Reconstruction of the United States"}

The Guard was dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD.\n\nThe term \"Praetorian\" derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field–the \"praetorium\". It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person. This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry. In time, this cohort came to be known as the \"cohors praetoria\", and various notable figures possessed one, including Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Augustus (Octavian). \n\nAs Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion \"Equestris\", a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field. When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC, he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also. Thus, from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces, Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard. \n\nThrough the cunning of their ambitious prefect, Sejanus, the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself. In 23, Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome. One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace. Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own \"cohors praetoria\" against partisans of Sejanus. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.\n\nWhile campaigning, the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army. Seldom used in the early reigns, they were quite active by 69. Under Domitian and Trajan, the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia, while with Marcus Aurelius, years were spent on the Danube frontier. Throughout the 3rd century, the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns.\n\nThe relationship between the Guard and their Emperor was always sensitive. Bribing the Guard is a common theme in Imperial history. Sejanus almost took over the running of the Empire, before Tiberius overcame, and later executed him. A number of Emperors were murdered or otherwise deposed by the Guard, or with their knowledge. The first was Caligula. \n", "id": "246978", "title": "Praetorian Guard"}

It is related to the study of disease pathology and immunology. It is a branch of medicine and microbiology and includes five sciences: bacteriology, virology, parasitology, immunology and mycology.\n\nIn 1546, Girolamo Fracastoro proposed that epidemic diseases were caused by transferable seed like entities through direct, indirect contact and contact over long distances with an infection.\n\nLouis Pasteur and Robert Koch are the founders of medical microbiology. Louis Pasteur is famous for his experiments when he disproved the theory of spontaneous generation. He offered method for food preservation (pasteurization) and vaccines against anthrax, fowl cholera and rabies. Robert Koch contributed to the germ theory of disease, provided that specific diseases were caused by specific microbes.

Such laboratory receives almost any clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are identified based on biochemical tests. In addition, sensitivity testing is carried out to determine whether the pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount of drug(s) that should be prescribed for the patient.\n\nMedical microbiologist is also involved in teaching at all levels, and in research.

He was the first son of President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. Born in Springfield, Illinois, United States, he was the only one of Lincoln's four sons to live to be an adult. He was a bright lawyer, and mostly served railroad interests. He was (1897–1911) president of the Pullman Company. He was quiet and shy. Because of this, he never tried to be a president, but he was minister to Great Britain (1889–93). Most of his last 20 years were spent at Hildene, his estate near Manchester, Vermont.\n\nLincoln did not have a very close relationship with his father. This was partly because Abraham Lincoln often spent months away from home. Robert would later say his clearest memory of his father was when he was packing for a trip to Illinois. Abraham Lincoln was proud of Robert. He thought Robert was clever. Though they were not close, Robert respected and loved his father. He wept openly at his deathbed. \n\nFollowing his father's assassination, in April 1865, Robert Lincoln moved with his mother and his brother Tad to Chicago, where Robert completed his law studies at the Old University of Chicago (a school different from but later assumed by the university presently known by that name). He was admitted to the bar on February 25, 1867.\n\nLincoln was also present during the assassinations of James A. Garfield and William McKinley. He is the only man to have been present in the area where three US Presidents were assassinated. \n\nOn September 24, 1868, Robert Lincoln married Mary Eunice Harlan (September 25, 1846 – March 31, 1937). They had two daughters and one son. The last person who was directly related to Lincoln was Robert's grandson \"Bud\" Beckwith. He died in 1985.\n\n", "id": "247152", "title": "Robert Todd Lincoln"}

An equestrian by birth, Sejanus rose to power as Praetorian Prefect. He commanded the Roman imperial bodyguard, the Praetorian Guard, from AD 14 until his death in 31.\n\nAfter the Praetorian Guard was established under Augustus, Sejanus introduced reforms which saw the unit go from a mere bodyguard to an influential branch of the government. It controlled public security, and influenced civil administration. Most important of all, it influenced the succession of emperors: all needed the goodwill and support of the Guard. These changes would have a lasting impact on the Empire.\n\nDuring the 20s, Sejanus gradually accumulated power by influencing Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor's son, Drusus. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in 26, Sejanus was left in control of the entire state mechanism as \"de facto\" ruler of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.\n\nIn 29 Sejanus began a series of purge trials of senators and rich equestrians in the city, removing those capable of opposing his power, adding to the imperial (and his own) treasury. Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Only Caligula, the last remaining son of Germanicus, managed to survive the purges of Sejanus. He had moved to Capri to be with Tiberius in 31.\n\nThrough years of crafty intrigues and indispensable service to the emperor, Sejanus had worked himself up to become the most powerful man in the empire. Exactly what caused his sudden downfall is unclear: According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed. She sent a letter to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas.\n\nBy the end of 31, he would be arrested, summarily executed. His body unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs, which were a flight of steps in the ancient city of Rome. Nicknamed the Stairs of Mourning, they are infamous in Roman history as a place of execution. \n\nIt was done like this. Tiberius resigned his post of Consul, which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus' legal powers and protection. Another man, Macro, was appointed as Praetorian Prefect. Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. \nFollowing an issue of \"damnatio memoriae\" by the Senate, his statues were torn down and his name obliterated from public records. Although Rome at first rejoiced at the death of Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more extensive trials, as Tiberius relentlessly persecuted all those who could in any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. This included all the children of Sejanus.\n", "id": "247174", "title": "Sejanus"}

His career lasted from 1911 until his death in 1950. He was called \"the world's greatest entertainer”. \n\nHis singing style was \"sentimental [and] melodramatic\". This style made many songs popular. Jolson influenced many famous singers. Some of these singers were Bing Crosby Judy Garland, rock and country entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bob Dylan. Dylan said Jolson was \"somebody whose life I can feel\".\n\nJolson was America's most famous and highest paid entertainer in the 1930s. Jolson sang and acted in the first (full length) talking movie, \"The Jazz Singer\" in 1927. He starred in many other musical movies in the 1930s. A movie about Jolson's life, \"The Jolson Story\", won Oscars in 1946. Larry Parks played Jolson, but Jolson sang the songs himself. A sequel, \"Jolson Sings Again,\" was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II. Again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea. He did 42 shows in 16 days.\n\nHe sometimes performed in blackface makeup. This was a theatrical convention in the mid-19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against anti-black discrimination on Broadway. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "247194", "title": "Al Jolson"}

A media center usually has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) designed to be used with a living-room TV using a remote control. This remote control is commonly known by their designers as a 10-foot user interface. A media center typically allows one to watch movies (DVD, Blu-ray, and other digital video formats) and watching and recording television broadcasts, playing audio (CD as well as MP3, WMA, and other audio formats).\n\nThe media itself may be stored, received by terrestrial, satellite or cable broadcasting or streamed from the internet. Stored media is kept either on a local hard drive or on a (wireless) network attached storage. Some software is capable of doing other tasks, such as finding news (RSS) from the Internet. Media centers are often operated with a remote control, connected to a television set for video output, and can sometimes function as a normal personal computer.\n\nA media center can be purpose-built, modified or created individuals by adding media center software to a PC or some other computer, for example a Home Theater PC or an Xbox. Lately, some video game consoles (such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) with their network services can also act as a basic media center device by default.\n\nTypically, complete media centers offer the following functions to the user:\n\n\nThough media centers are often built using similar components to personal computers, they are often smaller; media centers sometimes have hardware that is not usually seen in personal computers, such as receivers for remote controls, or television tuner cards.

Simply put, any application requiring the playback of digital media based files, but not requiring the full features and flexibility of a personal computer stands to benefit from the reduced size, reduced complexity and reduced cost of media centers when compared to similarly equipped PCs.\n\nCommon applications include :\n\n\n\n", "id": "247203", "title": "Media center"}

Many medical schools teach the doctors to be to keep a professional relationship with their patients, to respect the patients' dignity and privacy. \n\nThis relationship has asymmetric information though. The doctor knows more than the patient, but has to explain the patient's situation, and has to ask the patient what treatments should be done. There is a very similar relationship between the patient and nurses, psychologists.\n\nThere are different legal norms that regulate this relationship. Examples of such norms are the Hippocratic oath, the Declaration of Geneva. Professional responsibility may also govern such a relationship.\n\nIdeally, patient and doctor trust each other. If they do, this can have a positive influence on the development of disease or condition. Healing can be hindered if the patient does not take the prescribed drugs, of if these drugs are not taken in the doses prescribed.\n\nIf the relationship is too good this can preclude efficiency.

Army ants do not. They keep moving. All army ant species are members of the ant family, Formicidae, but there are several kinds that have evolved on their own the same behavior.

Now, another subfamily Leptanilloidinae, is called army ants.\n\nA 2003 study of thirty species (by Sean Brady of Cornell University) shows that the ecitonine and doryline army ants evolved from one group in the mid-Cretaceous period in Gondwana, and so the two subfamilies are now one called Ecitoninae, but not everyone says this.\n\nThese are army ants:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "247228", "title": "Army ant"}

The word quantized is used in physics to mean that only certain values of something are allowed. Something that is quantized can be thought of as stairs; you can only move from step to step and you can't stand in between steps. Something that is not quantized can be thought of as a ramp or smooth incline; you can move any distance up or down. A lattice is the repeating or periodic structure of a crystal. A crystal is made up of atoms or molecules in a certain pattern. The points on the pattern at which the atoms or molecules are located is the lattice. Solids, liquids, and gases can all experience vibrations. A vibration being quantized means that only certain frequencies of vibrations are allowed.\n\nIntuitively, there is no reason for lattice vibrations to be quantized. The macroscopic or large-scale vibrations of a material are not quantized and can take on essentially any frequency. It is only when we consider the tiny vibrations of the particles that make up a material—atoms and molecules—that the concept of quantization and phonons becomes important. To understand why phonons exist, complicated quantum mechanics is needed. Without going into too much detail, the interactions between the constituent atoms or molecules of a crystal are analyzed quantum mechanically. Because of their arrangement in a pattern that repeats, when one arrives at a mathematical expression for the frequency of oscillation, one finds that there are only distinct quantized values allowed. There is unfortunately no simple way to explain this.\n", "id": "247425", "title": "Phonon"}

They are named after the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine.\n\nQuine was very interested in the \"liar paradox\", \"this statement is false\", which can't be either true or false. This paradox appears in lots of other places. In the mathematics of set theory it is called Russell's paradox, it is a set which contains sets which don't contain themselves. \n\nAll of those examples before Quine were 'self-referential'. This means that they define an object in terms of itself, like the liar paradox starting with the words \"this statement\". Lots of people thought that you could ignore the liar paradox if you just decided to ignore all self-referential statements. Quine saw that you would also have to ignore \"quotation\", which is the process that happens when you put a phrase in quote marks. When you \"say\" a phrase, you are talking about its meaning; but when you \"quote\" a phrase, you are talking about that phrase, and not what it means.\n\nQuine's paradox was, '\"Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation\" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation.' This is a more complicated liar paradox which is not self-referential. It is a simple statement about some phrase, telling you what happens when you write a statement where you write the phrase in quote marks and then write the phrase again outside of them.\n\nMost programming languages have quotation too: you can put quotes around some code and then the computer does not \"run\" that code, but instead just \"stores\" it as a string.\n\nThe trick to writing a quine involves writing a string which somehow has a \"hole\" in it, then outputting that string, with the \"hole\" filled in with its own quotation. For example in Python the function which quotes a string is called codice_1, and the codice_2 operator fills in a hole which is written as codice_3 in the string, while converting codice_4 to codice_2:\n\nOr in JavaScript, we can use codice_6 to quote an array, and the \"hole\" can be the space between the two array elements:\n\nIn CoffeeScript you can write a quine as a phrase followed by its own quotation, which looks a lot like Quine's paradox:\n", "id": "247471", "title": "Quine"}

It was in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea, when Israeli naval forces seized an aid flotilla of six ships carrying 663 or 682 pro-Palestinian activists from 37 nations, known as the \"Gaza Freedom Flotilla\". The activists were trying to breach the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian supplies. \nDuring the event, Israeli military forces seized a convoy of six ships carrying goods which should be brought to the Palestinian territories in the form of aid. There were 663-682 people on board these ships. The ships were headed to the port of Gaza. Israel had offered them to land at a different port, so that the aid could be inspected, but the crew had declined this offer. During the incident, at least nine people were killed. \n\nThe Gaza strip is part of Palestine. It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 1.5 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 km².\n\nThe Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory. They say, Israel is the occupation force, and it should withdraw, and give the territory back to the Palestinians. Israel has attacked and bombed Gaza several times, most recently during December of 2008.\n\nIsrael does not see things this way, since they gave over the territory to Palestinian administration in 2005, and have pulled back their troops over time . Meanwhile, Hamas, the Palestinian group which controls the territory, has launched it's rockets at Israel.\n\nHamas took over the Gaza Strip since the Fatah–Hamas conflict that was after the 2006 Palestinian elections Israel said Hamas to be a terrorist movement. Likewise, Egypt did not agree with Hamas removing the Palestinian Authority officials from Gaza. \n\nThe Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip was said to be a safety measure by Israel, but the Free Gaza Movement are opposed. Hamas, along with other groups had been causing trouble there and in southern parts of Israel. The blocked started in 2007. Many countries (like Egypt) feal sorry for the Gaza Strip, a few others (like Iran) hate or some how fear Israel and some (like the USA) agree with Israel.\n\nThe Turkish passenger ship Cruse Liner MV Mavi Marmara was trying to take Turkish and Cypriot aid to the Gaza Strip on May the 31st, when the Israeli Navy found it. The 3 year old blockade was upheld by Flotilla 13. The Mavi Marmara was 40 miles from the Gaza Strip when it was raided. 27 British activists, 9 Palestinian, 8 Turks, 2 Irish, 1 Swedish, 1 South African, 1 American and 1 Albanian were on the Mavi Marmara, along with a few others. The Mavi Marmara was followed by the Irish passenger ship MV Rachel Corrie and 4 other minor vessels. The ships carried a total of 663-682 activists and aid workers, including several Turks, several Malaysians another American, an Australian, and a Belgian.\nThere were in total 663 or 683 people from 37 nations on board the 6 ships in the civilian flotilla. Notable people aboard the flotilla included Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Corrigan, former UN Assistant Secretary-General Denis Halliday, Israeli-Arab member of Knesset Haneen Zoubi, leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel Raed Salah, Swedish novelist Henning Mankell, and a number of politicians from European and Arab national governments and the European Parliament.\n\nIsrael said that the other 5 ships were boarded and taken over peacefully, and that the only incidents took place in the \"Mavi Marmara\", but many reports that several people from the other ships were also wounded.\n\nThe flotilla had planned to break through the Gaza blockade, ignoring Israel's plan for the activists to stop at the port of Ashdod and transfer the cargo through there. After the flotilla's activists ignored repeated calls to give in, soldiers from the Shayetet 13 (Flotilla 13) unit boarded the ships at around 04:00 IST\n\nThe convoy organizers Arafat Shoukriof, of the Free Gaza Movement (FGM), denied the account of Israeli military. One of the co-organizers of the flotilla convoy, said those on board one ship had called them by telephone to say that Israeli helicopters had arrived to do a surprise raid. \n\nThe boarding of the \"Mavi Marmara\" resulted in violent clashes between activists and Israeli soldiers, though the details are disputed. \n\nApparently an Israeli helicopter dropped 30 specialist soldiers on to the ship. Fighting then broke out for an unknown reason. An Israeli trooper was thrown over the side of the ship, some aid workers rioted and threw chairs at the Israelis. The Israelis then used tear gas, tasers, stun grenades and smoke bombs to stop the trouble. Later several gun shots were fired by both sides. Finally, at the end of it all, an Albanian woman fell over the side of the ship. The soldiers, who used stun grenades, then asked for government permission to use their firearms, which they then received.\n\nThe Israeli military said that the troops were suddenly attacked after climbing down ropes from helicopters onto the deck of the ship. Soldiers were reportedly beaten badly, one was stabbed, and one was thrown in to the sea Two Israelis had their guns taken away. An Israeli commando said that there was live fire at some point against them from below deck. Stun grenades and tear gas were used in an attempt to disperse activists. After this proved ineffective, the commandos requested and received permission to use shoot the resisting activists. The commandos then shot activists in the legs, which forced them to disperse. The commandos reached the bridge and took over the ship after 30 minutes. Some fighting can be seen in videos released by the Israeli military and Free Gaza activists. The Israeli military released 20 videos of the incident,\nAccording to Major Avital Leibovich of the IDF Spokesperson's Unit, the activists attacked the soldiers with knives, slingshots, spikes, and clubs, and with pistols that were found by the Israeli troops. Adam Shapiro, a board member of the Free Gaza Movement, said that according to the Al Jazeera correspondents on the ship, the soldiers started opening fire immediately as they came down the ropes.\n\nThe wife of the Mavi Marmara captain, Nilüfer Ören, stated that IDF began tracking them after , there were 40 Israeli ships following and snooping on the convoy until the troopers were boarding the ships from helicopters at 04:45 am. She also said that stun grenades and smoke bombs were used. Therefore activists and crewmembers used gasmasks. Norman Paech, a former member of the German parliament Left Party who was aboard the Mavi Marmara said he only saw three activists resisting on his part of the boat and said \"They had no knives, no axes, only sticks that they used to defend themselves.\"\n\nReporters for Iranian TV and Al Jazeera TV news told of the use of tear gas/CS gas and stun grenades. The Israeli solders said that the activists wore gas masks and ski masks. Neither side were fully believed by the United Nations, who tried not to take sides.\n\nThe MV Rachel Corrie gave in and hoisted the white flag of truce when boarded by the Israeli navy.\n\nThe ship Challenger One sped up along its course in an attempt to allow journalists to take their photos of the ongoing raid. Huwaida Arraf, an American activist who was on the \"Challenger One\" reported that Israeli soldiers attacked any one who tried to block them from taking over the vessel with kicks, tasers, and stun grenades.\n\nActivist Huwaida Arraf reported that once on board the Challenger One, Israeli troops seized all communication equipment, cameras, mobile phones, radios and memory cards from activists.\n\nFormer UK diplomat Ed Peck, who was on board the ship Sfendoni, said that the Israelite troopers were well-trained, and behaved well. The soldiers scuffled with a few activists trying to block their access to the wheelhouse, but there were no major injuries, Peck said. Paul Larudee, a 64-year-old former language professor from El Cerrito, California on board the \"Sfendoni\", was beaten and tased according to his family by the US Consul General and his lawyers; his family has reported that Israeli consular officials informed them that Larudee, a pacifist, was beaten after not to follow the orders of troops.\n\nCrewman Shane Dillon reported that Israeli troops used stun guns, broke the nose of a Belgian woman among them, and beat another passenger. Australian photojournalist Kate Geraghty was attacked and tasered by Israeli troops aboard the \"Challenger One\", while attempting to photograph the raid.\n\nKutlu Tiryaki, a captain of the other vessel in the flotilla, said that the passengers did not have weapons at all, but only came to bring aid in a peaceful manner.\n\nThe final ship in the convoy gave in as it was raided and hoist a white flag.\n\n9-19 were said to be dead and 32-50 were said to injured. 10 of the injured were Israelis and 1 of the dead was a Turkish politician . Israel has confirmed four being dead. Among the dead is İbrahim Bilgen, a Turkish politician from the Felicity Party. \n\nAt least 32 activists who had been aboard the ships were arrested and incarcerated by the Israel Prisons Service, after they refused to sign deportation orders, including two who were wounded but refused hospital treatment.\n\nIsrael said that the navy forces \"found weapons ready in advance and used against our forces.\" IDF photos displayed knives, metal and wooden poles, flares, wrenches and slingshots with marble projectiles said to have been used against the soldiers. The activists were said to have also lobbed stun grenades at IDF soldiers, and the IDF showed video illustrating this. The Israeli searches of the ship found bulletproof vests, night-vision goggles, and gas masks.\n\nA press-release by the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel said that violence against the soldiers was already planned, and that \"light weaponry\" was found on the ships, including pistols that would have been seized from activists on the \"Mavi Marmara\" by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldiers. \n\nA close-up picture presented to readers of \"Jerusalem Post\" as: \"The array of equipment found on board the ships that made up the Gaza aid flotilla was as divergent as the flotilla’s stated aims\", showed some knives and clubs. Israeli troops also admitted to finding wheelchairs, cleaning supplies and baby milk onboard both the ships.\n\nA high ranking Norwegian officer stated after watching pictures that \"This is not military equipment\", and that most of the tools and kitchen knives would belong on a ship.\n\nHigh ranking Officials in the Customs Undersecretariat called the Israeli \"complete nonsense\".\n\nFor the most part, the diplomatic result was unfairly harsh to Israel.\n\nEgypt opened its Rafah Border Crossing with the Gaza Strip to allow medical aid to enter following world criticism of the raid. Hamas's leader Khaled Meshaal call for the border to be opened eminently. \n\nThe Israeli blockade itself against Gaza itself is not illegal, and it's okay for Israeli ships to operate in international waters to enforce it,\" said Allen Weiner, former U.S. State Department \n\nThe German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", said UN worldwide law says countries are not allowed to extend their rule on areas outside of their coastal waters. In Israel’s case, a from the coast.\n\nSouth Africa's Ambassador left Israel and returned to South Africa as a form of protest. \n\nTurkey's deputy parliament speaker, Guldal Mumcu, said \"[t]his attack was an open violation of United Nations rules and international law,\" and that \"Turkey should seek justice against Israel through national and international legal authorities. The parliament expects the Turkish government to revise the political, military and economic relations with Israel, and to take effective measures.\"\n\nLawyer Dr. Turgut Tarhanlı of the University of Istanbul cited the ideal of innocent passage, under which vessels are given safe travel rights in a manner which is not \"prejudicial to the peace, good order or the security\" of the state.\n\nCyprus stated its belief that NGOs must be allowed to do their work freely and lawfully. Further, it called for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza. \n\nThe rogue state of North Korea's Foreign Ministry condemned the Israel, which \"mercilessly killed or wounded dozens of civilians aboard the boats.\" It went on to call the attack \"crime against humanity perpetrated at the U.S. connivance and under its patronage and a blatant challenge to the Arabs including Palestinians and the Mideast peace process\". The statement also \"expresses full support and solidarity with the cause of the Palestinians and other Arab people\"\n\nThe rogue state of Iran Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei condemned the savage attack of the Zionist regime against an international aid convoy heading towards Gaza, and said the Israeli regime proved that it is more brutal than Fascists. Iran president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad said that the incident was an \"inhuman action of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people\" and that it would bring the regime \"closer than ever to its end.\" The Iranian government has called for a boycott of Israel. Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Secretary Saeed Jalili high lighted the need among regional and Islamic states to confront the Zionist regime of Israel effectively. Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the raid, saying \"the incident once again revealed the criminal and war-mongering nature of the Zionist regime.\" Iran also on the UN Security Council and the OIC to take swift punitive action against Israel.\n\nThe Irish Taoiseach Brian Cowen described the attacks as \"very serious\" and stated that he feels the blockade action was a violation of international law. He also stated that people are allowed to receive humanitarian assistance.Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said he was \"gravely concerned\"\n\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned \"the out sized use of force\" against the flotilla. \n\nBelgium's foreign minister, Steven Vanackere, called the use of Israeli force \"disproportionate\" and \"invited the Israeli ambassador to explain how things happened.\"\n\nThe Bosnian representative at the UN Security Council, Ivan Barbalić, condemned the Israeli attack, called for an investigation and wanted Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza.\n\nChina Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu condemned Israel's raid on the international convoy and urged Israel to carry out UN Security Council resolutions and improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nThe Bulgarian Foreign Ministry demanded the quick release of two Bulgarian journalists travelling in the convoy. In addition, Bulgaria condemned the attack, saying \"nothing can justify the violence that resulted in the killing of over 10 people on board one of the ships.\" It called for an investigation.\n\nProtest rallies hit the streets of Tottenham, Paris, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and Malaysia. \n\nThe Czech Republic had gone out in support for Israel and declared that the Turkish flotilla was made to provoke Israel in to a military or political trap. \n\nThe USA also expressed pro-Israeli opinions, while Nauru said Hamas was wrong.\n\nThe Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the Israeli action, calling it a \"criminal attack\" and expressed its \"most energetic condemnation.\" Cuba calls for the lifting of the Gaza blockade and reaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people. The former Cuban President Fidel Castro has condemned Israel's attack on the Freedom Flotilla as \"Nazi fascist fury.\" He added that the Israeli commandos who boarded the ships fired at the aid workers.\n\nMontenegro, China, Zambia and the UK called for a peaceful solution to the situation.\n\nThe representative of Gabon at the UN Security Council expressed his shock at the events. He further called upon Israel to lift the blockade of Gaza, and called all parties to end the violence.\n\nSwitzerland called for an international inquiry and summoned the Israeli ambassador.\n\nThe Holy See expressed \"great concern and pain\" about the incident.\n\nIsrael planned to deport all of the captured passengers within 48 hours of their arrival into Israel. On of 2 June 2010 Israel had decided to release over 600 of the detained activists.\n\n\n\n", "id": "247532", "title": "Gaza flotilla raid"}

(A \"reserved word\" is a word that is a \"part\" of the programming language and cannot be used for other things like naming variables.)\n\nIn Computer Science, there is a theory called the structured program theorem. This theory says that any program can be written in such a way that things are done with \"functions\" and \"methods\" (smaller sub-programs) instead of in one very big program and \"goto\" statements. The theory proves that the goto statement is not needed to write programs.\n\nA goto statement is usually used with a \"label\". A label is a word that identifies a place in a piece of code. A goto statement in code usually looks like this:\n\nIn this example, the computer would jump to the location of \"LABEL\".\n\nMany times the goto statement is combined with the if statement. In this case, the computer will only jump to another place in the code if something is true. For example:\n\nThis can be read as \"if \"some condition is true\", then go to the location of \"LABEL\".\"\n\nDifferent programming languages have different restrictions or limits on the use of goto statements. For example, the C programming language does not allow a goto to jump to a location inside of another function (subprogram).\n", "id": "247801", "title": "Goto"}

Dispersion is most easily seen in light, when all the colors inside white light become separated by a prism. \n\nWhen a white beam is shone at the prism, all of the colors in the light (colour spectrum) are slowed down when they meet the prism.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247942", "text": "Absorption spectroscopy\n\nAbsorption spectroscopy is a technique used to find out what makes up a sample of a substance – in other words, a chemical analysis.\n\nWhen a full spectrum of light (light with all the colours, like light from the sun) passes through the sample (which is often a gas) some specific colours do not show up on the other side. These colours of light are being absorbed by the sample. An image is created of the spectrum of light with black breaks where the light has been absorbed. These breaks are called absorption lines, and every element has its characteristic pattern of absorption lines.\n\nOn an atomic scale, this happens because of the electrons in the atoms of the sample - an electron can absorb light to gain energy. From experiments, electrons only ever absorb certain amounts of energy, suggesting an electron's energy must fit onto set, quantised, discrete \"energy levels\". The process of an electron going to a higher energy level is called \"excitation\". For any atom of a particular element, the energy needed to excite an electron from one specific energy level to another will be the same. This is important because it allows us to compare the absorption lines of say, the atmosphere of a far away planet, to the absorption lines of elements we know to exist in a lab. We can then reach a conclusion about what the distant planet's atmosphere may be made of.\n\nThe missing colours give us information about the energy of the photons that cause excitation. Note that the energy gained by the excited electron is equal to the energy of the incident photon (a particle of light), so only photons with fitting energies will cause an excitation. The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency:\" \"\n\nformula_1\n\nWhere \"E\" is the energy of a photon, \"h\" is Planck's constant (a constant is a set number that doesn't change) and \"f\" is the frequency of the photon. Since a colour can be described as a specific frequency of light, this is why the black breaks can be used to identify element(s) which the light is passing through.\n\nThe intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the absorption spectrum.\n\nIn chemistry, the technique is used to detect and measure concentrations of a particular metal element within a solution. The scientists atomise the sample (make it turn to individual atoms) and then see what light wavelengths it absorbs. Each type of chemical (element) absorbs a particular wavelength, so scientists can tell which chemicals are in the sample. Every element has a different atomic absorption spectrum because of the different light wavelengths it absorbs.\n", "id": "247942", "title": "Absorption spectroscopy"}

The number of objects that were found in Saxon burial sites around the village support this. These large, Saxon burial sites also indicate a good sized population, that lasted over many years.\n\nThe village was mentioned in the Domesday Book. By Tudor times, it had a population of around 200, with crops: wheat, oats, barley and even rye. Following a local legend Oliver Cromwell addressed the villagers on his way to his niece's wedding, in neighbouring Little Wittenham.\n\nThe village Cross has First Millennial origins: the base dating from the 7th century. St. Birinus preached here when he brought Christianity to the area. The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary, begun around 1120, is on the site of a previous Saxon church. Cruck Cottage can be architecturally dated to being around 800 years old and as such is (possibly) the oldest house in South Oxfordshire.\n\nThe building housing Pendon Museum, originally started life as The Three Poplars - a working man's pub.

It starts on the slopes of Mount Kosciuszko, Australia's highest mountain. It gets its water from the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales, and then flows through the Snowy River National Park in Victoria and finally into Bass Strait. Up until the middle of the 20th century, the river was known for the large amount of fresh water it carried, its wide reach and large rapids. \n\nThe river's course and surroundings have not changed very much, as it is protected by the Snowy River National Park. However its flow of water was almost stopped in the 1950's by the building of the Snowy Mountains Scheme to make hydroelectricity. Four large dams were built, at Guthega, Island Bend, Eucumbene, and Jindabyne, as well as many smaller dams and tunnels. Less than 1% of the river flow, as measured at Jindabyne, New South Wales, continued to flow down the river. Concern over the health of river led to an agreement between the state and federal governments to increase the amount of water released back into the river. From 2002 to 2008 the flow was increased from 1% to 4%. The agreement planned to increase the flow to 15% by 2009 and 21% by 2012.\n", "id": "248074", "title": "Snowy River"}
