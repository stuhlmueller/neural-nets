It is the home of the National Tramway Museum. It is set up as an Edwardian village and has a street with shops which include a sweet shop, café and gift shop. Other buildings in the open-air museum are the Red Lion Pub from Stoke-on-Trent, Derby Assembly Rooms, Burnley Tramways Offices and the tram sheds and displays. There are tram lines which go out for about from the village. There is also a collection of old street furniture from around the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trams that are in the museum used to run on tramlines along the streets of different towns and cities. Most of the trams at Crich were used in the United Kingdom before the 1960s. Some are from other countries. Many were saved and restored after the tram services in the cities stopped.\n\nBefore World War II, tramways were an important type of public transport in many cities in the United Kingdom. (Trams pulled by horses began to be built in the late 19th century.) After World War II, they began to close. Many people thought that the trams and tramways got in the way of motor cars and buses and that fuel for buses was costing less than the cost of making electricity. Most tram networks in the United Kingdom had closed by 1962. Only one remained in use, the Blackpool tramway which still runs today. \n\nIn 1948, a group of tramway enthusiasts decided to buy an open top tram that they had been on during the last tram ride of Southampton Tramways. For just £10, they bought Southampton No. 45, Although there were trams and locomotives in British museums, there were no working museums or heritage railways in Britain at this time, so at first the idea of amateurs running a tramway or railway seemed impossible. In 1955 the Tramway Museum Society was started and in 1959, the Society chose a place for the museum after a very long search. The site was found by the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society when they were taking apart the old track from George Stephenson's railway for a project in Wales. \nIn the 1840s, when Stephenson was building the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds, he had found coal buried under the ground on the way to Clay Cross. He decided to mine it and make some money. Crich already had a limestone quarry when he started. Stephenson saw that he could use this limestone and coal to make burnt lime for agricultural use and then use his railway to move it. To link the quarry at Crich to the limekilns at Ambergate, a new metre gauge railway was built, which is said to be the first in the world. The museum is built on part of the old Cliff Quarry, which Stephenson's company bought.\n\nAfter the Tramway Museum Society's members visited the quarry, they bought part of the site and buildings. Since buying them, the society has gotten many trams, as well as getting track and power for the trams. Many of the tramcars were also repaired. In 1967, the society decided that they would start a village around the tramway, as trams did not run in limestone quarries. This was the start of Crich Tramway Village. The museum got lots of street furniture, and even some entire buildings. Many of these buildings have been changed to hold the museum's collections of books, pictures, and archives. \nIn 1962 the Tramway Museum Society became a company and a year later it was listed as an educational charity. Since then, the society has grown with the help of people all over the world. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said that the museum has a very good collection. It was one of the first 26 museums that was told this in 1995.\n\nSince the start of the 2000s, the work of the museum's volunteers and the income earned by visitors has been added to by grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund The museum is still an independent charity; this means that the government does not pay for it.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the government of the United Kingdom decided that trams were a way of stopping the traffic problems in the UK. New light rail systems, or \"second generation tramways\", opened in cities like Manchester, Sheffield and Nottingham. Twenty years later more systems are being built, like the one in Edinburgh.\n\n\nThe museum has over 60 tramcars from places such as Berlin, Blackpool, Chesterfield, Den Haag, Derby, Douglas, Dundee, Edinburgh, Gateshead, Glasgow, Grimsby, Halle, Howth, Johannesburg, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, New York, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Oporto, Paisley, Prague, Sheffield, Southampton and Sydney.\n\nMost of these tramcars are double-deckers and some have open-tops. \n\nThe museum has about fifteen fully working tramcars. Every day that the museum is open, one to four of those trams are in service on the mile long line. There is also a 1969 Berlin tram that has been changed into an \"\"Access Tram\"\".\n\nMany of the trams can be seen at the museum. Some, such as Blackpool Dreadnought 59 and Blackpool OMO 5, are stored in the Museum's depot at Clay Cross.\n\nThe museum has trams using four different types of operation – horse, steam, diesel and electricity. Electricity is used for most of the service trams and works cars, but for one weekend each year a horse tram runs. The museum has five horse trams, Leamington & Warwick 1, Chesterfield 8, Oporto 9, Sheffield 15 and Cardiff 21, but only Sheffield 15 is used. The rest are on display. The museum also has a steam tram engine on display.\n\nMost systems have their overhead wire system built to operate with just one form of current collector (the part that gives the tram electricity). The museum has been built to use any of them, including trolley poles, bow collectors and pantographs. Conduit current collection is another form of current collection. Blackpool 4 uses this, and it was also used in London.\n\n\n", "id": "134585", "title": "Crich Tramway Village"}

There are about 90 species, mostly in the Old World and Australasia, Most species are tropical in distribution.\n\nTheir feathers are often bright colours, such as blue or orange. They have large heads, long, sharp bills, short legs, and stubby tails.\n\nMost species have bright plumage with little differences between the sexes. Most are found only in forests. They eat a wide range of prey, including fish. They usually catch prey by swooping down from a perch. Many live near rivers and eat fish, but most species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order they nest in holes, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in disused termite nests.\n\nBased on sequence analysis, the 90 or so species of kingfishers are now divided into three families:\n\nKingfishers are found all over the world. They often make their nests near rivers where the water flows slowly. They make their nests in tall river banks. They dig a hole in the side of the river bank. Most kingfishers lay 3–6 eggs each time.\n\nMany kingfishers eat fish. They sit on branches hanging over the river's edge and wait for a fish to appear. They then dive into the water to catch the fish. Some kingfishers eat lizards or other reptiles. Kookaburras do this.\n\nMost species are in the Australasian region, but the family did not originate there. They evolved in the Northern Hemisphere and invaded the Australasian region a number of times. Fossil kingfishers have been described from Lower Eocene rocks in Wyoming 50 million years ago (mya) and in Germany, around 30-40 million years ago. More recent fossil kingfishers have been described in the Miocene/Pliocene rocks of Australia (5-25 mya). \n\nKingfishers are easily harmed if there is a lot of snow and cold weather in winter. They can also die if humans cause a lot of water pollution or if the places where Kingfishers live are destroyed. Some kingfishers are endangered species\n", "id": "134749", "title": "Kingfisher"}

It is binary code used by electronic equipment to handle text using the English alphabet, numbers, and other common symbols. ASCII is an abbreviation for \"American Standard Code for Information Interchange\". \nASCII was developed in the 1960s and was based on earlier codes used by telegraph systems.\n\nThe code includes definitions for 128 characters: most of these are the printable characters of the alphabet such as abc, ABC, 123, and ?&!. There are also control characters that cannot be printed but instead control how text is processed, to start a new line for example. Those are in the left column in the table below. Most of the control characters are no longer used for their original purpose. There is no real formatting control (for bold or \"Italics\", etc.) \n\nSometimes someone talks about a file or document in ASCII, meaning it is in plain text.\n\nASCII uses 7 binary digits (bits) to represent characters: 1000001 (or 41 in hexadecimal or 65 in standard base-10 numbers) represents the upper-case letter A; 1000010 represents B; 1000011 represents C; and so on in sequence. Seven bits allowed a \"parity bit\" to be included in each byte sent over a serial port or modems, this bit is used for avoiding errors. This was more important years ago when connections were often noisy.\n\nASCII does not have diacritics (marks that are added to a letter, like the dots (umlauts) above vowels in German, or the tilde (~) above the 'n' for the 'ñ' used in Spanish). It was only meant for English and doesn't work well for most other languages. Some English words borrowed from other languages use these marks as well, like \"resumé\" (see Appendix:English words with diacritics).\n\nThis led to some systems using 8 bits (a full byte) instead of 7 bits. The proper name for systems that use 8 bits is called \"extended ASCII\". Eight bits allows for 256 characters. The first 128 characters must be the same as for ASCII and the rest are usually used for alphabetic letters with accents, for example like É, È, Î and Ü. This solves the problem for languages that are based on the Latin alphabet, although not all extended ASCII systems are the same. Other alphabets, like the Greek alphabet, Cyrillic alphabet need a different set of characters. And some systems like those using Chinese characters still do not work, as they use thousands of characters. So unicode was created to have one common system for all languages.\n\nStandard ASCII is still commonly used, particularly in computer software and HTML files. Until 2010 it was the standard for URLs. Often a web site that has fields for entering text will only take ASCII text. Any special markups for bold or centered text, etc. will show up incorrectly.\n\n", "id": "134849", "title": "ASCII"}

It is the only state flag of the United States to have the Union Flag of the United Kingdom on it.\n\nThe field of the flag is composed of eight horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands. A ninth stripe was once shown, meaning the island of Nihoa. The color of the stripes, from the top down, has this pattern: white, red, blue, white, red, blue, white, red. The colors were standardized in 1843, although other combinations have been seen and are occasionally still used.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for the earliest history of the flag of Hawaii. One said how King Kamehameha I flew a British flag, given to him by British explorer Captain George Vancouver as a token of friendship with King George III. Other visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor. An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the Union Flag could draw Hawaii into international problems as his kingdom could be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom, and he quickly lowered the Union Flag over his home. While argued as historically correct, one report of events that followed stated that in order to please American interests during the War of 1812, a flag of the United States was raised over Kamehameha's home only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha powerfully objected to it. This account then explains why the resulting flag of Hawaii was a deliberate combination of the two nations' flags.\n\nIn 1816, Kamehameha appointed his own flag to avoid problems. As a result, the current flag of Hawaii was born. There is debate as to the name of the officer: some traditions credit Alexander Adams, others George Beckley. The original flag was designed to feature stripes alternating in the order red-white-blue. However, some have argued that the stripes were influenced by the flag of the United States. The flag used at the first official flying of the flag of Hawaii erroneously placed the stripes in the order white-red-blue. The number of stripes also changed: originally, the flag was designed with seven horizontal stripes, and in 1845 it was officially changed to eight stripes (and at one point, nine but was changed back to eight). The arrangement was adopted and is used today.\n", "id": "134883", "title": "Flag of Hawaii"}

It was held in South Africa from 11 June to 10 July 2010. In the host selection, only African countries may be selected as host of this tournament. In 2004 FIFA selected South Africa to become it the first African country hosted FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe matches were played in 10 stadiums in 9 cities around the country. The final was played at the Soccer City, Johannesburg\nAll countries (except South Africa that qualified as host nation) took part in qualification tournament to qualify to the World Cup. In the first round all teams were divided to eight groups of four teams where team played with other three teams in group. Two best teams from each group qualify to knockout stage where teams need to win 3 matches to reach the final.\n\nIn the final Spain, the European champions, won the tournament. They defeated Netherlands 1-0 in extra time with Andrés Iniesta's goal in the 116th minute. Spain got their first World Cup title and they also became the first European team won the World Cup outside Europe. They also became the first team to win the World Cup after losing their first match. Host nation of this tournament South Africa, winner (Italy) and finalist (France) of previous World Cup were all failed the group stage. It was the first time when host nation was not qualified to knockout stage. New Zealand was only team that did not lose any matches but it also did not advance to knockout stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, the organizers released a list of thirteen venues to be used for the World Cup. They were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006:\n\nNew for 2010 is the Budweiser Man of the Match award. Fans vote for the top player for each match in the World Cup tournament.\n\nThe first round was also called the Group stage. There were 32 teams in the first round of the World Cup. The teams were divided into eight groups with four teams in each group. The groups were named Group A through Group H.\n\nEach team in a group played all the other teams in their group one time. That means there were six games in each group and 48 games in the first round. The top two teams from each group in this round advanced (were allowed to play) in the next round, named the Round of 16.\n\nThe FIFA uses the following method to rank teams in the first round.\n\nLegend:\n\nAll times are given in South African Standard time (UTC+2).\n\nSchedule\nSchedule\nSchedule\nThe games starting with the second round are known as the knockout stage. These games can not end in a draw (tie). If a match (game) is tied at the end of 90 minutes (the regular game time limit), extra periods are added to the game. Two periods, each 15 minutes long, will be played. If the score is still tied after the two extra periods, the game will be decided by a penalty kick shootout.\n\n<br>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28 players were suspended after being shown two consecutive yellow cards (13 players), a single red card (8 players), or a yellow card followed by a red card (7 players).\n\n\nThe Best 11 was decided by an online public vote, where people were invited to select a team (in a 4–4–2 formation) and best coach. Voting was open until 23:59 on 11 July 2010, with submissions going into a draw to win a prize.\n\nSix of the eleven players came from the Spanish team, as did the coach. The remainder of the team comprised two Germans, one Brazilian, one Dutchman and a Uruguayan.\n\n\n", "id": "134923", "title": "2010 FIFA World Cup"}

While the meaning of the colors has changed over time, these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the country's War of Independence. The current flag was adopted in 1968, but the design has been used since 1821. The current law of national symbols, Law on the National Arms, Flag, and Anthem, that governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1984. Red, white, and green are the colors of the national liberation army in Mexico. The central emblem is the ancient Aztec symbol for Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City), the center of the Aztec Empire. It recalls the legend that inspired the Aztecs to settle on what was originally a lake-island. The form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968. Aztec legend held that they should found their city on the spot where they saw an eagle on a cactus, eating a snake. There is a ribbon in the national colors at the bottom of the coat of arms.\n\nIn the early 14th century, the Mexica people were a wandering tribe of nomads looking for a permanent settlement in modern day central Mexico. They survived by hunting and gathering and were often hired to fight as mercenaries for the city-states scattered throughout the region. According to legend, their god, Huitzilopochtli, told them to establish a city of their own at a site where they would find an eagle eating a snake on the top of a cactus. The legend relates that the people saw the eagle on a small, swampy island in the middle of the shallow Texcoco lake. The Mexica invented a resourceful system of gardening, called chinampas, which allowed them to grow small gardens, eventually drying out the lake. In 1325, they completed construction of a city there. That city, which they called Tenochtitlan, became the capital of the Aztec Empire.\n", "id": "134950", "title": "Flag of Mexico"}

These changes are usually done to make a language simpler to understand or to write. Sometimes changes are done to make the language purer; that is, to get rid of foreign parts of the language, or to get rid of parts of the language that are not grammatical.\n\nSimplification makes the language easier to use. It tries to regularise vocabulary and grammar. Purification makes the language similar to a version of the language that people think is more pure.\n\nSometimes language reforms were done to unite the people speaking the language. For this reason, many language reforms happened in 19th century Europe when there was a rise of nationalist movements.\n\nThe most common form of language reform involves changing the spelling of words. This is known as spelling reform. Sometimes the grammar of the language is changed. Inflection, syntax, vocabulary and word formation can sometimes be simplified, in addition to spelling. English uses many different prefixes that mean \"the opposite of\", like \"un-\", \"in-/im-\", \"a(n)-\", \"de-\". A language reform might suggest that there is only one prefix to mean \"the opposite of\", for example \"un-\". On top of this, there are words such as \"good\" and \"bad\" that roughly mean the opposite of each other, but would be better (in terms of simplicity) portrayed as \"good\" and \"ungood\", so the word \"bad\" is not part of the language anymore.\n\nAnother good example of what language simplification can do is the word \"flammable\". Flammable means that something can catch fire easily. Originally the word was \"inflammable\", from Latin \"inflammare\" - put something on fire. \"In-\" is also a prefix that can mean \"the opposite of\", like with \"transparent\", \"intransparent\". Today most instructions use \"flammable\" rather than \"inflammable\", in order not to confuse people that the \"in-\" in this case does not mean the opposite of. \n\nSeveral major world languages have been subject to big spelling reforms: Spanish (in the 18th century), Portuguese (in 1910, in Portugal, and in 1946 and 1972, in Brazil), German (in 1901/02 and 1996/98) and Russian (in 1728 and 1919).\n\nSome people feel that it is bad to change a language. They want to keep a language the way it is now, or they want to take back changes to the language that have been done earlier. Sometimes, purism can make a language more complex, because people add false etymologies:\n\nExamples of language reforms are:\n\n\n", "id": "135267", "title": "Language reform"}

Capitalism began its rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as Genoa. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of mercantilism. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of feudalism, serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe period includes the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the European colonization of the Americas and the peak of the European hunt of witches.\n\nThe beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this phase from medieval to early modern Europe are:\n\n\nThe end date of the early modern period is associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of European politics.\n\nAmong the most important political changes of this time are the of serfdom and the change of kingdoms into nation-states. Then the Reformation, that meant that Christendom was no unified entity any more. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as English Reformation) converted to Protestantism in an attempt to slip out of the power of the Pope.\n\nThe intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of mercantilism and the publication of works of political and social philosophy, such as Machiavelli's \"The Prince\" (1513) and Thomas More's \"Utopia\" (1515).\n\nThe expression \"early modern\" is sometimes, and incorrectly, used as a substitute for the term Renaissance. However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe—especially central and northern Italy—and span the transition from late Medieval civilization and the opening of the early modern period.\n\nThe term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire.

This can be from an internal combustion engine (as in a car), water driving a water wheel, or gas or water going through a turbine. This rotating power is called torque. The load that is turned creates torsion and shear stress. Drive shafts need to be strong enough to take this stress. A light drive shaft will more efficiently move the power to the load, so there needs to be a balance between strength and weight.\n\nMost automobiles today use drive shafts to deliver power from the engine to the wheels. Most cars made today are front wheel drive (the front wheels have the power to move the car). In this case, the drive shafts are between the transaxle and each front wheels.\n\nIn rear wheel drive cars, there are drive shafts between the differential and each rear wheel. There is also a drive shaft running the length of the car, from the transmission up front to the differential in the back - in British English this is not called a drive shaft, but a propeller shaft, or prop-shaft, and the drive shafts may be called half shafts (since there are two that make one axle). \n\nThere are different types of drive shafts used in automobiles:\n\nThe Slip in Tube Drive shaft is the new type which helps absorb energy in a crash, protecting the people in the car or truck. It is also known as a collapsible drive shaft.\n\nDrive shafts have been used on motorcycles almost as long as there have been motorcycles. Many motorcycles use a simpler chain or belt drive instead, but drive shafts need less care, and have a long life. A problem with using drive shafts on a motorcycle is that gearing is needed to turn the power 90° from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.\n\nFarm tractors use a type of drive shaft called a Power Take-off shaft, or PTO shaft. This is a shaft that comes out the back of the tractor. It can be connected to any farm equipment that needs power from the tractor engine, such as a hay baler or corn chopper. \n\nThe drive shaft can also be used in a bicycle instead of chain-drive. They have been used for the past century, although never becoming very popular.

The International Headquarters of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is currently in London, England. The smaller faction, known as the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement, is active in 17 countries of the world. They are most notable in Germany, Australia and Pakistan. The International Headquarters of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement is in the town of Lahore, Pakistan where the Lahore Movement started. Within Lahore, Pakistan, are the \"Ahmadiyya Buildings Lahore\" which act as the international administrative base for the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement. \n\nControversial points include the Ahmadiyya view on the death and return of Jesus and their concept of Jihad. The Ahmadiyya community also has a different interpretation of verse Qur'an 33:40 of the Qur'an. This verse talks about the Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets. The members of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement are not subject to such criticism because they do not believe Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was a prophet. For this reason, they are more close to traditional mainstream Islam. Ahmadis (particularly the members of the International Ahmadiyya Muslim Community) argue that their beliefs are in accordance with Islam, and using arguments from the Qur'an, Hadith and opinion of Islamic jurists and theologians, challenge the contention of the groups calling them non-Muslims.\n\nAhmadis have translated the Holy Qur'an in all the main languages of the world. They broadcast globally on their 24-hour satellite television channels such as MTA 1, MTA 2, MTA 3, (For Arab viewers) and a recently introduced MTA Africa. Ahmadis have provided teachers, doctors and humanitarian relief workers in many developing countries. The fourth Caliph Hazrat Mirza Tahir Ahmad helped to promote homeopathy as a system of medicine by training practitioners through a regular TV class and establishing many free dispensaries around the world. The official Al-Islam website below is a vast online resource of books and videos explaining the movement's beliefs and answering common questions.\n\nThe Promised Messiah claimed that within three centuries people would give up the belief that Jesus would bodily descend from the sky and Islam would be the majority religion around the world.\n\nThe Ahmadiyyas are regarded as heretics by the orthodox Muslims because Mirza Ghulam Ahmad proclaimed himself the Mahdi of Islam, the Christian Messiah, and the final avatar or incarnation of Vishnu and also because they do not believe that Prophet Muhammad is the last Prophet. Based on divine revelations, he declared that he resembled Jesus in face and stature, and had been sent to 'break the cross', and show crucifixion to have been a fable. Thus, the majority of Muslims do not refer to the Ahmadis by this name, but use the derogative Qadianis (Qadian, in northwest India, is the birthplace of Ahmad) and Mirzai (referring to Mirza Ahmad). By using these terms, the point is being made that Ahmadiyya is a new religion founded by a particular person at a particular time, unlike Islam which is universal: Muhammad is a Prophet, not a founder, and therefore it is considered derogative to refer to Islam as 'Muhammadism'.\n\n", "id": "135336", "title": "Ahmadiyya"}

It has 19 lines, which together are 214 km (133 mi) long. There are 303 stations. 17 of these lines are Owens by RATP and 2 by Paris Airport. \n\nThe Paris Métro is a symbol of the city. Notable is its Art Nouveau architecture at the older entrances. It is the second busiest metro system in Europe, after Moscow. It carries 4.5 million passengers a day, and an annual total of 1.479 billion (2009). \n\nThe first line opened on 19 July 1900, during the 1900 World's Fair (\"Exposition Universelle\"). The system expanded quickly and the core was complete by the 1920s. Extensions into suburbs were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II. The Métro introduced newer trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations. Besides the Métro, Downtown Paris and its urban area are served by a number of other transit systems.\n\n", "id": "135339", "title": "Paris Métro"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135354", "text": "Boris Johnson\n\nAlexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson (born 19 June 1964) is a British-American politician and journalist. The ex Mayor of London, he previously served as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Henley and as editor of \"The Spectator\" magazine. In July 2016, Johnson became Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.\n\nJohnson was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Classics. He began his journalism career with \"The Times\", and later moved on to \"The Daily Telegraph\" where he was assistant editor. He was appointed editor of \"The Spectator\" in 1999. In the 2001 general election he was elected to the House of Commons and became one of the most high profile politicians in the country, partly because of his distinctive appearance and persona. He gained praise for several appearances on the \"Have I Got News for You\" television programme. He has also written several books.\n\nUnder Michael Howard, Johnson briefly served on the Conservative front bench as the Shadow Minister for the Arts from April 2004 until November 2004 when he was sacked after allegedly lying to Howard when denying he had had an affair with Petronella Wyatt. When contemporary David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservative Party in 2005, Johnson was re-appointed to the front bench as Shadow Minister for Higher Education and resigned as editor of \"The Spectator\" to concentrate on his new role. In September 2007 he was selected as the Conservative candidate for the 2008 Mayor of London election. Though some questioned his suitability for the role, Johnson defeated Labour incumbent Ken Livingstone and was elected Mayor, after which he resigned as an MP from the House of Commons.\n\nOn 26 August 2014 it was confirmed that Johnson will stand as Conservative candidate for MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in the 2015 General Election. He won the election and did not run for re-election in the 2016 mayoral election. He was replaced by Labour candidate Sadiq Khan.\n\nJohnson is the eldest of the four children of Stanley Johnson, a former Conservative MEP and employee of the European Commission and World Bank, and his first wife, painter Charlotte Fawcett (later Wahl), the daughter of Sir James Fawcett, a prominent barrister and president of the European Commission of Human Rights.\n\nOn his father's side Johnson is great-grandson of Ali Kemal, a liberal Turkish journalist and interior minister in the government of Damat Ferid Pasha, Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, who was murdered during the Turkish War of Independence. During World War I, Boris's grandfather and great aunt were recognised as British subjects and took their grandmother's maiden name of Johnson. In reference to his cosmopolitan ancestry, Johnson has described himself as a \"one-man melting pot\" — with a combination of Muslims, Jews and Christians comprising his great-grandparentage. His father's maternal grandmother, Marie Louise de Pfeffel, was a descendent of Prince Paul of Württemberg through his relationship with a German actress. Through Prince Paul, Johnson is a descendent of King George II of Great Britain and through George's great-great-great grandfather King James I of England, a descendent of all the previous British royal houses.\n\nJohnson was born in New York City, New York, USA, but his family returned to England soon afterwards as his mother had yet to take her Oxford finals. Johnson's sister Rachel was born a year later. As a child, Boris Johnson suffered from severe deafness and had to undergo several operations to have grommets inserted in his ears, and was reportedly rather quiet as a child. He was educated at the European School in Brussels, Ashdown House and then at Eton College, where he was a King's Scholar. He read Classics at Balliol College, Oxford, as a Brackenbury scholar, and was elected President of the Oxford Union, at his second attempt. Radek Sikorski has claimed Johnson touted himself as a supporter of the Social Democratic Party, then a dominant current at the university, as a strategy to win the Union presidency, though Johnson denies he was more than the SDP's preferred candidate. Along with David Cameron he was a member of Oxford's Bullingdon Club, a student dining society known for its raucous feasts.\n\nIn 1987 he married Allegra Mostyn-Owen but the marriage lasted less than a year, finally being dissolved in 1993. Later that same year he married Marina Wheeler, a barrister, the daughter of journalist and broadcaster Sir Charles Wheeler and his Sikh Indian wife, Dip Singh. The Wheeler and Johnson families have known each other for decades, and Marina Wheeler was at the European School in Brussels at the same time as her future husband. They have two sons—Theodore Apollo (born 1999) and Milo Arthur (born 1995)—and two daughters—Lara Lettice (born 1993) and Cassia Peaches (born 1997). \n\nIn 2001, Johnson was elected MP for Henley, succeeding Michael Heseltine, having previously been defeated in Clwyd South in the 1997 general election. In 2004 he was appointed to the front bench as Shadow Minister for the Arts in a small reshuffle resulting from the resignation of the Shadow Home Affairs Spokesman, Nick Hawkins. He was also from November 2003 vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, with an emphasis on campaigning.\n\nJohnson was dismissed from these high-profile posts in November, 2004 over accusations that he lied to Michael Howard about a four-year extramarital affair with Petronella Wyatt, \"The Spectator\"'s New York correspondent and former deputy editor. Johnson derided these allegations as \"an inverted pyramid of piffle\", but Howard sacked Johnson because he believed press reports showed Johnson had lied, rather than for the affair itself.\n\nHe was appointed Shadow Minister for Higher Education on 9 December 2005 by new Conservative Leader David Cameron, and resigned as editor of \"The Spectator\" soon afterwards. On 2 April 2006 it was alleged in the \"News of the World\" that Johnson had had another extramarital affair, this time with \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" journalist Anna Fazackerley. The video shows him emerging from her flat and waving to her in a taxi. Subsequently, in a speech at the University of Exeter concerning student finance, he allegedly made comical remarks about his gratitude to the audience for not \"raising other issues\" during the talk, which may have been a reference to the allegations. A report in \"The Times\" stated that Cameron regarded the possible affair as a private matter, and that Johnson would not lose his job over it.\n\nAfter several days of speculation, Johnson announced he was a potential \nConservative candidate for the London \nmayoral election in 2008 on 16 July 2007. Reported as saying \"the \nopportunity is too great and the prize too wonderful to miss ... the \nchance to represent London and speak for Londoners\", he resigned as Shadow Minister for Higher \nEducation. He was confirmed as the Conservative candidate on 27 \nSeptember 2007 after gaining 75% of the vote in a public London wide \nprimary.\n\nOn 7 May 2008, Johnson announced plans to ban the consumption of alcohol on the London transport network, effective from 1 June, a policy described by Jeroen Weimar, Transport for London's director of transport policing and enforcement, as reasonable, saying people should be more considerate on the trains. The ban initially applies on the London Underground, Buses, DLR and Croydon Trams. The London Overground will be added later in June 2008. Press releases said that the ban would apply to \"stations across the capital\", but did not specify whether this included National Rail stations - especially those stations not served by the TfL lines on which alcohol is banned.\n\nOn the final evening on which alcohol was to be permitted on London transport, thousands of drinkers descended on the Underground system to mark the event. Six London Underground stations were closed as trouble began, and a number of staff and police were assaulted. Police made 17 arrests as several trains were damaged and withdrawn from service.\n\nJohnson was present at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics as London's representative to receive the Olympic flag from Guo Jinlong, the Mayor of Beijing in order to formally announce London as Olympic host city. He was accused by Chinese media of being \"rude, arrogant and disrespectful\" for accepting the Olympic flag with one hand, putting his hands in his pockets and not buttoning up his jacket. At the subsequent handover party held at London House in Beijing, he gave a speech in which he declared 'ping pong is coming home'.\n\n", "id": "135354", "title": "Boris Johnson"}

Watson, and added the idea of operant conditioning. These two American psychologists paid no attention to mental states and 'thinking' (terms they thought were unscientific), but dealt only with visible behaviors. Skinner's work had effects on education (programmed learning) and on behavior therapy for various psychological problems. He was the Edgar Pierce Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974, and then Emeritus Professor until 1990.\n\nSkinner was also an social philosopher who wanted to change society, and wrote a eutopian novel, in which the science of human behavior is used to eliminate poverty, sexual oppression, government as we know it, and create a lifestyle without war. He wrote poetry, and three volumes of autobiography.\n\nSkinner was born in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania to Grace and William Skinner.\nHis father was a lawyer. Skinner became an atheist after a liberal Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the Hell that his grandmother described.\n\nSkinner attended Harvard University after receiving his B.A. in English literature in 1926. After graduation, he spent a year at his parents' home in Scranton attempting to become a writer of fiction. He tried to become a writer in Greenwich Village. He soon became disillusioned with his literary skills and concluded that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with John B. Watson's \"Behaviorism\" led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own operant behaviorism.\n\nSkinner received a PhD from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis and later at Indiana University, where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947. He returned to Harvard in 1948, and stayed there for the rest of his career.\n\nIn 1936, Skinner married Yvonne Blue. The couple had two daughters, Julie (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. Buzan).

The Stade de Suisse is currently the second biggest football stadium in Switzerland. The stadium has seats for 32,000 people. The field is 105 m x 68 m and has got an artificial turf surface. It was one of the venues for the European Football Championship in 2008. \n\nThe Stade de Suisse was built in the place where the old Wankdorf Stadium, which was destroyed in 2001, had been. It cost 350 million francs to build the stadium. There are solar panels on the roof. Very many shops are in the stadium. The stadium is 2 kilometers away from the city. The stadium was officially opened on July 30, 2005. However, the first game of football was played there on July 16, 2005. In the first game, The BSC Young Boys played against the Olympique Marseille. The BSC Young Boys lost by a score of 2-3. 14,000 people watched the game. The building's official name is \"Stade de Suisse, Berne, Wankdorf\". Still, most people call it the \"Wankdorf\". The building has also hosted Hockey games and musical concerts.\n\nThe Wankdorf was one of the venues for the European Football Championship in 2008 (often called Euro2008). Three games were played here for the tournament. During Euro2008, the real grass inside the stadium was replaced with fake grass, which is called artificial turf. The stadium's operators removed the artificial turf after the championship.\n\nAll the seats are either black or yellow, but there is one red seat in sector A. It is called the \"hot seat\". The ticket for that seat is often given to former players of Young Boys or famous visitors. The first person who sat in the \"hot seat\" was the most successful goalkeeper of the BSC Young Boys, Walter Eirich.\n\nThe official website of the Stade de Suisse (This site is written in German)\n", "id": "135484", "title": "Stade de Suisse"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135485", "text": "Ken Livingstone\n\nKenneth Robert Livingstone (born 17 June 1945) is a British socialist politician. He has twice held the leading political role in London local government: firstly as leader of the Greater London Council from 1981 until the council was abolished in 1986 by the government of Margaret Thatcher, and secondly as the first Mayor of London, a post he held from its creation in 2000 until 2008. He also served as Labour Party Member of Parliament for Brent East between 1987 and 2001.\n\nHe was initially elected as Mayor of London as an Independent candidate after the Labour Party chose not to nominate him as their candidate in the first mayoral elections. In January 2004, he was re-admitted to the Labour Party. He stood as the official Labour Party candidate for Mayor in the June 2004 elections, which he won with a total of 828,380 first- and second-preference votes. On 1 May 2008 Livingstone was defeated in his second re-election bid by Conservative candidate Boris Johnson, and his term as Mayor of London ended on 4 May 2008.\n\nHe has announced his intention to run again for the post of London mayor in 2012. In the meantime, he has been appointed as an adviser for urban planning to Hugo Chávez.\n\nLivingstone was born in Lambeth, London, England, the son of Ethel Ada (Kennard), a professional dancer, and Robert Moffat Livingstone, who was of Scottish descent and worked as a ship's master in the Merchant Navy. Livingstone has described his parents as \"working class Tories\". \n\nLivingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive School. He did not pass the eleven-plus examination in 1956 but still managed to obtain a few O-levels. He worked for eight years as a cancer research technician, between 1962 and 1970. He also trained as a teacher, qualifying in 1973, but was never active in the profession. Livingstone joined the Labour Party in 1968 at a time when party membership was falling and few new young members were joining, and rose rapidly in the local party. He was elected to the Lambeth Borough Council in May 1971 and served as Vice-Chair of the Housing Committee from 1971 to 1973 (succeeding John Major in the job).\nAt the Greater London Council Election in 1973 elections Livingstone won the Norwood seat on the Greater London Council (GLC) and served as Vice-Chair of Housing Management in 1974-1975 before being dismissed when he opposed spending cuts urged by council leader Sir Reg Goodwin. He also served on the movie censorship committee and urged the abolition of censorship. Coming up to the Greater London Council Election of 1977, Livingstone realised that it would be difficult to retain his seat and managed to be selected for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, a safe seat, following the retirement of Dr David Pitt, Baron Pitt of Hampstead. This ensured that he was one of the few left-wing Labour councillors to remain on the council.\n\nLivingstone had been selected as the Labour Parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead constituency. He moved to Camden just before the deadline to stand for the council in 1978, and was elected there. Livingstone's performance in Hampstead in the United Kingdom 1979 general election was good, although he did not come close to winning what was at that time a safe Conservative seat.\n\nHe married Christine Pamela Chapman in 1973 and the marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Around that time he became involved with Kate Allen (Amnesty International UK), now director of Amnesty International in the UK, but the couple separated in November 2001.\n\nLivingstone and his current partner Emma Beal, also his office manager, have a son, Thomas, born 14 December 2002 at the University College Hospital, London, and a daughter, Mia, born on 20 March 2004 at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. He also has three other children from previous relationships, whose existence was only publicly revealed during the London mayoral election in 2008. Livingstone is a noted \"bon vivant\", having twice worked as a food critic for London's \"Evening Standard\" newspaper and various magazines.\n\nHe is known for his enthusiasm for keeping and breeding newts.\n\nLivingstone again stood for Parliament in the 1987 general election, winning a seat in the north-west London constituency of Brent East. He replaced Labour MP Reg Freeson who was a committed left-winger, but his relatively moderate (\"sensible left\") views made him vulnerable to the hard left in the early 1980s. Freeson was able to retain his seat at the 1983 general election, but was deselected in 1985 after a bitter struggle, described as \"political 'murder'\" in his Guardian obituary, and replaced as Labour candidate in Brent East by Livingstone. \n\nIn his maiden speech to Parliament in July 1987, Livingstone used Parliamentary privilege to raise a number of allegations made by Fred Holroyd, a former MI6 operative in Northern Ireland. Despite the convention of maiden speeches being non-controversial, Livingstone alleged that Holroyd had been mistreated when he tried to expose MI5 collusion with loyalist paramilitaries in the 1970s and the part Captain Robert Nairac is alleged to have played. He also voiced Colin Wallace's allegations of MI5 dirty tricks levelled at Harold Wilson, part of what became known as the \"Wilson plot\".\n\nAs a Labour backbencher, Livingstone lost the public platform he possessed as head of the GLC; furthermore, his brand of radical socialism was increasingly out of step with the Labour leadership, which had moved sharply towards the centre under the leadership of Neil Kinnock who now blamed left-wingers like Livingstone for Labour's 'unelectability.' Over the long term, though, it was Livingstone rather than Kinnock who was to achieve electoral success. In September 1987 he was elected to the party's National Executive Committee, although he lost this position two years later; he regained it in 1997 beating Peter Mandelson in what some interpreted as a rebuke to Tony Blair. He was re-elected MP in the general election of 1992, with a 6% swing to Labour in his Brent East constituency. Besides serving in the Commons, Livingstone held a number of other 'odd jobs' during this period, including game show contestant and host, after-dinner speaker, and restaurant reviewer for the \"Evening Standard\". In 1987 he published an autobiography-cum-political tract, \"If Voting Changed Anything They'd Abolish It\".\n\nAs a politician comfortable in light-hearted and satirical situations, in 1990, Livingstone made the first of seven appearances on the topical panel show \"Have I Got News For You\". For a long time, his first six appearances would stand as the show's record; his current tally of seven - the last being in 2002 - fall one short of the record for guest appearances currently held by Germaine Greer and Will Self.\n\nIn 1995, Livingstone appeared on the track \"Ernold Same\" by the band Blur, taken from the album \"The Great Escape\". Livingstone provided spoken word vocals and was listed as 'The Right On Ken Livingstone.'\n\nLivingstone appeared in one of a series of advertisements extolling the virtues of cheese in the 1980s, appropriately endorsing red Leicester. On the other side of politics, Edward Heath advertised Danish Blue. Their respective choices are down to the colour red being associated with the Labour Party, and blue with the Conservative Party.\n\nLivingstone was again re-elected in the 1997 general election, in which Labour was returned to power under the leadership of Tony Blair. Among Labour's proposals was the establishment of a Greater London Authority which was to be a strategic body: unlike the GLC the Greater London Authority would not provide any services to Londoners directly. The new Greater London Authority would be headed by a directly-elected mayor, who would be watched over by a 25-member Assembly.\n\nDespite having earlier criticised the specific proposals for a new London-wide authority, Livingstone was widely tipped for the new post of Mayor. The mayoral election was scheduled for 2000, and in 1999, Labour began the long and trying process of selecting its candidate. Despite Blair's personal antipathy, Livingstone was included on Labour's shortlist in November 1999, having pledged that he would not run as an independent if he failed to secure the party's nomination. William Hague, then Leader of the Opposition taunted Blair at Prime Minister's Question Time: \"Why not split the job in two, with Frank Dobson as your day mayor and Ken Livingstone as your nightmare?\"\n\nLabour chose its official candidate on 20 February 2000. Although Livingstone received a healthy majority of the total votes, he nevertheless lost the nomination to former Secretary of State for Health Frank Dobson, under a controversial system in which votes from sitting Labour MPs and MEPs were weighted more heavily than votes from rank-and-file members. On 6 March, Livingstone announced that he would run against Dobson as an independent, confirming speculation that he would renege on his earlier pledge. He was suspended from the Labour Party the same day and expelled on 4 April. Tony Blair said that Livingstone as mayor would be a \"disaster\" for London; he later said he was wrong in that prediction.\n\nThe result of the election – held on 4 May – was a foregone conclusion: Dobson, who it was alleged, had been pressured into running by the party leadership, unsuccessfully based his campaign on claims that Livingstone was an egomaniac, and the Conservatives remained becalmed after their catastrophic national defeat in 1997. Livingstone came out ahead in the first round of balloting with 38% of first-preference votes to Conservative Steven Norris's 27%; Dobson finished third, with 13% of all first-preference votes – just ahead of Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer, with 12%. Under the modified instant-runoff voting system employed for the election, only the votes cast for Livingstone and Norris were considered in the second round, where Livingstone won with 58% of first- and second-preference votes, versus 42% for Norris.\n\nLivingstone continued to sit in parliament, as an independent having had the Labour whip withdrawn, until standing down at the 2001 General Election.\n\nLivingstone applied for readmittance to the Labour Party in 2002 but was rejected. In November 2003, however, rumours emerged that the Labour Party would allow Livingstone to rejoin, just ahead of the 2004 London mayoral election. Opinion polls consistently gave a poor showing to Labour's official candidate, Nicky Gavron, and many in the party leadership (including Tony Blair himself) feared that Labour would be humiliated by a fourth-place finish. In mid-December, Gavron announced she would stand down as the Labour candidate in favour of a 'unity campaign,' with Gavron as Livingstone's deputy, with Labour's National Executive Committee voting 25-2 to pave the way for Livingstone's readmittance. The deal hinged on a 'loyalty test' administered by a special five-member NEC panel on 9 January. The panel recommended that Livingstone be allowed back in the party. The move towards readmittance came amid considerable opposition from senior party members, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, and former party leader Neil Kinnock. In a ballot of Labour Party members in London, Livingstone was overwhelmingly endorsed as the Labour candidate for the 2004 Mayoral election.\n\nLivingstone was re-elected Mayor of London on 10 June 2004. He won 36% of first preference votes to Conservative Steven Norris's 28% and Liberal Democrat Simon Hughes's 15%. Six other candidates shared the remainder of the votes. When all the candidates except Livingstone and Norris were eliminated and the second preferences of those voters who had picked neither Livingstone or Norris as their first choice were counted, Livingstone won with 55% to Norris's 45%.\n\nLivingstone sought re-election in 2008, but was defeated by Conservative candidate Boris Johnson on a night that saw the Labour Party suffer its worst electoral defeats for forty years. Once first and second votes were taken into account Johnson had 1,168,738 votes, Livingstone 1,028,966 - a margin of 139, 772 votes or just over 6% of those who voted.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the count, Johnson paid public tribute to his defeated rival, praising \"the very considerable achievements of the last mayor of London\" and describing Livingstone as \"a very considerable public servant\". Johnson went on to say \"You shaped the office of mayor. You gave it national prominence and when London was attacked on 7 July 2005 you spoke for London.\"\n\nJohnson also spoke of Livingstone's \"courage and the sheer exuberant nerve with which you stuck it to your enemies\" and expressed a desire that the new Conservative administration could \"discover a way in which the mayoralty can continue to benefit from your transparent love of London\".\n\nLivingstone's greatest challenge as Mayor of London has been dealing with the city's ageing transportation infrastructure. Despite conflict over appropriate funding schemes and engineering challenges to modernising both the London Underground and the city's bus system, an Association of London Government survey, conducted by MORI towards the end of Livingstone's first term in 2004, suggested growing public satisfaction with public transport, with buses in particular being seen as more frequent and reliable.\n\nIn accordance with his pre-election pledge, bus fares were frozen for four years, but then the standard single cash fare on buses more than doubled. Further, and contrary to his pledge during his first election campaign, when he said \"only a de-humanised moron would get rid of the Routemaster\", Livingstone removed the famous Routemaster buses from routine service on 9 December 2005, claiming it was because the new buses were wheelchair-accessible, although several of the old buses are used on shortened \"heritage routes\". There was some question over the legality of using the old Routemaster under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as the Routemasters effectively banned wheel chair users.\n\nIn tandem with the removal of Routemaster buses, Livingstone oversaw the introduction of bending articulated buses. These buses have faced criticism for allegedly being fire-prone, dangerous to cyclists, and unable to navigate some winding streets; see London articulated bus controversy.\n\nLivingstone has been a strong proponent of the Oyster card smartcard ticketing system for London's public transport network introduced in 2003. In late 2005, Livingstone proposed large fare increases for on-the-spot tickets across the Tube and bus network to encourage regular travellers to use the automated Oyster system to reduce queuing at Underground stations and avoid delays in conductorless buses as drivers issue tickets. The plans, although ratified by the GLA and introduced in January 2006 were condemned by those who argued that the increases would increase the cost of travelling in London to tourists and others who do not travel regularly. Civil liberties groups have expressed concern over the way in which Transport for London is able to track the movements of passengers using the Oyster card system. Livingstone moved to make all bus journeys free for passengers under the age of 18 enrolled in full-time education who travel with an Oyster card and introduced initiatives to enable visitors to buy an Oyster card before arriving in London.\n\nOne of the key points of conflict between Livingstone and the Labour Party had been the proposed 'Public-Private Partnership' for the London Underground. Livingstone had run in 2000 on a policy of financing the improvements to Tube infrastructure by a public bond issue, which had been done in the case of the New York City Subway. However the Mayor did not have power in this area at the time as the Underground operated independently of Transport for London. The PPP deal went ahead in July 2002, but it did not diminish Livingstone's desire to re-join Labour. Metronet, one of the winners of the contract for PPP, subsequently went into administration in July 2007.\n\nLivingstone introduced the London congestion charge with the purpose of reducing traffic congestion in central London. Since being introduced the charge has proved to be controversial, though Transport for London maintains that traffic has fallen by 20% within the charge zone since the scheme began. One reason for the controversy is that whilst the scheme has been lucrative for its private-sector operator, Capita, some people argue it has not made enough money for public transport because the money has been spent on other things.\n\nHowever, its apparent success in reducing congestion has led to similar schemes being proposed in other major cities such as New York.\n\nIn November 2003, Livingstone was named 'Politician of the Year' by the Political Studies Association, which said his scheme was 'bold and imaginative'.\n\nThe United States Embassy for many years has refused to pay the charge because they argue it is a tax and not a charge on congestion.\n\nKen Livingstone has been called “an environmentalist, a leftist, a lover of newts,\" and has made a significant effort to reduce London’s impact on the environment. He began by creating the London Hydrogen Partnership and the London Energy Partnership in his first term as Mayor of London. The Mayor’s Energy Strategy, “green light to clean power,” commits London to reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide by 20%, relative to the 1990 level, by 2010. However, he does support the Thames Gateway Bridge in East London that Friends of the Earth say \"would bring few benefits to the local people and lead to more traffic, more noise and air pollution and an increase in climate-changing emissions\". In October 2007, London Councils stated Livingstone had gone back on his promise to help chair the developing London Waste and Recycling Board, and to provide £6 million of funding for the project, because \"the government had failed to provide him with absolute control of the Board.\"\n\nIn June 2007, Livingstone criticised a planned £200 million desalination plant at Beckton, which would be the United Kingdom's first, calling it \"misguided and a retrograde step in UK environmental policy\", and that \"we should be encouraging people to use less water, not more.\"\n\nIn 2001 Livingstone set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen as a \"step towards\" such rights. Legal status was later passed by the government through the Civil Partnership Act 2004.\n\nAfter rejecting the idea for a couple of years, Livingstone hosted a Jewish Hanukkah ceremony at City Hall in December 2005. He said he intended this to be an annual occurrence. On 17 March 2002 Livingstone introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to London to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, with around 250,000 people annually turning out for this. On 28 October 2006 he helped organise the first ever \"\"Eid in the Square\"\" in Trafalgar Square, in commemoration of the Eid ul-Fitr festival which marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting.\n\nAfter the 7 July 2005 London bombings Livingstone, from the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, where it had recently been announced London would host the 2012 Olympic Games, delivered a speech.\n\nFinally, I wish to speak directly to those who came to London today to take life. I know that you personally do not fear giving up your own life in order to take others - that is why you are so dangerous. But I know you fear that you may fail in your long-term objective to destroy our free society and I can show you why you will fail. In the days that follow, look at our airports, look at our sea ports and look at our railway stations and, even after your cowardly attack, you will see that people from the rest of Britain, people from around the world will arrive in London to become Londoners and to fulfill their dreams and achieve their potential. They choose to come to London, as so many have come before because they come to be free, they come to live the life they choose, they come to be able to be themselves. They flee you because you tell them how they should live. They do not want that and nothing you do, however many of us you kill, will stop that flight to our city where freedom is strong and where people can live in harmony with one another. Whatever you do, however many you kill, you will fail.\n\nLivingstone defended the police after the mistaken killing of a Brazilian man, Jean Charles de Menezes, who police believed was a suicide bomber.\n\nIn 2001 Livingstone revived the free anti-racism Music festival now called . He believes that this, along with other anti-racist policies, is why London has seen a 35% decrease in racist attacks.\n\nIn September 2005 Livingstone came out in support of placing a statue of Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa, on the north terrace of Trafalgar Square. Livingstone said \"There can be no better place than our greatest square to place a statue of Nelson Mandela so that every generation can remind the next of the fight against racism.\" He was highly critical of the Planning and City Development Committee of Westminster City Council who refused planning permission.\n\nIn 2008 Livingstone's race advisor Lee Jasper resigned after being accused of corruption and inappropriate behaviour. Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote has said the 2008 Mayoral campaign has seen a \"wholly disproportionate\" focus on Jasper, Doreen Lawrence (Livingstone supporter and mother of Stephen Lawrence), and others.\n\nOn 23 August 2007, at 12pm, Mayor Ken Livingstone formally apologised for London's role in the transatlantic slave trade. In a bicentennial day memorial event, he also called for the 23 August to be named as a national day for remembrance in the UK for the \"horrific crime against humanity of the transatlantic slave trade.\" He went on to make the following tearful speech and formal apology:\n\n\"It is because it is the anniversary of the biggest slave revolt in history, that UNESCO officially marks this day, the 23 August, the anniversary of that outbreak in Haiti, as slavery's official remembrance day. This is why we, in London, call for it to be the annual slave memorial day. We are therefore here to initiate London's annual slavery memorial day, and call for the establishment of a national, annual memorial day. In 1999, Liverpool became the first major British slaving city to formally apologise. The Church of England soon followed suit. In March I invited representatives of London's institutions to join the City of Liverpool and the Church of England for formally apologising for London's role in this monstrous crime. As Mayor, I offer an apology on behalf of London and its institutions for their role in the transatlantic slave trade.\"\n\nRejecting the idea that it is not possible to \"meaningfully apologise for something a former generation did,\" Livingstone emphasised that London and by implication the rest of the developed world still profited enormously from the assets accumulated in the slave era, adding \"It was the racial murder of not just those who were transported but generations of enslaved African men, women and children. To justify this murder and torture black people had to be declared inferior or not human. We live with the consequences today.\"\n\nIn March 2002, while still independent, Livingstone was accused of \"cronyism\" by some Labour party members in the London Assembly after he had appointed six officials as special advisers at a salary level which seemed to them excessive, and a manoeuvre to help his chances of being re-elected. Livingstone denied the allegations and stated the appointments were a \"necessary efficiency drive.\"\n\nIn December 2007, the \"Evening Standard\" published news of an investigation into grants worth £2.5 million paid to organisations in which Ken Livingstone's adviser Lee Jasper was involved. It is confirmed that some of these grants were paid directly by the mayor's office.\n\nFollowing Mr. Livingstone’s defeat in the 2008 Mayoral Elections, \"The Daily Mail\" reported that “Eight 'cronies' of Ken Livingstone are to receive £1.6 million in pay-offs following his defeat in the London mayoral elections.” Mr. Livingstone changed the rules for political appointees who would otherwise not have been eligible for severance packages, which paved the way for the eight City Hall advisors to receive an average of £200,000. Liberal Democrat Leader Dee Doocey stated that the payments were “completely inexcusable” and added that “It seems like there's one law for the ordinary working person and one law for the political class.” Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, said: “I think most people will be shocked. You could do quite a lot about knife crime with £1.6 million. It is odd indeed that the full benefits of labour laws designed to protect the vulnerable are being claimed by courtiers who knew they would lose their jobs if their master lost the election.” \nMr Livinstone refuted the comments by stating that 'It's a question of what the law requires. Either there's a legal responsibility or there is not.'\n\nKen Livingstone was publicly criticised in February 2005 for remarks made to an \"Evening Standard\" reporter, comparing him to a Nazi concentration camp guard, after the reporter had tried to interview him following a reception marking the 20th anniversary of Chris Smith's coming out as gay. The reporter, Oliver Finegold, was in fact Jewish and said he took offence at the remarks, but Livingstone refused to withdraw the remark and was subsequently accused of antisemitism. Finegold had an audio recorder running. \"The Evening Standard\" decided not to run the story at first but the following transcript of the conversation was published by \"guardian.co.uk\":\n\nThe epithet \"German war criminal\" and Livingstone's subsequent jibes refer to the Standard's owners, the Daily Mail and General Trust, which endorsed Oswald Mosley's Fascists in 1934 and supported Nazism until 1939. Livingstone also claimed the \"Standard\" was guilty of \"harassment of a predominantly lesbian and gay event\". Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell suggested in the Evening Standard that this explanation \"came across as patronising. Gay people don't need the Mayor's protection to fend off a journalist asking simple questions.\"\nAfter listening to the recording supplied by Finegold, the London Assembly voted unanimously to ask Livingstone to apologise. Livingstone responded by saying \"the form of words I have used are right. I have nothing to apologise for.\" Deputy Mayor Nicky Gavron, herself the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, said of Livingstone: \"These were inappropriate words and very offensive, both to the individual and to Jews in London.\" Some two dozen complaints were referred to the Standards Board for England, the body responsible for English local government standards, which passed it to the Adjudication Panel for England, which has the power to ban individuals from public office for five years.\n\nThe Adjudication Panel addressed the case over two days on the 13 & 14 December 2005 and adjourned the hearing for two months. On 24 February 2006, Ken Livingstone was found guilty of bringing his office into disrepute and suspended from office for four weeks, stating that he seemed \"to have failed... to have appreciated that his conduct was unacceptable\". Livingstone attacked the decision on the grounds that the Adjudication Panel members ought not to suspend a democratically elected official from power, describing their actions as \"striking at the heart of democracy\". The ban was due to begin on 1 March 2006, but on 28 February, a High Court judge postponed it pending an appeal by Livingstone.\n\nThe decision was later quashed by the High Court of Justice when on 5 October, Mr Justice Collins overturned the suspension, regardless of the outcome of Livingstone's appeal concerning the breach of standards. The final judgment upheld Livingstone's appeal and stated that the Adjudication Panel had misdirected itself, although the judge stated that the Mayor should have apologised.\n\nOn 7 December 2006, at a City Hall reception marking the launch of the London Jewish Forum, Livingstone apologised for any offence that he had caused the Jewish community.\n\nCriticism of Livingstone by the Evening Standard intensified during the 2008 campaign, with daily front page articles attacking him, under the direction of editor Veronica Wadley who originally urged Johnson to stand and who is closely linked to Tory leadership. According to articles in The Guardian and Time Out London, she is strongly influenced by the need to renew Associated Newspaper's multi-million pound contract to deliver the Metro free paper in London Underground stations in 2010, a decision within the gift of the Mayor.\n\nIn 2004 Livingstone said \"I just long for the day I wake up and find that the Saudi Royal Family are swinging from lamp-posts and they've got a proper government that represents the people of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nIn a March 2005 commentary in \"The Guardian\" he accused Israel's prime minister Ariel Sharon of being a \"war criminal\", citing his alleged personal responsibility for the Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982 and accusations of ethnic cleansing. Accusations that Sharon was implicated are frequently made by other organisations and leading politicians including the official Israeli Kahan Commission investigation into the massacres in 1982.\n\nOn 20 July 2005, Livingstone made the following comments in a BBC interview about the role of foreign policy as a motivation for the London bombings of two weeks earlier:\n\n\"I think you've just had 80 years of western intervention into predominantly Arab lands because of the western need for oil. We've propped up unsavoury governments, we've overthrown ones we didn't consider sympathetic. And I think the particular problem we have at the moment is that in the 1980s ... the Americans recruited and trained Osama Bin Laden, taught him how to kill, to make bombs, and set him off to kill the Russians and drive them out of Afghanistan. They didn't give any thought to the fact that once he'd done that he might turn on his creators. A lot of young people see the double standards, they see what happens in Guantanamo Bay, and they just think that there isn't a just foreign policy.\"\n\nLater in the interview he stated, about the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip:\n\n\"Under foreign occupation and denied the right to vote, denied the right to run your own affairs, often denied the right to work for three generations, I suspect that if it had happened here in England, we would have produced a lot of suicide bombers ourselves.\"\n\nCommentator Mark Steyn described the interview as Livingstone \"artfully\" attempting \"to draw a distinction between Muslim terrorists blowing up his own public transit (which he didn't approve of) and Muslim terrorists blowing up Israeli public transit (which he was inclined to be sympathetic to).\"\n\nIn November 2003, Livingstone made headlines for referring to US President George W. Bush as 'the greatest threat to life on this planet,' just before Bush's official visit to the UK. Livingstone also organised an alternative 'Peace Reception' at City Hall 'for everybody who is not George Bush,' with anti-war Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic as the guest of honour. In 2004 he referred to Bush as \"the most corrupt American president since Harding in the Twenties\". In July 2007 Livingstone suggested that Prime Minister Gordon Brown needed to explain to Bush \"that US governments need to return to a realistic view of the world. The US is the world's single most powerful country, but much weaker than the rest of the world put together. The attempt by one country to unilaterally impose itself on the rest of the world is not only undesirable but simply won't work.\"\n\nIn February 2007, Ken Livingstone signed a deal with Venezuela to provide cheaper oil for London buses. In return, the Greater London Authority advises Venezuela on recycling, waste management, traffic and reducing carbon emissions. This deal came under criticism from the London Assembly Conservatives including Richard Barnes, who stated that the \"money would be better directed at the poor of Venezuela,\" and journalist Martin Bright, who said that the deal \"effectively takes from the poor of Latin America to give to one of the richest cities in the world.\" Prices have been slashed by 20%; following this, half-price bus travel became available to Londoners on income support. Livingstone stated the plan \"rises on the suggestion of President Hugo Chávez and builds on the work his government is doing around the world in tackling the problems of poverty,\" and also said, \"This will make it cheaper and easier for people to go about their lives and get the most out of London. The agreement... will also benefit the people of Venezuela, by providing expertise in areas of city management in which London is a world leader.\" \n\nThe deal was discontinued by incoming mayor Boris Johnson (effective from September 2008), a decision criticized by Livingstone.\n\nA dispute with the US Embassy in London over payment of the London Congestion Charge escalated on 27 March 2006 when Livingstone criticised the Embassy's decision not to pay. The Embassy argued that the charge is a form of taxation, not a charge for a service, and diplomats and their staff are therefore exempt under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Embassy officials have never paid the charge, which was instituted in 2003. Livingstone, however, alleged that the decision was made by Robert Tuttle, who took up the post of Ambassador in July 2005. Livingstone described Tuttle as \"one of George Bush's closest cronies and a big funder of his election campaign\" and said he was trying to \"skive out of [paying] like some chiselling little crook\". The group Liberty and Law reported this remark to the Standards Board for England as a breach of its code, but the board chose not to investigate it.\n\nGermany stopped paying the charge in 2005, Japan followed in 2006, and in 2007 France, Russia, Belgium, and 50 other missions followed suit when the zone extended to their missions' locations (Iran, Sweden and Syria continue to pay the charge). Asked about Japan's refusal to pay in a March 2007 interview on LBC Radio, Livingstone responded, \"I think there are several problems with Japan that we could go on about here. Admitting their guilt for all the war crimes would be one thing. So if they've not got round to doing that, I doubt they're too worried about the congestion charge.\" London's Japanese embassy responded that their government had already apologised for previous war crimes.\n\nLivingstone acted as a stand-in presenter on London talk radio station LBC 97.3's Jeni Barnett for a week beginning on 30 June 2008. In July 2008 he announced his intention to run again for the office of Mayor of London at the next mayoral elections and signalled his intent to organise a \"progressive alliance\" of political parties (such as the Labour Party and the Green Party), trade unions and interest groups to defend the progress which was made during his terms as Mayor and to prepare for the next mayoral elections.\n\nOn 28 August 2008, it was announced that Livingstone will be an adviser on urban planning to Caracas, Venezuela. He will act as a consultant on the capital's policing, transport and other municipal issues. As a friend of Hugo Chávez, Livingstone was appointed personally by him to advise officials and mayoral candidates in Caracas, in order to help transform the city, which journalist Rory Carroll described as suffering from, \"Gridlocked traffic, a crumbling centre, hillside slums, horrific murder rates, corrupt police and inept local government\". Livingstone reckoned that in twenty years a \"first-world city\" can be made out of Caracas, stating, \"I have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which I will be calling on to assist in this.\" No decision on a salary for the ex-mayor has been made, although he mentioned that, \"The whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of Venezuela and as an unemployed citizen I would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise.\" The appointment follows on from the controversy surrounding the deal brokered by Livingstone in February 2007 for the Greater London Authority and Transport for London to provide advice to Venezuela in exchange for cheap fuel to help with bus subsidies. The deal was later overturned by new mayor Boris Johnson, and Livingstone offered his services to Chávez so that Venezuela gets the \"advice that we promised\". Livingstone played down any accusations that his close relationship with the Venezuelan President was controversial, \"unless you believe American propaganda\", while a spokesperson for Johnson said, \"Ken Livingstone is free, as a private individual, to offer his advice and services to whomever he wants.\" Livingstone is now being touted as a key asset for Chávez in the upcoming November elections in the country.\n\n", "id": "135485", "title": "Ken Livingstone"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135500", "text": "British Rail\n\nBritish Rail was the national railway company in the United Kingdom, from 1948, when the railways were nationalised, until 1997, when it was privatised.\n\nThe rail transport system in Great Britain started to grow in the 19th century. It was very close together, had many small 'branch lines', and many competing firms. Four of these lines were London's Staines and West Drayton Railway, the Sheppey Light Railway in Sussex, the Welsh Cambrian Railways and Welsh Highland Railway.\n\nDuring World War One, the railways were run by the government, until 1921. Railways Act 1921 merged most of the minor lines, like the Cambrian Railways, into the four biggest firms, who took them over. Complete nationalisation had been considered but was rejected until the Transport Act 1947. The Cambrian Railways joined the Great Western Railway (GWR). The Staines and West Drayton Railway had already been taken over by the GWR many years earlier.\n\nSome of the lines were to be under shared ownership and jointly run by some of the \"Big Four\" railway firms. These lines included the jointly owned Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GN) between the LMS and the LNER in eastern England, and the LMS and LNER owned Cheshire Lines Committee in Cheshire and Lancashire. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&DJ) became owned by the LMS and the SR in south-western England. GWR and LMS also jointly ran some lines in outer London.\n\nThe London area railway firms, such as the Metropolitan Railway, which become part of London Underground in 1933, were not merged. Industrial lines like the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway, narrow-gauge railways like the Ffestiniog Railway, and some light railways like the West Sussex Railway were also excluded. The London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), who run London Underground, was a state-run firm.\n\nAfter the smaller firms were merged in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, there were four large regional railway companies. The \"Big 4\" were the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR). The Transport Act 1947 made provision for the nationalisation of the network.\n\nThe Welsh Highland Railway had been deemed unnecessary and too costly to run. It was closed in 1937. The Second World War had caused damage to all the railways. They had lost a large part of their trains, buildings and equipment.\n\nThe Transport Act 1947 set out the nationalisation of the rail network, as part of a plan by Clement Attlee's Labour Government to nationalise public transport. The London Underground, some industrial lines and some remaining light railways like Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway were again excluded. For a short time, during World War II, the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway line was taken over by the military. After the war the line re-opened to public use in 1946. The Bicester Military Railway had been built by the government in 1941.\n\nThe Transport Act 1947 took effect on 1 January 1923. By that date most of the mergers had taken place, some from the previous year. The \"Railway Magazine\" in its issue of February 1923 dubbed the new companies as \"The Big Four of the New Railway Era\".\n\nThese \"Big Four\" were:\n\nSee also a list of railway companies involved in the 1923 grouping.\nThe nationalised Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) ran the railways in Northern Ireland from 1948 until 1966. They were then taken over by Translink and called \"NI Railways,\" also known as \"Northern Ireland Railways\" ().\n\nThe government of Northern Ireland and Ireland ran the former Great Northern Railway jointly under a Great Northern Railway Board until 1958. Most of the lines in the west of Northern Ireland were closed in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1955, a major modernisation programme costing £1.2 billion was authorised by the government. The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes occur as steam trains were scrapped 1968, in favour of diesel trains and electric trains. Freight now replaced passengers as the main source of business. One third of the network was closed by the highly critical Beeching report of the 1960s.\n\nA major railway survey in April 1961 was used in the writing of a government report on the future of the network. This report was called \"The Reshaping of British Railways\". It was published by the BRB in March 1963 as (\"the Beeching Axe\"). A third of all passenger trains would be scrapped and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would be closed.\n\nInterCity (or, in the earliest days, the hyphenated Inter-City) was introduced by British Rail in 1966 as a brand-name for its long-haul express passenger services (see British Rail brand names for a full history).\n\nPassenger levels fell steadily from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, but experienced a sharp increase after the introduction of the high-speed Intercity 125 trains in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1975 the Northern line ran the Northern City Line as its Highbury Branch. London Underground gave it to British Rail in 1975,\n\nBefore the sectorization of BR in 1982 the system was split into regions. Working around London, they were London Midland Region (Marylebone, Euston, St Pancras and Broad Street), Southern Region (Waterloo, Victoria, Chairing Cross, Holborn Viaduct, Cannon Street and London Bridge), Western Region (Paddington) and Eastern Region (King's Cross, Moorgate, Broad Street, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street). This was perceived to be a source of inefficiency, so sectorization made the regions into a single organisation covering all commuter services. At the same time InterCity took over express services and Regional Railways took over regional services. The group was originally called \"Provincial\".\n\nBR built 2537 steam locomotives from 1948 to 1960, some to pre-nationalisation designs and some to its own, new, standard designs. Eventually BR chose to end the use of steam trains in 1968.\n\nThe official report known as the \"Modernisation Plan\" of December 1954 was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety and line capacity, by making the railways more attractive to passengers and freight operators. The important areas were:\n\n\nLong-distance trains from Marylebone began to be cut back from 1958 after the line was given from BR Midland Western to the BR Midland Region. Then BR Midland Region thought it was an unnecessary rival of their Midland Main Line. By 1960 there were no daytime trains running to destinations north of Nottingham and only a few still ran at night. Many Express services were cut. By 1963, local stopping services beyond Aylesbury were cut. In 1965 freight services were ended. Between 1963 and 1966 only a few remaining long distance services stayed in use. A large part of the former Great Central Railway was closed as part of the 'Beeching axe'. This meant that Marylebone was now used only by local trains to Aylesbury and High Wycombe. After the 1960s, lack of investment meant the station itself became run down.\n\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\n\nBritish Rail Class 127 diesel trains were chosen to operate on the services from Marylebone usually to places such as High Wycombe, Aylesbury and Banbury which are on the Chiltern Main Line and Great Central Main Line (now the London to Aylesbury Line). Strangely, the 115 were under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable. They were similar to British Rail Class 127, but were superior as the class had larger windows, better seats, lights and wall surfaces. Both classes were made in the early 1960s.\n\nThe British Rail Class 47 (originally \"Brush Type 4\") is a class of British railway diesel-electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction. Their reliable and trusted service lasted well in to the 2000s.\n\nBritish Rail gave \"Class 52\" to the class of 74 large Type 4 diesel-hydraulic locomotives built for the Western Region of British Railways between 1961 and 1964. All were given two-word names, with the first word being \"Western\", and so the type was nicknamed \"Westerns\".\n\nSome of the early models were of poor quality and design, but many later kinds proved their worth in time.\n\nThe British Rail Class 207 (or 3D) versatile diesel-electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh in 1962.\n\nThe British Rail Class 423 (or 4Vep) electrical multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1967 to 1974. They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row and mostly found working outer suburban services in South London, and rural services in Kent and Sussex, up to replacement in 2005.\n\nThe British Rail Class 303 is a type of electric multiple unit. They are also known as \"Blue Train\" units, since they were originally painted blue all over. They were first used in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in Strathclyde.\n\nThe British Rail Class 73 electro-diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC third-rail supply, but also have a diesel engine to allow them to work on non-electrified routes.\n\nThe British Rail Class 86 was the standard electric locomotive built during the 1960s. It was made after the repeated testing of the earlier classes like the 81 and 85. The tests led to a much improved loco design.\n\nThe British Rail Class 312 is a type of alternating current (AC) electric multiple unit (EMU) built in 1966–1974 intended for use on outer-suburban passenger services. It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the British Rail Mark 2 body shell, and also the last with slam doors. Their passenger seats were an improvement on former types.\n\nBritish Rail Class 313 electric multiple units were built by BREL at York Works from 1976 to 1977, thus the first second-generation EMUs to be constructed for British Rail. They were capable of both drawing power via 25 kV AC overhead, or 750 V DC third-rail. They were the first units in Britain to have fully automatic couplers which allowed both physical coupling and also the connection of control electric and air supplies to be carried out without the driver's need to leave the cab. Their passenger seats were also an improvement on former types.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, railways continued to worsen, and in 1959 the government acted, limiting the amount the BTC could spend on British Rail.\n\nThe government proposed that many services could be provided more cheaply by buses, and said that most abandoned rail services would have their places taken by bus services. Only main lines would be untouched. Many other minor lines would be cut back or scrapped.\n\nThe business man Lord Beeching saw South Wales as a failing industrial region. So it lost the majority of its network. Since 1983 it has experienced a major rail revival, with new stations such as Llanharan reopening. Four lines reopened within 20 miles (32 km) of each other: Abercynon–Aberdare, Barry–Bridgend via , Bridgend–Maesteg and the Ebbw Valley Line via Newbridge.\n\nThe station at Laurencekirk on the mainline between Arbroath and Aberdeen was shut in 1967, but 42 years later in May 2009 it reopened. Other reopened stations include , and – all closed in the mid-1960s.\n\nHaddenham in Buckinghamshire lost its little-used station in 1963, but a more popular station opened in 1987 as the town grew.\n\nA major part of the report proposed that British Rail electrify some major main lines and the use of containerised freight traffic instead of outdated and uneconomic wagon-load traffic. Some of these plans were eventually adopted, however, such as the creation of the Freightliner concept and further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974. Also the staffs' terms and conditions were improved over time.\n\nSince the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, road traffic levels grew heavily in some areas. This has come close to gridlock. Furthermore, in recent years there have been record high levels of passengers on the railways. A modest number of the railway closures have therefore been reversed.\n\nIn addition a small but significant number of closed stations have reopened, and passenger services been restored on lines where they had been closed or removed. Many of these were in the urban metropolitan counties and towns where Passenger Transport Executives have a role in promoting local passenger rail use.\n\nA notable reopening was the Robin Hood Line in Nottinghamshire, between Nottingham and Worksop via Mansfield, which reopened in the early 1990s. Before the line reopened, Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a railway station.\n\nProfits from the railways began to fall in the early 1980s. In 1983, the civil servant Sir David Serpell wrote what became known as the Serpell Report. He wanted even more cutbacks.\n\nIn the early 1980s there was a proposal to close Marylebone and divert British Rail services via High Wycombe into nearby Paddington. There was also a plan to extend the Metropolitan Line to Aylesbury, so London trains via Amersham would be sent to Baker Street. Marylebone station was to be converted into a bus and coach station. London Underground said the Metropolitan Line could not cope with any more trains and was full up. However these plans were deemed stupid and clumsy, and were quietly dropped.\n\nThe funding of BR was reduced so they created the cheaper Pacer trains. The British Rail Class 143 is a diesel multiple unit, part of the Pacer family of trains introduced between 1985 and 1986. They originally worked around North East England but were later transferred to Wales. It was made out of bus parts put on to lorry chassis and train wheels. Earlier units proved to be unreliable, but later units were of a better design.\n\nThe British Rail Class 156 \"Super-Sprinter\" diesel multiple unit were built from 1987 to 1989 to replace elderly First Generation \"Heritage\" DMUs (like the Class 127 units) and locomotive-hauled passenger trains.\n\nAs funding increased before privatisation the successful British Rail Class 158 \"Express Sprinter\" was made. It is a type of diesel multiple unit (DMU) train. They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Works.\n\nOn 12 December 1988, three commuter trains crashed, just south-west of Clapham junction station, in London. 35 people died and more than 100 were injured. British Rail's 30-year-old vintage Mark 1 carriages were found out to be dangerous and the broken signalling equipment was fixed and improved.\n\nThe British government under John Major said that privatisation would help passenger services, but this did not happen until much later.\n\nThe Scottish Assembly Government have re-opened the lines between Hamilton and Larkhall, Alloa and Stirling and is working on a link from Airdrie to Bathgate. The biggest line-reopening project is the former Waverley railway Edinburgh to Borders line.\n\nThe Welsh Assembly Government has re-opened the Vale of Glamorgan Line between Barry Bock and Bridgend in 2005. The Ebbw Valley Line reopened between Ebbw Vale and Cardiff in the year 2008. It will later go on to services to Newport in Gwent in 2011. The Barry–Bridgend route was closed after the Beeching report of March 1963. The line's passenger service was officially shut down in June 1964, but freight continued until the late 1990s.\n\nSome English stations like Corby and Mansfield were reopened after privatisation.\nYet more stations were reopened by British Rail in Scotland, England and Wales before privatisation when the railway was run properly.\n\nTrain fares cost more than under British Rail.\n\nRegional Railways was one of the three passenger sectors of British Rail. It was created in the year 1982. It finished operation in 1996, two years after privatisation. In the privatisation of British Rail, InterCity trains were divided up into several franchises. The Caledonian Sleeper are transferred to ScotRail, now First ScotRail.\n\nSince privatisation, the number of companies has changed a number of times as rules have changed and the areas covered altered. The companies that took over passenger rail services include:\n\n\"Six sub-brands also occurred in the early 2000s:\"\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wales and Borders, now part of Arriva Trains Wales.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Wessex Trains, now part of First Great Western.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Silverlink Metro, now London Overground.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Silverlink County, now part of London Midland.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> West Anglia, now part of National Express East Anglia.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Great Northern Electrics, now part of National Express East Anglia.\n\nThe British Rail \"double arrow\" logo was said to show direction of travel on a double track railway on a railway map and was nicknamed \"the arrow of indecision\". It is now employed as a general symbol on street signs in Great Britain, but not in Northern Ireland, denoting railway stations, and as part of the Association of Train Operating Companies (A.T.O.C.)'s joint-managed National Rail brand, still being printed on railway tickets.\n\nSometimes strikes happened among British Rail staff, over staff pay, safety, working hours and alike. There were several strikes in the late 1970s, but decreased after privatisation. There were also several other strikes in the late 1970s. Other firms like the UK's coal mines also struck at this time.\n", "id": "135500", "title": "British Rail"}

It has huge tracts of excellent grazing after good rains.\n\nThe Kalahari Desert is the southern part of Africa, and the geography is a portion of desert and a plateau. The Kalahari supports some animals and plants because most of it is not a true desert. There are small amounts of rainfall and the summer temperature is very high.

The only permanent river, the Okavango, flows into a delta in the northwest, forming marshes that are rich in wildlife. Ancient dry riverbeds—called omuramba—traverse the Central Northern reaches of the Kalahari and provide standing pools of water during the rainy season. Previously havens for wild animals from elephant to giraffe, and for predators such as lion and cheetah, the riverbeds are now mostly grazing spots, though leopard or cheetah can still be found.\n\nThe Kalahari has a number of game reserves—the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR, the world's second largest protected area), Khutse Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Animals that live in the region include brown hyenas, lions, meerkats, giraffe, warthogs, jackals and several species of antelope (including the eland, gemsbok, springbok, hartebeest, steenbok, kudu, and duiker), and many species of bird and reptiles. Vegetation in the Kalahari consists mainly of grasses and acacias but there are over 400 identified plant species present (including the wild watermelon or Tsamma melon).\n\nThe Bushmen of the Kalahari were hunter/gatherers. They hunted for meat and gathered the food of the desert to eat. They did not keep animals. They moved from place to place to find food and water.

He tried to rid them of Hinduism, and convert them to Islam. He took slaves, gold and jewels from the Indians. His raid of Punjab was the last invasion where he increased his territory in India. From then on, most of Mahmud’s raids were to gain wealth. Mahmud's last and most famous raid was on Somnath. This is a temple city on the Gujarati coast that was also a pilgrimage site. The temple had many riches: heavy golden chains and thousands of jewels. The battle was violent, and more than 50,000 people died.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135563", "text": "Abnormal psychology\n\nAbnormal psychology is a part of psychology. People who study abnormal psychology are psychologists. They are scientists that investigate the mind using the scientific method. Different cultures tend to have different ideas of how strange (abnormal) any behaviour is considered. This tends to change over time within cultures, so people that live in a country at one time in history might consider abnormal what people who live in the same country consider normal years before before or years later.\n\nAbnormal psychology is often used to understand or to treat people with mental disorders to make life better for them. This is because abnormal behaviour is often defined as when someone is not able to change how they behave to fit different settings. This is often also used to define some mental disorders. When someone cannot change their behaviour to fit the people and situations around them when they need to, it can cause suffering, and the person may be uncomfortable when around people. Their behaviour can be unreasonable and hard to understand. Their behaviour can even be dangerous.\n\nNot everyone with a mental disorder is unable to adjust to their surroundings. People who can change to fit their the environment around them more easily than most people can also have behaviour that is considered abnormal and might also have an easier life with the help of a psychologist.\n\nA supernatural belief is a belief in a force that is beyond scientific understanding. There are a lot of cultures that believe in supernatural events. These cultures include religious cultures, as well as the Ancient Chinese, Ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Ancient Greeks. These cultures have writings that say abnormal behaviour in the form of supernatural events created demons or Gods that would take over a person and act through those people. This was called possession. In the Roman Catholic Church, exorcisms were done to make these demons leave the body of the individuals they possessed. Exorcism involved prayer, noises and potions. People who had abnormal behaviour were often told they were possessed.\n\nIn some cultures, trepanation was often used. This was when a hole was made in someone's head to release the \"bad spirit\".\n\n\"Lunatic asylums\" were buildings that kept patients that had abnormal behaviour. They became popular in Europe with the Madhouse Act of 1774, although they did exist before the Act. Asylums were meant to look after people who could not take care of themselves. But they were known for being cruel and abusive to their patients. The buildings were often dirty and not looked after very well.\n\nDuring the late 1700s, William Tuke made a religious retreat for patients. This was a turn away from the horrors of mental asylums. Also, in the late 1700s, Philippe Pinel started to encourage better treatment of the mentally insane.\n\nToday the 18th-century lunatic asylum does not exist. Most of the asylums were closed in the late 1900s because of the invention of antipsychotic medicines. Today, there are psychiatric hospitals for people with mental illness. This includes Broadmoor Hospital, which houses some of Britain's the most dangerous criminals with mental illnesses.\n\nIn the 1800s, Dorothea Dix fought against the bad treatment of patients in mental asylums. She started a \"mental hygiene\" group to encourage politicians to change the treatment of mental patients in the United States. When people became aware of the wrongdoing in mental asylums, money was raised to improve the treatment of patients and the asylums. Dix is thought to have helped to create 32 mental hospitals. By 1940 there were more than 400,000 patients living in mental asylums.\n\nMost treatments were still cruel to patients and were not effective. The asylums were quickly becoming overcrowded. Mary Jane Ward wrote a book in 1946 called \"The Snake Pit\" that raised awareness of the inhumane treatment of mental patients.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health was created the same year. The organisation provided training and support for mental patients and workers that cared for them. The Hill-Burton Act was passed to give money to the mental health hospitals.\n\nLater, the Community Health Services Act of 1963 was passed. This law which created outpatient buildings for patients to live at home rather than in hospitals. Rehabilitation and community care centers were also built under this act.\n\nDuring the late 1900s, mental asylums were less accepted. The cruel treatment of patients and the overcrowding and ways of living were seen as not needed. Less money was being given to asylums. So many closed all around the world. The closing down of mental hospitals became known as deinstitutionalization. The movement from asylum to community was meant to help patients' development and recovery. The lack of good support programs meant that patients felt abandoned and found it hard to fit into normal life. This led to many becoming homeless.\n\nIn the past there were three ways to explain abnormal behaviour. These were supernatural, biological, and psychological explanations. Western medicine no longer uses supernatural explanations. Instead we use biological and psychological explanations. Biological explanations use genetics and neuroscience to explain abnormal behaviours. The biological explanation is based on how the brain works and how genes change the way it works. Psychological explanations use how the mind works to explain abnormal behaviours.\n\nEarly cultures believed that abnormal behaviour was from demons, spirits and astrology. Trepanation was when a hole was drilled in a person's head. This was done to let the spirits or demons out of the person's head.\n\nExorcism was practiced mainly by the Catholic Church. Exorcism was believed to ward the spirits out of the person that they possessed.\n\nThese practices were normal during the Middle Ages. This was when abnormal behaviour was thought to be a religious issue rather than a psychological one. Some abnormal behaviour was thought to be witchcraft. People accused of witchcraft were almost always punished for the acts. In many cases, the punishment was to be murdered.\n\nThe Biological approach to explaining abnormal behaviour assumes that the behaviour can be explained by physical factors. Hippocrates was a man who lived during the 5th century and is thought by many to be the father of modern medicine. He did not accept that evil spirits or astronomy were the causes of psychological disorders. Hippocrates believed that there were natural causes for the disorders and appropriate treatments could be found. He focused on the \"four humors\" of the brain. He believed that the four humours must be balanced for healthy mental states and when one humour was stronger, various disorders would appear. To balance the humors, Hippocrates would tell patients to change their lifestyles. There are now new ideas when talking about the biological explanations of psychological disorders. But, Hippocrates' focus on mental processes and clinical practice was a revolutionary concept.\n\nAnother Greek physician called Galen also took a scientific approach to the causes of psychological disorders. He divided them into physical and mental categories. Among Galen's causes were head injuries, alcohol abuse, and life experiences. During the 18th century, Galen's concepts influenced the medical industry. Galen's focus was on the biological causes for mental disorders.\n\nPsychological explanations for abnormal behavior sometimes take a behavioral approach in which the positive behaviors are reinforced and negative ones are not. This approach is more focused on changing the actual behavior of a person than the true cause of it.\n\nSigmund Freud was one of the most popular psychological theorists of the 20th century. The method he used to study and treat patients was known as psychoanalysis. Methods of hypnosis by were used by Freud, but also by Franz Mesmer and physicians in the Nancy School. However, Freud attempted to have his patients confess their deepest, truest emotions, which was referred to as a catharsis. He would have his patients speak freely about themselves, in free association. Also he would conduct dream analysis where patients would record and discuss their dreams. Freud's work led to other great psychoanalytic theorists such as Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, and Harry Stack Sullivan. Wilhelm Wundt and William James were credited for opening up the first experimental psychology laboratories. This led to many studies and psychological methods, such as classical conditioning led by Ivan Pavlov and John B. Skinner, while Edward Thorndike and B. F. Skinner were the leaders of the study of operant conditioning.\n\nThe North American reference book used by psychiatrists and psychologists to diagnose and treat psychological disorders is known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). It is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The most recent version was released in May of 2013 and is known as the DSM-5. The DSM is relied upon by clinicians, health insurance companies, medicine companies, and the legal system as a reference for understanding and identifying mental disorders. The DSM divides mental disorders into groups and provides descriptive signs and symptoms that define each disorder. In addition, it lists statistics for each disorder ranging from its frequency in the general population to the most effective form of treatment.\n\nBefore diagnosing an individual with a \"specific\" mental disorder, a professional must first determine whether that individual does in fact suffer from a mental disorder. The DSM defines a mental disorder as a condition that:\n\n\nWhen using the DSM, a complete psychiatric diagnosis is split up into five dimensions, called \"axes\", that relate to different characteristics of disability or disorder:\n\n\nThe separate axes of the DSM are often linked together in the development of mental disorders.\n\nThe International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) was created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is the universal diagnostic system for mental disorders. The ICD is approved by health officials from 193 WHO member countries, and is available for free on the internet. Its purpose is to help countries reduce the problems associated with mental disorders. The coding system used in the DSM is designed to be compatible with the system used in the ICD; however, some codes may not match because the two publications get revised at different times. The ICD-10 was made public in 1994; its most recent update occurred in 2010. Chapter 5 of the ICD-10 covers over 300 mental and behavioral disorders which are divided into the following categories:\n\n\n\"The Online ICD-10 can be found in its entirety here\"\n\nPsychoanalysis is a form of therapy based on psychoanalytic theory. This theory states that human behavior is controlled by unconscious forces such as instinct and that there is no such thing as free will. Many ideas found in the Psychoanalytic theory can be traced back to the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud. Freud believed mental disorders are a result of repressed memories and emotions from childhood; psychoanalysis is designed to search for these hidden memories and emotions and bring them to the patient's attention. Techniques such as hypnosis are used to tap into the unconscious mind with the hopes that the source of the disturbance is found. Freud also believed dreams had hidden meanings, and often asked patients to record their dreams for analysis. Because of the lack of scientific evidence supporting most Freudian ideas, psychoanalysis is rarely used by clinical psychologists and has been replaced by more effective forms of therapy.\n\nBehavior therapy is based on the theory of behaviorism, which states that all human behavior is a result of a stimulus and reinforcement. Famous behaviorists include James Watson, B.F. Skinner, and Joseph Wolpe. The goal of this therapy is to increase one's positive or socially reinforcing behavior. Behavior therapy can be broken down into three areas:\n\nHumanistic therapy is a method taken from Carl Rogers, which aims to focus on a client as a human rather than the problem that they have. A therapist can adjust the environment and mood of a session in a way that mimics normal conversation. This often helps the patient realize the issues they have, and share them with the therapist more successfully than in a traditional counseling session. Humanistic therapy creates an effective means of getting to the source of a problem and treating it properly.\n\nRoger's own term was \"client-centered therapy\", which has the idea that the therapist is helping the client to become a genuine psychological adult.\n", "id": "135563", "title": "Abnormal psychology"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=135566", "text": "John B. Watson\n\nJohn Broadus Watson (January 9, 1878–September 25, 1958) was an American psychologist. He established the psychological school of behaviorism, after doing research on animal behavior. This school was extremely influential in the middle of the 20th century, when B.F. Skinner developed it further.\n\nWatson was forced to resign his chair at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, because his affair with a graduate student became a public scandal. After this, Watson worked for many years for J. Walter Thompson, a leading American advertising agency. He is credited with popularizing the \"coffee break\" during an ad campaign for Maxwell House coffee.\n\nWatson founded behaviorism in the spring of 1913 with his paper \"Psychology as the behaviorist views it\". In this article, Watson outlined the major features of his new philosophy of psychology, called \"behaviorism\". The first paragraph of the article concisely described his position:\nPsychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is the prediction and control of behavior. Introspection forms no essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness. The behaviorist, in his efforts to get a unitary scheme of animal response, recognizes no dividing line between man and brute. The behavior of man, with all of its refinement and complexity, forms only a part of the behaviorist's total scheme of investigation.\nIn 1913, Watson viewed Ivan Pavlov's conditioned reflex as primarily a physiological mechanism controlling glandular secretions. He had already rejected Edward Thorndike's \"Law of Effect\" (a precursor to B.F. Skinner's principle of reinforcement) because of what Watson believed were 'unnecessary subjective elements'. The article is also notable for its strong defense of the objective scientific status of applied psychology, which at the time was considered to be much inferior to the established experimental psychology.\n\nWith his behaviorism, Watson put the emphasis on external behavior of people and their reactions on given situations, rather than the internal, mental state of those people. In his opinion, the analysis of behaviors and reactions was the only objective method to get insight in the human actions. This outlook was thought to be extreme or radical behaviorism.\n\nWatson wrote the book \"Psychological care of infant and child\" in 1928, with help from his mistress, turned wife, Rosalie Rayner. Rosalie later entitled a self-penned article \"I am a mother of behaviorist sons\". In the book, Watson explained that behaviorists were starting to believe psychological care and analysis was required for infants and children.\n\nHis slogan was \"not more babies but better brought up babies\". Watson argued for the nurture side of the nature-nurture debate, claiming that the world would benefit from extinguishing pregnancies for twenty years while enough data was gathered to ensure an efficient child-rearing process. Watsons’ description of a \"happy child\" was rather detached. It included ideas such as that the child can occupy himself through his problem-solving abilities, should only cry when in physical pain, and that the child stray from asking questions. Behavior analysis of child development as a field may have begun with the writings of Watson.\n\nWatson carried out controversial science experiments known as the \"Little Albert experiments\"; in these experiments, Watson studied fear in infants.\n\nWatson's views and life have been the subject of a number of works.\n\n", "id": "135566", "title": "John B.

Pavlov is widely known for first describing classical conditioning.\n\nThe son of a priest, and a theology student, Pavlov turned to science after being influenced by progressive ideas. He took natural sciences at the University of St Petersburg, and got a doctorate in 1878.\n\nIn the 1890s, Pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect, measure, and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions. He noticed that the dogs tended to salivate before food was actually delivered to their mouths, and set out to investigate this \"psychic secretion\", as he called it. Pavlov performed and directed experiments on digestion, eventually publishing \"The work of the digestive glands\" in 1897, after 12 years of research. His experiments earned him the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.\n\nThe concept for which Pavlov is famous is the \"conditioned reflex\" he developed with his assistant Ivan Tolochinov in 1901.\n\nAs Pavlov's work became known in the West, particularly through the writings of John B. Watson, the idea of \"conditioning\" as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology, and the general approach to psychology called behaviourism. \n\nThe British philosopher Bertrand Russell was an enthusiastic advocate of the importance of Pavlov's work for philosophy of mind.\n\nPavlov's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science, but also popular culture. The phrase \"Pavlov's dog\" is often used to describe someone who merely reacts to a situation rather than using critical thinking. Pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel, \"Brave New World\", and also to a large degree in Thomas Pynchon's \"Gravity's Rainbow\". \n\nIt is popularly believed that Pavlov always signalled the food by ringing a bell. However, his writings also record the use of many stimuli, including electric shocks, whistles, metronomes, tuning forks, and a range of visual stimuli. Catania did not believe Pavlov ever actually used a bell in his famous experiments. Littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to Pavlov’s contemporaries Vladimir Bekhterev and John B.

It was a yellowish-brown zebra with stripes only on its head, neck and forebody, and looks similar to an Okapi. The Quagga was native to dry grassy plains in the south of the African continent. It was found as far north as the Orange River. It is believed to have separated from other plains zebras between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago. The name \"Quagga\" comes from the noise that they made. (kwa-ka-ka) (qua-ga-ga).\n\nThe Quagga was hunted for food, for their skin and also because farmers did not want it to eat the grass they needed for their sheep and goats.

She has released five studio albums and two EPs. In 2001, she released a Christian album named after herself, \"Katy Hudson\". In November 2007, Perry released the music video for her first single, \"Ur So Gay\". She has a contralto vocal range. Perry became the most-followed person on Twitter in November 2013. She has earned nine number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, five of which are from one album (she became the first female artist to achieve this record). Perry has also been nominated for 11 Grammy Awards.\n\nPerry was born on October 25, 1984, to Maurice Hudson and Mary Hudson (\"née\" Perry), both pastors. She has an older sister, Angela, and a younger brother, David, who is also a musician. Perry has said that her upbringing was \"sheltered\" and that an example of this was that her family did not eat Lucky Charms cereal because her parents thought that luck was something that came from the devil. She also called deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\" growing up.\n\nThen known as Katy Hudson, she released a Christian album named after herself. It had the single \"Search Me\". She was discovered by Glen Ballard, who is known for his work with musician Alanis Morissette. This album did not perform well, and she was dropped from her record label, Red Hill, when the label was shut down. She struggled for six years before eventually signing with her current label, Capitol Records.\n\nAfter changing her last name to Perry (her mother's maiden name) so that she allegedly would not be confused with actress Kate Hudson, Katy released an EP album called \"Ur So Gay\". This song has been criticized and labeled homophobic. On June 17, 2008, Perry released her first pop album called \"One of the Boys\" with singles including \"I Kissed a Girl\" (her first number-one hit), \"Hot N Cold\", and \"One of the Boys\".\n\nShe co-wrote the single \"I Do Not Hook Up\" for singer Kelly Clarkson (the first winner of \"American Idol\"), along with the song \"Rock God\" for singer-actress Selena Gomez.\n\nPerry's third album, \"Teenage Dream\", was released in August 2010 and included the singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", and \"Firework\". She is the only female artist to get 5 number-one singles from one album on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Along with the album's first three singles reaching the top, \"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" also hit number one. The only other artist to get 5 number-one songs from one album is Michael Jackson, with \"Bad\". She was inspired by her then-engagement to British comedian and actor Russell Brand.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards in 2012, Perry performed a new song, \"Part of Me\", that was released as the lead single from the re-release of \"Teenage Dream\", called \"Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection\". The song entered at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming her seventh US number-one hit. The next single, \"Wide Awake\", reached number two in the US and topped the Canadian Hot 100.\n\nIn July 2012, Perry released the concert film/biopic \"Part of Me in 3D\". The movie shows her early life through the \"Teenage Dream\" era and her rise to fame.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, Perry went to the 2012 Billboard Women in Music event. She was given the Woman of the Year Award there.\n\nIn August 2013, Killer Queen, Perry's third fragrance, was released.\n\nPerry's fourth album, \"Prism\", was released on October 18, 2013. It reached number one in 83 countries. The first single from the album, \"Roar\", was number one in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Ireland, Israel, Lebanon, New Zealand, Scotland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Perry performed the song at the 2013 American Music Awards.\n\nOn November 10, 2013, she performed the album's second single, \"Unconditionally\", at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards.\n\nOn December 5, 2013, Perry's single \"Roar\" was nominated for the 2014 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance. She performed at The GRAMMY Nominations Concert Live!\n\nOn May 7, 2014, Perry began the Prismatic World Tour in support of her fourth studio album, \"Prism\".\n\nThe album's third single, \"Dark Horse\", featuring rapper Juicy J, became Perry's ninth number-one single in the United States. It was the second-best performing single of 2014 there.\n\nIn 2016, she released the single \"Rise\" in support of the Rio Olympics. Two music videos were released: one with an Olympic theme and one which depicts Perry with a red parachute. The song reached number one in Australia and the top twenty in the US and Canada.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, Perry released the single \"Chained to the Rhythm\", which reached the top five in many countries worldwide, including the US, UK, and Canada. It features the grandson of Bob Marley, Skip Marley, and was co-written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia. Two months later, the single \"Bon Appétit\" was made available for download. The hip-hop group Migos is featured on this song.\n\nIn May 2017, Perry announced that her fifth studio album would be released on June 9 and is called \"Witness\".

Perry says it is \"about the magical beauty of a woman.\" On June 26, 2008, the song topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, becoming the 1000th chart-topper of the Rock Era. The song has since become a major worldwide hit, and along with the United States it has topped the charts in more than 20 countries, including Canada, Sweden, Australia, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Germany, and Ireland. \n\nA music video for the song was released on May 16, 2008, on Perry's personal website and on MySpace. The video was directed by Kinga Burza and features a Moulin Rouge and burlesque-type setting with scenes containing Katy, along with many other flamboyantly-dressed women, dancing to the song. Eventually she wakes up next to a male companion, Katy's real life boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes band member Travis McCoy. Despite the song's title, there is not any depiction of same-sex kissing. Katy features her real life friend and DJ, Mia Moretti and her main gay, Markus Molinari's dog Bella in the video. Even her cat, Kitty Purry, makes an appearance. \n\nThe video made its television debut on June 12 on TRL with the visit and interview by Perry in set show. And on June 24, 2008 it became #1 on TRL. The video obtained high airplay on this music video channel, as well as on VH1. It debuted at #20 on VH1's VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown on June 28, 2008. On June 30, 2008 the video was premiered on MTV Latin America. On July 6, 2008, it rose to #4 on VH1's VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown. The video received five nominations for the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video and Best New Artist. The video has had over 24 million views on YouTube. Due to the video and the songs popularity around the world, there are several videos on YouTube which imitate and mock the song such as \"I Kissed a Pig\" and \"I Kissed a Dog\", both of which use the same tune and similar lyrics, while the videos use similar scenes to the original.\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" has drawn mixed reviews from critics. \"Blogcritics Magazine\" called it \"an instantly catchy number,\" and About.com said, \"fueled by an instrumental wallop provided courtesy of producer Dr. Luke, 'I Kissed a Girl' is the perfect breakthrough.\"\n\nHowever, Rolling Stone, while giving her album 2/5 stars, despite describing the song as a \"New Wave-y club single,\" says the supposedly rebellious \"attention-grabbing\" lyrics are \"a vanilla recounting of her chick-on-chick exploits\" and that this \"acting out\" is \"just to get a dude's attention.\" AllMusic praises \"the stomping Gary Glitter beat\" before criticizing the producers for turning it \"into a leaden stumble and burying Perry's voice underneath Pro Tools overdubs so it all winds up as a faceless wash of sound designed to be placed in TV shows, movie trailers, and malls.\"\n\nSal Cinquemani of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote, Perry's \"lead single 'I Kissed a Girl' features a throbbing beat and an infectious, bi-curious hook, but its self-satisfied, in-your-face posturing rings phony in comparison to the expertly constructed ambiguities of 'Justify My Love' or practically anything in the first decade of Ani DiFranco's catalogue; it's like a tween version of DiFranco's tortured bisexual confession 'Light of Some Kind.'\" \"Hiponline.com\" wrote that the song is \"not nearly as interesting or exciting as you’d expect. It’s not even half as good as Jill Sobule’s song 'I Kissed a Girl'.” \"Glitterati Gossip\" agrees Sobule's song \"was ten times better, because there was actual emotional content to her lyrics.\"\n\nThe song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 in the UK on July 21, 2008 on The Scott Mills Show. It was praised by many fans on their text lines and was made his record of the week. On July 23, 2008, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was added to the station's C-List, \"The Playlist,\" being, \"where most songs on daytime Radio 1 are selected from\". The song has since made it to the station's more popular A-list. \n\nPrevious to its debut on Radio 1, it had been (and continues to be) on the playlist of some of the UK radio stations which are part of The One Network for a number of weeks. In addition it had received at least one play a week on BBC Radio 2 on its Saturday evening America’s Greatest Hits show hosted by Paul Gambaccini due to the song’s number status in the Billboard chart.\n\nThe song gained a significant amount of controversy after its rise in popularity due to its perceived promotion of bisexuality and promiscuity. While community members and parents may be concerned over \"the coarseness of the sexual behavior,\" including its public nature and intoxicated state, they may or, such as Unitarian minister Debra W. Haffner, may not be concerned over \"the sex or gender of the person she's talking about.\"\n\nWhile Haffner, who holds a degree in public health, believes Perry \"obviously is using the whole issue of sexual orientation in a positive way, raising awareness, or she's doing it because it gets attention,\" \"AllMusic\" concludes that, \"the problem is not with Katy's gender-bending, it's that her heart isn't in it; she's just using it to get her places, so she sinks to crass, craven depths.\" \"Slant Magazine\" agrees, saying, the song, \"isn't problematic because it promotes homosexuality, but because its appropriation of the gay lifestyle exists for the sole purpose of garnering attention—both from Perry's boyfriend and her audience.\"\n\nAdam Holz of \"PluggedinOnline\", a division of Focus on the Family, wrote an article entitled \"A Tale of Two Katys\" about the singer's image transformation from a Contemporary Christian Music artiste to one of the \"girls gone wild\". He criticizes the song for being the latest, \"high-profile message to young women and men that our sexuality is a malleable commodity that can be reshaped at will.\" Holz also argues that Perry's message carries with it, \"no need to worry about who might get used or objectified in the process,\" causing Katy to live, \"down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype.\"\n\nIn some areas of the world the song's bi-curious lyrics have kept it from reaching the Top 40 or to even be released at all. Though the \"Toronto Star\", of Canada, describes it as \"a lesbian-friendly tune,\" whether anti-gay bias fuels negative reactions to the song or the song itself appears to divide critics. While \"Slant\" and other critics suggest that Perry may be homophobic, especially given her single \"Ur So Gay\", which makes \"I Kissed a Girl\" seem like \"a classic example of the 'Guys kissing is gross, girls kissing is hot' line of thought\" \"The Star Ledger\" quotes a listener who proposes that negative reactions to the song are due to homophobia, saying that it would not draw disapproval if sung by a male artist, and who compares the level of explicitness in the lyrics with other songs on the radio such as rap lyrics. \"MomLogic.com\" writer Vuv-A-Licious agrees, asking, \"'What's the big deal?'...When this tune is playing and my son and daughter are dancing, I will be trying to dance along, or trying to acknowledge that they may one day dance to the beat of a different drummer than me.\"\n\nDuring her Washington concert at Warped Tour, Perry actually did kiss a girl from the audience.\n\nIn an August 2008 interview with the \"Daily Mail\", Perry's mother, Mary Hudson, who is an evangelical Christian preacher, was reported as saying that she disliked the song, stating: \"It clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting...\" However, Perry took to her official blog stating that her mother's supposed comments were completely fabricated, while also saying her parents love and support her and attend many of her shows.\n\nRegarding the question of her own sexuality that the song has raised, Perry told Santa Barbara magazine (which featured her on the cover), \"I like to kiss boys, but there is no doubt in my mind if Angelina Jolie or Gisele Bündchen came a callin', who wouldn't pucker up?\"\n\n\n\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" debuted at number 76 at Billboard Hot 100. After a couple of weeks, the single hit the top 5, due to the rising digital downloads and increasing radio airplay. It continued to rise the next week, reaching #2 just behind her labelmate, Coldplay. The following week, the song reached the summit of the US chart, becoming the 1000th #1 song of the rock era (the 961st #1 on the Billboard Hot 100). In addition the song also gave the Capitol label two consecutive Hot 100 #1's, as the week's prior #1 was fellow Capitol artist Coldplay's \"Viva la Vida\", making it the first time since 1976 Capitol has had two back to back chart toppers on the Hot 100. The single also crossed over to Billboard's sister publication R&R's Rhythmic chart in its July 5 issue, where not only did she have the highest debut ever for a non-rhythmic track, entering at number 26 with 1,065 spins, she also had the highest debut from a new artist in over five years. The bow is the best for a debut track at Rhythmic since Beyoncé entered at No. 21 with \"Crazy in Love\" in 2003. It also became the first song since Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" to simultaneously appear on the Mainstream Top 40, Rhythmic, Adult Top 40 and Alternative charts. On July 26, 2008, the track also made history by reaching the number one spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart by three weeks, a first for a solo act with a debut single. The song topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks in a row before finally being dethroned by Rihanna's \"Disturbia\". It is the second longest running number one on the Hot 100 of 2008 so far, with only Flo Rida's \"Low\" topping the chart for longer. The single has sold more than 2,500,000 downloads in the United States to date.\n\nIn Canada, the single debuted at #55 at Canadian Hot 100. On June 12th the song soared to #1, jumping 26 spots from #27 position. Also on the Canadian iTunes Top 100, the song remained at #1 for over 6 weeks, until rapidly being pushed to #4 on August 7, 2008, behind Lady GaGa's \"Just Dance\", the Jonas Brothers' \"A Little Bit Longer\" and Rihanna's \"Disturbia\". \nIn New Zealand, the song debuted at number 38, the single's first appearance in other countries chart outside North America, moving to number three the following week. The song was certified Gold after seven weeks with sales of over 7,500. On August 11, eight weeks after debuting on the chart, \"I Kissed A Girl\" finally made it to number one.\nIn Australia, the song debuted at #11 on the 30th of June on downloads alone, then the next week jumped to second position behind Jordin Sparks, still on downloads alone. The next week it jumped to number one still solely off downloads, becoming only the second single to do so. Ironically, by the time the song went number 1, this was the time when World Youth Day 2008 had started and the event held anti-gay views. On 21st July, 2008, after the singles physical release, the track retained its number one position and was certified Gold. The single has held the number one position since and has gone on to be certified Platinum.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a cover version released by the artist Nicki Bliss was climbing up the UK iTunes Chart. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart (published 3 August 2008) at position number 50.\n\nA second cover version, by Barnicle, entered the UK Singles Chart (published 3 August 2008) at position #116.\n\nBecause of the success of the cover versions, the official release of Katy Perry's version was brought forward from September 1 to July 30, 2008. On August 3, 2008, the song, which had entered the UK Singles Chart at number 139 the week before, climbed 135 places to reach position number 4. The song has become one of the most requested on Radio 1's request hour. The following week it climbed 3 places to reach number 1. The following week it stayed at the top spot for a second consecutive week and then went on to spend 5 consecutive weeks at #1.\n\nEven parodies of \"I Kissed a Girl\" are seeing chart success. Robert Lund's spoof \"I Peed in the Pool\" reached #1 on Dr. Demento's August 2008 comedy music countdown. Including the MADtv parody, \"I'll Kiss a Girl\" featuring Nicole Parker as Ellen DeGeneres and fellow cast member Arden Myrin as Portia de Rossi, by Ellen saying that she's been kissing girls since the 9th grade.\n", "id": "135701", "title": "I Kissed a Girl"}

In Pakistan it is officially the military iconic symbol of the PAF and the unofficial territory bird of Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe peregrin is a crow-sized falcon, with a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head and \"moustache\". It can go at up to 322 km/h (200 mph) in a dive, which means it is the fastest animal in the world. As with other bird-eating raptors, the female is bigger than the male. There are 17–19 subspecies recorded, and each varies slightly in appearance and where they live. There is disagreement over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon is a subspecies of the Peregrine or just a different species.\n\nThe use of certain pesticides, especially DDT was not good for the animals. It could be shown that in areas where DDT was used, the thickness of the shells of their eggs was reduced. This caused a dramatic decline in their numbers, in certain countries. Since the use of DDT has been forbidden in many countries, their numbers are increasing again. This recovery was helped because their nesting places were protected in many countries; some countries also bred these falcons in captivity and released them into the wild.\n\nConservation organizations:\n", "id": "135769", "title": "Peregrine falcon"}

His father was Carbonari in 1821, one of his brothers and a brother-in-law were deputies, while Carlo Cafiero was always called the 'black sheep' of the family. In 1864 he went to Naples, where he got a degree in law. He then went to Florence and at the beginning of 1870 he was in Paris. The Paris he went to London, where he matured, renouncing his diplomatic career, his wealth and family, to join the revolution and socialism. In London Cafiero made contacts with Marx and Engels. He joined the International Workingmen's Association and was charged to go back to Italy and conquer it to Marx’s ideology, where instead there was the strong influence of the Anarchism of Mikhail Bakunin and the Republicanism of Giuseppe Mazzini. He restored the ancient section of 'L'Internazionale' in Naples, with the help of the young Errico Malatesta. There, during an assembly, he was imprisoned for the first time. \n\nAfter over a year spent in Italy as a representative of Marx and Engels Cafiero felt the influence of anarchism. And thanks to the friendship with Giuseppe Fanelli, he passed on to the other side of the barricade, with Bakunin and his Italian followers. In early 1872 came the first issue of the newspaper \"La Campana\" and Cafiero wrote for, and gave money towards the publication. In the same year he met Bakunin in Locarno (Switzerland). In the summer of 1873, with the help of Cafiero, an old project was realised: to create an international center for the revolution in Italy and the world. Cafiero, selling all his inherited lands, bought a farm in Switzerland where Bakunin could live. This center was called \"La Baronata\", would also be a safe shelter for revolutionaries persecuted by their respective governments. In 1875 Cafiero went to Milan and joined the editorial staff of the first socialist daily paper, \"La Plebe\", directed by Enrico Bignami. In April 1877, Cafiero, Malatesta, Ceccarelli, the Russian Stepniak and 30 other comrades began an insurrection in the province of Benevento. They took the village of Letino without violence and with great enthusiasm. Arms and food were expropriated and distributed amongst the people, tax money was returned and official documents destroyed. Cafiero, in dialect, explained about anarchism, freedom, justice and the new society without the State, without masters, servants, soldiers and owners. His proclamations convinced even the parish priest who called the rebel group 'the true apostles sent by the Lord'. The following day the village of Gallo was taken in a similar fashion. As they were leaving Gallo the Internationalists were surprised and surrounded by government troops and all were arrested. Held in prison for over a year before being brought to trial all the accused were eventually acquitted in August 1878. In 1878, Cafiero was living in Marseilles working as cook and docker. In October he was arrested with Malatesta, then released and expelled from France. He rested in Switzerland, meeting with Kropotkin, and with the collaboration of Élisée Reclus promoted the publications of Bakunin. In 1881 Cafiero went to London, where he remained for a long time. In March 1882 he returned to Italy, expressing the will to take part in the imminent electoral campaign.\n\nOn April 5th he was arrested without any charge but on May 2nd, while imprisoned, he was the victim of a strong mental crisis and attempted to kill himself. The scandal of a man imprisoned without reason and crazy exploded and Cafiero was released with only the choice between forced residence in Barletta, his birth town, or exile to Switzerland. Cafiero chose the exile in the small town of Chiasso. Emilio Bellerio took Cafiero to his house in Locarno and Errico Malatesta wrote about him \"if his mind is ill, his heart is still healthy...\". In February 1883 Cafiero left for Florence, but was found in a street very shocked, so some doctors transferred him to a lunatic asylum in the City. After the lunatic asylum for the rest of his life had problems, Olimpia Kutusoff, mate of Cafiero, returned from Russia in September 1883 to assist him in the asylum of Imola. Olimpia left him after one and a half years because Cafiero in his crises was violent with her. Carlo expressed the will to return in Barletta where he arrived in the second half of ’89. However his brothers turned him away and after living some time in a hotel he was taken in by his brother Pietrantonio. In 1891, following another crisis, Carlo Cafiero was confined in the asylum of Nocera Inferiore where he died on Sunday July 17, 1892.\n\n\n\n", "id": "135802", "title": "Carlo Cafiero"}

He helped make the Austrian School of economics popular in the United States. \n\nRothbard helped to create modern libertarianism, a political belief in less government and more personal freedom. He founded a form of free-market anarchism which he called \"anarcho-capitalism\". Rothbard believed society should organise itself, and he didn't like central planning.\n\nRothbard wrote over twenty books and was an important central figure in the American libertarian movement.\n\nRothbard advocated the abolition of government control of society and the economy. He considered the monopoly force of government the greatest danger to liberty and the long-term well-being of the people. He called the state a \"gang of thieves writ large — the most immoral, grasping and unscrupulous individuals in any society\".\n\nRothbard thought that all services provided by monopoly governments could be provided more efficiently by the private sector. According to him, many regulations and laws passed \"for the public interest\" were self-interested power grabs by scheming government bureaucrats to make themselves look important. These schemes were not subject to market disciplines. \n\nGovernment services were not efficient, and would get eliminated, if the services could be provided by competition in the private sector.\n\nRothbard was equally condemning of big business working with government. Business elites, he thought, used government's monopoly power so as to influence laws and regulatory policy to help themselves at the expense of their competitive rivals.\n\nHe argued that taxation was theft on a grand scale, backed by law. It was \"a compulsory monopoly of force\" which prevented the more efficient voluntary procurement of defense and judicial services from competing suppliers. He also argued against central banking and fractional reserve banking. A monopoly system where the government decides how much money to print is, to him, a form of state-sponsored, legalized financial fraud. It is against libertarian principles and ethics.

The defending champions, Spain, were eliminated from the World Cup after losing to the Netherlands and Chile in the group stage and the host country, Brazil, were eliminated after a record-breaking 1–7 loss to Germany.\n\nBefore the tournament began, all teams received US$1.5 million for preparation costs. The teams that were eliminated from the Group Stage got US$8 million, from the Round of 16 got US$9 million, and from the Quarter-Finals got US$14 million. The fourth place team got US$20 million, the third place team got US$22 million, the second place team got US$25 million and the champions got US$35 million.\n\nA total of Seventeen cities showed interest in being chosen as World Cup host cities: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Brasília, Belém, Campo Grande, Cuiabá, Curitiba, Florianópolis, Fortaleza, Goiânia, Manaus, Natal, Recife (a stadium would be shared by both cities), Rio Branco and Salvador. Maceió withdrew in January 2009.\n\nAccording to current FIFA practice, no more than one city may use two stadiums, and the number of host cities is limited between eight and ten.

Originally the CBF's intentions were to have the opening match at Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. However, on 14 June 2010 the stadium was excluded from hosting games in the tournament due to a failure to provide financial guarantees for the improvements needed to have it as an eligible venue. In the end of August 2010, the CBF announced that the new Corinthians stadium will host the matches in São Paulo.\n\nThe 12 host cities for the 2014 World Cup were announced on 31 May 2009.

It was made by Walt Disney. It is based on the book \"Bambi, A Life in the Woods\" by Felix Salten. The movie was sent to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on August 13, 1942. It is the fifth movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story is about a baby deer named Bambi. He learns to grow up in the wild after his mother is shot by hunters. The main characters are Bambi, a white tailed deer, his parents (the Great Prince of the forest and his mother), and his friends Thumper (a rabbit), Flower (a skunk), and friend Faline, who becomes his wife later.\n\nFor the movie, Disney changed Bambi to a white-tailed deer. In the book, Bambi was a Roe Deer. However, roe deer do not live in the United States, and Americans know more about white-tailed deer. The movie was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound (Sam Slyfield), Best Song (for \"Love Is a Song\" sung by Donald Novis) and Original Music Score. In June 2008, the American Film Institute came up with a list of its \"Top 10\"—the best ten movies—after asking over 1,500 people. \"Bambi\" came in third in animation. In December 2011, the movie was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.\n\nThe movie starts with a wise old owl that tells a story about a little fawn called Bambi that was born in the woods. In his first days of life, he explores the forest around him. He makes a friend named Thumper, who is a rabbit. Bambi learns new words every day, \"Bird\" is his first word. He learns \"butterflies\", \"rain\", and the \"meadow\". He sees his father (the Great Prince of the Forest) for the first time. The movie first shows Bambi's childhood, such as a walk in the woods, a day in the meadow, and his first experience seeing snow.\n\nThe most famous part of the movie is the death of Bambi's mother. Bambi and his mother have trouble finding food. One day, Bambi's mother finds a patch of grass, and they eat. The audience hears scary music (Man's theme). Bambi's mother senses danger. She tells Bambi to run. As they run across an icy field, she screams \"Faster! Faster, Bambi! Don't look back! Keep running! Keep running!\" Bambi makes it but a gunshot is heard. Bambi makes it back to the den but finds that his mother is no longer there. He wanders around, desperately calling for her, and bumps into his father, the Great Prince, who tells him that \"your mother can't be with you anymore\". Bambi follows his father into the woods, taking one last look behind him. \nThe next spring, Bambi and his friends are adults. They meet a wise old owl, called Friend Owl, who tells them of the dangers of falling in love. They make vows not to, but are in love at first sight in no time. Bambi falls in love with his old childhood friend Faline, and is happily dancing in the clouds until another deer steps in the way. He tries to get Faline to go with him, but Bambi will not and gets into a fight with this deer. Bambi wins, and goes on a date with Faline. The Man comes back and makes more trouble for the animals. Bambi saves Faline from a pack of angry dogs.\n\nA forest fire comes and nearly destroys everything. Bambi has trouble getting up, but his father helps him. They both make it to an island where the animals have gathered. The following spring, everyone goes to see Bambi and Faline's new fawns (baby deer), with the wise owl saying that Bambi should be proud. The Great Prince steps down from his current place as king, and Bambi is left standing proudly. The beginning song, \"Love is a Song\", is sung again by a chorus.\n\nWalt Disney wanted to have realistic detail in this animated movie. The artists learned from animal experts, and visited the Los Angeles Zoo. A pair of fawns (named Bambi and Faline) were shipped from the area of present-day Baxter State Park in Maine to the studio so that the artists could see for themselves the movement of these animals. The source of these fawns, from the Eastern United States, gave the company the idea to change Felix Salten's Roe Deer to a white-tailed deer. The background of the movie was also the Eastern woodlands — one of the earliest and best known artists for the Disney studio, Maurice \"Jake\" Day spent a lot of weeks in the Vermont and Maine forests, drawing pictures and taking photographs of deer, fawns, and the wilderness areas around them.\n\n\n\n\"Bambi\" was released in theaters in 1942, during World War II. It was Disney's 5th full-length animated movie. \"Bambi\" was re-released to theatres in 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982, and 1988. It was then made available on home video in 1989. Even in home video, \"Bambi\" has seen many releases, including two VHS releases, in 1989 (Classics Version) and 1997 (Masterpiece Collection Version), and a digitally-remastered and restored Platinum Edition DVD. The Platinum Edition DVD went on moratorium on January 31, 2007.\n\nBambi was released in Diamond Edition on March 1, 2011, consisting of a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. According to Cinema Blend, this release is set to include multiple bonus features that were not previously included in Bambi home releases: a documentary entitled \"Inside Walt’s Story Meetings – Enhanced Edition\", two deleted scenes, a deleted song, an image gallery, and a game entitled \"Disney’s Big Book of Knowledge: Bambi Edition\". The release also marked the first use of \"Disney Second Screen\", a feature which is accessed via a computer or iPad app download that syncs with the Blu-ray disc, allowing the viewer to follow along by interacting with animated flip-books, galleries and trivia while watching the movie. A UK version of Diamond Edition was released on February 7, 2011.\n\n\"Bambi II\" is a story which takes place after Bambi's mother dies, but before Bambi becomes an adult. It shows the Great Prince of the Forest having trouble raising Bambi, and Bambi not being sure if his father really loves him. The movie was released direct-to-video on February 7, 2006. While the movie was a direct-to-video release in the United States and other countries, including Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, it was a theatrical release in some countries, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Dominican Republic, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and some other European countries.\n\n\n", "id": "136030", "title": "Bambi"}

The song was released on December 1, 2008. The music video for the single was directed by P. R. Brown and Shawn Crahan.\n\nThe music video for \"Dead Memories\" was directed by P. R. Brown. On September 30, 2008, the band's record label \"Roadrunner Records\" released a 15 second teaser video on YouTube which showed vocalist Corey Taylor in what looks like to be a grave in heavy rainfall. The video came out on MTV's \"Headbangers Ball\" on October 25, 2008 as part of the \"Headbangers Ball\" 20th anniversary special programming. The concept of the music video was percussionist Shawn Crahan's idea. Crahan calls the music video a \"short film\" and said that it was a \"very\" expensive video to make. Crahan's original idea was to have several rooms, he shared his idea with to vocalist Corey Taylor who decided what each room would be.\n\nThe video starts off with Taylor seen without his mask and dressed in casual clothes carrying a shovel and smoking a cigarette. He walks from an urbanized area (in the extended version, he is seen walking through a park, before approaching a car and smashing its headlights) in to a more rural area in the fields and begin to dig at the ground. He then seemingly falls through the ground and into a room below dressed in his Slipknot mask and cover-alls. The first room, which is a dark room with faint red lighting shows turntablist Sid Wilson who is seen barefoot, climbing all over the walls and is covered in dust and cobwebs. Taylor opens the drapes to attempt to look out of the window but can only see dirt. Wilson is then seen physically trying to stop Taylor from leaving the room by grabbing his pant leg. However, Taylor eventually leaves the room and enters a second which is occupied by drummer Joey Jordison, with tree branches instead of fingers and a crown of thorns on his head. The room features many photographs of Jordison on the walls and he is sitting in a chair surrounded by several females. Taylor walks around the scene looking at them without interacting with Jordison or the females, there is a moment in which Jordison is looking in a mirror and Taylor suddenly appears. Taylor then leaves the room and enters a third which is occupied by sampler Craig Jones who is standing straight upright and does not move throughout the scene. When Taylor enters the room the video is solarized and remains so throughout the time Taylor's in there. Taylor walks around Jones and inspects his mask and is seen touching the nails protruding from it. Jones then lights a smoke flare, which blinds Taylor, and is seen holding it in his right hand, but he [Taylor] finds the door then leaves the room and enters a fourth which is occupied by bassist Paul Gray.\n\nThis room is filled with mirrors, similar to that of a house of mirrors. Taylor is seen walking through the room while Gray seemingly follows him. Taylor then focuses on Gray and makes a waving gesture to seemingly establish if it's a mirror. Gray then gets aggravated, looks up and hits the mirror viciously, and Taylor is seen looking at a broken mirror and a reflection of himself. Taylor after he looks himself in the mirror, screams and looks around anxiously before he falls backwards out Paul Gray's rooms door and lands into a fifth room, which is occupied by percussionist Shawn Crahan. Crahan is seen with several females dancing around him while holding his baseball bat. Taylor is seen returning to his feet and he pushes his way through the crowd. Two of the females are seen trying to physically stop him from leaving the room by grabbing his clothes. Taylor then enters a sixth room which is a thin, blank corridor occupied by guitarist Mick Thomson. The two seemingly stand off, Taylor is seen trying to push past Thomson several times but is knocked backward several times with. Taylor is then seen stood at another door, as if Thomson was simply a mirage. He enters a seventh room which is occupied by guitarist James Root, Root is seen with several females in a room which is classically decorated. Throughout this room the video is reversed. Taylor is seen walking through the crowd almost unnoticed. He then enters an eighth room which is occupied by percussionist Chris Fehn. Fehn is seen lighting candles in the room which has walls covered in art. Taylor is seen observing and gaining interest in his actions while a female is seen walking around the room. Fehn is then seen lighting a candle and gives it to Taylor who blows it out. Taylor is then seen in casual clothes again outside in the rain digging, when a second Taylor rises from the hole dressed in his Slipknot mask and uniform, and the two see each other as it fades to black.\n\nDuring album reviews for \"All Hope Is Gone\", \"Dead Memories\" was given good feedback for its melody and accessibility. Reviewing for Blabbermouth.net, Ryan Ogle says that the single shows Slipknot's diversity, he went on to say that it is \"well-written and melodious\". Dan Martin from \"The Guardian\" compared it to Metallica's song \"\"Enter Sandman\"\" and went on to say, \"[it] is so listenable it's almost conventional.\" However, Jim Kaz of IGN said that the song almost detracts from the intensity of the album, stating, \"it's at this point the band loses a little momentum.\" Additionally, Ogle of Blabbermouth.net also said that it's a song that \"lack[s] the white hot fire that allows the rest of the disc to burn our asses.\"\n\n\n\n", "id": "136187", "title": "Dead Memories"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136201", "text": "Robert McNamara\n\nRobert Strange McNamara (June 9, 1916 - July 6, 2009) was an American business executive and former United States Secretary of Defense. After being an executive at Ford Motor Company, McNamara served as Defense Secretary from 1961 to 1968, during the Vietnam War under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. After holding that position he served as President of the World Bank from 1968 until 1981. He was of Irish ancestry on his father's side.\n\nMcNamara was born in San Francisco into an Irish family. He graduated from high school in 1933. McNamara was an Eagle Scout. He went to the University of California Berkeley where he got a degree in economics. He went to Harvard University for his MBA. After a short time working as an accountant he taught at Harvard. He married his high school sweetheart, Margaret Craig, in 1940. In 1943 he joined the Air Force. During the war, he looked at how effficent bombers were working and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. For his service in World War II, he was given the Legion of Merit.\n\nIn 1946 McNamara got together with Charles \"Tex\" Thornton and eight other people who, like Thornton, he knew from the military and went into business. The group was hired by Ford Motor Company, which was going through a difficult time. This group was known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The Whiz Kids made changes to the company that led to it becoming more profitable and its cars getting better reviews and better sales. He rose through the company fast. In 1960 he became the President of Ford. He helped launch several successful models, like the Lincoln Continental and the Ford Falcon and put in some of the first modern safety features to be seen in cars.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president. After he asked Robert A. Lovett to be his Defense Secretary, Lovett said no but recommended McNamara. McNamara was considered for both the Defense and Treasury Secretaries even though he was (and was for his entire life) a member of the Republican Party (Kennedy was a Democrat). He wasn't interested in being Treasury Secretary but eventually decided to be Kennedy's Secretary of Defense.\n\nMcNamara was known for using statistics to make decisions about the military and to make it more efficient. He tried to cut down on wasteful spending, often by merging programs into more efficient single ones. He also worked to end discrimination based on race and sex in the US Military. While in Kennedy's cabinet, he became good friends with Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General at the time (and brother of the president). McNamara was a big supporter of the space program and was one of the first people in government to suggest going to the moon. He wrote a recommendation to Kennedy in 1961 in support of a moon mission. Kennedy made the moon mission a priority for NASA, and the US went to the moon for the first time in 1969.\n\nMcNamara ended the \"Massive Retaliation\" policy that came from the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. Instead, McNamara put in place \"flexible response\" which allowed more options for defending the US. President Kennedy very much wanted to fight communist revolutions and wars to stop Soviet power from spreading, and McNamara supported this. He also played a big role in peacefully ending the Cuban Missile Crisis. He advised Kennedy to blockade Cuba and stop the Soviet Union from putting more missiles there. Kennedy agreed and their strategy worked.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. His successor, Lyndon Johnson, kept McNamara as Defense Secretary. He became a major leader of the Vietnam war, and he and General William Westmoreland were the two biggest leaders in the American military during the war. In order to stop the communists from taking over Vietnam, McNamara sent more troops to the country. Over a number of years this stopped the North Vietnamese Army from winning the war, but as large amounts of American soldiers were killed the war became very unpopular with the people. He and the president strongly disagreed on troop levels - McNamara wanted to stop the increase in troops but Johnson wanted to send more over. McNamara resigned from the Defense Department in 1968. Johnson did not run for reelection that year and the election was won by Richard Nixon, who ran on a promise to end the war. Nixon signed a peace treaty in 1973, but the North Vietnamese would eventually win the war after the US pulled out.\n\nAfter leaving the Defense Department, McNamara received the Medal of Freedom, published a book, and was hired as President of the World Bank. In 1972 he was in the news when a man saw him on a ferry boat in Massachusetts and tried to throw him in the ocean. McNamara told police not to press charges. While at the World Bank he focused on reducing world poverty. He was the first World Bank leader to make this the organization's top priority and he was often praised for this. McNamara also helped the World Bank fight disease. He retired from the World Bank in 1981.\n\nHe wrote a memoir in 1995. McNamara enjoyed food and cooking, and started an orchard business in his retirement. A movie was released made of interviews and clips about McNamara in 2003 called the Fog of War. He was a trustee of the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. There is a scholarship of the World Bank in his honor.\n\nIn his later list McNamara said that he and the Kennedy and Johnson administrations \"were wrong\" about Vietnam. He said if he had known in the 1960s what he knows now he would've made a different decision.\n\nMcNamara died in Washington DC in 2009. He was 93 when he died. He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\n", "id": "136201", "title": "Robert McNamara"}

Often the pleasure is of a sexual kind. When a person finds pleasure in being hurt or humiliated, their condition is called Masochism.\n\nThe terms \"sadism\" and \"masochism\" were both invented by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named sadism after the Marquis de Sade, a French nobleman who in the eighteenth century wrote many books, stories and plays. Sade's books include many characters who find pleasure in cruelty, including torture and even murder.\n\nAt first sadism meant only cruelty for sexual pleasure, but as the word became more widely used its meaning changed. Nowadays any person who enjoys being cruel to others can be called \"sadistic,\" even if they get no sexual excitement from what they do.\n\nSome people who have sadistic sexual fantasies mean no real harm to anyone. In BDSM a \"top\" or dominant person will bind his or her partner or \"punish\" them in different ways, but what they do will not go beyond limits which the partner has agreed on. Some sadists are severely perverted or have personality disorders, and wish to act out their sadistic fantasies for real. Such people are very dangerous.

This allows multiple computers to share a single public IP address, which has become necessary because there are not enough IP addresses for every computer in the world.\n\nToday, NAT is used to hide networks (called \"network masquerading\") or to hide IP (called \"IP masquerading\"). \"Masquerading\" is the mechanism that hides an entire address space, usually consisting of private network addresses (RFC 1918), behind a single IP address usually in the public domain address space. \n\nThe NAT mechanism is implemented inside a routing device that keeps track of the \"state\" of the network connections. The NAT device may also implement a firewall. The router uses translation tables to map the \"hidden\" addresses into a single address and then rewrites the outgoing IP packets on exit from the router so that they appear to originate from the router. In the reverse communications path, responses to the outgoing packets are mapped back to the originating IP address using the reverse of the rules (\"\"state\"\") stored in the translation tables. The outgoing IP packets establish the device translation tables.\n\nThe translation table rules established in the above way are cleared after a short period without new traffic refreshing their \"state\". However, most NAT devices today allow the network administrator to configure translation tables’ entries for permanent use. This feature is often referred to as \"static NAT\" or port forwarding and allows traffic originating in the 'outside' network to reach selected hosts in the \"masqueraded network\".\n\nCarrier-grade NAT, also called large-scale NAT, is NAT done by the Internet service provider (ISP). This is used when the ISP has more customers than IP addresses. This is commonly used by cellular service providers on 3G and 4G networks, but it is not (yet) common on landline DSL or cable connections. The CIDR address block 100.64.0.0/10 is reserved for carrier-grade NAT, although many ISPs improperly use RFC 1918 private addresses, which are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.\n\nNAT is used only in IPv4. It is not necessary in IPv6, because IPv6 has enough addresses for every computer in the world to have a global address.\n\n", "id": "136281", "title": "Network address translation"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136284", "text": "Router\n\nA router is a computer whose software and hardware are customized to move data between computer networks. They are responsible for making sure traffic between computers gets where it needs to go. They do this by choosing the shortest path between the computers using a complicated system of rules called Routing Protocols. Routers generally contain a specialized operating system, RAM, NVRAM, flash memory, and one or more processors, as well as two or more network interfaces. They come in a variety of sizes from something you could hold in your hand to something too large for one person to lift.\n\nIf you have an internet connection you probably have a router somewhere that your computer sends data to. This is the first router your computer will connect to in order to get to the internet. It is also known as a default gateway (because it is your gateway to the internet). By convention the gateway has the lowest IP address (like a phone number for a computer) in the subnet (a group of addresses). Anytime you make a connection (such as a connection to www.wikipedia.org) your computer looks up the IP address using the look-up service called DNS (Domain Name Service). Once the destination address has been found your computer connects to your gateway router. The gateway then sends data to a router at your ISP (Internet Service Provider), that router can be said to be part of the internet and connects to other routers until the data reaches the destination.\n\nIn small networks such as homes, small businesses (including internet cafes) and small schools, the router also performs NAT (network address translation) which makes all outgoing connections look like they come from one address. Typically incoming connections are only allowed if they are replies to connections made by a computer inside the NAT.\n\nRouters connect two or more networks and direct traffic between them. These networks may be physical (the network is associated with a port) or logical (not associated with a port on the router) The term layer 3 switch often is used the same as 'router', but it is a general term without a technical definition. Layer 3 switch implies a device that is built to connect Ethernet devices in a LAN but can also perform routing.\n\nRouter operating systems are split into two parts:\n\n", "id": "136284", "title": "Router"}

Often, the pleasure is sexual. When a person gets pleasure from being the one who causes hurt or humiliation, their condition is called Sadism.\n\nThe word \"masochism\" was invented by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named it after Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836-1895), a writer whose books and stories often featured men in love with women who treated them cruelly.\n\nMany people with masochistic feelings do not really want to be hurt badly. They want to act out their daydreams, such as being tied up and kidnapped, or becoming the slave of another person. In BDSM, people often agree who will be \"top\" and \"bottom\" before they do anything together, and talk about exactly what they will do before they do it. People who do this kind of masochism usually do it for sexual excitement.\n\nMost people who practice BDSM are concerned about their partner's safety. When people are careless about safety, or have no partner and play masochistic games when they are alone, it can be very dangerous. In some cases people have died from such games, especially when they involve suffocation, like hanging or rubber masks, even more dangerous when making it hard to get out by putting themselves in things like handcuffs.\n\nSome people suffer from emotional masochism. They are more comfortable when they feel sad or consider themselves failures in life, or prefer to be in a relationship with someone who cheats or insults them. People who have these kind of feelings may have been bullied or abused earlier in life, or may feel that they do not deserve success and happiness.\n\nSometimes, self-injury is seen as a form of masochism which is not motivated sexually. Other behaviours, such as nail biting or trichotillomania often occur in situations where there is a lot of stress or pressure on the individual. While they are related to the individual's way to deal with stressful situations, they are also often rooted in the personality.\n\nTreating masochism is difficult, but it looks like psychotherapy can help in some cases. People who like to be hurt during sex often say they're happy, though. Even not in sex, masochism can be natural in people.\n", "id": "136290", "title": "Masochism"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136305", "text": "Private network\n\nIn Internet terminology a private network is typically a network that uses private IP address space, following the RFC 1918 standard. Computers may be allocated addresses from this address space when it is necessary for them to communicate with other computing devices on an Intranet network (internal private computer network that uses the Internet Protocol).\n\nPrivate networks are quite common in home and office local area network (LAN) designs, as many organizations do not see a need for globally unique IP addresses for every computer, printer and other devices that the organizations use. Private IP addresses were created due to the shortage of publicly registered IP addresses created by the IPv4 standard. One of the reasons IPv6 was created is to overcome this limitation of the IPv4 standard. However IPv6 still did not achieve a widespread use.\n\nRouters on the Internet should be configured to discard any packets containing private IP addresses in the IP packet header. This isolation gives private networks a basic form of security as it is not usually possible for the outside world to establish a connection directly to a machine using these private addresses. As connections cannot be made between different private networks via the internet, different organizations can use the same private address range without risking address conflicts (communications accidents caused by reaching a third party using the same IP address).\n\nIf a device on a private network needs to communicate with other networks, a \"\"mediating gateway\"\" (in-between gateway) is needed to ensure that the outside network is presented with an address that is \"real\" (or publicly reachable) so that Internet routers allow the communication. This gateway is typically a NAT device or a proxy server. Public Internet Routers by default will not forward packets with RFC 1918 addresses. Unlike public Internet routers that need additional configuration to forward these packets, internal routers do not need any additional configuration to forward these packets.\n\nThis can cause problems, however, when organizations try to connect networks that both use the same private address spaces. There is a potential for clashes and routing problems if both networks use the same IP addresses for their private networks, or if both networks depend on NAT to connect them through the Internet.\n\nThe Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the entity that manage global IP address allocation, DNS root zone management, media types, and other Internet protocol assignments. It is operated by ICANN.\n\nFor someone familiar with the boundaries of classful addressing, it is important to note that even though the RFC 1918 range of 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 falls in the traditional class B range, the block of addresses reserved is not a /16, but a /12. The same applies for the range of 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255; this block is not a /24, but a /16. However, someone can still (and many individuals typically do) use addresses from these CIDR blocks and apply a subnet mask appropriate for the traditional classful boundary of the address.\n\nThe current IANA \"private internet\" (also called non-routable) addresses are:\n\nTo reduce the load on root nameservers caused by the reverse DNS lookups of these IP addresses, a system of \"black-hole\" nameservers is provided by anycast network AS112.\n\n", "id": "136305", "title": "Private network"}

Triple DES is also known as TDES or, more standard, TDEA (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm ).\n\nWhen it was discovered that a 56-bit key of DES is not enough to protect from brute force attacks, TDES was chosen as a simple way to enlarge the key space without a need to switch to a new algorithm. The use of three steps is essential to prevent meet-in-the-middle attacks that are effective against double DES encryption.\n\nIn general TDES with three different keys (3-key {k, k, k} TDES) has a key length of 168 bits: three 56-bit DES keys (with parity bits 3-key TDES has the total storage length of 192 bits), but due to the meet-in-the-middle attack the effective security it provides is only 112 bits. Another version, called two-key TDES (2-key TDES), uses k = k, thus reducing the key size to 112 bits and the storage length to 128 bits. However, this mode can be taken advantage of through certain chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks and so TDES is treated by NIST to have only 80 bits of security.\n\nBy design, DES and therefore TDES, suffer from slow performance in software. TDES is better suited to hardware implementations, which are many of the places it is still used.\n\nTDES is slowly disappearing from use, largely replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). One large-scale exception is within the electronic payments industry, which still uses 2TDES extensively and continues to develop and spread standards based upon it (e.g. EMV, the standard for inter-operation of IC cards; also called \"\"Chip cards\"\", and IC capable POS terminals and ATM's).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136355", "text": "Advanced Encryption Standard\n\nIn cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is also known as Rijndael, is a block cipher algorithm used as an encryption standard by the U.S. government. It has been looked at a lot and is now used all over the world, as was the case with its predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES was announced by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001 after a 5-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated before Rijndael was selected as the most suitable. It became effective as a standard May 26, 2002. As of 2008, AES is one of the most popular algorithms used in symmetric key cryptography. It is available by choice in many different encryption packages. This marks the first time that the public has had access to a cipher algorithm approved by NSA for top secret information.\n\nThis cipher algorithm was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and submitted to the AES selection process under the name \"Rijndael\", a portmanteau of the names of the inventors. (Rijndael is ).\n\nStrictly speaking, AES is not precisely Rijndael (although in practice they are used interchangeably), following are the main differences:\n\n\"The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.\"\n\nMany AES public products use 128-bit secret keys by default; it is possible that the NSA may assume that 128-bit secret keys are weak and they may prefer longer keys for top secret documents. \n\nUnlike DES (the predecessor of AES), AES is a substitution-permutation network, not a Feistel network. AES is fast in both software and hardware, is relatively easy to implement, and requires little memory. As a new encryption standard, it is currently being deployed on a large scale on various platforms.\n\n", "id": "136355", "title": "Advanced Encryption Standard"}

Examples include \"Esper Mami\", \"Dragon Ball\", \"Bleach\", \"One Piece\", \"InuYasha\", \"Naruto\", \"YuYu Hakusho\", and \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\".\n\nShounen is usually noticed by its high amounts of fighting. It often has humorous plots with male characters. It often has themes of friendship. Fighting teams and similar groups are often shown. Attractive female characters are also common, but not always present. The art style of shounen is usually less pretty than shōjo.\n\nBeyond shōnen manga, manga for men (age 18+) is called seinen manga. Very few seinen manga have been published outside of Japan. In Japan, many older men read shounen magazines. Because of this, in Japan, shounen manga magazines are the most popular manga magazines.\n\n", "id": "136356", "title": "Shōnen (media)"}

It is broadcast on CBS.\n\nIn \"The Amazing Race\", 11 or 12 teams of two people race around the world for $1,000,000, with information provided by \"clues\", or Route Info. There are certain \"legs\" of the race, culminated by \"Pit Stops\". At Pit Stops, teams check in for a mandatory 12 hour rest period, although sometimes the period can be 24 hours, 36 hours, or even once 60. Usually, the first team to arrive at a Pit Stop will receive a prize, such as a trip to a Caribbean country. On most of the Pit Stops on the race, the last team to arrive is eliminated from the race. However, two or three of those points are non-elimination. In Seasons 1-4, there was no penalty for coming in last in a non-elimination. From Seasons 5-9, teams had to give up all of their money and start the next leg without money. Even stricter, in Seasons 7-9, teams had to turn over all of their luggage. In Seasons 10 and 11, teams would start the next leg \"Marked for Elimination\". That meant that if they did not come in first at the next Pit Stop, they would have to wait out a 30-minute penalty. Starting from Season 12, teams coming in last on Non-Eliminations have to do a Speed Bump. A Speed Bump is a task that no other teams have to do.\n\n\"The Amazing Race\" has several different tasks that teams must complete. \n\nA Detour is a choice between two tasks. The team can choose which one it wants to complete. Teams are allowed to switch between Detour choices, but there is a harsh 24-hour penalty if you quit a Detour. \nA Roadbock is a task where only one member of the team can perform. Teams cannot switch the member performing the task. There is a 4-hour penalty if teams quit.\nA Fast Forward is a task in order for a team to skip tasks and head directly to the Pit Stop.\n\n\"The Amazing Race\" was created by Bertram van Munster and Elise Doganieri in 2001. It has been airing from 2001 to present.\n\"The Amazing Race\" is seen as hard to produce. Producers need to find places, come up with tasks and pick teams. Cameramen have to keep up with the teams, and people are not allowed to give away the results. However, \"The Amazing Race\" has won 6 Emmy awards.\n\nBesides the original American version, \"The Amazing Race\" has generated several versions from around the world.\n", "id": "136367", "title": "The Amazing Race"}

It became prominently visible in September 2008 with the failure, merger, or conservatorship of several large United States-based financial firms. The underlying causes leading to the crisis had been reported in business journals for many months before September, with commentary about the financial stability of leading U.S. and European investment banks, insurance firms, and mortgage banks consequent to the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nThere are many reasons why economists think the crisis happened. Most economists believe that it started in the United States. From 1997 until 2006, people bought expensive houses, even though they did not have enough money for it. Since the money had come from other countries, it was easy to have good credit. People used this credit for expensive home loans. This created an economic bubble which caused the houses' prices to raise. Because they had a lot of money, the loaning companies made it easier to get a loan, even if the borrower didn't have a good credit history. These loans are known as subprime loans.\n\nDuring this time, many refinanced their homes. This caused their mortgage to change, giving them lower interest. After they refinanced, homeowners could take out another mortgage to use as spending money. The loaning companies changed their loans so that they had low interest at first, which would increase later. This is known as adjustable rate mortgage. The companies did this to try to convince more people to take loans. Many people with subprime loans also took these adjustable rate mortgages, hoping that the good price of housing would help them refinance later.\n\nWhile the housing prices were still high, many American and European companies, including banks, invested in subprime loans. These investments gave more money to the loaning companies, who used it to give out more subprime loans. These investments would make a lot of money as long as the prices of housing was high. \n\nHowever, the housing companies built too many houses. This caused the price of housing to decrease beginning in the summer of 2006. The value of many homes dropped below the value of the remaining mortgage debt, so the owners were unable to sell and move away. This is called negative equity. About 8.8 million homeowners in the U.S. had zero or negative equity by March 2008. This caused the number of foreclosures on homes to increase, meaning that many people lost their homes. During 2007, almost 1.3 million U.S. homes could be foreclosed on. The number of houses for sale continued to increase, which made the prices decrease. The homeowners with subprime loans left their houses with less value than they had when they were bought, which meant that the loans were worth more money than the house. The loaning companies were not able to make money from these houses.\n\nThe collapse of the housing bubble caused the value of investments to fall. The companies that had invested in subprime loans lost a total of about $512 billion. Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were two of the companies which lost the most money. More than half of the money lost, $260 billion, was lost by American firms.\n\n", "id": "136373", "title": "Financial crisis of 2007–2008"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136443", "text": "Carbon cycle\n\nThe carbon cycle is the way carbon is stored and replaced on Earth. Some of the main events take hundreds of millions of years, others happen annually.\nThe main ways that carbon gets into the carbon cycle are volcanoes, and the burning of fossil fuels like coal and gas. Through most of history, volcanoes were the biggest source of carbon to the carbon cycle, but in the last hundred years, people burning fossil fuels have added about a hundred time more CO to the air than volcanoes have. That is, for every ton of CO added to the air by volcanoes, about 100 tons of CO have been added to the air by people.\n\nThe main way carbon gets taken out of the atmosphere is by photosynthesis by living organisms. Some of this gets released as they die and decompose, but a proportion gets buried in sediment. This is shown in the diagram. Sediment turns to rock, and it is the carbonate rocks like limestone which contain the now-solid CO. Some of the carbon from plants also becomes part of the soil, where it can stay for a long time before decomposing.\n\nAnother process takes CO out of the air. Weathering by rain washes out CO in the form of dilute carbonic acid. This reacts with rock, helping to dissolve and destroy it. This also ends up as sediment.\n\nSome CO is also dissolved in the ocean. Right now, the oceans are taking in more CO than they are releasing, every year. However, this is making the oceans more acidic.\n\nThe store of carbon in sedimentary rock is far greater than the CO in the atmosphere (this is not shown in the diagram). Eventually it returns to the air as oceanic plates subduct in plate tectonics. At the margins of plate boundaries (and some other places) volcanoes form and spew out CO. This completes the cycle.\n\nThe carbon cycle is a process where carbon is recycled through the ecosystem. The concentration of carbon in living matter (18%) is almost 100 times greater than its concentration in the earth (0.19%). So living things extract carbon from their nonliving environment. For life to continue, this carbon must be recycled. See the diagram for a detailed look at the carbon cycle. An example of a route carbon takes in this cycle is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by plants and used in photosynthesis to produce sugars which the plant uses for energy. When the plant dies, it decomposes and the carbon stored in the plant will, over millions of years, form into coal (a fossil fuel). The coal is burnt and gives off carbon dioxide which goes into the atmosphere. Also the carbon cycle has to relate to quantum mechanics due to the restoration of water. \n\nAt the moment, the carbon cycle, and how human activity is affecting it, is a big topic in international news. Fossil fuels are a non-renewable resource which means that they cannot be replaced easily. Our use of fossil fuels has nearly doubled every 20 years since 1900. This release of carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect and acid rain.\nThe carbon cycle was discovered by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, and popularized by Humphry Davy.\n\n", "id": "136443", "title": "Carbon cycle"}

The Greek Sophists of the 5th century BC, such as Protagoras of Abdera (480–411 BC), were for the most part skeptics. Gorgias (485–380 BC) said that \"Nothing exists; if anything does exist, it cannot be known; if anything exists and can be known, it cannot be communicated\". In the 4th century BC Pyrrho of Elis (c360–275 BC), who travelled and studied as far as India, adopted practical skepticism. Carneades (c213–129 BC) denied absolute truth and falsity. He criticized the Dogmatists, especially supporters of Stoicism, asserting that absolute certainty of knowledge is impossible. Sextus Empiricus (c200 AD), the main authority for Greek skepticism, incorporated empiricism into the basis for asserting knowledge.\n\nThe nub of the argument is the proposition that unless we know \"something\" for certain, then we cannot know anything at all. The interest lies in the way great philosophers have sought to counter this problem. Some, like Descartes, retreat into the mind: \"I think, therefore I am\". Others, such as the British empiricists John Locke and David Hume, would rely on our sense perception. Certain kinds of knowledge may be especially vulnerable to skepticism. For example, an agnostic believes that knowledge of supernatural things cannot be attained. \n\nSkepticism is widely used as a method for research in science, and (with variations) in modern legal procedure. Here doubt, suspending judgement, methodical investigation, testing and discussion precede any statement of facts. Sometimes the process takes years before consensus is reached. This systematic approach is called \"methodological skepticism\". It is probably the most important legacy of the skeptics.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "136459", "title": "Skepticism"}

It is used in popular protocols like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (to protect Internet traffic) and WEP (to secure wireless networks).\n\nRC4 is known for being simple and quick, but attacks are likely to happen when the start of the output keystream is not removed, or one keystream is used twice; some ways of using RC4 can turn into very insecure cryptosystems such as WEP.\n\nRC4 was created by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. While its official name is \"Rivest Cipher 4\", the RC acronym is also known to stand for \"Ron's Code\" (see also RC2, RC5 and RC6).\n\nRC4 was first created as a trade secret, but in September 1994 a description of it was posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, and from there to many websites on the Internet. The code was confirmed to be genuine(not fake) as its output matched that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name \"RC4\" is trademarked, however. RC4 is often referred to as \"ARCFOUR\" or \"ARC4\" (meaning Alleged RC4, because RSA has never officially released the algorithm), to avoid possible trademark problems. It has become part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards, including WEP and WPA for wireless cards and TLS.\n\nThe two main reasons which helped its use over such a big range of applications are its speed and simplicity. Uses of RC4 in both software and hardware are extremely easy to develop.\n\nThe RC4 encryption algorithm is started with a different key length, usually between 40 and 256 bits, using the \"key-scheduling\" algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of encrypted bits is created using the \"pseudo-random generation algorithm\" (PRGA).\n\nRC4 fails the standards set by cryptographers for a secure cipher in many ways, and is not recommended for use in new applications as there are a lot of methods of attacking RC4. Dropping the first kilobyte of data from the keystream can improve the security somewhat.\n\n\nWhere a cryptosystem is marked with \"(optionally)\", RC4 is one of several ciphers the system can be set to use.\n\n\n\"RC4\"\n\n\"RC4 in WEP\"\n", "id": "136634", "title": "RC4"}

Blowfish has a good encryption rate in software and until 2008 no cryptanalytic attack model of it has been found. However, the AES block cipher algorithm now has more attention.\n\nSchneier made Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, to be used as a replacement for the old DES algorithm and to remove the problems and difficulties of other encryption algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other algorithms were proprietary, or were secrets. Schneier has said that, \"Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.\"\n\nMain features of the design include key-dependent S-boxes and a very complex key schedule. Blowfish is one of the fastest block ciphers used by many people, except when changing keys. Each new key needs to be pre-processed which takes the same time as encrypting about 4 kilobytes of text, which is very slow compared to other block ciphers. This stops its use in certain applications (such as in the smallest embedded systems like the early smartcards), but it is not a problem in other applications. In one of the applications, it is actually good: the password-hashing method used in OpenBSD uses an algorithm that comes from Blowfish which makes use of the slow key schedule; the idea is that the extra computational effort required gives protection against dictionary attacks. \"See\" key strengthening.\n\nBlowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 0 up to 448 bits\nIt is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. It is similar in structure to CAST-128, which uses fixed S-boxes.\n\nIn 1996, Serge Vaudenay found a known-plaintext attack needing 2 known plaintexts to break, where \"r\" is the number of rounds. Moreover, he also found a class of weak keys that can be detected and broken by the same attack with only 2 known plaintexts. This attack cannot be used against the regular Blowfish; it assumes knowledge of the key-dependent S-boxes. Vincent Rijmen, in his Ph.D. papers, introduced a second-order differential attack that can break four rounds and no more. Still there is no known way to break the full 16 rounds, apart from a brute-force search.\nA sign extension bug in one of the published C code has been found in 1996.\n\nThere is no good cryptanalysis on the full-round version of Blowfish known publicly till 2008. However, in 2007, Bruce Schneier noted that while Blowfish is still in use, he recommended using the new Twofish algorithm instead \n\n\n\n", "id": "136640", "title": "Blowfish (cipher)"}

The game gets updated quite regularly.\n\n\"Sauerbraten\" was made out of the game Cube, but is much more advanced and a player can create new levels. \"Sauerbraten\" was not made to look very good, but to allow easy map making within the game without making a big download. \"Sauerbraten CTF Edition\" is less than 350 megabytes.

Online game types are deathmatch, last man standing,\"Capture\" (where teams fight for control of parts on the map), Quake-style Capture the Flag, also instant-shot games (Instagib, Insta-clan-arena, insta-capture) as well as online multiplayer map editing, which is one of \"Sauerbraten\"'s most interesting and popular features.

The crier can also be used in court or official announcements. Criers often dress elaborately, a tradition known from the 18th century, in a red and gold robe, white breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat. \n\nThey carry a handbell to make a loud noise and they shout the words \"Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!\" before making their announcements. The word \"Oyez\" means \"hear ye,\" which is a call for silence and attention. \"Oyez\" is from an Anglo-Norman word for \"listen\". Some town criers announcements are recorded in books called a Proclamation Book The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records the town criers call as \"O Yes, O Yes!\"\n\nIn Medieval England, town criers were the most important way of spreading news with the people of a town. Many could not read newspapers. Royal proclamations, local bylaws, market days, advertisements and even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or town crier for centuries. During Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar that was damaged in their packet boat and this was advertised by the town crier.\n\nChester's first 'belman' was in 1540. His was paid one (old) penny for 'going for anything that is lost' and 4 old pennies for leading a funeral procession. In 1681, a fire safety law that all houses should have tiled rooves, not thatched, was to 'be published throughout the city by the day bellman. In 1553, the crier was paid 13 old pennies for 'ridunge the banes' (reading the banns or adverts) for the Chester Mystery Plays. In 1598, bellman Richard Woodcock must have been dressed in a similar way to the London bellman, for he had 'a tymber mast typt at both endes and embellished in the middest with silver' (a wooden stick with silver decorations). \n\nIn 1620, there was a fight at the crossroads between the butchers and the bakers where the 'Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them'(broke his silver stick among them). In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, that putting rubbish in the river was illegal. In 1715, a local man recorded that the 'Belman at the Cross ... Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to bee of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night'. In 1743, John Posnitt took over as 'Day and Night Bellman'.\n\nIn 1792, Chester had a day-time and night-time bellman, John Yarwood and a crier, William Ratcliffe, but by 1835 there seems to have been only one position. It was not until 1998 that Chester had both a crier and a bellman again.\n\nTown criers were protected by royalty, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. To this day, any town crier in the British Commonwealth is protected under old English law that they are \"not to be hindered or heckled while performing their duties\". To injure or harm a town crier was seen as an act of treason against the ruling monarchy. The term \"Posting A Notice\" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn.\n\nThe same as England, town criers were the most important way to deliver news to the people of the town because many people could not read newspapers or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.\n\nCriers were not always men, many town criers were women. Bells were not the only way to make noise - in Holland, a gong was often used, and in France a drum was used, or a hunting horn.\n\nThe best dressed town crier and escort at the last World Championships (date of entry 2008) are Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford, UK. They also hold the title of the best dressed town crier in Britain 2008 Competition held at Alnwick for the Loyal Company of Town Criers. They are also the Best Dressed Crier at the National Town Crier Competition in Hastings 2007.\n\nPeter Moore has been The London Town Crier for more than 30 years. He is Town Crier for The Mayor of London, The City of Westminster, and London Boroughs. He is also Freeman and Liveryman of The City of London.\n\nAlan Myatt holds the world record as the loudest town cryer at 112.8 decibels.\nThe need for town criers has disappeared and they became part of the local folklore. There are European and World Championship competitions for modern town criers.\n\n\n", "id": "136798", "title": "Town crier"}

The amount of information in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person who does not know its value. \n\nA key measure in information theory is \"entropy\". Entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty involved in the value of a random variable or the outcome of a random process.

He was a major figure in modern art and painted some of the first modern abstract works. His art changed several times during his life. It was fauvist, abstract, expressionist and constructivist in turn.\n\nBorn in Moscow, Kandinsky spent his childhood in Odessa. He enrolled at the University of Moscow and chose to study law and economics. Quite successful in his profession—he was offered a professorship (chair of Roman Law) at the University of Dorpat—he started painting studies (life-drawing, sketching and anatomy) at the age of 30. \n\nIn 1896 he settled in Munich and studied first in a private school, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. He went back to Moscow in 1914 after World War I started. He was unsympathetic to the official theories on art in Moscow and returned to Germany in 1921. There he taught at the Bauhaus school of art and architecture from 1922 until the Nazis closed it in 1933. He then moved to France where he lived the rest of his life, and became a French citizen in 1939. He died at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1944.\n\nLater in life he would recall being fascinated and stimulated by colour as a child. His fascination with colour symbolism and psychology continued as he grew. In 1889, he was part of an ethnographic research group which travelled to the Vologda region north of Moscow. In \"Looks on the Past\", he tells how the houses and churches were decorated with such shimmering colours that, on entering them, he felt he was moving into a painting. This experience, and his study of the region's folk art (particularly the use of bright colours on a dark background), can be seen in much of his early work. \n\nHe was interested in geometry in art and philosophy. The creative aspect of the form is expressed by a descending series of circles, triangles and squares.\n\n", "id": "136865", "title": "Kandinsky"}

He established a new unified political polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the following Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from northwest India, across Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, southern Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula, to the Pyrenees. \n\nThe Arab conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire. Though spectacular, the Arab successes are not hard to understand in hindsight. The Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires were militarily exhausted from decades of fighting one another. This prevented them from dealing effectively with the mobile Arab raiders operating from the desert. Moreover, many of the peoples living under the rule of these empires, for example Jews and Christians in Persia and Monophysites in Syria, were disloyal and sometimes even welcomed the Arab invaders, largely because of religious conflict in both empires.\n\nSome of the individual conquests are mentioned here:\n\nThe Byzantine-Arab Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates.\n\nUnder the Rashidun there were the conquests of Syria (637), Armenia (639), Egypt (639) and North Africa (652). Under the Umayyads the continuing conquest of North Africa (665), the second Arab siege of Constantinople (717-718) and the conquest of Tbilisi (736). In 827 there followed the conquest of southern Italy (827).\n\nThe last ruler of the Sassanid Empire in Persia was defeated by the Rashidun in 633 and 636, but the final military victory didn't come until 642 when the Persian army was destroyed. \n\nDuring the seventh century the Umayyad fought successfully against the early Rajput in north India and in Central Asia. \n\nIn 711, a Muslim expedition defeated Raja Dahir at what is now Hyderabad in Sindh and established Umayyad rule by 712. The Umayyad brought under control the whole of what is modern Pakistan, from Karachi to Kashmir and reached the borders of Kashmir within three years. But rather soon afterwards semi-independent Arab ruled states developed.\n\nThe conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when the Moors (mostly Berbers with some Arabs) invaded Visigothic Christian Iberia (modern Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Andorra) in the year 711. They landed at Gibraltar on April 30 and worked their way northward. This territory, under the Arab name \"Al-Andalus\", became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids. In 1031 the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492, when Granada, the last kingdom of Al-Ándalus fell under the Spanish Kings.\n\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast. Muslim traders spread Islam.\n\nThe modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires: the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe, the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia, and the Mughal Empire of India; along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe.\n\nThe Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. \n\n\n", "id": "136870", "title": "Muslim conquests"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136887", "text": "Key space\n\nIn cryptography, the key space of an algorithm refers to the set of all possible keys that can be used to initialize the cryptographic algorithm. For example, if an algorithm works using a key that is a string of 10 bits, then its key space is the set of all binary strings of length 10 bits; i.e. we have key space of size 2 = 1024.\n\nTo avoid attackers from guessing the key using a brute-force attack, the key space is usually designed to be very large. Another needed attribute is that the key space designed to be \"flat\", having no or very few weak keys.\n\nThe block cipher Rijndael/AES uses a key of up to 256 bits, resulting in a key space containing about 2 which is over 1.1579 × 10 keys. This makes it \"computationally infeasible\" to check each possible key by brute force.\n\nIn the DES block cipher, a 56-bit key is used, resulting in a relatively small key space of size 2.\n\nThe ROT13 cipher is only designed to prevent people from accidentally reading messages (e.g. movie plot details).

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136902", "text": "Unitarianism\n\nUnitarianism is a term that describes some forms of Christianity. Unitarianism can be described as the belief that God is just one person. This is different from what most other Christians think, which is that God is three different people all in the same person. That belief is called Trinitarianism. Unitarian Christians believe in Jesus of Nazareth. They think that Jesus was a great leader and prophet, but they generally do not think that Jesus is part of God himself.\n\nThe \"Son of God\" is a being that existed before Jesus' human life. It is called the Logos who dwelt with God in the beginning and then was born as the man Jesus. However, he is not eternal, but had a beginning of existence. God created him. This theology is commonly called Arianism, but there are many varieties of this form of Unitarianism. They range from the belief that the Son, before he came to earth, was a divine spirit of the same nature as God to the belief that he was an angel or other lesser spirit creature of a wholly different nature from God. Arius' views are only one variation of this theology.\n\nWhatever the case, in this belief system, Jesus is beneath God, but higher than humans (and has always been so). This concept could be referred to as \"elevated subordinationism.\" It is associated with early church figures such as Justin Martyr, Lucian of Antioch, Eusebius of Caesarea, Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia, Asterius the Sophist, Eunomius, and Ulfilas, as well as Felix, Bishop of Urgel and others who believed that Jesus was God in his divine nature but his divinity in his human nature was through adoption. Arian forms of Unitarianism remain among Unitarians in Transylvania, Hungary, France, and several countries in Africa. Famous Arian Unitarians include Isaac Newton, Andrews Norton and Dr. William Ellery Channing.Ralph Waldo Emerson's father was a Unitarian pastor.\n\nSince the 19th century, several Evangelical or Revivalist movements also used an elevated subordinationist theology. This can be best described as Nontrinitarianism, rather than Unitarianism. Important figures include Barton W. Stone and Charles Taze Russell. Theologies among Evangelical Unitarians are sometimes classed as Arian, and sometimes Sabellian (Jesus is God in the flesh, the manifestation of God, who exists as a single person) and the Chinese-based sabbatarian True Jesus Church. Other modern non-trinitarian churches, such as the Filipino-based Iglesia ni Cristo, may also be included, although they reject the \"unitarian\" name to avoid confusion. Jehovah's Witnesses also have a nontrinitarian theology with specific traits. The Christian Churches of God (CCG) is another Unitarian Church with a World Conference. It has a lot of material on Unitarian theology and history and holds the doctrine of the Pre-existence of Jesus Christ. CCG like other Sabbatarian Churches of God trace their ancestry back to the early church and follow biblical law. The CCG and Sabbatarians are sometimes erroneously called Arians due to the pejorative Trinitarian use of that term and also that of Subordinationists (see Bibliography).\n\nThis theology ranges from the belief that Jesus was merely a great man filled with the Holy Spirit (sometimes called Psilanthropism or, more commonly, Socinianism) to the belief that he is the incarnation of God's \"impersonal\" Logos. It is associated with early church figures like the Ebionites, Theodotus of Byzantium, Artemon, and Paul of Samosata in the early Church, Marcellus of Ancyra and his pupil Photinus in the 4th century AD, and Michael Servetus, Ferenc Dávid and Faustus Socinus in the Protestant Reformation. It is from the latter that we get the word \"Socinianism,\" but the teaching of Socinus is unique in more than just its Christology, and so the name is best not used as merely a Christological term.\n\nIn modern times we see the psilanthropist view manifested in Rationalist Unitarianism, which emerged from the German Rationalism and the liberal theology of the 19th century. Its proponents took a highly intellectual and humanistic approach to religion. They rejected most of the miraculous events in the Bible (including the virgin birth.) They embraced evolutionary concepts, stated that man was good by default and abandoned the doctrine of biblical infallibility. Rationalist Unitarianism is distinguished from Deism (with which it nevertheless shares many features) by its belief in a personal deity who directly acts on creation, while Deists see God as holding aloof from creation.\n\nNotable Rationalist Unitarians include Ralph Waldo Emerson and Theodore Parker in theology and ministry, Joseph Priestley and Linus Pauling in science, Susan B. Anthony and Florence Nightingale in humanitarianism and social justice, Charles Dickens in literature, and Frank Lloyd Wright in arts. Many Hungarian Unitarians embrace the principles of Rationalist Unitarianism—the only Unitarian high school in the world, John Sigismund Unitarian Academy in Cluj Napoca (Kolozsvár, Klausenburg), Romania, teaches Rationalist Unitarianism. The psilanthropist concept of the nature of Jesus is similar to the viewpoint held by the Islamic faith, which regards Jesus as a non-divine and human Prophet. The Christadelphians, the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith and the Biblical Unitarians are Evangelical Unitarians.\n\n", "id": "136902", "title": "Unitarianism"}

Even though it has temperatures of 2,000 °C (3,360 °F), the density of the thermosphere is so low that it doesn't feel hot. Within this layer, ultraviolet radiation causes ionization. That is why it is also called the ionosphere. Shortwave radio waves can bounce off the Kennelly-Heaviside layer (ionosphere) and go to distant parts of the Earth.

Canowindra is on the Belubula River. \n\nA post office opened in 1847. The mail came through Carcoar. It was not part of the road to the Lachlan because it didn't have a bridge.\n\nIn October 1863, bushranger Ben Hall's gang took over the village for three days. Everyone was held hostage in the hotel. The gang held a big party for everyone in the hotel. A monument to Ben Hall was put up in 1951 on the site of Robinson's hotel, the \"Travellers' Rest\". New research shows that the events happened at an hotel on the other side of the river.\n\nThe Royal Hotel is on the site of another hotel owned by Robinson. A sign on the wall says this was where Ben Hall's gang had their party. Other important buildings include the nursing home, the Junction Hotel, Finn's Building, the Victoria Hotel, the former Bank of NSW and the former CBC Bank. The Trading Post is a homewares shop that won a tourism award for 2006.\n\nCanowindra is also known as the Balloon Capital of Australia. One of the largest festivals in Australia used to take place here every April. This was called Marti's Fiesta, which is no longer held due to lack of money.\n\nAustralian country music star Captain Flange makes his home in Canowindra.\n\nThe town is the site of one of the world's great fossil discoveries. A road worker in 1956 found 360 million year old fish fossils. These were from the Devonian period in the Palaeozoic era. The \"Canowindra slab\" was taken to the Australian Museum, Sydney. The fish had been trapped in a pool of water that dried up. The fish found were two armoured antiarch placoderms, \"Remigolepis walkeri\" and \"Bothriolepis yeungae.\" They also found \"Canowindra grassi\", a lobe-finned crossopterygian fish, with two rare young arthrodire placoderms, \"Groenlandaspis\" species.\n\nMore fossils were found in January 1993 using an excavator to dig down to the fossil layer. Many fish were preserved in detail. Specimens can be seen in the Age of Fishes Museum. This was built with support and funding from the Australian Museum. The Canowindra site has now been listed as part of Australia's National Heritage because of its international scientific importance.\n", "id": "137008", "title": "Canowindra, New South Wales"}

Accelerators work by pushing particles like electrons, protons, or atomic nuclei (the centers of atoms) with electric fields and by steering them with magnetic fields. Their main use is to study particle physics. \n\nThe largest accelerators are used to study particles smaller than atoms; smaller accelerators are used to study atomic nuclei and make radioactive materials. There are two kinds of particle accelerators: linear accelerators and circular accelerators. Linear accelerators move the particles in a line, while circular accelerators move the particles in a circle. One example of a particle accelerator is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It is very big, stretching through two countries. Another example is the Tevatron in the United States. An example of a particle accelerator used in everyday life is the cathode ray tube, used in older televisions and computer monitors.\n\nWhen accelerated particles hit other particles such as atoms, smaller pieces come out. This helps people see particles smaller than an atom. Normally those particles cannot be seen, but they can in the particle accelerator. This is because in some ways energy and matter are the same thing. At the high speed created in these machines, some of the movement energy is changed into matter. It is the opposite process that nuclear weapons use; nuclear weapons turn matter into energy. Small amounts of antimatter are also created during the process.\nThe particle accelerator at CERN was set up to search for the Higgs Boson particle, which would complete the Standard Model of Particle Physics.\n\nParticle accelerators often use very advanced technology. This makes them cost a lot of money which is usually paid by governments. \n", "id": "137042", "title": "Particle accelerator"}

For messages sent through an insecure channel, a good implementation of digital signature algorithm is the one that makes the receiver believe that the message was sent by the claimed sender, and trust the message.\n\nDigital signatures are equivalent to traditional handwritten signatures in many respects; properly implemented digital signatures are more difficult to copy than the handwritten type. Digital signature are implemented using cryptography. Digital signatures can also provide acknowledgement, meaning that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message, while also claiming their private key remains secret;\n\nDigital signatures are often used to implement electronic signatures, a broader term that refers to any electronic data that holds a meaning of a signature, but not all electronic signatures use digital signatures. In some countries, including the United States, and in the European Union, electronic signatures may have legal significance.\n\nA digital signature system typically consists of three algorithms:\n\n\nTwo main properties are required by the digital signature system:\n\nThe GMR signature scheme:\n\nIn 1984, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Ronald Rivest became the first to strictly define the security requirements of digital signature schemes. They described a hierarchy of attack models for signature schemes, they also present the GMR signature scheme. GMR scheme was proven to be secure against adaptive chosen-message attacks — even when an attacker receives signatures for messages of his choice, this does not allow him to copy a signature for a single additional message.\n\nIn their foundational paper, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest lay out a hierarchy of attack models against digital signatures:\n\n\nThey also describe a hierarchy of attack results:\n\n\nThe strongest notion of security, therefore, is security against existential forgery under an adaptive chosen message attack.\n\nDIGITAL SIGNATURES\n\nA digital signature is an electronic signature.\n\nIt can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message.\n\nIt ensures that the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged.\n\nDigital signatures cannot be imitated by someone else.\n\nIt can be automatically time-stamped.\n\nThe sender too cannot deny sending the message whether it is encrypted or not.\n\nIt ensures the receiver of the sender's identity.\n\nIt demonstrates the authencity of a digital message or document.\n\nThese are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions etc.\n\nDigital signatures are equivalent to hand written signatures but are more difficult to forge than handwritten signatures.\n\nUSES OF DIGITAL SIGNATURES:\n\na) Authentication\n\nb) Integrity\n\nc) Non-repudition\n\na) Authentication:\n\nDigital signatures can be used to authenticate the source of messages.\n\nb) Integrity:\n\nIf a message is digitally signed, any change in the message after signature will invalidate the signature .\n\nThe message cannot be modified, and if modified a new message with a valid signature cannot be produced.\n\nc) Non - repudation :\n\nIt is an important aspect of digital signatures.\n\nA sender cannot deny having sent the document after signing it.\n\n", "id": "137121", "title": "Digital signature"}

The key is used to encrypt and decrypt data whatever the data is being encrypted or decrypted.\n\nModern cryptographic systems include symmetric-key algorithms (such as DES and AES) and public-key algorithms (such as RSA). Symmetric-key algorithms use a single shared key; keeping data secret requires keeping this key secret. Public-key algorithms use a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone (often by means of a digital certificate). A sender will encrypt data with the public key; only the holder of the private key can decrypt this data.\n\nSince public-key algorithms tend to be much slower than symmetric-key algorithms, modern systems such as TLS and its predecessor SSL as well as the SSH use a combination of the two in which: \n\nThe simplest method to read encrypted data is a brute force attack–simply attempting every number, up to the maximum length of the key. Therefore, it is important to use a sufficiently long key length; longer keys take exponentially longer time to attack, making a brute force attack invisible and impractical. \n\nCurrently, commonly used key lengths are:\n\nIn computer cryptography keys are integers. In some cases keys are randomly generated using a random number generator (RNG) or pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), the latter being a computer algorithm that produces data which appears random under analysis. Some types the PRNGs algorithms utilize system entropy to generate a seed data, such seeds produce better results, since this makes the initial conditions of the PRNG much more difficult for an attacker to guess. \n\nIn other situations, the key is created using a passphrase and a \"key generation algorithm\", using a cryptographic hash function such as SHA-1.\n\n", "id": "137123", "title": "Key generation"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137129", "text": "Symmetric-key algorithm\n\nSymmetric-key algorithms are ways of doing cryptography where the keys for decryption and encryption are exactly the same shared secret. You can generate the secret randomly, from a password, or through a secret key-exchange procedure like Diffie-Hellman.\n\nSymmetric-key algorithms are very important because they are faster on computers than public-key algorithms. In public-key cryptography, also called asymmetric-key cryptography, it is hard to figure out the key for decryption from the key for encryption, so you can tell the key for encryption to the public with no problem, and everyone can send you secret messages. This is very useful, but public-key cryptography algorithms are very slow on computers, so they are actually only used to send a shared secret, and then symmetric-key algorithms are used for everything else because they are faster.\n\nThere are two kinds of symmetric-key algorithms, called stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers encrypt a message as a stream of bits one at a time. Block ciphers take blocks of bits, encrypt them as a single unit, and sometimes use the answer later too. Blocks of 64 bits have been commonly used; though modern ciphers like the Advanced Encryption Standard use 128-bit blocks.\n\nExamples of popular symmetric cyphers include Twofish, Serpent, AES (aka Rijndael), Blowfish, CAST5, RC4, TDES, and IDEA.\n\nIn history, some symmetric ciphers were broken by cryptanalysis, so it was less safe to use them for secrets. Some attacks are called known-plaintext attacks, chosen plaintext attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. \n\nOther terms for symmetric-key encryption are secret-key, single-key, shared-key, one-key and eventually private-key encryption. Make sure that the use of the latter term does not conflict with the term \"private key\" in public-key cryptography.\n\nUnlike symmetric algorithms, asymmetric key algorithms use a different key for encryption than for decryption. Meaning, a user knowing the encryption key of an asymmetric algorithm can encrypt messages, but cannot calculate the decryption key and cannot decrypt messages encrypted with that key. A short comparison of these two types of algorithms is given below: \n\nSymmetric-key algorithms are generally much less \"computationally intensive\" than asymmetric key algorithms. In practice, asymmetric key algorithms are typically hundreds to thousands times slower than symmetric key algorithms.\n\nOne disadvantage of symmetric-key algorithms is the requirement of a \"shared secret key\", with both parties holding the same copy at each end. \nIn order to ensure secure communications between everyone in a group of n people a total of \"n\"(\"n\" - 1)/2 keys are needed, which is the total number of possible communication channels.\nTo limit the impact of a potential discovery by a cryptographic attacker, they should be changed regularly and kept secure during distribution and in service. The process of selecting, distributing and storing keys is known as key management, and is difficult to achieve reliably and securely.\n\nIn modern cryptosystems designs, both asymmetric (public key) and symmetric algorithms are used to take advantage of the best of both. \nAsymmetric algorithms are used to distribute symmetric-keys at the start of a session. Once a symmetric key is known to all parties of the session, faster symmetric-key algorithms using that key can be used to encrypt the remainder of the session. This simplifies the key distribution problem, because asymmetric keys only have to be distributed authentically, while symmetric keys need to be distributed in both an authentic and confidential manner.\n\nSystems that use such a hybrid approach include SSL, PGP and GPG, etc.\n\n", "id": "137129", "title": "Symmetric-key algorithm"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137175", "text": "Duke Nukem 3D\n\nDuke Nukem 3D is a first-person shooter video game. It was made by 3D Realms and sold by Apogee Software. It was first sold on January 29, 1996. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" is based on the main character from the platform games \"Duke Nukem\" and \"Duke Nukem II\" which were also published by Apogee. The character is voiced by Jon St. John.\n\nIn the game, players control Duke Nukem, an action hero from Earth. Players must fight invading aliens that want to take over Earth. The game is made up of 28 levels spread over three chapters. An add-on pack called \"The Plutonium Pak\", later added a fourth episode of 11 new levels, new enemies, and one new weapon.\n\nThe game is a first person shooter, so the player sees the game from Duke's eyes. Instead of following the character around like a third-person shooter, Duke Nukem is like being \"inside\" Duke, and the player can see Duke's hands and weapons on the screen. The player fights the aliens, most often by shooting at them with different guns, but Duke can also kick, and throw pipe bombs like grenades. The player must also sometimes solve puzzles to find the way through the level.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" is set \"sometime in the early 21st century\", starting in a badly worn down Los Angeles. The game moves on to places such as lunar space stations. An alien transgenic species has invaded Earth while Duke has been fighting in space. Duke crash lands back on Earth and finds most humans are gone. Only a few women remain as slaves for the aliens. America has been turned into a wasteland, and pornography has become the only entertainment.\n\nThe levels of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" take the player outdoors and indoors, on the street, inside military bases, deserts, flooded cities, space stations, moon bases and Japanese villas. Levels were designed with many routes so that players can climb through air ducts, back doors and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden secrets. This makes the levels well suited to multiplayer deathmatchs. The secret items also include (light switches to make it easier to see, water fountains and broken hydrants provide some health points) or simply provide a touch of diversion and strippers who Duke tells jokes to and sometimes they open up their clothes.\n\nThe game includes a range of weapons, some of which, even today, are still unique to the \"Duke Nukem\" series. They range from Duke's foot for kicking, a pistol, a \"Chain gun\" (similar in design to the Nordenfelt gun), pipe bombs, freeze- and shrink-rays, and laser-trip-mines.\n\nAside from weapons, Nukem can also find 'medkits' to heal himself whenever the player chooses. Steroids make the player move faster, as well as removing the effects of the shrink-ray. Nightvision goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The \"HoloDuke\" device projects a fake hologram of Duke that can be used to trick enemies. Protective boots allow the player to cross dangerously hot or toxic floors. For underwater scenes, scuba gear (an aqua-lung) can be used to let Duke breathe. One of the favorite items is the jetpack which allows the player to fly up in the sky, often to reach hidden weapons or extra health. Many of the secret items such as the jetpack, the scuba gear and the night vision goggles only last for a short time. Weapons also have a limited number of ammunition.\n\nThere are many monsters in the game. Some of these are aliens, others mutated humans (the LAPD has been turned into monster pigs). Similar to many first-person shooter games, Nukem encounters a large number of weaker enemies, and a small number of boss enemies (extremely powerful). Like Duke, these \"boss\" enemies have a wide range of weapons and equipment (some weaker enemies have jet packs).\n\nIn 1996, at the time of the game's release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning and \"Duke Nukem 3D\" could be played on IPX LAN or modem. \"Duke Nukem 3D\" players often used the IPX network utility Kali or the Total Entertainment Network (TEN) online service. Kali allowed users to join a chat room to find opponents. The Total Entertainment Network had hundreds of Duke 3D players online at any time, but players had to pay money monthly for it. The game's levels are often used as the battlegrounds for these online players, bur users are able to create their own levels (\"maps\"). The game also features co-operative play (co-op) which allows players to fight against the aliens instead of each other. In the \"Atomic\" version, a new game play mode was introduced: Duke Tag, a \"capture the flag\" style mode.\n\nKen Silverman's Build engine allowed complicated levels. The game could use slopes in the floors. It also supports upwards and downwards mouse aiming (though aiming up and down distorts the graphics due to not having perspective correction).\n\nDuke Nukem 3D \"Build\" engine had doors/walls that can move sideways. The \"Build\" scripting system allows a whole string of moving and sliding parts with sound effects, such as buildings falling down, earthquakes, and walls that break apart when hit with explosives. One of the more advanced effects is the horizontal sliding platform that can move the player inside a small sliding room, which made it possible to create subway cars moving in a timed sequence around a ring-shaped track.\n\nThe \"Build\" engine makes horizontally moving platforms possible by allowing several objects to pass through the same 2D space. While inside one of these spaces, it is not possible to see into the other space, and so the Byuild 2.5D engine has no problem rendering one space or the other even though the map data literally shows the two areas to be occupying the same place. Several \"Duke Nukem 3D\" maps use this feature to create bizarre mind-bending maps where multiple large rooms all seem to be occupying one 3D space. One secret level in particular (\"Lunatic Fringe\" from episode 2, Lunar Apocalypse) has a map where the player can travel 720 degrees around a circle and not cross their path. This would be much more difficult to duplicate with modern true-3D map editors and engines. \n\nAn early beta (testing) version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" called LameDuke was released by 3D Realms as a \"bonus\" one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support.\n\nLameDuke features four episodes. Some weapons were removed and/or altered from the original versions.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" is often thought of as one of the first videogames to have adult humor and sexual themes, especially in the first-person shooter genre. Jokes about American consumerism, Hollywood culture, and sex in the media are made all through the game. Duke's world is out of control and virtually all forms of entertainment in this future have been reduced to pornography by the aliens.\n\nThe game has been heavily attacked by some critics, who claim that it supports pornography and murder. Media Watch made the following comments about the game.\n\"\"Duke Nukem 3D\" moves the 'shooter' through pornography stores, where Duke can use XXX sex posters for target practice. Duke throws cash at a prostituted woman telling her to 'Shake it, Baby' his gun ever ready. In the game bonus points are awarded for the murder of these mostly prostituted and partially nude women. Duke blows up stained glass windows in an empty church or goes to strip clubs where Japanese women lower their kimonos exposing their breasts. Duke is encouraged to kill defenseless, often bound women.\"— Media Watch, Teaching Boys To Kill\"\nIn reality, Duke Nukem 3D does not contain a \"bonus points\" system; even accidental shooting of innocents in the game is, sometimes, punished by a sudden group of enemies attacking.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" was banned in Brazil, along with \"Quake\", \"Doom\" and several other violent first-person shooters. As a response to complaints, censored versions of the game were sold in some countries to avoid being banned. In Germany, the BPjM placed the game on the \"List of Media Harmful to Young People\".\n\nMany spin-offs and modifications to the original \"Duke Nukem 3D\" were produced after the game's initial launch.\n\nPlutonium PAK/Atomic Edition: The Atomic Edition of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was first sold in November 1996, and contained the original 3 episode game as well as a new eleven-level fourth episode. The Plutonium PAK was also sold as an upgrade package to convert the first available version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" (v1.3d) to the new Atomic Edition (v1.4, later upgraded again to v1.5). It includes three new enemies: the Protector Drone, the Pig Cop Tank, and a new boss known as The Alien Queen. It also includes a new weapon, the Microwave Expander, with its own special ammunition. It also has several improvements to the software of the game, which allow the game's players to create new enemies and items. Also this version includes a computer controlled second player to simulate multiplayer games.\n\nEDuke (\"Enhanced Duke Nukem 3D\"): created by Matthew Saettler was given away as a patch for Atomic Edition users on July 28, 2000. On this version 3D Realms removed the copyrights from the software so that players could do anything they liked with it and included a demo mod made by several beta testers. The demo included new Sector-Based Effects, Sprite-Based Elevators, Ladders, a Bouncing Particle Fountain, a Personal Teleporter, and a Sophisticated Translucent Water Effect. Saettler has kept records of his original Eduke site hee for reference.\n\nDuke Caribbean: Life's a Beach: This is an add-on created by Sunstorm Interactive. Duke relaxes on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own \"vacation\" there. This unofficial add-on has a sunny Caribbean atmosphere, nice beaches and hotels as well as some of the original Duke Nukem 3D stuff fit in. It includes levels created by Charlie Wiederhold, who later worked for 3D Realms to work on \"Duke Nukem Forever\", the upcoming sequel to \"Duke Nukem 3D\".\n\nDuke it out in D.C.: In this storyline, President Bill Clinton is captured by alien forces, and it is up to Duke to save him. This pack has levels that are based on real locations of Washington DC, such as the White House, the FBI headquarters, the Smithsonian museum, and the Washington Monument and others. This game was also developed by Sunstorm Interactive.\n\nDuke: Nuclear Winter: This one was developed by Simply Silly Software. In the storyline, Santa Claus is mind-controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth. Several of the levels take place near the North Pole. This game has sometimes been criticized for using content from the original Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nDuke Xtreme: An add-on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and contained 50 levels and many items. This version had many technical problems.\n\nDuke!Zone (Parts 1 and 2): Was sold by WizardWorks and had over 500 levels made by fans of Duke Nukem 3D. \"Duke!ZONE II\", contained three episodes designed by WizardWorks.\n\n\"Duke Nukem 3D\" has been included in several compilations. A bundle called \"East Meets West\" included the full versions of \"Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition\" and \"Shadow Warrior\". A bundle called \"Duke Nukem: Kill-A-Ton Collection\" featured \"Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition\", \"Duke Xtreme\", \"Duke!ZONE II\", \"Duke Nukem I\" (\"Duke Nukum\"), \"Duke Nukem II\", and various other utilities. Both of these compilations are no longer sold. Earlier packages of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" also included the complete versions of \"Duke Nukem\" I and II as a bonus.\n\nIn 1998, 3D Realms filed a lawsuit against Micro Star over its add-on pack \n\"Nuke It\" and won. \n\nThe source code to the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as free software under the GPL on April 1, 2003. The artwork remains copyright protected. Many programmers altered so that it can be played on modern computers. As of 2007, these projects gave the game a second life in multiplayer games through the Internet and a growing community is still actively playing.\n\nThe first modern \"Duke Nukem 3D\" project was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows and prossibly others. The icculus.org software would later be used in the Rancidmeat, and later, the xDuke projects.\n\nOne popular project is Jonathon Fowler's JFDuke3D, which the original creator of \"'Duke Nukem 3D\", Ken Silverman, gave support to, in December 2003. Fowler and Silverman produced a new version of JFDuke3D using Polymost, an OpenGL software product for Build, which uses much more advanced 3D models, and 32-bit color. Another project JFDuke3D called xDuke (not related to the xDuke project by icculus.org/duke3d) was created for play on the Xbox.\n\nSilverman has helped Fowler with a lot of other software work related to the game. \n\nHere is a list of some of the most popular \"Duke Nukem 3D\" versions played in 2008:\n\nProjects such as the \"Duke Nukem 3D High Resolution Pack\" were started to give the game the same quality as modern games. There are plans to continue enhancing the \"'Duke Nukem 3D\" software but no new versions of JFDuke3D have appeared since 2005.\n\nA few projects have been created from the EDuke version (most notably WinEDuke and EDuke 2.1.1), but it was not until the release of Richard Gobeille's EDuke32 (a version of JFDuke3D using Saettler's EDuke software) in 2004 that EDuke became a the most popular with programmers. EDuke32 has been capable of playing OGG music since September 2007. A pack of music was compiled is planned to be part of future versions of the High Resolution Pack. In June 2008, EDuke32 became the first \"Duke Nukem 3D\" project to be played as 64-bit software thanks to the DOSBox team.\n\nIn 1997, \"Duke Nukem 3D\" versions were sold for all the major consoles of the time. \n\nThe PlayStation version, \"Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown\", includes six extra areas and a secret level, which was also included in the PC version. It has some music from the PC version, some from the original, in Streaming XA-Audio made by Mark Knight, new enemies and a new boss.\n\nThe Sega Saturn version was created by Lobotomy Software and sold by Sega. It uses Lobotomy's \"SlaveDriver\" software. This version uses the Sega NetLink for online play, and is played with the Saturn's analog pad. It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini-game called \"Death Tank Zwei\". The Nintendo 64 version was named \"Duke Nukem 64\" and can be played by four players on a split-screen. There is no music in this version and many items have been renamed to avoid drug and sex references. Other changes include a fully 3D model for the final boss.\n\nIn 1998, a Sega Mega Drive version was sold by Tec Toy. The artwork is very simple and only one third of the original game was included. This version was sold in Brazil only. \n\nA version of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was also released for the Game.com, Tiger's handheld system.\n\nA Duke Nukem 3D version has been sold for Xbox Live since September 24, 2008. This version includes the ability to \"rewind\" the game to any point if Duke gets killed, video recording and online multiplayer games. The music is slightly better quality using modern MIDI tools.\n\n", "id": "137175", "title": "Duke Nukem 3D"}

During Partition of British India in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad declared his intentions of not joining either newly formed India or Pakistan. Sensing trouble, India launched Operation Polo which resulted in the absorption of Hyderabad into the Indian Union, in 1948.\n\nThe forebears of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty came to India from Samarkand, in Central Asia, but the family actually originated from Baghdad. In 1724, the Mughal Governor of the Deccan, Asaf Jah, Nizam ul-Mulk, Qamar ud-din Khan, established himself as an independent ruler of Deccan. Hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to that of the state he had created. The first Nizam's successors became closly allied to the British colonialists, frequently assisting them in subduing their enemies, the Maratha dynasty, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the French. In later years, the Nizam's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns undertaken by the British Indian Army. Large numbers of his troops took part in the First and Second World Wars. These contributions earned for the Nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful Emperor. \n\nThe state was the largest and premier of all princely states within the British Indian Empire. After the Pakistani and Indian Independences, the Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan Asaf Jah VII decided that the Princely state of Hyderabad will not join the New Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan. His decision found favour with Pakistan but not with India. The Nizam’s state was a prosperous one and had its own army, railway and airline network, postal system and radio network. On 15th August, 1947, India declared itself an independent nation. And so did Hyderabad.\n\nAt the time of the Independence movement of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest of all princely states in India. The Nizam ruled over lands extending to cover 82,698 mi² (214,190 km²) of fairly homogenous territory and was bigger than Belarus but was smaller than the Guyana. The Nizam ruled over a cosmopolitan comprised of a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (83%) was Hindu. These advantages persuaded the Nizam to attempt an Independent existence, when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. He blatantly refused or to succumb to be subdued to any pressure whatsoever to reluctantly to join either a Hindu India or an ally Muslim Pakistan, preferring to form a separate Kingdom of its own within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Hyderabad State had its own Army, Airline, Telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and Radio broadcasting service. Shocked by the idea of an Independent Sovereign state right in the heart of India, Deputy PM Sardar Patel consulted with Lord Mountbatten and he suggested Patel to resolve the challenge without having to resort to force. Attempts by certain groups of Muslim fundamentalists to ferment trouble and seize power, India then decided to offer Hyderabad a \"Standstill Agreement\", which assured that no military action will be taken against it. In June 1948, before leaving India, Mountbatten proposed the Heads of Agreement deal which gave Hyderabad the status of an Autonomous Dominion nation under India. The deal required the restriction of its armed forces and the adjourning of its voluntary forces. Hyderabad would be allowed to govern its territory, but its foreign affairs would be handled by the Indian Government. The deal was signed by India, but the Nizam refused. While these negotiations were being carried out, communal riots between Hindus and Muslims had broken out in Hyderabad. The state was also busy arming itself and was receiving arms from Pakistan and the Portuguese administration in the State of Goa. As soon as the Indian Government received information that Hyderabad was arming itself and planning to ally with Pakistan, the Indians then after decided to forcibly annex Hyderabad by a so-called, Police action. On the 4th September the Prime Minister of Hyderabad Mir Laiq Ali announced to the Hyderabad State Legislative Assembly that a delegation was about to leave for Lake Success, in New York, headed by Moin Nawaz Jung. The Nizam also appealed, without success, to the British Labour Government 1945–1951 and to the King of Pakistan for assistance, to fulfil their obligations and promises to Hyderabad by \"immediate intervention\". Hyderabad only had the support of Sir. Winston Churchill and the British Conservatives. The battle between India and Hyderabad began on 13th September 1948 and ended on 18th September after which the Nizam’s army surrendered to the Indian Army and Hyderabad became a part of India. This war which lasted five days resulted in loss of life and casualties and it is estimated that 32 were killed and 97 injured on the Indian side and 490 killed and 122 wounded on the Hyderabadi side. Thereon On 6 October 1948, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zafarullah, requested the President of the United Nations Security Council that Pakistan be permitted to participate in the discussion of the Hyderabad question in accordance with Article 31 of the United Nations' Charter. The Government of Pakistan took the case and raised the question of the State of Hyderabad to the United Nations security council Pursuant to Article 31, where it is still pending for resolution Pakistan has been mainly involved in arguments for the rights of Kashmiris. In spite of raising questions which predominantly affect Pakistan, the Pakistan delegation is often able to play a significant role in debates on other issues as well. As a number of states had not attained independence in the 1950s, Pakistan became effective spokesman of many Asian states and movements, It states: \n\nIn this distinct entity of State of Hyderabad, where no official Referendum was held and where the ruler did not accede, the forced accession to India brought about by Military action, was presumed to have the tacit approval of the predominantly Hindu population. In each case of annexation there was a different rationale, but a similar goal, namely Annexation of territories. The use of military force provided the only consistency in India's policy. The state that was once so well noted for its religious and ethnic toleration, ruled by a highly cultured and intellectually brilliant elite who maintained all that was best in the old Mughal order, was now no more. Although it has not always been satisfied with the effectiveness of the United Nations to act on Kashmir, Pakistan remains a keen and active member. Pakistan would like to see the United Nations strengthened so that it can serve as an effective force to uphold International law and protect weaker states.\n\nHistorical dates of Hyderabad Deccan State:\n\n\nThese were the 4 Divisions and 17 Districts combined which most of the former Princely state is as follows:\n\nAfter the states were captured they reorganised in 1956, Aurangabad became part of Maharashtra, and Gulbarga became part of Karnataka, the remainder became Andhra Pradesh.\n", "id": "137187", "title": "Hyderabad State"}

Quarks do not appear alone, they exist in groups and are held together by the strong nuclear force.

The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key. \n\nModern cryptography, is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications; for many applications, a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible. Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography, where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose.\n\nAny cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks; this is a conservative approach to security.\n\nTwo forms of chosen-plaintext attack can be distinguished:\n\n\n", "id": "137351", "title": "Chosen-plaintext attack"}

The ability to obtain any amount of information from the underlying ciphertext is considered a success. \n\nEvery modern cipher attempts to provide protection against ciphertext-only attacks. The process of selecting a new cipher design standard usually takes many years and includes exhaustive testing of large quantities of ciphertext for any statistical different approach from random noise. On the other hand, poor cipher depends on home-grown proprietary algorithms that have not been subjected to extensive testing and inspection; for this reason, many computer-age encryption systems are still subject to ciphertext-only attack but still in use.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137359", "text": "Chosen-ciphertext attack\n\nA chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is an attack model for cryptanalysis in which the cryptanalyst gathers information, at least in part, by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key. \n\nWhen a cryptosystem is susceptible to chosen-ciphertext attack, implementers must be careful to avoid situations in which an attackers might be able to decrypt chosen ciphertexts (i.e., avoid providing a decryption scheme). This can be more difficult than it appears, as even partially chosen ciphertexts can permit subtle attacks. Additionally, some cryptosystems (such as RSA) use the same mechanism to sign messages and to decrypt them. This permits attacks when hashing is not used on the message to be signed. A better approach is to use a cryptosystem which is provably secure under chosen-ciphertext attack, including (among others) RSA-OAEP, Cramer-Shoup and many forms of authenticated symmetric encryption.\n\nChosen-ciphertext attacks, like other attacks, may be adaptive or non-adaptive. In a non-adaptive attack, the attacker chooses the ciphertext or ciphertexts to decrypt in advance, and does not use the resulting plaintexts to inform their choice for more ciphertexts. In an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack, the attacker makes their ciphertext choices adaptively, that is, depending on the result of prior decryptions.\n\nA specially noted variant of the chosen-ciphertext attack is the \"lunchtime\" or \"midnight\" attack, in which an attacker may make adaptive chosen-ciphertext queries but only up until a certain point, after which the attacker must demonstrate some improved ability to attack the system. The term \"lunchtime attack\" refers to the idea that a user's computer, with the ability to decrypt, is available to an attacker while the user is out to lunch. This form of the attack was the first one commonly discussed: obviously, if the attacker has the ability to make adaptive chosen ciphertext queries, no encrypted message would be safe, at least until that ability is taken away. This attack is sometimes called the \"non-adaptive chosen ciphertext attack\"; here, \"non-adaptive\" refers to the fact that the attacker cannot adapt their queries in response to the challenge, which is given after the ability to make chosen ciphertext queries has expired. \n\nMany chosen-ciphertext attacks of practical importance are lunchtime attacks, including, for instance, when Daniel Bleichenbacher of Bell Laboratories demonstrated a practical attack against systems using the PKCS#1; invented and published by RSA Security.\n\nA (full) adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack is an attack in which ciphertexts may be chosen adaptively before and after a challenge ciphertext is given to the attacker, with ONE condition that the challenge ciphertext may not itself be queried. This is a stronger attack notion than the lunchtime attack, and is commonly referred to as a CCA2 attack, as compared to a CCA1 (lunchtime) attack. Few practical attacks are of this form. Rather, this model is important for its use in proofs of security against chosen-ciphertext attacks. A proof that attacks in this model are impossible implies that any practical chosen-ciphertext attack cannot be performed. \n\nCryptosystems proven secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks include the Cramer-Shoup system and RSA-OAEP. \n\n", "id": "137359", "title": "Chosen-ciphertext attack"}

It began on July 19 as a weather system away from the Southeast U.S. Coast. It became a tropical storm later that day. Cristobal stayed away from land, and reached its highest strength as a strong tropical storm on July 21. It moved to the northeast next to the U.S. East Coast and died out on July 23 near Nova Scotia. Because it was a weak storm and never moved onto land, Cristobal's damages were mostly moderate rainfall. The storm dropped 3.43 in (87 mm) of rain in Wilmington, North Carolina, where minor flooding happened. Also, the remnants helped produce rainfall on Nova Scotia, which caused some flooding on roads and in basements.\n\nOn July 14, 2008 a weakening weather system stretched across northern Florida, causing thunderstorms. A weak low pressure area formed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved towards the southeast into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on July 16, it moved onto land near Tampa, and strengthening was not expected. However, late on July 17, thunderstorms became stronger around the low pressure area, and the system started to get better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said that a tropical depression was forming. At 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300 UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65 miles (105 km) to the southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.\nIt was located between an area of high pressure to its southeast and another one to the northwest, the depression moved slowly towards the northeast. It became a weak tropical storm during the early afternoon of July 19. In the beginning, the storm was not strong, with few strong thunderstorms. Dry air in the middle- to-upper-levels of the atmosphere caused the storm to not strengthen. However, late on July 20 thunderstorms became more active. Cristobal stayed as a weak tropical storm during the time that it moved close to the South Carolina and North Carolina coast, and the storm never moved onto land. It reached its highest intensity as a strong tropical storm on July 21 while it passed east of Cape Hatteras, and stayed the same over the warm Gulf Stream. The storm started to enter cooler waters, and the cyclone quickly moved towards the east-northeastward on July 21 and July 22. In the afternoon of July 22, Cristobal began to weaken while to the south of Nova Scotia. The storm's cloud pattern became weak, and on July 23, it became an extratropical cyclone, and was no longer a tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system at 5:00 am EDT (0900 UTC) on July 23.\n\nBefore the storm, the National Hurricane Center started a tropical storm warning from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to the Virginia–North Carolina border. Before Cristobal formed, it produced light rain in Florida. At Lake Wales, about 6 inches (150 mm) of rainfell, mostly in a two hour period. The rain clogged storm drains, which caused light flooding. The rain caused no serious problems, and helped get rid of dry conditions. The storm dropped in Wilmington, North Carolina. Minor flooding happened there. Because most of the storm stayed out to sea, winds along the coast were light. On the coast, storm surge reached above normal. Winds that were of tropical storm-strength were reported offshore. No severe damage was reported.\n\nCristobal helped produce heavy rain and flooding in Atlantic Canada. At Baccaro Point on the southern tip of Nova Scotia, 224 mm (8.8 in) of rain fell. There was flooding to basements and streets in Cape Sable.

Twofish's main features are the use of pre-computed key-dependent S-boxes, and a relatively complex key schedule. One half of an n-bit key is used as the actual encryption key and the other half of the n-bit key is used to modify the encryption algorithm (key-dependent S-boxes).

The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams. They had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims.

(With the only other exception: the Caliphate of Ali himself.)\n\nThe Fatimids were famous for religious tolerance towards non-Ismaili sects of Islam as well as towards Jews, Maltese Christians and Coptic Christians, but there were some exceptions nevertheless.\n\nThe Fatimids had their origins in Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia and eastern Algeria). The dynasty was founded in 909 by , who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter Fātima as-Zahra and her husband , the first Imām, hence the name \"al-Fātimiyyūn\" \"Fatimid\".\n\nAbdullāh al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from Mahdia, his newly-built capital in Tunisia.\n\nIn the 1040s, the Zirids (governors of North Africa under the Fatimids) declared their independence from the Fatimids and their conversion to Sunni Islam, which led to the devastating Banū Hilal invasions.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137536", "text": "Stream cipher\n\nIn cryptography, a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream (keystream) using an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the Plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state. An alternative name is a state cipher, as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state. In practice, the digits are typically single bits or bytes.\n\nStream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly; for example, in particular, the same starting state must never be used twice.\n\nA stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic key, for example 128 bits keys. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one-time pad encryption algorithm. However, because the keystream is pseudorandom, and not truly random, the security associated with the one-time pad cannot be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.\n\nA stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in two ways: \n\nIn a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo-random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or with the ciphertext (to decrypt). In the most common form, binary digits(bits) are used, and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation (XOR). This is termed a binary additive stream cipher.\n\nIn a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be in synchronous for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to mark the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.\n\nIf, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely that the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks — if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped(Toggled) in the plaintext.\n\nSelf-synchronizing stream ciphers is another technique that uses part of the previous \"N\" ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known also as asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey (CTAK). The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 1946, and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving \"N\" ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to \"N\" plaintext digits. It is somewhat more difficult to perform active attacks on self-synchronising stream ciphers rather than synchronous counterparts.\n\nAn example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher-feedback mode (CFB).\n\nBinary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be quickly analysed mathematically. However, the use of LFSRs only is insufficient to provide good security. Various schemes have been designed to increase the security of LFSRs. \n\nBecause LFSRs are inherently linear, one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of a group of parallel LFSRs into a non-linear Boolean function to form a \"combination generator\". Various properties of such a \"combining function\" are important for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme, for example, in order to avoid correlation attacks. \n\nNormally LFSRs are stepped regularly. One technique to introducting non-linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR. Such generators include the stop-and-go generator, the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator.\n\nThe stop-and-go generator (Beth and Piper, 1984) consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a \"1\", otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then (in some versions) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.\n\nThe shrinking generator uses a different technique. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly in the following way:\n\nThis technique suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator's state. This can be improved by buffering the output. \n\nAnother approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear \"filtering function\".\n\nInstead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions (T-Functions) with a single cycle on n bit words.\n\nTo be secure, the period of the keystream (the number of digits output before the stream repeats itself) needs to be large enough. If the sequence repeats, then the overlapping ciphertexts can be aligned against each other \"\"in depth\"\", and there are techniques which allow extraction of the plaintext form ciphertexts generated using these methods. \n\nStream ciphers are often used in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length as in secure wireless connections. If a block cipher were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the transmitted data need padding. Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by operating on the smallest transmitted unit (usually bytes).\n\nAnother advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated by an encryption device that is subject to strict security measures then fed to other devices, e.g. a radio set, which will perform the xor operation as part of their function. The other device can be designed for used in less securely environments.\n\nRC4 is the most widely used stream cipher in software; others include: \nA5/1,\nA5/2,\nChameleon, \nFISH, \nHelix,\nISAAC, \nMUGI,\nPanama,\nPhelix, \nPike,\nSEAL, \nSOBER,\nSOBER-128 and\nWAKE.\n\n\n\n", "id": "137536", "title": "Stream cipher"}

The lakes were found by the \"Cassini-Huygens\" space probe. The larger lakes are known as maria (seas) and the smaller ones as lacūs (lakes).\n\nIt was possible that there were seas of liquid methane on Titan and first suggested after reading Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 information that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere, capable of supporting lakes, but exact evidence was not found until 1995 when pictures from the Hubble telescope and other telescopes had already shown some proof of liquid methane possibly in lakes or planet-wide oceans, similar to oceans on Earth.\n\nThe \"Cassini\" mission proved there are liquid lakes on Titan, but not at first. When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in 2004, scientists hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans might be seen in reflected sunlight from the surface, but no reflections were found.\n\nScientists still believed that liquid ethane and methane would be found near Titan's poles, where they expected to find lots of liquid. At Titan's south pole, a large dark area named Ontario Lacus was the first lake identified, possibly created by rain as clouds are often seen in the area. A possible shoreline was also identified at the pole in radar images. As the Huygens-Cassini probe flew by on July 22, 2006, its radar took pictures of the northern part of the planet (which was in its winter), a number of large, smooth areas were found on the surface near the northern pole. Based on this data, scientists announced \"definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan\" in January 2007. The \"Cassini–Huygens\" team decided that the smooth areas are the hydrocarbon lakes they had been searching for, the first lakes found off Earth. Some valleys appear to have rivers.\n\nThe satellite was not able to show pictures of lakes moving in the wind. The heavy moisture and clouds of methane near Titan’s surface could be a sign of evaporation from lakes. The lakes cover 0.002–0.02% of the saturns surface.\nThe \"Cassini-Huygens\" probe flew by in February, 2007, taking radar and camera pictures of some large areas near the north pole that may be large areas of liquid methane and/or ethane, including one sea larger than 100,000 km² (larger than Lake Superior), and another area similar in size to the Caspian Sea. Pictures taken near Titan's southern pole in October 2007 showed similar, but far smaller, areas that look like lakes.\nThe Cassini-Huygens probe, flew very close to Titan in December 2007, and took infrared pictures of the chemicals on the surface and found a lake called Ontario Lacus near the south pole. Scientists studying the infrared pictures decided that one or more of the large lakes in the pictures of Saturn's moon Titan does hold liquid and that the liquid is made of hydrocarbons. They have also found ethane on Titan. This mission proves Titan to be the only other planet known to have liquid on its surface. The lakes make Titan a very important planet for studying weather science. Liquids, gases and temperatures are at play on Titan. This should help the science of weather forecasting.\n\nLakes were not found near near Titan's center of Titan which was studied on January 14 2005. A part of the Huygens-Cassini probe landed there. The pictures taken by the probe as it fell showed no open areas of liquid, but showed rivers that had dried. It was at first thought that dark areas near the center of Titan could be a lake of a liquid or tar-like substance, but the probe landed on the dark area, and it is solid without any liquid. A device known as a penetrometer studied the surface as the probe landed and seemed to find wet clay. Scientists believe that the penetrometer may have landed on a large pebble, and they say that the surface is similar to sand made of ice. Pictures taken after the probe landed show a large flat area covered in pebbles. The pebbles may be made of water ice and are partly rounded, which indicates fluids.\n\nOn February 13, 2008, scientists said that Titans polar lakes contain \"hundreds of times more natural gas and other hydrocarbons than all the known natural gas on Earth.\" The desert near the center of the planet are not liquid but do have more organics than Earth. In June 2008, \"Cassini\"'s Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in a lake in Titan's southern hemisphere.\n\nPredictions of Titan's clouds are that during in a Saturnian year, liquid moves from the equator to the poles, in clouds, and falls as rain.\n\nTitanian \"maria\" (large hydrocarbon seas) are named after sea monsters of Earth.\n\nAreas named \"Lacus\" are believed to be methane lakes.

He became famous for leading the New South Wales police in their hunt for the bushrangers Ben Hall, John Gilbert, Frank Gardiner and John Dunn.\n\nHe was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Pottinger of the British East India Company, and his wife Susanna Maria, née Cooke, of Dublin. Henry Pottinger was the first Governor of Hong Kong. Frederick went to Eton from 1844 to 1847. Between 1850 and 1854, Pottinger was an officer in the Grenadier Guards in England. He lost a lot of his mother's money gambling on horse races. In 1856 he took the place of his father as second baronet. He soon gambled away all his money. He owed people a lot of money.\n\nHe went to Australia to search for gold. He joined the New South Wales police force as a mounted trooper. He was an excellent horse rider and spent the next few years working on the gold escort between Gundagai and Goulburn.\n\nPottinger kept his title secret but in 1860 the inspector-general of police, John McLerie, found out. He was quickly given better jobs. In November he became clerk of petty sessions at Dubbo and on October 1, 1861, assistant superintendent of the Southern Mounted Police Patrol. He wanted to do a good job in the police, but he got into a drunken brawl at Young on 20–21 December 1861. He was a publicly warned about his bad behaviour. He was sent to the Lachlan River area. He showed he was a busy but unlucky hunter of bushrangers.\n\nIn 1862 Pottinger was made an inspector of police for the Western District of New South Wales. In April 1862 he arrested Ben Hall at Forbes on a charge of robbery. Hall he was released because there was not enough evidence to prove he was a robber. Soon afterward Hall joined Frank Gardiner's gang. On June 15, 1862, they robbed the Lachlan gold escort of some £14,000 at Eugowra. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery. Pottinger was able to capture two of the bushrangers quickly. They escaped several days later in a gun battle. Pottinger got back some of the stolen gold.\n\nPeople thought Pottinger made a lot of mistakes. He was in trouble for not having enough police guards on the gold escort and letting his prisoners escape. On the night of August 9, Pottinger and a group of police surrounded the house of Gardiner's mistress, Kate Brown. The bushranger escaped when Pottinger's pistol fired accidentally. They arrested a young boy who they thought was a friend of the bushrangers. When he died from a fever in gaol in March 1863, this was seen to be caused by Pottinger's cruelty. In February 1862 Pottinger was in court at Yass for assault. During a game of billiards he had been called a cheat, a liar and a scoundrel. He hit the person with the billiard cue and smashed his head through a window. On September 27, 1862, Pottinger had appeared before a Bathurst court on a charge of assault. In February 1863 Pottinger went to Sydney for the trial of the escort robbers. He was pushed in the street by people in the crowd. He also threatened a Member of Parliament, J. J. Harpur, with his whip. He didn't like things that Harpur had said about him.\n\nThe bushrangers in his area became more active. He captured Patrick Daley. On August 17, 1864, he nearly caught James Alpin McPherson.\n\nIn May 1863 the inspector-general told police to think of new ways to catch the bushrangers. Early in January 1865 Pottinger rode a horse in the Wowingragong races. This was against the rules of the police force. He was sacked (lost his job) on February 16, 1865. Pottinger said that he was just trying to get Ben Hall and John Dunn to come out of hiding. His plan worked and the bushrangers went to the races, only Pottinger didn't see them. Protest meetings against his sacking were held on the gold diggings and in the towns. People signed petitions for him to get his job back. He was regarded as a brave and tireless policeman. Pottinger went to Sydney to try and get back his job. On March 5, 1865, at Wascoe's Inn in the Blue Mountains Pottinger accidentally shot himself in the stomach while trying to get onto a moving coach. He was moved to the Victoria Club in Sydney where he died on April 9, 1865. His brother Henry became the 3rd Baronet. He was buried at St Jude's Anglican Church, Randwick.\n\n", "id": "137590", "title": "Frederick Pottinger"}

It means the same thing as selective breeding and is an ancient method of genetic engineering. \n\nSelective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigeons or cattle. Some of these animals may have traits that a breeder will want to carry over to the next generation. The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed which have that quality, rather than those that do not.\n\nInbreeding is a particular kind of selective breeding, designed to produce a population which is genetically virtually identical. Such populations are rarely viable outside the laboratory. They lose fertility. To control this, most breeds are outcrossed or backcrossed to wild-type individuals, or at least less inbred stock. This is done every so many generations: the details differ from breed to breed. The improvement when outcrossing is done is called hybrid vigour.\n\nCharles Darwin used the example of artificial selection to introduce his idea of natural selection. Artificial selection may be contrasted with the process of natural selection. In natural selection, the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits happens. This is because some variations help the organism to have better survival and reproduction. The process maintains or enhances the fitness of a population in its natural habitat. \n\nArtificial selection may sometimes be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional.\n", "id": "137607", "title": "Artificial selection"}

It is a technique in gene targeting and gene knockout.\n\nSelectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137614", "text": "Genetic algorithm\n\nA genetic algorithm is an algorithm that imitates the process of natural selection. Natural selection is a central concept of evolution: some organisms have traits that will make it more likely that the organism survives long enough to reproduce. That way, it is likely that these traits will be passed on to the next generation. This has also been called survival of the fittest.\n\nGenetic algorithms are often used to find solutions for optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms are part of the broader class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms imitate the same mechanisms as those found in nature, that is to say inheritance, mutation, selection and crossover. \n\nThe concept of genetic algorithms is a search technique often used in computer science to find complex, non-obvious solutions to algorithmic optimisation and search problems. Genetic algorithms are categorised as global search heuristics, and can be used in many ways, particularly in generating useful Artificial Intelligence agents in computer games.\n\nFor decades, games and the field of game theory have provided competitive, dynamic, often unpredictable environments that make ideal test beds for computational intelligence theories, architectures, and algorithms. Natural evolution can be modelled as a game, in which the rewards for an organism that plays a good game of life are the propagation of its genetic material to its successors and its continued survival. In natural evolution, how well an individual performs depends on its competitors and collaborators, as well as the environment. More simply described, genetic algorithms are a simulation in which a population of abstract representations (called chromosomes or the genotype of the genome, after their biological counterparts) of candidate solutions (called individuals, creatures, or phenotypes) to an optimisation problem.\n\nCandidates are evaluated and crossbred in an attempt to generate high quality solutions which are extremely time consuming and may not be obvious to a human programmer. An evolutionary phase is initialised with a population of randomly generated entities (or human specified instances of high quality). The process is subdivided into different generations. In each generation, the fitness of every individual in the population is evaluated, and multiple individuals are stochastically selected from the current population (based on their fitness), and modified (recombined and possibly randomly mutated) to form a new population. The new population is then used in the next iteration of the algorithm. The algorithm terminates when either a maximum number of generations has been produced, or a satisfactory fitness level has been reached for the population. If the algorithm has terminated due to a maximum number of generations, a satisfactory will not necessarily have been obtained.\n\nFinding a solution is a process that is repeated. Very often, a number of steps are run in a loop, until some stop condition is met:\n\nGenetic algorithms have been successfully used in many fields of computer science, such as the optimisation of complex algorithms, the training of text classification systems, and the evolution of intelligent artificial agents in stochastic environments.\n\nBoard games are a very relevant part of the area of genetic algorithms as applied to game theory problems. Much of the early work on computational intelligence and games was directed toward classic board games, such as tic-tac-toe, chess, and checkers. Board games can now, in most cases, be played by a computer at a higher level than the best humans, even with blind exhaustive\nsearch techniques. Go is a noted exception to this tendency, and has so far resisted machine attack. The best Go computer players now play at the level of a good novice. Go strategy is said to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and not just logical analysis as with chess and other more piece-independent games. The huge effective branching factor required for finding high quality solutions heavily restricts the look-ahead that can be used within a move sequence search.\n\nThe genetic algorithm can be used in computer games. This allows for a more realistic game experience; if a human player can find a sequence of steps which, repeated in different games always lead to success, there can be no challenge left. Conversely if a learning technique such as a genetic algorithm for a strategist can avoid repeating past mistakes, the game will have increased playability.\n\nGenetic algorithms require the following components:\n\n\nThe fitness function accepts a mutated instantiation of an entity and measures its quality. This function is customised to the problem domain. In many cases, particularly those involving code optimisation, the fitness function may simply be a system timing function. Once a genetic representation and fitness function are defined, a genetic algorithm will instantiate initial candidates as described previously, and then improve through repetitive application of mutation, crossover, inversion and selection operators (as defined according to the problem domain).\n\n", "id": "137614", "title": "Genetic algorithm"}

While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range, the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function—quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function.\n\nIt was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977. When trying to improve the security of a block cipher, one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme. Certainly, an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take formula_1 attempts if each key is n bits long, compared to the formula_2 attempts required for a single key. However, Diffie and Hellman, discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme. The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end, thus meeting in the middle.\n\nAssume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext: \"P\" and \"C\". That is,\nwhere E is the encryption function (cipher), and \"K\" and \"K\" are the two keys.\n\nThe attacker can then compute \"E\"(\"P\") for all possible keys \"K\" and store the results in memory. Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing \"D\"(\"C\") for each \"K\". Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys. (To speed up the comparison, the \"E\"(\"P\") set is stored in an in-memory lookup table, then each \"D\"(\"C\") can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys.)\n\nOnce the matches are discovered, they can be verified with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext. If the keysize is \"n\", this attack uses only formula_4 encryptions (and formula_5 space) in contrast to the naive attack, which needs formula_1 encryptions (but only formula_7 space).\n\n", "id": "137720", "title": "Meet-in-the-middle attack"}

A large set of block ciphers use the scheme, including the Data Encryption Standard (DES). \n\nThe Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved.\n\nFeistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier.\n\nFeistel networks and similar constructions are product ciphers, and so combine multiple rounds of repeated operations, such as:\nto produce a function with large amounts of what Claude Shannon described as \"confusion and diffusion\". \n\nBit shuffling creates the diffusion effect, while substitution is used for confusion.\n\nMany modern symmetric block ciphers use Feistel networks, and the structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers. Specifically, Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel block cipher construction, and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function, with K used as the seed, then 3 rounds is sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation, while 4 rounds is sufficient to make it a \"strong\" pseudorandom permutation (which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation). Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff, Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby-Rackoff block ciphers. Further theoretical studies generalized the construction, and defined more precise limits for security.\n\nLet formula_1 be the round function and let\nformula_2 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_3 respectively.\n\nThen the basic operation is as follows:\n\nSplit the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_4, formula_5)\n\nFor each round formula_6, compute (calculate)\n\nThen the ciphertext is formula_9. (Commonly the two pieces formula_10 and formula_11 are not switched after the last round.)\n\nDecryption of a ciphertext formula_12 is accomplished by computing for formula_13\n\nThen formula_16 is the plaintext again.\n\nOne advantage of this model is that the round function formula_1 does not have to be \"invertible\", and can be very complex.\n\nThe diagram illustrates the encryption process. Decryption requires only reversing the order of the subkey formula_18 using the same process; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption:\n\nUnbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where formula_4 and formula_5 are not of equal lengths. The MacGuffin cipher is an experimental example of such a cipher.\nThe Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers. For example, the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric-key encryption schemes.\n\nFeistel or modified Feistel:\nBlowfish,\nCamellia,\nCAST-128,\nDES,\nFEAL,\nICE,\nKASUMI,\nLOKI97, \nLucifer,\nMARS,\nMAGENTA,\nMISTY1,\nRC5,\nTEA,\nTriple DES,\nTwofish,\nXTEA,\nGOST 28147-89\n\nGeneralised Feistel:\nCAST-256,\nMacGuffin,\nRC2,\nRC6,\nSkipjack\n", "id": "137725", "title": "Feistel cipher"}

After the galls are formed, the larvae develop inside until fully grown, when they leave. In order to form galls, the insects must seize the time when plant cell division occurs quickly.

The Jeep became the primary light 4-wheel-drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II. It remained so in the postwar period. The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war. Doug Stewart notes:\nThe first civilian models were produced in 1945. It inspired a number of other light utility vehicles, such as the Land Rover. Many Jeep variants serving similar military and civilian roles have since been designed in other nations.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137908", "text": "Mandaeism\n\nMandaeism or Mandaeanism (Mandaic: Mandaiuta, \"Mandā'iyya\") is a monotheistic religion. The religion has a strong dualistic world view. Its followers, the Mandaeans, think highly of Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist.\n\nOriginally, Mandaeism was practiced mainly in the countries around the lower Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. Today, this area belongs to Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. Because they were persecuted in that area, many Mandaeans have left that area and now live abroad. This is commonly called diaspora. Most left for Europe, Australia and North America.\n\nThere are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide, and until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq. The 2003 Iraq War reduced the population of Iraqi Mandaeans to approximately 5,000 by 2007. Most Iraqi Mandaeans fled to Syria and Jordan under the threat of violence by Islamic extremists and the turmoil of the war.\n\nThe Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private—what has been reported of them and their religion has come primarily from outsiders, particularly from the Orientalists J. Heinrich Petermann, Nicholas Siouffi, and Lady Ethel Drower.\n\nMandeism is the religion of the Mandaean people. It is based on a common history and heritage. There is no fixed set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature is quite large. It also covers topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God, and the afterlife. It only does this in an unsystematic manner. Apart from the priests, very few people know it. \n\nAccording to E.S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:\n\nMandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They put a high priority on family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and red meat. They look forward to a future liberated from the influence of the Torah, which they consider to be evil in origin. While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.\n\nThe Mandaeans have many religious texts. The most important of them is the \"Genzā Rabbā\" or Ginza. The Ginza is a collection of history, theology, and prayers. The \"Genzā Rabbā\" is divided into two halves — the \"Genzā Smālā\" or \"Left Ginza\" and the \"Genzā Yeminā\" or \"Right Ginza\". \n\nBefore the printing press was invented, people copied texts by hand. The people doing this were called scribes. Each person's handwriting is special in certain ways. This was the same with scribes. A scribe might join two letters in a certain way, or he might do the dots on those letters that have them in a special way. Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza. That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. These special marks show that the Mandaeans existed during the late Arsacid period at the very latest. A legend called \"Harrān Gāwetā\" also strengthens this. According to this legend, the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire. Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.\n\nOther important books include the \"Qolastā\", the \"Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans,\" which was translated by E.S. Drower. One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the \"Draša d-Iahia\" \"the Book of John the Baptist\". This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates. There are also many other religious texts such as ritual commentaries, which are generally only consulted by the members of the priesthood.\n\nThe language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. The majority of Mandaean lay people do not speak this language. Some members of the Mandaean community in Iran ( about 300-500 out of a total of ca. 5000 Iranian Mandaeans) continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.\n\nMandaeans have several prophets. Iahia or Iuhana \"John the Baptist\" has a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion. They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers. They trace their beliefs back to Adam.\n\nMandaeans maintain that Jesus was a \"mšiha kdaba\" \"false messiah\" who changed the teachings given to him by John. The Mandaic word \"k(a)daba\", however, comes from two roots: the first root, meaning \"to lie,\" is the one traditionally given to Jesus; the second, meaning \"to write,\" might provide a second meaning, that of \"book\". Some Mandaeans, who are motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a \"lying Messiah\" but a \"book Messiah\". The \"book\" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.\n\nLikewise, the Mandaeans believe that Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad were false prophets, but recognize other prophetic figures from the monotheistic traditions, such as Adam, his sons Hibil (Abel) and Šitil (Seth), and his grandson Anuš (Enosh), as well as Nuh (Noah), his son Sam (Shem) and his son Ram (Aram). The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.\n\nThere is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower (\"The Secret Adam\", p. ix):\n\nThere are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the \"tarmidia\" \"disciples\" (Neo-Mandaic \"tarmidānā\"), the \"ganzibria\" \"treasurers\" (from Old Persian \"ganza-bara\" \"id.\", Neo-Mandaic ') and the \"rišamma\" \"leader of the people.\" This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the ', a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis (ca. 3rd c. BCE) and which may be related to the \"kamnaskires\" (Elamite <qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra> \"kapnuskir\" \"treasurer\"), title of the rulers of Elymais (modern Khuzestan) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any ' who baptizes seven or more ' may qualify for the office of \"rišamma\", though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.\n\nThe contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19 century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (\"šgandia\"), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.\n\nAccording to the \"Fihrist\" of ibn al-Nadim, Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was brought up within the Elkasaites (\"Elcesaites\" or \"Elchasaite\") sect. The Elkasaites were a Christian baptismal sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans. The members of this sect wore white and performed baptisms like the Mandaeans. They lived in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia. According to the \"Harran Gawaitā\" legend, the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there. Mani later left the Elkasaites to start his own religion. Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg showed that Mani's \"Psalms of Thomas\" were closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature.\n\nOther groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the \"Nasoraeans\", described by Epiphanius, and the Dositheans, mentioned by Theodore Bar Kōnī in his \"Scholion\". Ibn al-Nadim also mentions a group called the \"Mughtasila\", \"the self-ablutionists,\" who may be identified with one or the other of these groups. The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms.\n\nIt is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites, the Mughtasila, the Nasoraeans, and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another.\nThe names say that there are a number of different groups. Much of the teaching of these groups is secret. This makes it difficult to see the nature of these groups or the relationships between them.\n\nUnder Saddam Hussein, the Mandeans were recognised as a religious minority. Many of them are craftspeople, like smiths or traders of gold and silver. These people belonged to the middle classes. Since the change of government in Iraq, islamic extremists have harassed them. There are also reports of attacks on women who refuse to veil themselves. Most Iraqi Mandaeans have fled as a result, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction.\n\nIn Iran, Mandeans do not have a problem with violence, but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of \"Gozinesh\" Law. This law and other \"gozinesh\" provisions require a \"religious screening\" for people who want to access employment, education, and a range of other areas. A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam. These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans.\n\nThere were over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s. In 2007, only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there; over 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan. This is a result of the Iraq War. There are small Mandaean populations in Australia (c. 3,500 as of 2006), Canada, the USA (c. 1,500), the UK (c. 1,000) and Sweden (c. 5,000).\n\nThe current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, the New York Times ran an op-ed in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community:\n\n", "id": "137908", "title": "Mandaeism"}
{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137912", "text": "Substitution box\n\nIn cryptography, a S-Box (\"Substitution-box\") is a basic component of symmetric-key algorithms. In block ciphers, the S-Boxes are used to make the relation between the plaintext and the ciphertext (coded text) difficult to understand–Shannon's property of confusion. The S-Boxes are carefully chosen to resist cryptanalysis (decoding).\n\nIn general, an S-Box takes some number of input bits, \"m\", and transforms them into some number of output bits, \"n\": an \"m\"×\"n\" S-Box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2 words of \"n\" bits each. Fixed tables are normally used, as in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key; e.g. the Blowfish and the Twofish encryption algorithms. Bruce Schneier describes IDEA's modular multiplication step as a key-dependent S-Box.\n\nOne good example is this 6×4-bit S-Box from DES (S):\n\nGiven a 6-bit input, the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits, and the column using the inner four bits. For example, an input \"011011\" has outer bits \"01\" and inner bits \"1101\"; the corresponding output would be \"1001\".\n\nThe 8 S-Boxes of DES were the subject of intensive studies for many years cause of a concern that a method of bypassing the DES cipher to obtaining access to the plaintext–a \"vulnerability\" (\"susceptibility\") known only to its designers–might have been \"planted\" (inserted) in the cipher. In 1994, the S-Box design criteria were finally published by its designers after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis, showing that they had been carefully tuned the design to increase resistance against differential cryptanalysis attacks. Other research had already indicated that even a very small modification to one of the 8 S-Box used by the DES could weaken it very much.\n\nThe design of good S-Boxes was the subject of a great amount of research; now much more is understood about their use in block ciphers than when the DES S-Boxes were released.\n\n\n\n", "id": "137912", "title": "Substitution box"}

It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard. IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard (PES), but with some improvements. Because of this, IDEA was first called IPES (Improved PES).\n\nThe cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non-commercial use. The name \"IDEA\" is also a trademark. The patents will expire in 2010–2011. Today, IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt.\n\nIDEA was used in Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) v2.0 after the cipher used in v1.0, BassOmatic, was found to be breakable. IDEA can be used with the OpenPGP standard.\n\nIDEA operates on 64-bit blocks, using a 128-bit key. It contains a series of eight identical transformations (\"rounds\") and one output transformation (the \"half-round\"). It does this for a total of 8.5 rounds. The processes for encryption and decryption are similar.\n\nIDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups — modular addition and multiplication, and bitwise eXclusive OR (XOR) — which are chosen to be \"algebraically incompatible\".\n\nEach of the eight round uses six sub-keys, while the half-round uses four; for a total of 52 sub-keys. Each sub-key is a 16-bit in length. The first eight sub-keys are extracted directly from the 128-bit key, with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group; six rotations generate all sub-keys.\n\nThe designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions. No successful linear or differential attacks have been reported. Some classes of weak keys have been found — E.g. (Daemen \"et al.\", 1994) — but these are of little importance, being so rare to be explicitly avoided. As of 2007, the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds (the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds).\n\nIn 1996, Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA, \"In my opinion, it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time.\" (\"Applied Cryptography\", 2nd ed.) However, by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster cryptographic algorithms, some progress in its cryptanalysis, and the issue of patents. \n\n\n", "id": "137965", "title": "International Data Encryption Algorithm"}

Chrysler declared Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on August 30, 2009. In 1979, Chrysler had similar problems. They got 1.5 billion dollars from the U.S. government. Lee Iacocca became CEO. Then, Chrysler created the K-car platform, invented the minivan, and sold many trucks to the army. Chrysler acquired American Motors in 1988, and rebranded the auto company as Eagle. They slowly recovered. Chrysler is currently owned by Italian automotive Fiat, the two companies merged forming Fiat Chrysler Automobiles or F.C.A for short. The company still trades as Chrysler in the United States.\n\nAt its peak, Chrysler owned Dodge, Jeep, Plymouth, DeSoto, Valiant, Imperial, and Eagle (AMC). Only Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep survived.

At the age of three he was an orphan, so he was brought up by his grandfather in Cambridge. At the age of seven he became a chorister at King's College Chapel Choir. In 1826 he entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he spent ten years studying. His piano teachers were W. H. Holmes, Dr William Crotch and later Cipriani Potter \n\nIn 1833 he was made organist of St Anne's Church, Wandsworth and in that same year met Felix Mendelssohn who invited him to Germany. He went there four times, making long tours. He was welcomed and admired by famous musicians including Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann. Schumann later dedicated his \"Symphonic Studies\" to Bennett. He also often performed at the Leipzig Gewandhaus.\n\nAlthough he knew the works of Bach and Mozart very well, many of his compositions were clearly influenced by Mendelssohn. As well as being known as one of Europe's most brilliant pianists, his music was well known for its new ideas, excitement and poetic beauty. His compositions include four overtures, six piano concertos, four symphonies, a chamber trio, sextet, several piano works and two song cycles to be followed later in life by a cello duo, a late Symphony in G minor, a Cantata The May Queen for the opening of Leeds Town Hall in 1858, and an oratorio The Woman of Samaria for the 1867 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival.\nOf his 80 published compositions, nearly half are now available on CD, the most popular being the Overture \"The Naiades Op 15\", the \"Chamber Trio Op 26\" and the \"Piano concerto No 4 in F minor Op 19\".\n\nFrom 1844 for fifteen years he organized the popular Chamber Music Concerts in the Queen's Concert Rooms, Hanover Square in London introducing a number of famous soloists to the British public. In 1848 he became a founding Director of Queen's College London and in the following year of Bedford College, now part of London University. In this way he helped women to get equal opportunity in education. \n\nIn 1849 he formed the Bach Society (later to be reformed as the Bach Choir) in London to produce and conduct the first English performance of Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\" on 6 April 1854.\n\nIn 1856 he succeeded Wagner as conductor of the Philharmonic Society Orchestra. He was the first person to be given their Gold Medal. In 1866 he was chosen to be Professor of Music at Cambridge University having got an MA and Mus Doc. From 1866 until his death he was Principal of the Royal Academy of Music. A scholarship and Prize in his name continues to be awarded to this day. In 1870 Oxford University gave him an Hon DCL and a year later he was knighted. \n\nHe died on 1st February 1875 and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nSeveral of his family later became well known in music and theatre. Bennett left a large music library which is now at the Bodleian Library in collaboration with his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale-Bennett (b 1939) which continues to be available for research purposes.\n\nSee: The Life of Sterndale Bennett by JR Sterndale Bennett (Cambridge University Press 1907) and William Sterndale Bennett- a Descriptive Thematic Catalogue by Rosemary Williamson (Clarendon Press 1996) \n", "id": "138076", "title": "William Sterndale Bennett"}

Most computers have a large amount of space, but not infinite space. Also, most people are willing to wait a little while for a big calculation, but not forever. So if your problem is taking a long time but not much memory, a space-time tradeoff would let you use more memory and solve the problem more quickly. Or, if it could be solved very quickly but requires more memory than you have, you can try to spend more time solving the problem in the limited memory.\n\nThe most common condition is an algorithm using a lookup table. This means that the answers for some question for every possible value can be written down. One way of solving this problem is to write down the entire lookup table, which will let you find answers very quickly, but will use a lot of space. Another way is to calculate the answers without writing down anything, which uses very little space, but might take a long time.\n\nA space-time tradeoff can be used with the problem of data storage. If data is stored uncompressed, it takes more space but less time than if the data were stored compressed (since compressing the data decreases the amount of space it takes, but it takes time to run the compression algorithm). \n\nLarger code size can be used to increase program speed when using loop unwinding. This technique makes the program code longer for each iteration of a loop, but saves the computation time needed for jumping back to the beginning of the loop at the end of each iteration. \n\nIn the field of cryptography, using space-time tradeoff, the attacker is decreasing the exponential time required for a brute force attack. Rainbow tables use partially precomputed values in the hash space of a cryptographic hash function to crack passwords in minutes instead of weeks. Decreasing the size of the rainbow table increases the time required to iterate over the hash space. The meet-in-the-middle attack attack uses a space-time tradeoff to find the cryptographic key in only formula_1 encryptions (and formula_2 space) compared to the expected formula_3 encryptions (but only formula_4 space) of the normal attack. \n\nDynamic programming is another example where the time of solving problems can be decreased by using more memory.\n\n", "id": "138079", "title": "Space-time tradeoff"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138093", "text": "Carnivorous plant\n\nCarnivorous plants are plants which get nutrients from trapping and eating animals. They are often called insectivorous plants, because they usually trap insects. Since they get some of their food from animals, carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin, or poor in nutrients. This is true for soils with little nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcrops. Charles Darwin wrote the first well-known book on carnivorous plants in 1875.\n\nThis ability of plants to catch animals is true carnivory. There are more than twelve genera in five families. These include about 625 species that attract and trap prey, produce digestive enzymes, and use their nutrients. In addition, there are more than 300 species in several genera that show some but not all of these characteristics. These are usually called \"protocarnivorous plants\".\n\nInsectivorous plants have leaves that are made like pitchers or bladders which catch insects. Today, five different ways of trapping are known\n\nThese traps are all classified as \"active\" or \"passive\". \"Triphyophyllum\" is a liana (a climber in tropical forests). It has three types of leaves. When needed, it puts out long leaves. These are passive 'flypapers' which hide mucus. The leaves of the plant do not grow or move as a response to moving prey. The Sundew \"Drosera\", on the other hand, is an active flypaper. All species of Sundew are able to move their sticky tentacles in response to a contact. The tentacles are very sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf in order to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible. According to Darwin, the touch of legs of a small gnat with a single tentacle is enough to cause this response. This helps the catch and digestion of prey.\n\nThe Venus flytrap, \"Dionaea muscipula\", is one of a very small group of plants able to move fast. When an insect or spider crawls along the leaves and touches a hair, the trap closes \"only if a different hair is contacted within twenty seconds of the first touch\". The two-touch trigger avoids wasting energy on objects with no food value.\n\nA carnivorous plant must attract, kill and digest prey. It must then also benefit from digesting the prey. In most cases, this will yield amino acids and ammonium ions. There are some cases, where plants catch the prey, but they do not digest it. Rather, they have a symbiosis with another organism, which feeds on the prey. One such case is the species of the sundew \"Roridula\", which forms a symbiosis with the assassin bug. The bugs eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' faeces.\n\nFew fossil carnivorous plants have been found, and then usually as seed or pollen. Carnivorous plants are generally herbs, without wood or bark. True carnivoury has probably evolved independently at least six times. \n\nSome think all trap types have a similar basic structure—the hairy leaf. Hairy leaves do catch and hold drops of rainwater, which helps bacterial growth. Insects land on the leaf, are caught by the surface tension of the water, and suffocate. Bacteria start to decay the insect, and release nutrients from the corpse. The plant then absorbs the nutrients through its leaves. This 'leaf feeding' can be found in many non-carnivorous plants. Plants that were better at holding water and insects therefore had a selective advantage. Rainwater can be retained by cupping the leaf, leading to pitfall traps. Alternatively, insects can be caught by making the leaf stickier, leading to flypaper traps.\n", "id": "138093", "title": "Carnivorous plant"}

This may be sufficient to partially or completely break (crack) the algorithm. \n\nOne of the primary design objectives in constructing a \"quality\" cipher or cryptographic hash function is to build a good avalanche effect in it. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks. \n\nThe Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) is a property of boolean functions of importance to cryptography. A function is said to satisfy the strict avalanche criterion if, whenever a single input bit is complemented, each of the output bits should change with a probability of one half. \n\nThe SAC was built on the concepts of evolution completeness and avalanche and introduced by Webster and Tavares in 1985.\n\nThe Bit independence criterion (BIC) states that output bits \"j\" & \"k\" should change independently when any single input bit \"i\" is inverted, for all \"i\", \"j\" and \"k\". \n\n\n", "id": "138172", "title": "Avalanche effect"}

Today, oil is rarely stored or transported in actual barrels, but the term \"barrel\" is still used to mean a 42-gallon measurement.\n\nA barrel can also be used to measure dry goods.

He often draws in high visibility public places such as on buildings or train stations. His paintings are often about politics, war and other important topics.\n\nHis satirical street art and mind-hurting pictures combine dark humour with graffiti. The graffiti is done with a stencilling technique. Such works have been done on streets, walls, and bridges of cities throughout the world.\n\nBanksy's work started in the Bristol underground scene, which had collaborations between artists and musicians. According to graphic designer Tristan Manco and the book \"Home Sweet Home\", Banksy \"was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol, England. The son of a photocopier technician, he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s\". His style is similar to Blek le Rat, who began to work with stencils in 1981 in Paris, and to members of the anarcho-punk band Crass, which did a graffiti stencil campaign on the London Underground system in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nBanksy displays his art on public surfaces such as walls and even going as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell photos of street graffiti directly himself. However, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder. Banksy's first movie, \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\", billed as \"the world's first street art disaster movie,\" made its debut at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. The movie was released in the UK on 5 March 2010. In January 2011, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary for the movie.\n\nThere have been numerous rumours as to Banksy's identity. Names often suggested include Robert Banks and Robin Gunningham.\n\nIn 2004 an alleged photograph of him in Jamaica surfaced. In October 2007 the BBC website featured a photo allegedly taken by a passer-by in Bethnal Green, London, purporting to show Banksy at work with an assistant, scaffolding and a truck. From the pictures, Banksy's identity was thought to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol on 28 July 1973. Gunningham was educated at Bristol Cathedral Choir School and Leicester Polytechnic, now De Montfort University, and according to a former friend, was \"extremely talented at art\".\n\nGunningham lived with artist Luke Egan. Around 2000, when Banksy moved from Bristol to London, Gunningham is known to have moved from Bristol to a London flat in Hackney, and a number of Banksy's most famous works appeared nearby. At that time, Gunningham lived with Jamie Eastman, who worked for a record label that used illustrations by Banksy.\n\nIn May 2009, the \"Mail on Sunday\" once again speculated about Gunningham being Banksy. This \"new Banksy rat\" story was also picked up by \"The Times\", and the \"Evening Standard\".\n\nIn response to reports that Banksy was Robin Gunningham, Banksy's agent refused to either confirm or deny the reports.\n\nSimon Hattenstone from \"The Guardian\" is one of the very few people to have interviewed him face to face. Hattenstone describes him as \"a cross of Jimmy Nail and British rapper Mike Skinner\" and \"a 28-year old male who showed up wearing jeans and a t-shirt with a silver tooth, silver chain, and one silver earring.\" In the same interview, Banksy claimed that his parents think he is a painter and decorator.\n\nBanksy himself states on his website: \n", "id": "138215", "title": "Banksy"}

It is used either raw, roasted or sautéed with butter. Mirepoix is known as the holy trinity of French cooking.\n\nThese three ingredients are commonly referred to as aromatics. Similar such combinations, both in and out of the French culinary repertoire, sometimes include leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots, mushrooms, bell peppers, chilies, and ginger. For the combination \"mirepoix au gras\", or a \"Matignon\", ham or pork belly are used as additional ingredients. In Cajun cuisine, a mirepoix or trinity is a combination of onions, celery and bell peppers.\n\nThey may be used in different combinations, as dictated by the cuisine and the dish itself.\n\nTraditionally, the ratio for mirepoix is 2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots. The ratio for bones to mirepoix for stock is 10:1. When making a white stock, or \"fond blanc\", parsnips are used instead of carrots to maintain the pale color.\n\nMirepoix derives its name, as many other elements of French cuisine do, from the patron of the chef who established it, in this case one of the house of Lévis, seigneurs of Mirepoix since the eleventh century and a famous name in Languedoc.

The first was to attack the supply lines of the other side. The second was to keep open its own supply lines, the Axis to their own armies in North Africa and the Allies to supply the island of Malta. The third was to destroy the ability of the opposing navy to wage war at sea. \n\nOutside of the Pacific ocean, the Mediterranean saw the largest conventional naval warfare during the war. In particular, Allied forces struggled to supply and retain the key naval and air base of Malta.\n\nItalian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour. All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war, although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships had good \"rangefinder\" and \"fire-control\" systems. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act, Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters (\"Supermarina\"). This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage (e.g., During \"Operation Hats\"). Italian Naval Headquarters was conscious that the British could replace ships lost in the Mediterranean, whereas Italian Navy resources were limited and there was a terrible lack of fuel. \n\nThe Italian Navy entered the war with only one year of fuel required to operate normally (in 1943 practically there was no fuel to do naval operations far away from the coasts of Italy).\n\nThe Allies had \"Ultra\" intercepts, which predicted the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the \"Fleet Air Arm\" and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats (like in the \"Battle of Cape Matapan\").\n\nThe Axis forces in this campaign were:-\n\nThe Allied forces in this campaign were:-\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. On the following day, Italian bombers attacked Malta on what was to be the first of many raids.\nThe first clash between the rival fleets, the Battle of Calabria, took place on 9 July 1940, just four weeks after the start of hostilities. This was inconclusive (neither side won), and was followed by a series of small ship actions ( the battle of the \"Espero\" convoy, battle of Cape Spada) during the autumn.\n\nIn spring 1940 the British Royal navy attacked at Mers el Kebir (Algeria) the French navy of Vichy, sinking 2 battleship with other minor ships.\nIn November, the RN mounted an aerial attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto harbour, crippling 3 capital ships and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\nThree months later the fleets clashed again at the Battle of Cape Matapan. This was a major Allied victory; 3 Italian cruisers were sunk, and a battleship damaged in a 2-day battle ending in a night action.\n\nFollowing this the Allies suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete, supporting the army when the island was invaded by the Germans.\n\nIn spring 1941 the Greek and Yugoslavian navy were destroyed and/or made captive by the Italians (with help from the German air force) during the Italo-German war in the western Balkans against Greece and Yugoslavia.\n\nFollowing the battle of Crete in the summer of 1941, the Royal Navy got the better of things in the central Mediterranean in a series of successful convoy attacks, (such as the \"Duisburg\" convoy and the Battle of Cape Bon) until the events around the First Battle of Sirte and the Raid on Alexandria in December swung the balance of power in the Axis favour.\n\nThe Italian Navy's most successful attack was when divers planted mines on British battleships during the raid on Alexandria harbour (19 December 1941). HMS \"Queen Elizabeth\" and HMS\"Valiant\" were sunk (but ten months later raised and returned to active service). During those ten months the Italian Navy enjoyed a temporary control of the Mediterranean sea (called by Mussolini's propaganda the \"Mare Nostrum\", meaning \"our sea\").\n\nA series of hard fought convoy battles (Second Battle of Sirte in March, Operations Harpoon and Vigorous in June, and Operation Pedestal in August) were victories for the Axis but ensured Malta's survival, until the Allies regained the advantage in November 1942.\n\nIn Sept 1943 with the Italian collapse and the surrender of Italian fleet, naval actions in Mediterranean became restricted to actions against U-boats and by small craft in the Adriatic and Aegean seas.\n\n\nThe following are the major amphibious operations staged during the Battle of the Mediterranean:\n\n\n", "id": "138323", "title": "Battle of the Mediterranean"}

Practical applications include message integrity checks, digital signatures, authentication, and various information security applications. \n\nA hash function takes a string of any length as input and produces a fixed length string which acts as a kind of \"signature\" for the data provided. In this way, a person knowing the \"hash value\" is unable to know the original message, but only the person who knows the original message can prove the \"hash value\" is created from that message.\n\nA cryptographic hash function should behave as much as possible like a random function while still being deterministic and efficiently computable. A cryptographic hash function is considered \"insecure\" from a cryptographic point of view, if either of the following is computationally feasible:\n\nAn attacker who can find any of the above computations can use them to substitute an authorized message with an unauthorized one.\n\nIdeally, it should be impossible to find two different messages whose digests (\"hash values\") are similar. Also, one would not want an attacker to be able to learn anything useful about a message from its digest (\"hash values\"). Of course the attacker learns at least one piece of information, the digest itself, by which the attacker can recognise if the same message occurred again.\n\nIn various standards and applications, the two most commonly used hash functions are MD5 and SHA-1. \n\nIn 2005, security defects were identified showing that a possible mathematical weakness might exist, like attacks, and recommending a stronger hash function. \n\nIn 2007 the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced a contest to design a hash function which will be given the name SHA-3 and be the subject of a FIPS standard.\n\n\n\n", "id": "138331", "title": "Cryptographic hash function"}

It was claimed that it may break the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher faster than a brute force attack. \n\nAES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret and classified information. Finding a technique that can decrease the amount of time it takes to break the secret message without having the key could cause wide damage. \n\nIn 2004 it was shown by one of the cryptanalysts, that the algorithm does not perform as described in its published paper. In addition, the method requires long effort. Unless shortened, the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to a brute force attack. Therefore, it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future. However, the attack has caused some experts to insert complexities in the algebraic simplicity of the current AES.\n\nThe XSL attack relies on first analyzing the \"internal design\" of a cipher then deriving a system of quadratic simultaneous equations. These systems of equations are typically very large, for example 8000 equations with 1600 variables for the 128-bit AES. Several methods for solving such systems are known. In the XSL attack, a specialized algorithm, termed XSL (eXtended Sparse Linearization), is then applied to solve these equations and compute the key.\n\nThe attack is well-known and famous for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform.

Today, we are not sure if the treaty can be used or not.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty ended in 1911. After this, both Tibet and Mongolia were independent. Both had a lamaist head of state. The Republic of China did not see them as independent. In the treaty, both Mongolia and Tibet said they would see each other as independent, and help each other in war. \n\nThe people who signed for Mongolia were foreign minister Da Lama Ravdan and General Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. Those who signed for Tibet were Agvan Dorjiev, Chijamts, and Gendun-Galsan, who lived in Tibet. Dorjiev was a Buryat, a citizen of Russia. For this reason, the treaty may not be legal. The 13th Dalai Lama denied that he had let Dorjiev sign a treaty with Mongolia. More importantly, neither the cleric nor the Tibetan government has ever signed any treaty. The Russian government said that Dorjiev was Russian. He could therefore not act as a diplomat for the Dalai Lama. The Mongolian text of the treaty has been published by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in 1982.\n\nMost other people still did not see Mongolia or Tibet as independent. They said that these areas belonged to China. Western powers had made treaties with the Qing Dynasty, and China had said it would honour these treaties. If they had recognised either Tibet or Mongolia, these treaties would have become invalid. The main Western powers were the United Kingdom and Russia. Both feared that if they saw the countries as independent, they could come under the influence of the other western powers. In their opinion, that situation was worse than if China controlled both of them, because China was weak.\n\nBritish negotiators at the Simla Convention heard about the treaty and got very suspicious. They feared that Russia might use the treaty to gain more influence in Tibet. In the end, China did not sign the Simla Convention. Instead, a very similar treaty was signed by Mongolia, China, and Russia on 25 May 1915. This treaty was called the tripartite Treaty of Kyakhta. The agreement stated that Mongolia was completely autonomous in internal matters and that Russia had certain privileges in Mongolia. At the same time it said that Mongolia was in fact a part of China.\n\n", "id": "138375", "title": "Treaty of friendship and alliance between the Government of Mongolia and Tibet"}

The lost energy is converted into heat, raising the temperature of the system. Such systems are called dissipative systems. \n\nFor example, a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate. The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave: an atmospheric wave, for instance, may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass, and at higher levels due to radiative cooling.\n\nIn computational physics, a numerical dissipation is also known as \"artificial dissipation\" or \"artificial diffusion\" or \"numerical diffusion\". They all mean this: when the pure advection equation--which, by definition, \"is free of dissipation\"--is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous (similar) to a diffusional process, the method is said to contain 'dissipation'.\n\nIn Hydrology, dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy. Various devices are designed in stream-beds (river-banks) to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms. Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades, where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force.\n", "id": "138377", "title": "Dissipation"}

Porta Alchemica is the only survivor of the five gates of the Palombara villa, there was an lost door on the opposite side enabling to give it a date of 1680, there were also four other inscriptions lost on the walls of the mansion inside the villa.\n\nAccording to a legend dated 1802 sent us by the scholar \"Francesco Girolamo Cancellieri\" , a pilgrim \"stibeum\" (from Latin: \"stibium\" = antimony) was hosted in the villa for a night. The \"pellegrino\", identifiable with the alchemist \"Giustiniani Bono\", stayed for a night in the gardens of the villa in search of a mysterious herb capable of producing gold, the next morning he was seen disappearing forever through the door, but left behind a few flakes of gold fruit of a successful alchemical transmutation, and a mysterious paper full of puzzles and magic symbols that would contain the secret of the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nThe marquis had engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and on the walls of the mansion, the content of the manuscript with symbols and riddles in the hope that one day someone would be able to understand them.\n\nThe interest of the Marquis Palombara for alchemy was born probably on his attendance since 1656, at the roman court of queen Christina of Sweden, at \"Riario\" palace (today \"Palazzo Corsini\") on the slopes of the \"Gianicolo\" hill. After the queen converted to Catholicism, she abdicated the throne of Sweden and he spent much of the rest of his life exiled in Rome from 1655 until her death in 1689.\n\nQueen Christina had an alchemical laboratory in Riario palace attended by people like the esotericists \"Giuseppe Francesco Borri\", and the learned Athanasius Kircher possessor of the mysterious Voynich manuscript of enigmatic scripture full of magic symbols. According to a legend the same \"Porta Alchemica\" was built in 1680 as a celebration of a successful alchemical transmutation occurred in Riario laboratory.\n\nBetween 1678 and 1680 Borri aka \"Giustiniani Bono\", collaborated with Athanasius Kircher for construction of Porta Alchemica in Palombara villa. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, famous architect and Kircher friend, designed the door. On the door was transcribed the secret formula for producing gold discovery in those years in alchemical laboratory of queen Christina. Because of this revelation the Marquis Palombara, Bernini and Athanasius Kircher were murdered by poison at 28 November 1680, probably by the same Borri. The secret of the Philosopher's Stone was lost forever, or perhaps continued to be used by Borri. (It's amazing the similarity between portraits of Borri and the mysterious Count of St. Germain).\n\nThe particular drawing on the pediment of Porta Alchemica, with the two triangles overlap and inscriptions in Latin, appears almost exactly the same on the title of the book alchemical \"Aureum Seculum Redivivum\" of \"Henricus Madatanus\" aka \"Adrian von Mynsicht\" (1603-1638). The title page of the original of 1621 is very different, because the design that was inspired the Marquis Palombara appears exactly only in the posthumous edition of 1677. The same drawing appears in a bookmark possessed by \"Berenger Saunière\", who became the parish priest at Rennes-le-Château in 1885. The motto \"Aureum Seculum Redivivum\" recalled this \"Novus Ordo Seclorum\" in the Great Seal of the United States, motto also of the Bavarian Illuminati heirs of the 17th century Rosicrucianism.\n", "id": "138406", "title": "Porta Alchemica"}

The term comes from apartheid, a governmental system that ruled South Africa in which the Afrikaners, or \"whites\", controlled most of the resources and where non-whites were denied access to these resources. Apartheid or 'separate development' was introduced by the National Party after the 1948 election to protect European interests and identity by enforcing separation between the 'races'. The term is often used to describe the gap between whites and nonwhites, and global socioeconomic inequality, the existence of which has been proven by statistics. As in South Africa, there is a hierarchy of group rights in the world:\n\n\nAlthough not explicitly classified by race, this hierarchy is banded by colour. Nationality laws of most countries, and the European Union, explicitly enshrine this ‘classification'.\n\nEuropean countries control most of the world's technology and weapons, and 20% of the global population, the richest percentage, take in 71.3% of income. Although most people of the world are not white, thereby making whites a minority, this minority often holds power in society. Most Western countries have laws against racial discrimination and active anti-racist movements, however much Western thought, law and action are exclusive, operating through institutional and indirect discrimination rather than overt racism. Their system of exclusion are more sophisticated, this prevents the West from exercising unconditional power in international affairs.\n\nThe term apartheid was famously used by Thabo Mbeki, the then-President of South Africa, in a 2002 speech, drawing comparisons the modern-day status of the world's people, economy, and access to natural resources to the apartheid era. Mbeki got the term from the book Unravelling Global Apartheid (1996) by Titus Alexander, initiator of Charter 99, a campaign for global democracy, who was present at the UN Millennium Summit.\n", "id": "138424", "title": "Global apartheid"}

It was created and executive produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. It was first shown on CBS on September 24, 2007.\n\nThe show is about two male Caltech scientists who live in an apartment in Pasadena, California. They are in their twenties. One is an experimental physicist from New Jersey (Leonard Hofstadter). The other is a theoretical physicist from Texas (Sheldon Cooper). Sheldon is asexual and has Asperger syndrome and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. They live across the hall from an attractive blonde waitress from Nebraska (Penny). She has show business aspirations.\n\nLeonard and Sheldon's geekiness and intellect are contrasted with Penny's social skills and common sense for comedic effect. Two equally geeky friends of theirs, Jewish Howard and Indian Rajesh, are also main characters. The show is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions. In March 2014, it was announced that \"The Big Bang Theory\" would continue for at least three more seasons on CBS.\n\n\n\nThe show was first developed for the 2006-2007 television season. At that time, it was very different from the show that was later broadcast. Only Jim Parsons & Johnny Galecki were part of the original pilot. The character now played by Kaley Cuoco was much meaner to the geeks. CBS did not pick the show up, but gave Bill Prady and Chuck Lorre a second chance. They brought in Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar. They retooled the show.\n\nThe second pilot of \"The Big Bang Theory\" was directed by award-winning television directing veteran James Burrows. He decided not to stay with the show. This reworked pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007. Before its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered September 24, 2007. It was picked up for a full 22-episode season order on October 19, 2007.\n\nProduction on the show was halted on November 6, 2007 by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. When the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season for the 2008-2009 television season.\n\nThe show returned on March 17, 2008 . It had an earlier time slot and nine new episodes. The second season premiered, in the same slot, on September 22, 2008. During that season, the show's ratings grew. That led to a \ntwo-year renewal through the 2010-11 season.\n\nDavid Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, math equations and diagrams used as props. He says he is more consultant than contributor. Executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady said, \"In fact, we're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... We worked hard to get all the science right.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the theme song, which describes developments the universe has undergone since the dawn of time.

The second episode, shown the following week, also received 1.0 million. For the third episode an average of 1.1 million tuned in. The show is also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 the preceding evening, and brings in 400,000 viewers on average. The 5th episode received 880,000 viewers. After the first 5 episodes, the average number of viewers continues to hover around the 1 million mark. Episode 13 was watched by 1.3 million viewers and was the most watched episode.\n\nIn December 2008, Virgin Media made the first nine episodes of the first season available to watch on its TV Choice On Demand service, and the rest of Season 1 was made available in January 2009.\n\nThe show is also broadcast in:\n\n", "id": "138437", "title": "The Big Bang Theory"}

There were three species. \"Smilodon gracilis\" (or \"S. fragilis\") was the ancestral, smaller, species (2.5 to 0.5 million years ago).\n\n\"Smilodon populator\" (1 mya to 10 kya) was a large, heavy species from eastern South America. It was 1.2 m high at the shoulder, 2.1 m (83 in) long on average. With an estimated weight of 220 to 400 kg, it was among the heaviest known felids. Its upper canines reached 28 cm (11 in) and protruded up to 17 cm (6.7 in) out of the upper jaw.\n\n\"Smilodon fatalis\" (or \"S. californicus\"; 1.6 mya to 10,000 years ago) was the famous cat known from the Rancho La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles. The tar, a bit like asphalt, has yielded about a million bones of late Pleistocene mammals, of which 162,000 bones are from \"Smilodon\", representing perhaps 1200 individuals. The cat was about the size of a female lion, but weighed more, perhaps 200 kg. It was about 1 metre tall at the shoulders.\n\n\"Smilodon\" is most famous for its relatively long canines, which are the longest found in the saber-toothed cats, at about long in the largest species \"Smilodon populator\". Those of \"S. fatalis\" reached their full size in 18 months at a growth rate of 7 mm/month. These canine teeth were slender and had fine serrations. They were fragile and could not have bitten into bone. Therefore, the cats did not use their long teeth to take down prey. Only when their prey was subdued did they use their teeth.\n\nThe front limbs on these cats were longer and stronger than modern cats, and from that, and its teeth, its method of attack must have been different. An educated guess would be: they were an ambush predators, which clung on round the neck of their prey, and slashed at the underside of the throat. This contrasts with the method of the modern lion, which brings down its prey by weight of numbers, and clamps its jaws over the prey's nose and mouth. The prey dies of suffocation.\n\n\"Smilodon\"&apos;s gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This makes the gape wide enough to allow \"Smilodon\" to slash the throats of their victims without closing their jaws in a bite.\n\n\"Smilodon\"'s niche was closer to a leopard's, which is also an ambush predator. They both need cover to get close to prey.\n\"Smilodon\" had relatively short legs and a short, bobbed tail. Its front legs were especially powerful. Its body was adapted for springing onto prey, but it was not a very fast runner.\n\nDuring the last ice age, there were many possible prey species from the La Brea location: mammoths, bison, horse, camel, ground sloth, pronghorn, tapir, deer,(elk and others). Most of these were extinct by 5 to 10,000 years ago. The pressures of a major climate change and human hunting were thought to be the main causes.\nThere was more plant cover at that time. Juniper, oaks, ragweeds, cedars, redwoods, sagebrush, sycamore, thistle and walnut grew in the environs. \"Smilodon\" survived so long as its prey had vegetation.\n", "id": "138477", "title": "Smilodon"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138503", "text": "Dalek\n\nThe Daleks are a made-up alien race of mutants from the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". Daleks are aliens from the planet Skaro, integrated within a tank-like metal casing. The creatures are a powerful race who always wanted universal conquest and control, they have no pity, feelings or guilt (as all of their emotions were removed except hate).\n\nThe Daleks are one of the most powerful races ever in \"Doctor Who\" history and are the Doctor's worst enemies. They cry \"EX-TER-MIN-ATE!\" when they are about to kill someone. They come in different colours, like bronze, black, red, white, gold, and silver. They first appeared in the first season episode of the series (in \"The Daleks\") and they were last seen in the Series 7 episode \"Asylum of the Daleks\" (2012). They are not robots, but horrible aliens kept in a metal casing, because they became mutated during a war on their planet, Skaro. They were created by an evil scientist named Davros. They can not be easily hurt by guns as their casing reflects the bullets that come from the gun and a shield melts bullets shot at them.\n\nDaleks were created by writer Terry Nation and designed by BBC designer Raymond Cusick. They were introduced in December 1963 in the second \"Doctor Who\" serial. From their first appearance they became very popular with viewers. They appeared in many later serials and two 1960s motion pictures. \nThe word \"Dalek\" has been put into the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" and other major dictionaries; the \"Collins Dictionary\" defines it rather broadly as \"any of a set of fictional robot-like creations that are aggressive, mobile, and produce rasping staccato speech\". Although there is no meaning to their name, \"Dalek\" sounds like the Norwegian word \"dårlig\", which means \"bad\" or \"evil\". It is also a trademark, having first been registered by the BBC in 1964 to protect its range of Dalek merchandise.\n\nThe Daleks were on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon.\n\nOn the outside, Daleks resemble human-sized salt and pepper shakers who are five to six feet (152 to 183 cm) tall. On the top, they have a rotating dome with a telescope for seeing. They have two arms. One arm has an energy weapon (or \"death ray\"), which looks like an long egg beater or the framework of a paint roller. In some episodes, this could also fire a gas or projectiles. Their other arm is a telescope with a plunger on the end, which they use as a hand. The actual Dalek creature inside the metal casing is very rarely seen. It looks like an octopus or a squid.\n\nEarly versions of the Daleks were rolled around on castors or moved by wheels connected to hand cranks by bicycle chains. \nLater versions of the prop had more efficient wheels (from shopping carts, according to a Blue Peter episode) and were simply moved by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of where the camera could not see. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky movements of the Dalek. The latest model of the costume still has a human operator within, but the movement of the dome and eyestalk are now remotely controlled so that the operator can concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.\n\nThe Daleks have appeared on the show many times and their design has seen many changes. This means that it can be difficult to make sure that the storylines line up. When the Daleks first appeared in \"The Daleks\", they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and Thal races. However, in 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in \"Genesis of the Daleks\", where the Dals were now called Kaleds (of which Daleks is an anagram), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist Davros.\n\nInstead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war, fought with nuclear and other weapons causing widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in \"travel machines\" whose design was based on his own life-support chair.\n\n\"Genesis of the Daleks\" marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely talked about again.\n\nA single Dalek appeared in \"Dalek\", written by Robert Shearman, which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the last Time War that had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.The Doctor had guessed that this Dalek had \"fallen\" out of the time war.\n\nThe Dalek Emperor returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with human subjects; it saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. This terrified the Doctor as \"Daleks have no concept of blasphemy.\" These Daleks and their fleet were erased from time itself in \"The Parting of the Ways\".\n\nThe 2006 series finale \"Army of Ghosts\"/\"Doomsday\" saw another squad of Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the Cult of Skaro, led by a black Dalek named \"Dalek Sec\", that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with a Time Lord prison containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the Torchwood Institute and Cybermen from a parallel world, leading to a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London. Eventually, the Tenth Doctor caused both factions to be sucked back into the Void. However, the Cult members (Sec, Caan, Jast, and Thay; it is unusual for a Dalek to have a name) survived by \"temporal shifting\" away. The two-part story \"Daleks in Manhattan\"/\"Evolution of the Daleks\" revealed they had escaped to 1930 New York, setting up base in the Empire State Building, which was being built at the time. Experiments led by Sec attepted to force a Dalek evolution by combining their DNA with that of humans, and he is the first of the new \"Human-Daleks\". However the three remaining Daleks rebelled and destroyed him because he was not a pure dalek. The Cult also attempted to create a Human/Dalek hybrid (fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds). This attempt failed after the Doctor interfered. Caan escaped via another temporal shift.\n\nThe Daleks returned in the 2008 series' two-part finale, \"The Stolen Earth\"/\"Journey's End\", accompanied once again by their creator Davros (now played by Julian Bleach). It is revealved that Dalek Caan had forced himself back into the Time War, even though it was \"time-locked\" or prevented from entering by any means (the effort rendered him insane), where he rescued Davros; Davros then created a new army of Daleks from his own flesh. The new Dalek army was led by a Supreme Dalek, who kept Davros imprisoned in a \"Vault\"; Davros said that he and the Supreme Dalek had reached \"an arrangement\". Davros and the Daleks planned to destroy all creation with a 'reality bomb', which failed due to the interference of the Doctor and his companions, and due to Caan himself who had been manipulating the events unknown to either side. Though the Daleks were destroyed, the fate of Davros and Dalek Caan is unknown. 3 Daleks from this episode came back in Series 5 (Victory of the Daleks). They created 5 new, different colored daleks. These new Daleks escaped into space. Later, they showed up in \"The Pandorica Opens\" and trapped the Doctor in the Pandorica, the ultimate prison. After they were erased from time by the cracks, a stone Dalek showed up, which was an echo of the Dalek race. It was brought alive by the Pandorica light, which could restore thing which had been erased by the cracks. It was later shot in the eye by River Song. Their race, along with the rest of the universe, was brought back by the Doctor.\n\n", "id": "138503", "title": "Dalek"}

The male vocal folds are between 17 mm and 25 mm in length.\n\nThe female vocal folds are between 12.5 mm and 17.5 mm long.\n\nFolds are pearly white - females have whiter cords than males.\n\nThe difference in vocal fold size between men and women means that their voices have a different pitch. Each person's voice is different and has a slightly different pitch. This is caused by genes that influence how the larynx is made.\n\nThe vocal folds discussed above are sometimes called 'true vocal folds' to distinguish them from the false vocal folds. These are a pair of thick folds of mucous membrane. They sit directly above the true vocal folds, to protect them.

The capital (now prefecture) was Saintes alternating with La Rochelle and Saint-Jean-d'Angély but soon was changed and Saintes was kept as the only capital.\n\nIn 1800, with the creation of the \"arrondissements\" in France, the seven districts were changed into six \"arrondissements\": Saintes, Jonzac, Marennes, Rochefort, La Rochelle and Saint-Jean-d'Angély and in 1810 the capital was moved to La Rochelle. \n\nOn 10 September 1926, the \"arrondissements\" of Marennes and Saint-Jean-d'Angély were eliminated. In 1943, Saint-Jean-d'Angély was made again an \"arrondissement\".\n\nOn 4 Septembre 1941, the name of the department was changed from \"Charente-Inférieure\" to the present name of Charente-Maritime.\n\nCharente-Maritime is part of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region.

This is a branch of software engineering.\n\nThe optimization can have sense at different levels, from the lowest (development of circuits, writing of machine code designed especially for the architecture) up to the highest levels of making of implementation, use or design of algorithms.\n\nThe optimization is generally recommended to leave until the end of the process of development, since the premature optimization can introduce new errors (generally more difficult to detect for being of algorithmic nature).\n\nThe optimized system may be a single computer program, a collection of computers or even an entire network such as the Internet. \n\n", "id": "138550", "title": "Optimization (computer science)"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138568", "text": "Embedded system\n\nAn embedded system is a computer that has been built to solve only a few very specific problems and is not easily changed. In contrast, a general-purpose computer can do many different jobs, and can be changed at any time with new programs for new jobs. \n\nAn embedded system usually does not look like a computer, often there is no keyboard or monitor or mouse. But like any computer it has a processor and software, input and output. The word \"embedded\" means it is built into the system. It is a permanent part in a bigger system. \n\nFor example, the controller embedded in an elevator tells the motor to move the elevator to different floors, based on buttons that are pushed. A decoder is embedded in a satellite television set-top box to read a signal from the dish and send something that a TV understands. Often this type of system must do its work in a specific amount of time. This is called real-time computing. If a set-top box got interrupted to do another task, you would see a bad picture on the TV, for example. A general purpose computer will often have short pauses while it does something else, it is not real-time.\n\nEmbedded systems control many of the common devices in use today, from card readers in hotel door locks to many controls in a car. They can be small like an MP3 player or a digital camera, to large systems like traffic lights, airplane controls, or assembly line controllers in a factory. \n\nEmbedded systems are used in many kinds of electrical devices, including:\n\n\n\nEmbedded systems are not always standalone devices. Sometimes they are built as a set, like the various parts of a car - the radio, the throttle control, the pollution control, etc. Sometimes they can communicate to the internet or a cell-phone network and they may have a USB reader or other connections.\n\nEmbedded systems range from no user interface at all — only sending and receiving electric signals — to a full graphical user interface like on a modern computer. Quite often they will have a few push-buttons and a small display and some LEDs. A more complex system may have a touch screen, allowing the meaning of the buttons to change with each screen as in smart phones.\n\nHardware includes the chips, wires, circuit boards, buttons and displays. \n\nThe most important chip is the central processing unit or CPU. This runs the software instructions. It can be a standard microprocessor or a microcontroller. Microcontrollers include the microprocessor as well as simple peripheral equipment so the system can be smaller and cheaper. They have less flexibility because those parts cannot be changed. Usually these parts include Flash memory and support for serial ports, USB, etc.\n\nUnlike a microprocessor for a general-purpose computer, bigger and faster is not always better. Many embedded processors are very small. Sometimes this is to use less space or less power, sometimes it is to be cheaper. General-purpose computers will use microprocessors that read 32-bit or 64-bit words and run at speeds measured in GHz, but embedded processors are usually 4 to 32 bits and run at speeds usually measured in tens of MHz (a hundred times slower). (But the programs are also smaller and do not check for things that are not used).\n\nThere are \"\"ready-made\"\" computer boards that can be used in some embedded systems. These often use Windows CE, Linux, NetBSD, or an embedded real-time operating system.\n\nSometimes it may be easier to use a circuit board that is already made. These usually share many components with general purpose computers, but are smaller than one in a general purpose computer. Boards such as the VIA EPIA can run Microsoft Windows. The advantage is that it saves some electrical engineering time and can use the same software development tools used for PC-type software development. Examples of such embedded devices are the ATMs or displays in casinos. This works well if the real-time requirements are not real strict (it doesn't matter much if a job takes eight seconds instead of five, for example).\n\nIf the device needs to be very small or will be sold in very big numbers (\"\"high-volume\"\"), it makes sense to make a custom or specialized chip that does exactly what is needed. This is a system on a chip (SoC) which holds a complete system - processor, floating point unit, memory cache and interfaces on a single integrated circuit. SoCs can be made as a special-order application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or by using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) which is programmed by the people building the embedded system.\n\nEmbedded systems talk with the outside world or other components using peripherals such as:\n\nEmbedded systems often do not need a full operating system. Some use specially-built small and simple operating systems that start very quickly, others do not need one at all. Embedded systems are not adapted as easily, but they are built to perform their tasks much more reliably. Because the hardware is simpler, it is also often cheaper to build and runs faster. \n\nIn contrast to this, a general-purpose computer needs to be ready for new device drivers and software to run hardware it doesn't know about yet, like new printers or hard drives. It needs to run different application programs.\n\nAs embedded systems get bigger, things that used to be only on general-purpose computers or even mainframes are now becoming common on embedded systems. This includes protected memory space, and open programming environment including Linux, NetBSD, etc.\n\nSome examples of operating systems, from simple to complex:\n\nReal-time operating systems include products like MicroC/OS-II, Green Hills INTEGRITY, QNX or VxWorks. Unlike MacOS or Windows 7, these operating systems are not known very well by most people. But they are used in many places where time and safety is very important. People use them every day and do not realize it.\n\nCommon examples of larger kernels are Embedded Linux and Windows CE. Although these do not have the tight time limits needed for a strict real-time system, they are becoming more common, especially for more powerful devices such as Wireless Routers and GPSs. They allow re-use of code in the public domain for Device Drivers, Web Servers, Firewalls, and other code. Software developers that are more comfortable writing applications for PCs will find this more familiar as well. If needed, an FPGA or other special hardware can be used for things that do need tight time limits.\n\nLike other software, embedded system designers use compilers, assemblers, and debuggers to develop embedded system software. However, they may also use some more specific tools:\n\n\nDebugging tools:\n\nUnless restricted to external debugging, the programmer can typically load and run software through the tools, view the code running in the processor, and start or stop its operation. The view of the code may be as assembly code or source-code. Some integrated systems (like VxWorks or Green Hills) have special features, like keeping track of how much space the software takes as it runs, what tasks are running, and when things happen.\n\nDepending on what kind of embedded system is being made will affect how it can be debugged. For instance, debugging a single microprocessor system is different from debugging a system where processing is also done on a peripheral (DSP, FPGA, co-processor).\n\nEmbedded systems are often in machines that are expected to run for years without errors, and in some cases recover by themselves if an error occurs. This means the software is usually developed and tested more carefully than that for personal computers, and unreliable mechanical moving parts such as disk drives and fans are avoided.\n\nPlaces where safety and reliability are important: \n\nWays to recover from errors — both software bugs such as memory leaks, and also soft errors in the hardware:\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "138568", "title": "Embedded system"}

Airbags are bags that rapidly fill with air when an accident happens. That way they can prevent injuries that occur when the driver hits a hard object.\n\nAn airbag is a useful vehicle safety device. Airbags are used in the world increasingly because in accidents, it can help passengers reduce shock. \nWhen the sensor feels a strong shock, the gas device explodes. This gas fills the bag immediately.\n\nAn American inventor, Dr. Allen S. Breed, invented and developed a key component for automotive use. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation first in 1967 to Chrysler. A similar \"Auto-Ceptor\" crash-restraint, brandon, developed by Eaton, Yale & Towne Inc. for Ford was soon offered as an automatic safety system in the USA. The Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions.\n\nAll cars used the airbag nowadays was originally invented by a Japanese man Mr. Kobori and he took the world patents.\n\nThe first patent on an inflatable crash-landing device for airplanes was filed during World War II. In the 1980s, the first commercial airbags appeared in automobiles. Since model year 1990, all new cars sold in the United States have been required to have airbags on both driver and passenger sides. To date, statistics show that airbags reduce the risk of dying in a direct frontal crash by about 30 percent. Today, some cars have six or even eight airbags.\n\nFirst, moving objects have momentum (the product of the mass and the velocity of an object). If no outside force acts on an object, the object will continue to move at its present speed and direction (because of inertia). Cars consist of several objects, including the vehicle itself, loose objects in the car and, of course, passengers. If these objects are not restrained, they will continue moving at whatever speed the car is traveling at, even if the car is stopped by a collision. \nStopping an object's momentum requires force acting over a period of time. When a car crashes, the force required to stop an object is very great because the car's momentum has changed instantly while the passengers' has not (there is not much time to work with). The goal of any supplemental restraint system is to help stop the passenger while doing as little damage to him or her as possible. \nWhat an airbag wants to do is to slow the passenger's speed to zero with little or no damage. The constraints that it has to work within are huge. The airbag has the space between the passenger and the steering wheel or dashboard and a fraction of a second to work with. Even that tiny amount of space and time is valuable, however, if the system can slow the passenger evenly rather than forcing an abrupt halt to his or her motion.\n\nIn 2006 the airbag was set up for a motorcycle. This was in the Gold Wing by Honda.\n\nThe second airbag device for motorcyclist is an inflatable airbag jacket was invented by Tamás Straub in 1976.\n", "id": "138593", "title": "Airbag"}

An \"Ecological Clerk of Works\" has been appointed to make sure the building works do not harm the wildlife.\n\nIt is hoped that the £29million sports complex will be used as a training camp for the 2012 London Olympics and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n\nThere are many people who disagree with the building work. Many local residents and small businesses think that it will take jobs and customers from other towns.\n\nAs part of the changes, the transport to Ravenscraig will get better. There will be new transport within walking distance of the new town centre, with buses going to Glasgow, Lanark and many other towns. There will be easy access to public transport throughout Ravenscraig that will include business routes, that will link to the public transport network with roads to the Motherwell and Carfin rail stations.\n\nLocal press have said that the Scottish Premier League football team, Motherwell Football Club could buy some land in Ravenscraig to build a new football stadium, leaving behind their home of 113 years, Fir Park.

The aim of the game is to respond quickly to the commands that are produced through the game's speakers. There are several responses, including pull handles, twisting cranks, spin-able wheels, toggle switches. Each command requires a different response. A beat is played during the game and the beat will get faster as the player scores more points. \"Bop It\" has been very popular as a children's game. \n\nThe game was designed by Dan Klistner. The design was developed by several Hasbro designers, including Bob Welch. There have been several versions. The original version was released in 1996. The current classic version was released in 2008. It was demonstrated at the London Toy Fair in 2009.\n\nSince 2008 when Hasbro re-made the toy, the voice in the games has been Buddy Rubino. He has recorded the voice for \"Bop It!\", \"Bop It! XT\", \"Bop It! Smash!, Bop It! Tetris and Bop It! with 10 New Moves.\"\n\nIn 2015, Hasbro managed to make a Bop It that can detect when it's batteries need replacing. When one of the three batteries are running low, the electronic device will play a sound clip that has been edited at the recording studio to make the game sound like it's running low on batteries. So now the voice will say \"My batteries are running low.\" and will talk slower towards the end of the audio file and automatically shut off the game as a prompt for the user to change the batteries.\n\nTo ensure that the Bop It game is working correctly, Hasbro adds a hidden mode into the electornic unit which allows the manufacturer to test the speaker and the moving parts of the game. Each moving part has a button inside the electronic unit that when multiple buttons are pressed and the game unit's power is reset, the game will enter it's manufacturer test mode and play sounds in a certain order. Newer versions of Bop It will produce a loud beep before playing sounds. \n\n\n\n\"Zing It\" is a yo-yo version of \"Bop It\". It tells commands that the player must follow along with. Like the original \"Bop It\", there are three commands that may be said: \"Bop it!\" (requiring the player to press the purple button), \"Zing it!\" (requiring the player to drop the yo-yo downward and send it back up again), and \"Loop it!\" (requiring the player to do the \"'round the world\" yo-yo trick). \"Zing It\" has 3 modes: \"Vox Bop\" (as with Bop It), \"Beat Bop\" (again, as with Bop It), and \"Vox Bop Challenge\" (where the game will tell a series of commands which must be done in correctly). As with \"Bop It\" and \"Bop It Extreme\", \"Zing It\" announces the score musically by sound effects. Different tones represent different point values. There is a maximum score of 250.\n\nIn 2009, EA Games made a video game called \"Hasbro Family Games Night 2\". It had \"Bop It\" as one of the games that could be played. It is available for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo Wii. In 2011, EA Games made an iPhone application which played exactly like the handheld game. It has the same commands from the handheld games and added extra commands which were never invented on the handheld game.\n\n", "id": "138678", "title": "Bop It"}

It is sometimes called embedded software. An example is a microcontroller, a part of the microprocessor that tells the microprocessor what actions to take. It can also be a larger program stored on flash memory, or uploaded onto existing hardware by a user.\n\nAs its name suggests, firmware is somewhere between hardware and software, connecting the two worlds. It can mean slightly different things to different people, especially as stand-alone electronic devices become more like computers. Like other software, it is a computer program which is run by a microprocessor. But it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it.\n\nA computer can have both firmware and software. The firmware is permanently stored in the computer, such as the BIOS, and cannot be easily changed or added to. Software, even the OS, can be replaced by reformatting the hard drive. Software includes the applications that a person operating a computer sees, like a web browser or a word processor. Sometimes a device driver is called firmware, since it is needed to run that piece of hardware, like a printer or a video card. The device driver is on the main part of the computer and can be easily updated (if an update exists).\n\nOther electronic devices may not look like a computer, but they still have a program inside telling them what to do. This is also called firmware. A TV cable box, an elevator controller and a card reader in a hotel door lock all run firmware. In this case, the firmware is the only software on the device and it runs everything, from handling button presses to turning motors on or off.\n\nIn the past, firmware was stored in ROMs but now it is often stored in media that can be written to such as EEPROMs and Flash. Firmware in many machines such as routers can now be updated without any special hardware, other than a computer and a USB cable. This is done by downloading a new version from the World Wide Web to update the device, using instructions from the device manufacturer.\n\nAn electronic device is said to be \"bricked\" if it cannot be started because of firmware issues because it is then as useful as a brick. Loading the wrong firmware into a device might cause this. Firmware is stored as a binary image file.\n\nExamples of firmware include:\n\n", "id": "138732", "title": "Firmware"}

A weather system became still in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early August. An area of low pressure formed along the shear line early on August 2, which slowly became stronger during the next day. It strengthened into Tropical Depression Five, and was named Tropical Storm Edouard on August 3. The tropical storm moved towards the west on August 4. It moved onto land on August 5 on the upper Texas coast, about 40 miles southwest of Port Arthur and moved west-northwest into inland Texas. Edouard died out over land and became a tropical depression late on August 5. The depression turned to the northwest, causing heavy rain in central Texas on August 6.\n\nIn preparations for the storm, emergency teams along the Louisiana and Texas coasts became active. The Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, started a disaster declaration for 17 counties in Texas that were in the possible path of the storm. He also activated around 1,200 National Guard troops, a 70 member rescue team, six helicopters, and a team that brings food and water to affected areas. About 200 buses became ready for use in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana, the Office of Emergency Preparedness started a mandatory evacuation, and Sheriff's deputies put up roadblocks. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Shell Oil company removed about 40 workers from drilling locations. \n\nStorm surge from the storm reached at Freshwater Locks in Louisiana, and also reached at Rollover Pass in Texas.

Lavigne was born in Belleville, Ontario. At age 17, she released her first album called \"Let Go\". \"Let Go\" reached number one on the UK and Australian album charts. Lavigne later released the albums \"Under My Skin\" in 2004, \"The Best Damn Thing\" in 2007, and \"Goodbye Lullaby\" in 2011, she released \"Here's to Never Growing Up\" in 2013. The last album is self-titled and is been released in November 5, 2013. In 2004, she won a World Music Award for favorite pop/rock artist.\n\nLavigne has done various other things in addition to singing. For instance, in 2006, Lavigne voiced a character in the movie \"Over the Hedge\". Lavigne has also appeared in the 2006 movie \"Fast Food Nation\". She has a clothing line, Abbey Dawn, and has released three perfumes.\n\nShe was born in Napanee, Ontario to Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne and Judy Lavigne. She has an older brother, Matthew Lavigne and younger sister, Michelle. Her father is French Canadian and her mother is of English, German and Scottish descent.\nIn 1999, Avril won a competition to sing with Shania Twain in Ottawa, Canada. She debuted when a recording artist saw her singing country songs in a book store.\n\nIn June 2002, Avril released her first album, \"Let Go\". It got to number one in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, and number two in the United States. Two months later, she won an award for the music video \"Complicated\", the first single from \"Let Go\". She had her first success with \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\" and the first two singles from \"Let Go\" both entered the top 10 in the music charts. The next February, she was nominated for five Grammy Awards, but won none. Thanks to the success of her first three singles, Complicated, Sk8er Boi and I'm with You, Lavigne, then a teenager, became the second artist in history to have three number 1 songs from a first album on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Top 40.\n\nIn May 2004, her second album, \"Under My Skin\" was released. After that, on \"Total Request Live\", she was rude to journalists after being asked for her opinions of the media. Other times she was violent. Lavigne and Matthew Gerrard also wrote the song \"Breakaway\", which became a hit for Kelly Clarkson.\n\n\"Under My Skin\", was released on 25 May 2004. It debuted at No. 1 in many countries, including Australia, Mexico, Canada, Japan, the UK, and the U.S. The album has sold more than 10 million copies. Lavigne wrote most of the album's tracks with Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk. Kreviazuk's husband, Our Lady Peace front man Raine Maida, co-produced the album. Butch Walker and Don Gilmore were the other producers. Lavigne went on the Live and By Surprise twenty-one city mall tour in the U.S. and Canada to promote the album. She was accompanied by her guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld. Each performance had live acoustic versions of the new songs. At the end of 2004, Lavigne went on her first world tour, the Bonez Tour. She had shows on almost every continent. The tour lasted for the entire 2005 year.\n\n\"Don't Tell Me\", the first single off the album, went to No. 1 in Argentina and Mexico. It reached the top five in the UK and Canada and the top ten in Australia and Brazil. \"My Happy Ending\", the album's lead single, went to No. 1 in Mexico and the top five in the UK and Australia. In the U.S., it reached the top ten of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and went to No. 1 in the Mainstream Top 40. It became her fourth biggest hit there. The third single, \"Nobody's Home\", did not make the top 40 in the U.S., reaching No. 1 only in Mexico and Argentina. The fourth single from the album, \"He Wasn't\", reached top 40 positions in the UK and Australia and was not released in the U.S.\n\nLavigne won two World Music Awards in 2004 for \"World's Best Pop/Rock Artist\" and \"World's Bestselling Canadian Artist\". She received five Juno Award nominations in 2005 of which she won three, including \"Artist of the Year\". She won the award for \"Favorite Female Singer\" at the eighteenth annual Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards and was nominated in every MTV Award show shown around the world.\n\nIn April 2007, her third album, \"The Best Damn Thing\" was released. The album was the first to carry a parental advisory warning due to repeated use of swear words. Avril described the album as \"fast, fun, young, bratty, aggressive, confident, cocky in a playful way ... all the good stuff.\" \"Girlfriend\", the first single from the album, got to number one in seven countries. She was sued because a different band already had a song called \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.\" Avril sang in \"Girlfriend\": \"I want to be your girlfriend\". She then went on a world tour, known as \"The Best Damn Tour\".\n\nA month after The Best Damn Tour was completed, Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with the song \"Black Star\". It was written to promote her first fragrance also called \"Black Star\". By July 2009, she had recorded nine tracks of the new album. These songs included \"Everybody Hurts\" and \"Darlin\". Lavigne had written some of these songs when she was young. \"Darlin\" was written by her when she was 15 years old, and living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne said the album was about \"life\". She said that it was easy for her to do a \"boy-bashing pop song,\" but it was different to write about something \"that's really close to me, something I've been through.\" Other than the album's lead single, \"What the Hell\", Lavigne described the songs on \"Goodbye Lullaby\" as different from her earlier songs. She said she was older, so her music was not so pop-rock now.\nIn January 2010, when she was writing and recording for the new album, Lavigne worked with Disney. This was on clothing designs inspired by those in Tim Burton's feature movie, \"Alice in Wonderland\". She asked the executives if she could write a song for the movie. So, she wrote the song \"Alice\". It was played over the end credits. It was also included on the soundtrack, \"Almost Alice\".\n\nOn 28 February, Lavigne performed at the concert portion of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony. She sang \"My Happy Ending\" and \"Girlfriend\".\n\nThe release dates for \"Goodbye Lullaby\" and its lead single were pushed back many times. Lavigne explained these delays. She said, \"I write my own music and, therefore, it takes me longer to put out records 'cause I have to live my life to get inspiration.\" She added that she had enough material for two records.

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138804", "text": "Hannibal Lecter\n\nDoctor Hannibal Lecter is a fictional serial killer. He is a character in books by the crime drama writer Thomas Harris. Several of these books have been made into movies. Lecter was also the main character in an NBC television show called \"Hannibal\". \n\nLecter is a cannibal, meaning that he eats people. He is also highly intelligent, so that he can talk to people in a way that makes them afraid or disturbed. He employs this unusual technique most famously in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", a novel featuring him that was made into a movie starring Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. The movie became very popular, and won many awards.\n\nLecter is Lithuanian. He is cultured, and his reasons for killing people are often that he thinks they are annoying, rude or corrupt. He is a psychopath, a predator who does not feel empathy. Thus, he feels no guilt about his actions.\n\n\nThomas Harris first wrote about Lecter in his novel Red Dragon, which shows how Hannibal Lecter was caught by the FBI, and ends up using his intelligence to help the agent who caught him catch another killer named Francis Dolarhyde. Will Graham, the agent who caught Lecter, is at first very offended by Lecter's demeanor, but comes to appreciate his help when Lecter gives him insight into the way Dolarhyde's mind works. Dolarhyde believes that he is a god, and that he is unaffected by laws and rules. \n\nTwo movies were based on this book. \"Manhunter\" (1986) starred Tom Noonan as Dolarhyde and Brian Cox as Hannibal Lecktor. In \"Red Dragon\" (2002), Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter and Ralph Fiennes played Dolarhyde.\n\nLecter returned in \"The Silence of the Lambs\", the sequel to Red Dragon. The movie based on this book became very popular. The book is about an FBI agent named Clarice Starling (played by Jodie Foster in the movie), who, like Will Graham from Red Dragon, is trying to catch a serial killer, who calls himself \"Buffalo Bill\" because he skins his victims like buffalo. Starling makes a deal with Lecter in which she will try to get him transferred to another prison (Lecter hates his cell) if he will help her understand Buffalo Bill's mind. In the end, Starling catches Bill, but Lecter escapes from prison, fleeing to Africa.\n\nHarris' next novel was \"Hannibal\". It was a sequel to \"Silence of the Lambs\". The book told the story about what happened to Hannibal Lecter after he escaped from prison. Lector was hiding in Italy. He used a false name and driver's license so he would not be caught. The book is about a victim of his, named Mason Verger. Verger survived when Lecter tried to eat his face. He now wants to get revenge on Lecter. Mason Verger captures Lecter. He tries to kill him with attack hogs, but Lecter escapes with the help of Clarice Starling. Lecter was again played by Hopkins in the 2001 movie.\n\nThe final book in the series was \"Hannibal Rising\". It shows Lecter as a child. It tries to explain why he is a murderous cannibal by describing the death of his family during World War II. The critics did not like \"Hannibal Rising\" as much as they liked the first three books. This was mainly because people thought that the story was unrealistic. They also felt it was not true to the characters. Thomas Harris has said in many interviews that he only wrote the book because he was afraid that someone else would write a book about Lecter as a child. This book was also the basis for a film of the same name, with Gaspard Ulliel as young Hannibal.\n\nThe character of Hannibal Lecter has become very popular in American culture. This is mainly because he is so scary. Lecter is often thought to be one of the best movie villains of all time, next to Freddy Krueger and Norman Bates. AFI listed him at #1 on their list \"Top 50 Movie Villains of All Time\"\n", "id": "138804", "title": "Hannibal Lecter"}

The religious character of predestination distinguishes it from other ideas about determinism and free will. Those who believe in predestination, such as John Calvin, believe that before the creation God determined the destiny of the universe throughout all of time and space. They believe that God orders some people to Heaven, and all other people will go to Hell because of their sins. This is determined before they even are born.\n\nDefinition: predestination is the divine foreordaining or foreknowledge of all that will happen. It applies to the salvation of some and not others. It has been particularly associated with the teachings of St. Augustine of Hippo and of John Calvin.\n\nIn Hinduism, which consists of four schools, predestination does not play an important role. Most followers believe in karma, associated with free will. However, in the Dvaita school of Vaishnavism, the philosopher Madhvacharya believed in a similar concept.\n\n\n", "id": "138834", "title": "Predestination"}

{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=138894", "text": "Gladiolus\n\nGladiolus (from Latin, the diminutive of \"gladius\", a sword) is a genus of flowering plants in the iris family (Iridaceae). Sometimes called the sword lily, the most widely-used English common name for these plants is simply gladiolus (plural gladioli, gladioluses or sometimes gladiolas).\n\nThe genus \"Gladiolus\" contains about 260 species, of which 250 are native to sub-Saharan Africa, mostly South Africa. About 10 species are native to Eurasia. There are 160 species of \"Gladiolus\" endemic in southern Africa and 76 in tropical Africa. The species vary from very small to the spectacular giant flower spikes in commerce.\n\nThese attractive, perennial herbs are semihardy in temperate climates. They grow from rounded, symmetrical corms, that are enveloped in several layers of brownish, fibrous tunics.\n\nTheir stems are generally unbranched, producing 1 to 9 narrow, sword-shaped, longitudinal grooved leaves, enclosed in a sheath. The lowest leaf is shortened to a cataphyll. The leaf blades can be plane or cruciform in cross section.\n\nThe fragrant flower spikes are large and one-sided, with secund, bisexual flowers, each subtended by 2 leathery, green bracts. The sepals and the petals are almost identical in appearance, and are termed tepals. They are united at their base into a tube-shaped structure. The dorsal tepal is the largest, arching over the three stamens. The outer three tepals are narrower. The perianth is funnel-shaped, with the stamens attached to its base. The style has three filiform, spoon-shaped branches, each expanding towards the apex.\n\nThe ovary is 3-locular with oblong or globose capsules, containing many, winged brown, longitudinally dehiscent seeds. In their center must be noticeable the specific pellet like structure which is the real seed without the fine coat. In some seeds this structure is wrinkled and with black color. These seeds are unable to germinate.\n\nThese flowers are variously colored, pink to reddish or light purple with white, contrasting markings, or white to cream or orange to red. \n\nThe South African species were originally pollinated by long-tongued anthrophorine bees, but some changes in the pollination system have occurred, allowing pollination by sunbirds, noctuid and sphingid moths, long-tongued flies and several others. In the temperate zones of Europe many of the hybrid large flowering sorts of gladiolas can be pollinated by small well-known wasps. Actually, They are not very good pollinators because of the large flowers of the plants and the small size of the wasps. Another insect in this zone which can try some of the nectar of the gladioli is the best-known European Hawk-moth \"Macroglossum stellatarum\" which usually pollinates many famous garden flowers like \"Petunia\", \"Zinnia\", \"Dianthus\" and others.\n\nGladioli are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Large Yellow Underwing.\n", "id": "138894", "title": "Gladiolus"}

It is named after its long feather-shaped tail. Although only the size of a very small mouse (65 to 80 mm and 10 to 14 g), it can leap and glide long distances from tree to tree, up to 25 metres. Like other gliding mammals, the feathertail glider has a skin membrane between the fore and hind legs; thicker than that of the other marsupials like the sugar glider, but smaller in proportion, extending only between the elbows and knees.\n", "id": "138916", "title": "Feathertail glider"}

It is called a sugar glider because it likes to feed on the sugary sap from certain trees, and can jump from trees and glide through the air to another tree. They live in trees, and rarely travel on the ground. They eat many foods, but mostly tree sap and insects. They look and act much like a flying squirrel, but they are not related. Sugar gliders are actually related to possums\n\nAround the world, the sugar glider is a popular domestic pet. It is one of the most commonly traded wild animals in the illegal pet trade, where animals are plucked directly from their natural habitats. \n\nIn Australia, sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory but not Western Australia, New South Wales, ACT or Tasmania.\n\nSugar gliders are most popular as pets in the United States, where they are bred in large numbers. Most states and cities allow sugar gliders as pets, with some exceptions. In some places, a license or permit might be needed to own a sugar glider, because they are considered an exotic pet, or wild animal.\n\n", "id": "138926", "title": "Sugar glider"}

Later arrivals included the Lapita people.\n\nThe first European to visit these islands was Dutch explorer Willem Schouten in 1616. \n\nThe islands remained unsettled by western Europeans until they became part of the German protectorate of German New Guinea in 1884. The area was named in honor of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\n\nOn 13 March 1888, a volcano erupted on Ritter Island causing a megatsunami. Almost 100% of the volcano fell in to the ocean leaving a small lake in the volcanic crater.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force seized the islands in 1914 and Australia later received a League of Nations mandate for the islands. They remained under Australian control – interrupted only by Japanese occupation during World War II – until Papua New Guinea became independent in 1975.\n\n\n", "id": "138927", "title": "Bismarck Archipelago"}
